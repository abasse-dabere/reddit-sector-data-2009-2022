&gt; **Subject:** S. 1241, “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017”-Section 13 &amp; Prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. § 1960      

&gt; Dear Senate committee members

&gt; The Bitcoin Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization founded in September 2012. Comprised of senior leaders in the Bitcoin community, the Foundation coordinates joint efforts of the Bitcoin community, helping to create awareness of the benefits of Bitcoin, its use and its related technology requirements. The Foundation’s audience includes technologists, regulators, and the media, and its reach is global. The Foundation has been at the forefront of campaigning for an unimpeded economic system for the future. In November 2013, Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Foundation, testified before a United States Senate Committee convened to assess digital currencies. After engaging with federal regulators and lawmakers, a near-unanimous consensus that the federal government needed to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely decentralized payment network resulted. 

&gt; First, the Foundation wishes to express its strong and unequivocal opposition to a specific section of a bill titled “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017” (S. 1241), Section 13, to the extent it includes “digital currencies” for purposes of Subchapter II of Title 31 of the U.S. Code, dealing with “Records and Reports on Monetary Instruments Transactions.” 

&gt; Second, we request that the United States Committee on the Judiciary formally investigates, whether directly or through the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the U.S. Department of Justice’s policy of prosecuting individuals who exchange bitcoin for cash or other financial instruments under the federal money transmitting statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1960. 

&gt; Further details of our submission to your committees are included in the letter attached here.

&gt; We look forward to engaging further with you about these very important issues.

&gt; best wishes

personalfinance,"Got into a pinch, had to purchase a used car, grossly overpaying for it.","Recently started a new job as a union Steamfitter in MD. Making $445 a week, net pay. When I had started the job, I was driving a Ford Focus which had served me well through my previous job. During my second week of work, the Focus broke down and was simply not worth repairing; nor did I have the money to fix it. 

I have a friend who works at a Hyundai dealership near me, decided to ask him the same day about deals on a sub-10k, small economy car. By the end of the day, I had walked out with a 2010 Hyundai Accent SE model, 58,000 miles on the odometer for $7530. This includes a 2 year all covered warranty with a $100 deductible. 

Where I believe it all went wrong, is that I have no established credit. The only way any finance company would approve the loan is if I had some sort of cosigner. My father is the only one willing that I had on hand. He has very bad credit as far as I know(normally late on bills, paying minimum amounts late). He agrees to cosign, and we go through all the financial details. In the end, the only way it could be approved is if he was listed as the main buyer, and myself as the co-buyer. My finance charge is $7530.20, with an interest rate of 22.99%. 60 month loan with monthly payments of $307. Lien company is Credit Acceptance Corp.

What would be my best course of action from here? Im considering getting a secured credit card from my bank to help build credit even more, using it to purchase gas and keeping track of each use. I also want to refinance the lien after 12 months or so with my bank(PNC). 

Tl;dr
Dad signed as buyer on my car, myself as cosigner. I have no credit, he has bad credit. Bought car for $7530; amount financed is $10,897, including 2 year warranty. Make $445 a week and monthly payments are $307, for 60 months. Only have one other bill for $300/month. What do?",finance
personalfinance,Owe 46k to federal. Done paying State.,"Hey guys, I need some help. So I just got done paying my state back taxes. Feels good but I haven't touched my federal, which is 46k. I've hired a CPA so that we can do an OIC but the deadline is September 9th to apply. 

I've recently started thinking about being more financially aware. I came into a decent inheritance which lead my to think I had more money than the world. At the same time I started throwing money into my contract business which was successful for a 2-3 years but then I blew all my money trying to get it back. I was 18 when I came into money. Now I'm pretty much broke but getting back on my feet.

I take home about $3200 a month. Currently live with my dad until he retires in 2019. Then I have to find my own place. 

I also have a car. Which I have high interest on and pay about $360 a month. Health insurance is $160 a month. And auto insurance is $235.

Got into an alcohol addiction before a garnish letter came in the mail. So I have about $2k in the bank because I'm dumb. Stopped drinking. Trying to save money now and be responsible. Finally have the job I wanted also. I've made a huge progress over that last year.

What can I do about the 46k I owe while still being able to save money. I just don't want to be in debt to anyone. Is there any way they can lower the bill a bit and I can make payments of like $150-200 a month? That way I can still pay off my car(hopefully in the next year) and save a bit of cash.

Thanks all.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on selling new car and minimizing loss,"I purchased a new car this past December and at the time I was planning on driving it for at least the next 5-7 years. I decided this July that I would like to fulfill a life dream and begin working remotely while traveling internationally. I will be leaving next March and I plan on selling everything and paying off all debt prior to beginning my travels. Obviously, had I known I would be making this huge life change I would not have purchased the car.

I am in the process of selling some land left to me and my siblings after my father's death last year. That sale should net me between $15,000-$22,000 which is how I plan on paying off any remaining credit card debt prior to my departure. I would like to minimize my losses on the car sale, though. I don't plan on returning any sooner than 1 year and potentially not at all so it doesn't make sense to keep the car and continue to make payments and pay insurance. Any money I have to cover on a loss on the sales comes out of my travel safety net fund, hence wanting to limit it.

It is a 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback Ex-L with Navi, and currently 5k miles, perfect condition. My current payoff is $23,981 and my interest rate is 3.99%. My monthly payment is $493.29. Current insurance is $180/monthly.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Savings accounts...online vs. local bank?,"Good evening /r/personalfinance, and thanks for the help on my last question here. Rather than having fun in the sun, I'm finally getting all my paperwork in order after a few hectic years of grad school. (Side note: I just shredded all my old bank statements from WaMu. Oh, the stupid things I spent money on in my youth)

Finally I'm making a comfortable earning and no longer living month to month, and since my spending habits haven't changed, my bank balance is growing considerably. Even more exciting is that I remembered I still had a checking account at a small bank across the country that I hadn't touched since I moved years ago. Combined, I have about $100k socked away. 

I figure rather than have that vulnerable since I still primarily use my debit card and checks, it's time I move some of that into a savings account, and just keep enough for monthly expenses in checking. Both my local banks here (WaFed) and in Massachusetts (Cambridge Savings) offer the same rates for savings accounts, which is to say, very low. However, I'm a Discover Card member and they do offer online savings, which, like others (ally, etc) is very attractive on returns. I'd be inclined to open one with any of the three entities since that's not yet another company to deal with.

To throw something else into the mix, I also have been playing with Acorns, throwing $100 in here and there, and in the last 2 years that account has done exceptionally well. However, I don't know if I'd trust market investments with my entire savings.

Lastly: I've thought of switching whole hog to an online bank, but 1- I really do appreciate the relationships I've built with my local banks (and my nearest branch *finally* put in an after-hours ATM) and 2- I deal with a non-trivial amount of cash doing freelance work. 

So how does Reddit deal with multiple bank accounts here? Or should I keep on trucking with my checking account and nothing else?",finance
personalfinance,"I have many, many questions.","Hi all. I've been working pretty hard to learn about finances and how to manage my money. My biggest priority is clearing my CC debt. That time is coming soon (October 13th!!) so I'm shifting my focus to saving, living an adult life, and planning for retirement. I have a few questions about taking that next step. 

Some background. I live in a two income household, myself and my husband. My paycheck goes to bills. His paycheck was generally used purely for discretionary/fun spending. Not the best idea, I know, but it's changing. My paycheck is approx. $2100 twice a month, his is approx. $1100 every two weeks. 

My current debt paying plan of action is putting all but $400/ month towards either bills or debt. The $400 ($100 each twice a month) is sanity saving fun money. Otherwise, I am putting close to $2000/ month towards debt. 

1. Once the debt is paid off, my plan is as follows. My paycheck will cover all bills ($3600). I will be contributing $400 to my TSP and the remaining $200 will be put in a shared emergency fund. My husbands check will contribute first to his employers retirement program. I don't know the exact amounts on his so the numbers will be more of an estimate. After his retirement contribution, approx. $120 will be put into the shared emergency fund. From there the check will be split evenly as ""allowances"". I plan (and suggested this to my husband) to contribute about $225 to an IRA from my allowance and then the rest will be fun money.

 Is this a step in the right direction? Any suggestions?

2. I have 5 credit cards/lines. Navy Federal CU, Capital One Quicksilver, Care Credit, Victoria's Secret, and Military Star. I've been thinking about closing some just so I don't have so many but I know that could hurt my score. My oldest card is only a little over three years. Another thought I had was upgrading my bank cards. I have a significantly better credit score than when I opened these cards so I thought I could get cards that reflect that, specifically better rewarding cards. Is upgrading a possibility? Is it a good idea? What about closing the lines in general?

3. After I leave the military in about two years, my husband and I are planning to move back home to the Seattle area. We want to buy a home in Kent, just south of Seattle. How do we go about saving for what's necessary now while also contributing to an emergency fund and retirement accounts and not squirreling all dollars away? I know I don't *have* to have a down payment if I use a VA loan, but I'd like to be as set up as possible. 

 Secondary to this, how do we use the next two years to prepare for living in a significantly higher COL area? My husbands pay check should go up considerably when we move but my paycheck will be reduced to just a housing allowance (~$2500) if I'm going to school full time on the GI Bill. We used to live there and I've been doing research so I'm not going in totally blind but I'm not 100% sure how to prepare for the shift.

4. Due to my husbands current job, we are required to move a city over. I'm going to pay off all my debts before we move. After that, I'd be going right back into debt again. We have to pay a lease termination fee of about ~$2300 plus associated moving costs. I predict an end figure of about $6000 back on my credit card (only one this time though so that's a plus). What would you recommend as a course of action for this situation? We don't have time to save beforehand between aggressively paying off debts in 40 days and having to move so soon. After the move though, we would go back to aggressively paying off the debt. Our rent and utilities will decrease so that will help.

 On top of this, I told myself that if I moved again, I would be leaving everything behind. I want to buy all new furniture. My home is furnished with crappy, cheap, broken furniture I bought when it was just my paycheck supporting us at 19 years old. We've grown up a little and we're both making decent money and we both desire an adult looking home. I don't plan on furnishing the entire home at once but I'd definitely like it to happen. Is it a bad idea to add this spending on top of the debt we'd be acquiring from the move? We've been waiting to pay off our debt, to start new, to purchase new furniture and then out of the blue we have to move. Wrench in the plans.

5. Last question: Taking into account everything above, what would you do with ~$8000? I have a little over this in an Edward Jones account. I don't know if I can withdraw it as cash but that was never my intention. Should I move it to a savings account and make it the base of our emergency fund? I've thought about putting it in a high earning account for the next two years and use it as the down payment/buying costs of our future home in Washington but I know even with the amount now it wouldn't accrue much of anything. I could split it and put half in each of our IRAs (or can I? Haven't really checked that out yet). Or I could just leave it where it's at. Thoughts?

If you've made it this far, I genuinely appreciate the effort you've put in. I went through a lot and learned the hard way to get where I have so far and I don't want to screw it up in the future. I'm not necessarily aiming for financial independence or early retirement but my husband and I are young. We want to take advantage of the time we have and the money we're making to set us up to be comfortable for the rest of our lives while also living as young adults in an amazing city.",finance
personalfinance,"Navy Federal CC, good idea?","I've made a few posts so far, trying to find my path towards financial responsibility, mainly trying to build credit. So my new question is about these Navy Federal credit cards.

I've heard them recommended numerous times. Awesome approval rates, generous credit limits, etc.

I recently got a secured card with Cap One, and am looking to add another card to my wallet to help build credit to finance a vehicle in the next year or so. 
With a 552 credit score on transunion (one bad remark, nothing else) and a blank score on the other two, plus the recent pull for capital one, what would my chances of being approved be?
I'd hate to apply and have an inquiry and denial on my score.

personalfinance,"Trying to repair my credit, some questions about handling a medical debt, etc.","So basically my credit is in the dumpster. I do have a secured VISA with CapitalOne and their CreditWise informs me that I'm currently at 514. All of the negatives are due to two things: medical bills and student loans. 

I have about $40k in student loans that are in default. They've been handed over to a collection agency called National Recoveries whom I'm working with, my understanding is that I have to make 9 months of basically token payments before they come out of default and get handed off to someone else. That's fine as far as I'm concerned. 

I also have a ~$3,500 debt from an emergency room visit 4 years ago. This has apparently been handed off to a collection agency ""SENEX SRVCS."" In case it matters, in credit wise the account is listed as ""Derogatory"" and payment status ""Collection/chargeoff"" I am making a little money now, which is why I'm trying to get this taken care of, but I certainly can't afford to pay off ~$3,500.

I've read that these collection agencies often bought the debt for pennies on the dollar and will settle for a much lower sum. One article I read recommended writing a letter to the agency offering to settle for 25% of the total. Is that sound advice, or what should I do here?

I have another medical bill for ~$600 (handled by ""TSI/55"") however the age of account is 5 years, 11 months and my understanding is that it falls off my credit report at 7 years. What is the best course of action here?

Finally, and this is one that concerns me the most, I see under ""new accounts"" that supposedly I opened a student loan in Kentucky in Nov of 2015, three separate charges totaling more than $10k. I did go to school in KY at one time but all of my student loans should have been consolidated, and all would have been well before (as in 10 years before) 11/2015.  One issue maybe be that when I left school in KY for the last time, I never ended up providing all of the necessary information for my loan so the school never got the federal money and was holding my transcript based on a debt I owed to the institution for tuition and housing (which of course I never used because I wasn't there). Is it possible that they've somehow turned this debt into student loan debt, 10 years later?

Thanks, any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Net present value vs compound investment growth,"I am confused regarding how net present value and compound interest growth relate. 

I'm evaluating putting solar panels on my house and have created a pretty elaborate spreadsheet to weigh how different factors and scenarios will affect the monetary benefit of the panels (inflation, maintenance, panel degradation, utility billing changes, etc).

A couple of the measures I am outputting is the net present value and the equivalent annual interest rate that would produce the same net benefit.

My base scenario on a $5723 investment produces a net gain of $14,636 over 30 years. The NPV using a 4% opportunity cost is $5,196 while the equivalent interest rate is 4.32%. (I have double checked and I *think* I am applying these formulas correctly).

The part that really confuses me is that if I change the opportunity cost to 10%, I'm still left with a barely positive NPV ($38). Yet if $5723 were allowed to grow over 30 years with 10% interest, it would earn &gt;$94K. 

If I'm not applying the formulas incorrectly, how that heck can NPV give me a positive value on $14,636 of earnings at 10% opportunity cost when, if I actually used that ""opportunity"" of 10%, I'd have &gt; 6x more earnings? I get the feeling NPV is not what it's claimed to be....",finance

Currently I have about 45k of student loans. I'm a part time student, part time employee and after falling on some hard times I'm finally able to make a bit of a dent in my loans. About 25k of these loans are federal with varying interest rates (the lowest at about 3.4% and the highest at 6.8%), with the remaining 20k in Sallie Mae with a whopping 9.85% interest rate. I tried refinancing that one but because I'm still a student I was denied. If all goes according to plan, I'll be a full time student in a year (full time, 2 year program) but that means my loans, although in deferment, will still be racking up that interest. I'm able to throw about $800 at my loans right now and have been dedicating that purely to the one with the highest interest rate, but that ability goes away once I start going to school full time. What do I do? I feel like even if I'm able to put a nice dent in the loan over the year before becoming a full time student, it'll add back up over the 2-year program.

personalfinance,401k/early retirement and tax questions,"I've got a couple questions I'm hoping someone here can help with.

EDIT: This first one has been completely answered, thanks.  First, a hypothetical situation to see if I'm understanding something correctly.  Let's say my wife and I both retire at age 40 with no income other than a 401k.  We withdraw $15k/yr from the 401k.  What taxes would we pay on this $15k/yr 401k income?  My understanding is that we would pay no regular federal or state income tax, since the standard deduction/exemptions for both are above $15k, but that we would pay a flat 10% tax due to early withdrawal of the 401k funds.  Is that correct, and would we also have to pay social security and medicare tax on the $15k?

The second and more general question: at my current job I have the option to make considerably more money by working more hours, but I recently did the math and realized that my extra hours at this point are already being taxed at almost 40% (25% federal, 5.5% state, 6.2% social, 1.45% medicare).  This removes my incentive to work more since the trade-off of time VS money isn't worth it at that tax rate to me, even though I'd otherwise like to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more while I can.  My question is, aside from putting money into a 401k (or other similar retirement fund with an early-withdrawal penalty) do I have any other good options to reduce my taxable income?  

I'm married, no dependents, no mortgage/debt, just use the standard deduction for federal/state taxes every year because our itemized deduction would be much less.",finance

That bankruptcy was really due to a divorce, an old job I quit soon after (being paid more now), and I had acquired all of the debt that my ex wife racked up on credit cards.

My plans now will be to move in with my GF and start searching for a new place (priced in the $150k area) we could live together (she currently owns her condo). Moving in with my GF to her condo will save me about $200-300/month if we just stay there instead of buy.  New house is looking to save me about $150/month.  Potential to get a roommate exists with the new house though, thus saving me MUCH more.

**My options I'm considering:**

* Pay off ALL debts and save $490/month and a ton of interest. But I don't have money left over for a downpayment on a house. Would have to save enough to get there. Would also be saving the $200-300/month in my living costs.

* Don't pay off debts and buy a house, use my $35k as a downpayment to avoid paying PMI on a new house. Would need $30k to avoid PMI.

* Pay off just the high interest rate car to save $250/month. Would have a lesser downpayment on a house, but PMI is calculated to only be about $65/month anyways.

Thoughts? Questions?

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan forgiveness program?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for some advice on calls that I've been receiving over the past few weeks. I get about 3 calls/day that leave messages about federal student loan forgiveness based on ""my balance and interest rate"". The messages also state that my servicer (Nelnet) is being sued although they don't mention the servicer by name. A quick google search shows a lawsuit filed against them. 

I'm just a little unsure since the calls don't state their agency or company. Can anyone offer advice on this? Is this legit?",finance

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, the war on cash and the next financial crisis.","Bitcoin and the war on cash.

I will keep this as brief as possible and apologies if I am preaching to the converted.  I see so many posts about short term gains and hourly price movements on this reddit then sheer panic if the price falls to a “7 day low”.  I think a lot of people are failing to see the bigger picture. 

There is a deliberate and almost synchronised global war on cash and war on savers going on in which bitcoin can play a crucial role in preserving the wealth of its hodlers.

In 2013 all depositors at the bank of Cyprus with deposits over €100k had 37.5% of their assets confiscated overnight in a “bail in” to recapitalise the bank.  I believe this will set the precedent for all future banking crises.

The Bank of England chief Economist Andy Haldane is calling for cash to be abolished to give the bank extra powers in case of another downturn, effectively paving the way for negative interest rates, bail in’s and all sorts of extreme monetary policy.

In 2016 the Venezuelan government removed the 100 bolivar note in Venezuela “to stop mafia crime”.  
The 500/1000 rupee note in India was declared non legal tender, causing huge political unrest for a country which many people have no access to modern banking.  
The ECB is considering removing the 500 Euro note, citing that it is mainly used by criminals and there are rumours other governments will follow suit.

The news may be sporadic but the trend is clear if you join the dots.  The war on money laundering is a smoke screen to hide governments true intent.  Every major Government is drowning in debt and is attempting to demonise the use of cash so that they can control the money supply electronically, enforce negative interest rates and bail-ins on their tax payers.  Cash is a burden on governments, they cannot control or monitor its use and they find it difficult to tax. 

If you think these crises are confined to countries in foreign lands then think again.  The next financial crisis may be just around the corner but the debt of the last financial crisis has not and cannot be repaid.  In fact the total global debt pile has grown exponentially since the last financial crisis.  

Contrast this with bitcoin, a currency with a predetermined inflation rate for the next 123 years.  A currency that cannot be seized by governments if you alone hold the keys.   Can be moved across borders just as easy as if it was moving across a room. A pseudonymous currency where you can control who is monitoring your transactions.  Bitcoin has the potential to free us from the enslavement of corrupt indebted governments, and offers protection from anyone trying to seize your money.

When the next financial crisis comes, the exit doors to Cryptocurrencies will be jammed and you will pay a huge premium to move your capital into bitcoin and other secure cryptocurrencies.

Many people don’t see bitcoin as a safe haven because of its extreme volatility and because it has never seen a financial crisis.

personalfinance,Should I restrain myself from paying off a big chunk of my student loans?,"**Quick background**: 

I am 29 years old. In grad school. Maybe two more years left. 

I am $40,000 in debt from undergrad: $20,000 in private loans at 3.2% (variable) and $20,000 in federal loans at 6.3% (fixed). $10,000 of my federal loans are subsidized (still), $10,000 are unsubsidized. My loans are currently being deferred. 

Over the last few years, I have managed to save about $30,000. I also have a side job as a server making about $35,000 per year. I live a relatively frugal lifestyle (I live on less than $15,000 per year) and have no clue about future job prospects/income levels.  

**My struggle is this**: 

I have this sort of all or nothing mentality with this debt; I have a desire to just write a check for $20,000 to pay off half the loans. I feel like it would be incredibly psychologically satisfying, but I don't know if it is the smartest move financially.  If it is a good idea, I feel compelled to pay off my private ones despite their lower interest rate since the federal loans come with various benefits (e.g.,  income-based/contingent payment schemes, forgiveness, etc).

Obviously, like most people I would like to be out of debt. I would like this to happen ASAP. But I also don't want to make rash decisions. Any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Question about the flowchart...what do I focus on next?!,"Hello!  I'm a longtime lurker, but this is my first post to PF.  I have a question regarding the flowchart regarding how to handle money...it indicates that after you have an emergency fund equal to one month's savings to contribute to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match.  My employer does not offer a match, but they do contribute anywhere from 3% to 6% into the 401(k) for profit sharing.  Should I not contribute to my 401(k) since I get the 3% to 6% contribution no matter what?  My spouse does not have a 401(k) through his employer...he is a union worker, so he has a pension. 

Last year I started contributing 10% to the 401(k) just to reduce my taxable income (we ended up owing $2K last year when we usually get around $1K returned).  I would rather pay into my 401(k) than pay the IRS again. 

Some details on our financial situation (if it would be applicable):
My annual gross income is $71k and my spouse's is about $55k.  We have a mortgage ($1,256/mo. at 3.63% interest rate), truck and car payment ($865/mo. combined with a 3.19% interest rate and 2.24% interest rate), and a $3k balance on a credit card with a 7.9% fixed interest rate.  We have been putting around $500 a month in our emergency fund and another $500 a month in savings for an upcoming vacation (we booked this last year). We have $5k saved right now in our emergency fund, which is in excess of 1 mo. expenses.  I have around $57k in a 401(k).  We are both in our early 30's with one child.

Any advice on where we should focus next?  Should we continue to contribute 10% into my 401(k) and stay the course with our savings until we reach 3-6 months expenses?  After our trip in November, we will be putting $1k a month in our emergency savings, so that will speed up the process quite a bit.",finance

personalfinance,Help Me Help GF Tackle Student Loans,"Hello all! I'm trying to help my girlfriend tackle her student loans and want to make sure I'm giving her all the right information. If I leave out any important details feel free to ask.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Loan provider: Great Lakes  
Principal balance:  $216,000  
Unpaid interest: $22,000  
Interest rate: 3%-6.5%  
Repayment plan: income based repayment(IBR)  
&amp;nbsp;  
She currently pays $5,000/month but isn't specifying any payment distribution. Her income now is too high for any IBR amount, so while her loans are still technically under IBR, her monthly minimum follows a standard 10 year repayment plan.    
&amp;nbsp;  
She is ready to put $40,000 towards the loans now, and continue making excess payments until they are gone. Having said all of this, here are a few questions:  
&amp;nbsp;  
1) When she applies the $40,000 payment, would it be best to apply it all to principal, ignoring the unpaid interest? (Assuming Great Lakes allows her to do this)  
&amp;nbsp;  
2) When navigating through the payment process in Great Lakes web portal, we see where to specify which loan we want the payment applied to. We don't, however, see a way to specify that we want everything after the minimum required payment to be applied to principal. Is it standard to have to call after every payment and tell them where to apply the excess amount?  
&amp;nbsp;  
3) She is worried that her semi-recent increase in income is going to get her kicked out of IBR. If this happens, the unpaid interest will capitalize. Can Great Lakes simply deem her ineligible for IBR and kick her off of it?  
&amp;nbsp;  
4) If she is kicked out of IBR and the $22,000 in unpaid interest capitalizes, after it is tacked onto principal does the unpaid interest balance go to $0?

Also, people realising that a federal government institution from the USA, Homeland Security, is **working** (not planning to work, already working) with Factom.  
  
Also, people realising that China's first smart-city relies on Factom to develop their data network.  
  
Also, people realising this coin has only a market cap of $290 million or so which is almost the same as f*cking Dogecoin. Considering that they already have a working product, they are already delivering, I think 2 billion market cap short to medium term is what's going to happen (that's about x7-x8).
  
Also, people realising that Factom has such a brilliant system in place that makes its coin more and more valuable,  the more companies are using Factom, the more the supply will lower and the price will go higher, which in itself will make the price go higher, it's brilliant!
  
Also, people realising that Factom is currently in talks/discussion/works with a few very big banking industry and insurance industry giants, but can't be disclosed at the moment due to NDA agreements (the fact itself that those companies chose to have an NDA until official announcement makes me believe even more that these companies are truly industry giants, why would a small business ask for an NDA randomly?), but will probably be in the near future.

personalfinance,Unemployed and wondering how to maximize using money from my previous employers 401k to get by.,"I'm 34 years old, had been working retail (full time for the last 3 year, and making over minimum wage since date of hire) for the last 10 years.  I've been unemployed for 9 months now (it's been extremely difficult for me to find anything), and am out of money from savings, emergency fund, and unused vacation pay.  In looking for ways to not move back in with my dad, and stay an independent adult, I'm looking into trying to do something with the money from my 401k.

I used this [calculator](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/401k-early-withdrawal-calculator).  For my [state](https://www.tax-brackets.org/californiataxtable) and [federal](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/) income tax levels I used the associated links and determined (with no other income yet in 2017) it looks like my state income tax bracket would be at most 6%, and my federal income tax bracket would be 15%.  With those numbers the calculator says I'd have a little under $20k after penalties and taxes.  Does it look like I chose the right brackets, and that the calculator is pretty accurate as far as the results?

The 401k is doing well enough for someone who knows little about good investment practices.  With no money from the company going into it anymore, my annual rate of return since January 1st is over 13%, and it's earned over $3000.  I don't really want to lose the start to having money for retirement, nor do I want to want that source of untouched income to disappear.

If I roll it over to an IRA, would I be able to withdraw (and be penalized and taxed) for just a portion of the full amount, or would I need to take the full amount out just like I would if I withdrew it from the 401k?  If I did withdraw it all from the 401k and then got a job in 2 weeks, would I be able to put the remainder of the money into a retirement account easily, and would it cost me to do so, because I would no longer have the fund managed by my previous company?  If I withdrew all the money, and then got a job in 2 weeks, and they had a retirement fund, would it be better to put the money I did withdraw into a Roth IRA, or would it be better to put as much of my paycheck as possible into the company's 401k, until I ran out of the withdrawn money again?

Any suggestions on which way I should go, to maximize my money in the future?

My only concern is that something catastrophic may happen to me and/or my wife before then, and the extra $120 a month in a regular savings account might be the difference between us making it through the situation or not. But given that we each pay about $750 a month for our respective halves of the expenses and we have combined savings of over $5,000 already, even after we just had to spend $500 each on car repairs in August, I feel like I'm stable enough to opt for saving money on the interest rates.",finance

2. If I pay off any of these loans in bulk do I need to be worried about fees or taxes associated with doing that? I wasn't sure if that applied to federal loans or just private loans but I've heard some horror stories.

3. I was interested in public service loan forgiveness, but given the ""nonbinding letters"" that were sent out regarding the program and with Betsy Devos at the helm of the Dept of Ed, I'm not sure that enrolling in an income based repayment plan and banking on 10 year forgiveness is a sound financial decision as the interest would be murder if she decided to axe it. I was contemplating enrolling and then just paying extra money towards the loans to knock them out one by one as I go but wasn't sure if that made financial sense or not. Also hinges on being able to land a public service job. Thoughts?

solar,Solar advice needed,"I was hoping to get some advice.
Was looking to get a solar panel installation in NY. Talking with Solar City, and had a site survey done. They were able to guarantee ~45% offset. It could be higher if not for a tall tree in the front blocking the setting sun, and the west side of the home, as well as a problem with 'sag' on an added on room section in the back.
I've had two roofers look at the roof, and both seem to agree that the roof is bouncing when they walk in certain areas. They both independently stated that the ply was delaminating. Unfortunately, It seems I need to tear the roof off and start over.
That said, I am trying to figure out my options.
OPTION 1- I think I can have the roof replaced, done correctly, ridge vent and updated fans installed, to cut down on the heat up there, to help with wear and tear on the ply, followed by a solar panel install. doing this may bring that 45% offset up to ~60% offset (due to the added on room being available for solar panels, without the sag issue. From what I understand, I can get the federal tax credit to apply to the roof replacement as part of this pv install.
OPTION 2- Solar shingles from Solar City. Is it feasible to get better than 45/60% offset with the shingles? I know the cost is higher, but it includes a new roof, so it's a combination solution. I don't know how soon I could have this done. I know there's a waiting list, but not sure how far out that is.
OPTION 3- sell the place and go rent an apartment.. this home owning business is for the birds.
I'm hoping someone has some feedback on the first two options.

personalfinance,"I'm not using university-provided housing, but my university has informed me they will still use my scholarship/financial aid to pay for it.","The gist:

* Large U.S. university
* Graduate program
* Takes place abroad
* ±$30K scholarship, split between semesters
* The rest is paid by federal student loans

Right now I'm in university-provided housing, as I'm living in a developing country. However, in the spring I will be in Europe, and university-provided housing is 4 to an apartment, 2 per bedroom with students much younger. I'm engaged and far from being 18, so this is a *highly* unattractive situation. I decided I wanted to get my own apartment.

Here's the problem. The program's financial aid liaison told me that tuition is ""bundled"" with housing. So even if I get my own apartment and it is miles cheaper than university-provided housing, my scholarship and my financial aid will still be forcibly applied to housing costs, because it's all ""part of tuition""; even if I'm not using housing. I asked for price breakdown of the spring semester, and he was ""unable"" to provide one.

In short, they're taking my money anyway and any cheap housing I get will be out of my own pocket.

I'm fuming. Is that even legal? How do I proceed?

**TLDR: University forcibly applying scholarship/financial aid money on housing that I'm not using. Their explanation is it's ""bundled"" with tuition.**

I looked up the maturity, duration (sensitivity to interest rates), and yield of vanguard total bond market.  I wondered if I could build a portfolio of CDs that beat it.

personalfinance,Need help in understanding the cost of owning a house for 5 years,"I live in the Seattle area where the housing market is really hot right now. I don't plan to live in this area for more than 5 years so I'm trying to understand if it makes sense for me to buy a apartment. My rent is $1600/month which means I'm spending more than $20K/year on just the rent. I'm thinking of buying a one bedroom apartment which are right now in 250K-300K range (This is in the greater Seattle area. I don't think I can afford anything in Seattle itself). 

Reddit, please help me here. This will be my biggest purchase ever so I want to make sure that I'm taking everything into account. 

Below are some calculations that I've done:

**Costs:**

For a 300K house, I'll have to put about 60K as the down payment (240K loan). The below calculations are based on this down payment.

*Interest:* - For a loan of 240K with a 4.25% interest rate, the total interest paid in 5 years will be about 49K. Total principal paid will be about 22k in 5 years (source : [https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/amortization](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/amortization)).
The interest is not contributing towards my equity so it is just plain cost. It does provide me with some tax gains which I'll get to in the savings section. 

*Property taxes:*  Property tax in the state of Washington is 1.025% which means, for a property worth 300K, the property tax will be about $3100  which means over a period of 5 years, I'll pay around $15,500 in property taxes.

*HOA dues:* Since I cannot afford an independent house, HOAs are a big concern as well. The apartments that I've looked at have an average HOA of about $400/month. Again, HOAs are like rent and do not build any equity so over a period of 5 years I'll pay about 24K in HOA dues.

*Closing costs:* The lender told me that closing cost will be about 2% of the purchase price so about 6K

*Selling costs* Since I'm not planning to not live in the house for more than 5 years, I've have to sell the house as well. Cost of selling the house (broker fees and sales tax) comes to about 8% of the property price. For a 300K house, this will be about 24K (assuming the value of the property doesn't change)

*Lost capital gain:* Instead of buying a house, if I invest the down payment amount (60K) in a vanguard fund and lets say I get a 5%, the total gains in 5 years will be about 16K. So I'm losing about 16K if I put that money as the down payment.





Expense type| Cost
---|---
Interest| 49K
Property taxes| 15K
HOA dues| 24K
Closing cost| 6K
Selling costs| 24K
Lost capital gain | 16K


The total cost of owning a house for 5 years is coming to be around **134K**.


**Savings**

*Rent* -- My current rent is $1600. It will surely go up in the next few years so if I take $2000 as the average rent for the next five years, I'll save about 120K (2000 X 12 X 5).
*Tax saving* -- The interest and property taxes are tax deductible. The total interest and property tax paid for 5 years will be about 64K (49K + 15K).  Since I won't be taking the standard deduction in this case ($6350/year), my actual extra tax deductible amount will be around 32K (64K minus standard deduction for 5 years). The tax saving on that will be about 8K (32 x 0.25 -- I'm in the 25% bracket)

Expense type| Cost
---|---
Rent saved| 120K
Tax saving| 8K

Total saving over the 5 years will be around **128K**


All of this calculation is based on the assumption that the value of the property remains the same. I'm not sure how much of an upside is possible on a 1 bedroom apartment which is already selling for 300K.

Based on this it does not look like I'll be saving a lot by buying a house. Please let me know your thoughts on the calculations.",finance
Ripple,Much Ado About Marketcaps,"Long post. Salty TL;DR at the bottom.

It's become painfully clear to me that many of us need a clarification as to what the Market Capitalization of any given thing is and what that means for said thing.

So here are some facts:

1) The Market Capitalization of any given cryptocurrency is determined by the CIRCULATING SUPPLY multiplied by the PRICE PER ASSET. If you want to check me on that, multiply XRP's current price by the circulating supply and see what you get.

I'll wait. (I'm gonna assume you got the current Marketcap, anyway, next fact)

2) The Marketcap of any given cryptocurrency is the worth of the speculative value of all the coins that can currently be traded and therefore does not reflect actual fiat value but POTENTIAL fiat value and also does not necessarily reflect the worth of the companies or organizations underpinning the currency. Essentially, it's a benchmark and doesn't actually mean anything concrete that we can't already tell from existing figures.

3) The TOTAL EXISTING SUPPLY does NOT matter in terms of Marketcap. Because given the definition of a market, whatever doesn't circulate through the hands of buyers and sellers is by definition NOT a part of the market and does not get figured into Market Cap.

So with that being said.

STOP WITH THE STOCK COMPARISONS. Stocks are directly affected by how the company is doing within the overall market rather than these assets which are literally either speculative or real use case value based on the tech itself and its adoption. VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. Especially in our case where Ripple and XRP are NOT tied to each other in value necessarily.

This is not the same as shares in a company. Traditional metrics do NOT apply and we ALL have to be much more open minded about what direction the value of XRP will take whether good or bad. And if you want examples of that close mindedness in my opinion, here:

A.) People tend to say ""Oh well, if XRP reaches this price then it'll exceed the marketcap of Bitcoin and so it's unrealistic""

This is simply conditioning. While market sentiment does have impeccable control over the determination of value, especially considering that this is a speculative market, once any given tradition is broken in this market it STAYS broken. This is the nature of tech and nascent tech markets especially (after all, cryptocurrency is essentially fintech). So to permanently assume that XRP could never overtake Bitcoin's marketcap is silly at best.

We cannot predict the future. 

The same way there are things much more valuable than gold despite it being the standard for many currencies, Bitcoin can become a store of value and standard of value despite other assets holding more value in total.

B.) Yes, there ARE 100,000,000,000 XRP in total (actually a lil less now that many have been burned off for transactions) but there are only about 40% of that in circulation. People worry about the idea that the escrow holding the majority of XRP might unlock, but the only real reason that would happen is demand exceeding supply and that is a GOOD thing for us investors. And the only reason that would happen is major banks going live and needing a certain amount of XRP that could match the scale of their cross border settlement and remittances burden. So again, if you want to figure out potential marketcap, forget the other 60bn at least for now (same way NEO actually has 100million total but 50million is stowed outside of the market)

And here's some more food for thought. After adjusting for inflation the internet bubble didn't truly burst until about 9.6 TRILLION USD. And that was just valuation of companies based in the specific use of the internet and what that would bring. And this was at a time (late 90's early 2000's) when internet access was in NO way ubiquitous like it is today.

WE ARE LITERALLY AND ACTUALLY DEALING WITH A NEW WAY TO DO MONEY FOR ALL OF HUMANITY AT ONCE. Not only that, but this new archetype of value is now leveraging an already insanely massive network that just about everyone will be able to somehow have access to in the coming years. So even the idea that this market bubbles at 10Trillion is small minded, especially because it's supposed to hopefully become the new main method of using money WITHOUT THE LIMITATION OF BORDERS.

And to bring the point home.

RIPPLE PLANS TO USURP SWIFT AND BECOME A NEW STANDARD FOR MONEY TRANSFER. And between SWIFT, CHIPS, And FedWire, you have QUADRILLIONS of dollars being handled and transferred every year.

This is NOT to say that XRP will reach some insane price by the end of this year. And this is not to say it won't. This is simply to provide better perspective so that I can stop reading trash arguments about XRP's valuation on every goddamn post in this sub. Get informed, do more research, and stop shutting down possibilities in either direction and realize that we are on the forefront of an international revolution in the longest standing trade mechanism we have developed.

TL;DR: Your conventional wisdom, your cynicism, your maximalism, and/or stock experience means literally as much as marketcap does:

Nothing.

I clearly went into this without knowing enough, and I'm definitely feeling the high payments.  I would also like to get the car I initially wanted, but I'm really not sure if that's possible. The car-buying scene kinda scares me a bit, and I don't want another auto-dealer to prey on my lack of knowledge/experience.

Anyways, thanks for looking at my post! Hope someone out there has been through the same and has some helpful advice..

TL:DR
Is it better to refinance now, or let my credit build for another few months?",finance

personalfinance,"Local bank and contractors screwed us over with home construction, and now we're having a hard time getting a mortgage","TLDR: After 19 months (and nearly $12,000 in construction loan interest), my wife and I are struggling to get approved for a home mortgage that refinances our construction loans. Please help! Sorry for the wall of text.

Any advice on how to get out of this mess would be greatly appreciated.

In March 2015, my wife and I purchase a piece of property where we wanted to build our dream home, just outside of my wife's hometown – a very small, rural town in Tennessee. We're young (mid to late 20s), but we were ambitious and excited about the possibility, especially after spending several months trying (and failing) to find an existing home that we liked enough to purchase.

After paying on the land loan for several months and meeting with different building contractors, we picked some carpenters/contractors to help us draw up plans for our home. They were recommended to us by some friends, and they seemed honest and reliable.

After meeting with a bank to discuss financing the construction of the home, the bank's in-house appraiser believed that the home would not be worth what the contractors said it would cost to build it. After making some adjustments to the plans, the construction loan was finally approved, and they first broke ground in March 2016. The basement was poured in late April/early May, and the house was in the dry by July.

Once insulation, electrical/plumbing, and HVAC was nearly completed in September, it was clear that we were going to run out of money before the drywall could even be put up. Once our contractors knew that we were running out of money, they stopped showing up. Other crews stopped showing up – the painters stopped halfway through painting the siding.

Fast forward to February 2017 after a few stressful months of trying to pay people out of pocket to work on the home, and the bank finally agreed to loan us an additional $45,000 to finish construction, with my wife's parents as co-signers. That amount was based on contract prices that we received from carpenters, painters, etc. (By this point, we had fired our initial contractors. I should clarify that we never actually signed a contract with these ""contractors,"" so there was nothing actually requiring them to build the home at the price they originally quoted us.)

The home was finally finished this summer, and we moved in July 1. We made some final touches on the interior of the home and then met with a home financer to discuss a mortgage. Based on the appraisal, we would need to pay private mortgage insurance for a few years. This frustrated us, but we just wanted to put the whole mess behind us and finally have a regular mortgage payment.

The financier contacted us yesterday and explained that the underwriters he spoke with said it would not be possible to refinance our construction loans (remainder of land loan, initial construction loan, and final ""supplemental"" loan). Our loan-to-value ratio exceeded 80%, and based on some federal rules (?), it is not possible to refinance with a cash-out when the LTV exceeds 80%.

Cash-out? Right. Well, when the bank loaned us the additional $45,000 to finish the construction, they did not place a lien on the property for this loan. Apparently because of that, the line of credit is treated as a cash-out option.

So, we're stuck. By my count, we have sunk $53,000 into this home out of our own savings – not even including the loan interest that we have paid. As young people with very modest incomes, that is a LOT of money for us. Most of that went toward the land early on, but we also spent a lot of money on the actual construction: appliances, bathrooms, interior painting (which we did ourselves), door knobs, etc., as well as the money we paid to some workers over the winter in 2016-17 after our initial construction loan ran out.

We aren't sure what to do. The financier is supposed to speak with our bank on Tuesday (since Monday is Labor Day), but he said that would be some obstacles.

Any advice? What options do we have? And does anyone think we might have any legal recourse against the initial contractors or the bank?

EDIT to clarify that our LTV is about 90%. Our loans do not exceed the appraisal value.",finance

Student loan: $4220.09 (interest rate of 10.99%, Original amount was $5000, term was 5 years I believe. Don't recall when it started but it would've been in the fall of 2016)

2 - $14,348.40 at 5.28% (minimum payment - $146.59, currently paying $200/month)

3 - $43,325.68 at 7.65% (minimum payment - $290.16, currently paying $950/month)

4 - $5,448.19 at 8.00% (minimum payment - $50, currently paying $100/month)

I was off work for a while (traveling the world) so I lowered my loan payments. However, now I'm back and working and making plenty of money so I'm throwing it at my loans.

At minimum now, I put $1500/month to them. I am also putting any extra money I make from side gigs to loan #4.

My questions:

1. Both snowball and avalanche have me paying off loan #4 first, as it is both the lowest principal and highest interest rate. However, because my next highest interest rate is 7.65% (not that far from 8%) and the principal is MUCH higher, I've putting the majority of my money towards that loan. **Is this best?**

2. According to unbury.me, to pay the least amount of interest overall, I should use the avalanche method and pay the minimum on all my loans except the one I am trying to pay down at the moment. However, since I lowered my loans while I wasn't working, the minimum is just enough to cover the monthly interest. It doesn't seem in my best interest to not pay on my principal for years. **Is this correct? Is there another calculator where I could input different monthly amounts and see where it gets me?**

3. Any other advice? I want these paid off ASAP!

CryptoCurrency,"Resources/examples of anonymous, but taxable crypto currencies?","I've been thinking about the role of government and taxes in economics and society, as well as how crypto currencies will change that (if at all). I'm very skeptical of the ancap patterns of ""no taxes, no regulations"", however I am thinking about the following:

You can argue that a global, distributed currency which is not susceptible to national monetary policy could combat market distortions ( even if we realistically only limit this by making monetary policy equivalent to hardforking, which still raises the required consent). This is orthogonal to anonymity (see most crypto currency). 

The important thing for governments in this case is that the  global currency is taxable (you can have anonymous, but taxable systems and also non-monogamous systems which make taxing difficult).

 If you agree that humans in general desire some sort of tax funded services (police, roads, an army, education, whatever), then taxability becomes a new desirable quality in currency. 

The last step is based on the idea that black markets are created by a mismatch between human desires and the social structures around them. In this view the largest criminal industries (prostitution and drugs, human trafficking and protection rackets) will be eliminated through finding regulations that keep participants safe, not by banning (for drugs and prostitution) and by providing a functioning immigration and police system. If this is the mindset, then it becomes desirable to enable illegal transactions in the taxable crypto currency, since then the taxes can be used to build this infrastructure/regulations. The benefit from the criminals would be elimination of the need to launder money, knowing their gains are fungible and the customers having an easier time with it",cryptocurrency

BlockChain,"The bridge between Blockchain and AI, Atmatrix want to connect them using AIaaS","The rise of Block chain can be attributed to the existence of monopolized industries, artificial intelligence is also a field that is monopolized. Major players secure their position through their advanced learning algorithms and access to a wealth of data, resulting in a data fed behemoth. Only those software companies with access to massive amounts of personal data to train a more powerful artificial intelligence can be competitive. Therefore personal user's data has become the Internet’s most valuable resource. 


But because each company's business type is different, their access to data is also different. So even if the company is powerful enough to monopolize a specific field of data, it cannot monopolize every field of data. 
This results in an awkward internal conflict, because they need additional data to grow, but aren’t willing to share their own resource (data) in exchange, resulting in slowed, “fragmented island” industry.

Data monopolies bring these risks and problems, so if we leverage the decentralized nature of blockchain, to address the roots of the problem, drive the cooperation between different companies, Entities, and institutions across the borders, in a fully trusted manner, establishing valuable trade networks and resolving the problems caused by monopolies. In the future world of artificial intelligence, (a.k.a. the super AI world) we will see an entirely new world built from the consolidation of artificial intelligence services.

personalfinance,"(US) Options for loans to consolidate home improvement payments (windows, roof)","Hi all.  Long-time reader, first-time poster, and I like this helpful community. My family recently replaced the windows of our house which were in such bad shape that as an expediency measure we went with financing from the window company at a sucky 9.99% interest to get them installed ASAP.  We own the property outright (no mortgage, liens or anything else), assessed value $225k, AGI $85k, and I am looking into loan options to pay off the windows immediately and have a lower interest rate. We also need a new roof, so I am looking for options that give a lump sum to pay both.

Windows were about $27k, a roof will be on the order of $20k, so I am estimating a need of ~$50k loan. I have read that it's a terrible idea to use a house as a credit card to pay for things (a la the mortgage crisis), but possible exceptions include home improvements that increase home value/structural integrity.

We have excellent credit, no debt, stable employment, and are not worried about being able to pay the loan off or losing the house in an emergency. We also have a second property (land only, $120k assessed value) that could be used to guarantee the loan instead as a safeguard if that's needed.

So my question is, what types of financing are available for something like this? Home equity loan? Home equity line of credit? Second mortgage? Construction loan?  FHA 203k? It seems one of these options should at least give us a lower interest rate than 9.99%, and we would check with our credit union that has historically been awesome at loans (car loans at 1%!).  I have been reading about options but figured I should ask here in case anyone has any particular experience or advice regarding home upkeep.

&gt; The United States has a problem: not enough inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; That notion is a bit of a head-scratcher. Most people don’t like inflation. They would prefer that a dollar tomorrow be worth the same as a dollar today.
&gt; 
&gt; But a recent drop in inflation may be a sign of fresh economic weakness and is perplexing to Federal Reserve officials who are now wrapping up the central bank’s stimulus campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; The Federal Reserve thinks modest inflation has important economic benefits, and it has aimed since 2012 to keep prices rising at an annual pace of 2 percent. The problem is that the Fed is on track to fail for the sixth straight year. Inflation has been stubbornly sluggish.

&gt; The Federal Reserve on Friday finalized a new rule that should make it easier to wind down systematically important U.S. banks by creating a safe harbor for financial contracts after a firm defaults.

&gt; **The decision, unanimously approved by Fed board members, forms part of global post-crisis efforts to end ‘too big to fail’ institutions that are so large and complex they could endanger the entire financial system if they fall into bankruptcy.**
&gt; 
&gt; The rule requires global systematically important banks (GSIBs) to amend the language in common financial contracts so they cannot be immediately canceled if the firm enters bankruptcy.

&gt; By imposing new legal protections, regulators aim to prevent a run on a GSIB’s subsidiaries that could be triggered if a large number of counterparties rush to terminate their contracts, as occurred in the case of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

gaming,Idea for a new video game,"Last night, I've been looking at the best video game developers and going through a history of developing my critiques, tastes, and preferences in entertainment, such as video games, anime, movies, etc. As I was skimming through, I was glaring through potential companies that had a good track record and was leaning towards Relic entertainment (Warhammer 40k, Homeworld, and Company of Heroes) and Insomniac (Ratchet and Clank, Resistance, and Spider-Man 2017) due to how they're open to new ideas.

Before we start off, I wanted to say that I am a 19 year old college student that plans on majoring in Engineering some day, since I have a lot to catch up with in terms of my skills. However, my advisor for scheduling classes said that I can try and minor in computer science if given the chance, but I'm still testing the waters a bit. That aside, let's start off by saying that my head to the brim is filled with new ideas on trying to make the world a better place and I stay up almost all night just thinking about them. I have ideas of snowcapped mountainsides with mixtures of Norse and Mayan architecture, xenomorph-like Beelzebubs with protruding tongues with talking snakes, the Iron winged Dogs from Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII but with iron teeth and horns, etc. 

For some, these ideas may seem crazy and there's no doubt about it. But my favorite games tend to be Silent Hill, Shin Megami Tensei, Fallout, Dead Space, Castlevania, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy VI, etc. so go figure. 

As per the idea for a new video game, I've been looking into the idea of making hybrid games much like Dark Souls did, and I've been looking into some old, obscure games like Gundam Vs. Zeta Gundam for the PS2, Mechwarrior 4, Nier, Shadow Hearts Covenant, Suikoden V, etc. etc. and looked deeply into the insight of the video game industry and the importance of innovation and came to the foregone conclusion that the aforementioned Insomniac and Relic entertainment, although it may sound impossible, would make a great game if given the chance. 

The premise of this new game I thought about would mainly be a Sci-fi space opera with some cues taken from cyberpunk and mechs. The story would take some influence from Zeta Gundam, in the sense of how the Federation is corrupt by using Guerilla warfare. However, a couple of points I'd like to address is how your actions can change the war in drastic terms, the amount of ways you can play the game (meaning that there isn't just one way to play it), and how you can customize your character and mech like in Armored Core, especially for the latter so to speak since the former isn't really much of an option. It may also be influenced by Obsidian's way of storytelling, since the decision you think is right wouldn't exactly be the right one, as per the multiple endings and factions in Fallout New Vegas.

In regards of choice and replay value, there are many ways to play the game. You can go guns blazing, use melee weapons, or destabilize your opponents' mechs with specific weapons so you wouldn't have to kill them, along with the fact that the game can be played in either first or third-person mode, which adds to the substance of the game. For the strategy/RPG component, while you wouldn't exactly level up your character, you can level up and or improve your mech, and there would be instances where you can engage in important relationships with the characters in the story. Plus, you can also command your own squad and climb up the ranks of the military, which also leads me to mention how there would be a cycle for commands like in SOCOM 3, so it wouldn't be overly complicated and how you can choose your own branch like in the System Shock 2 training course.

As for gameplay and combat per se, I can imagine the combat with other mechs to work in the same fashion as Dark Souls, though the AI may also be opted to retreat or surrender if the odds are against them or if they've lost too many casualties. There may also be instances where you would fight mechs that would be twice, thrice, or ten times your size like the Psycho Gundam! Battles can and would be taken either on space colonies, planets, in space, or even sortied, meaning that an invasion could happen at any time. But don't worry, it wouldn't be in a hub or a safe zone if that makes sense.

Different game modes may also be created to appeal to a multitude of audiences such as:

Hardcore mode, realistic saving - Think Mount and Blade saving meets Fallout New Vegas hardcore mode. The difficulty spikes are anted up and you also have to be careful with decision making since every decision is permanent like in Dark Souls so it'll save automatically every now and then. Special units and characters may also be killed permanently, rather than injured like in Fire Emblem. 

Hardcore mode, exit without saving - Can save at any time at your own leisure, but the difficulty would remain the same.

No hardcore mode, realistic saving - Basically Dark Souls in an ironic and non-ironic way.

No harcore mode, exit without saving - The most basic and accessible difficulty.

This just goes to show that difficulty isn't limited to a spike in the enemy's health or the damage you and or the enemy can take.

As for what gaming console would work best, most likely PS4 and or PC if this comes to reality. A multiplayer mode may also work, but I'm not sure yet.",technology
personalfinance,"My credit score dropped rapidly due to a student loan I thought was being paid going into collections. Debt really freaks me out and I have a lot of it from school. Please help me figure out the best way to tackle this? (23, USA)","I feel like an idiot. Debt really stresses me out and I got myself into a stupid situation because of school. I put my last 2 classes of my degree on my credit card because I had no other way to pay and now I am having a hard time getting out from under the debt. My card is almost maxed out and it's making me crazy. I've never used it for anything besides emergencies (car repair the day before pay day and paid off immediately, etc) and these stupid classes. I'm the first person in my family to go to college and I make more money than both my parents and all my friends have help from their parents and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

My credit score is 610. I've had no idea why it's going down because it was in the mid 700s before, but I just checked my credit tracker app and I have 7 notifications that a loan from a school I went to for one quarter is 90+ days delinquent. I was under the impression that this was rolled into my federal loans paid through Navient. I've never been contact by them before and I'm freaking out. I left the school a voicemail and I'll call again on Tuesday when they're open, but it's destroying my credit and I have no idea what I owe them (it's no more than the $5,550 mentioned below and probably closer to $2,000) and I want to get it paid off as soon as possible.

I really don't like not having my card for emergencies. My limit is $7,500. I recently got a bump in salary from $34k to $50k so I wasn't able to pay it significantly until now. Should I tackle the credit card debt first or keep paying the minimum until I pay off the student loan that's in collections? Should I stop putting money in savings and put every penny towards CC debt? How do I make a budget and stick to it?

personalfinance,(AUS) 20 Year old male with no idea how to deal with my finances but want to get on top of it.,"I'll start by saying thank you in advance for any replies and advice I get here. I will do a TLDR at the end for those not wanting to read through a wall of text.

About my job:

I currently work at the same company that I have for 5 years now. My higher up's have made it very clear that they want me to stay with the company and have invested time and money to train me for more responsibilities. I am on a full time contract currently and there have been talks of putting me on salary.

My finances:

My current contract gets me $790 take home (after tax). I have a car loan (yes I realise it may not have been the wisest decision. A secondary reason for doing this was to get a good credit rating for potential home loans etc. in the future) that is a fixed rate of $155 a fortnight that i will be paying for 3 more years. 

I also have a HELP (Higher Education Loan Program, I.E. Uni loan from the government) debt of $11,808. I went to uni for a year and a half before deciding it wasn't for me and left before finishing my degree. This government loan has a 1.5%P.A. interest rate so it is currently accruing ~$200 a year on interest.

I currently live with my parents and pay them $60 a week as board which they provide everything I need for me. If I add up all of my 'bills' such as netflix, phone, car loan, insurance, etc (not fuel or food). Then I am currently paying ~$125 a week.

Now the good news about my finances. I have saved $12,000 dollars whilst living at home and living a very frivolous lifestyle. In my mind this has basically been my emergency fund (haven't really needed to dip into it yet thank god).

The situation:
I now want to move on with my life as an adult and move out from home to gain some independence and privacy. I do have people wanting to move out with me which would help alleviate costs. From what little I know I can't see why I wouldn't be able to afford to do this but I am so inexperienced I am worried about unforeseen costs that will shoot me in the foot.

My main question for this whole post is how can I best use the money I have saved up/money I will save in the future to most efficiently benefit me. Should I pay off my HELP debt? Should I invest? Should I keep it there to spend a little on moving out and then leave the majority as a safety net?


TLDR:
Am 20 years old with a seemingly stable career, a car loan, school loan and $12,000 dollars saved. Want to move out but not certain on how to efficiently spend my money.",finance

personalfinance,"M27, getting ready to buy my first flat in Stockholm with help from parents - Scary prospects","Firstly, this sub truly is a great resource for young people and I appreciate all the help I can get on this topic.

**Background:**
I'm a recent graduate (1.5yrs) working as a freelance researcher in Stockholm. I'm making a decent living and even though I don't have any formal job security, I'm fairly confident that I can at least keep a job in the event of a recession.

I have rented, stayed on friends' couches, and with roommates, for the past 7 years and I am getting tired of not being able to live in one place for longer than a year at a time. I don't want to come off as a weak-minded person but I'm frankly getting sick and tired of moving around and not being able to think straight because of the constant change in environments and co-habitants. That's why I've decided to buy a flat with the help of my parents. 

**Housing market:**
The inner-city housing market here has gone crazy in the past couple of years to the point where many analysts fear a looming bubble burst. UBS ranked Stockholm #3 for bubble risk in its [2016 Global Real Estate Bubble Index](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/chief-investment-office/features/global-real-estate-bubble-index.html). 

Nonetheless, at current prices and interest rate levels it makes sense to buy a flat as opposed to renting. I've been using [this tool](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0) from NY Times to make my calculations (see below).

**The flat and financing:**
The plan is to buy a one bedroom flat in one of the better neighbourhoods in the city at around $420k with a 25% down-payment ($105k).

This will deplete all my savings, but all else equal, I should be able to save up an initial rainy day fund within 6 months.

I have calculated that even if interest rates go up from the current 1.5% to 7%, I will be able to make ends meet on a strict budget.

I plan to live there for at least three years, and hopefully share with a future girlfriend.

**Calculations:**

I've enclosed the calculations I have made for the purchase [here ](https://imgur.com/a/MoTdi),and even accounting for a potential 1% annual decrease in housing prices, it still makes more sense to buy. It would cost me around $1500/mo to rent a similar flat in the same area - $150 above the 'buying threshold' from the calculator.

**Alternatives:**

Using the above calculator it could still make sense to rent if I can find a similar object for another one or two years. I would have to change my mindset about the frequent moving around and the associated hassle and worry. And I could miss out on some potential gains if the market proves to remain stable or even go up. I do value peace of mind, but I'm aware that a drop in housing prices and an increase in interest rates would be tough to swallow.

**Verdict:**
Am I going crazy?

**TLDR;**
I'm a first-time home buyer and I'm afraid that I'm embarking on a risky investment.",finance

investing,"Salesforce is trading at over 370 times earning. Unlike companies like Google, they are not monopoly of their industry with only around 20% market share in the crm market. What should I be careful about shorting it?","Edit 2: This post was flair as a discussion right from the start, and I am glad the community raised some thoughtful points. Some of the points raised here are relevant considerations for someone thinking of shorting any popular tech company that seem largely overvalued. I have summary some great feedback redditors have for easy reference. Its over 65 comments so pardon me if I missed out some!

Warning about shorting SF:

1. SF is a great platform for innovative solution, leader in the industry, with high switching cost to customers.
2. Other than CRM, it has acquisitions that includes Heroku. This give SF as a whole more potential for future growth.
3. Shorting should be for professional, not retail investors since downside is unlimited. 
4. You need some catalyst to short, right now, people are optimistic about the company. 

Points that make me ponder

1. Yes, downside is unlimited. But given current valuation, would it be much more likely the market price in at double the valuation or much lower than the valuation the next few years given a likely deteriorating environment for stock(E.g. Raising Interest rate)

2. Companies like FANG Stock, Tencent, Alibaba are all innovating and venturing to new fields, how does SF valuation compare to them?

3. With almost 20 years in the business, how much more market share would SF capture? 

Overall the discussion make me realised shorting is more risky than I thought. Thanks for the feedback!



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit 1: Hi guys, thanks for the raising several points. Thought I can add in more here. To be clear, I have not shorted the stock yet. Reason is that the market seem to be still very optimistic about the company, and I am unsure of its growth potential at this point. 

However, SF current market cap is around 64 billion. How big is the US CRM market and what proportion of it could SF likely capture given the competition from other players? What is its advantage against Microsoft and other business? I think these are question I am still looking for an adequate answer. 

Of course SF is an outstanding company, but the news I read seem to be focus on its potential for growth. Also SF market share in the CRM market did not seem to increase significantly over other players. 

Previous I studied Netflix for a few months and finally decided against shorting it. Although it has a very high P/E ratio, I dun see another player that come close to Netflix in terms of content for a on-demand tv. Also, a 10-20 percent increase in subscribers(there has been steady increase) would drastically reduce its P/E ratio since most of its cost is in generating content for its platform (Which in a way give it an edge over other players trying to enter the market.) So far, I have not see similar sign in SF business that would deter me from shorting it.

Not plans to short yet, but certainly looking deeper.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancers Friendly to Foreign Employers,"I'm in a pretty weird pickle right now.

Income: $250k-$275k per year

Credit Card Debt: $0

Savings: Approx $100k

Student Loans: $204k through SoFi at around 4.5% interest. 6-7 years left on repayment.

Credit Score: Around 815 according to Equifax.

I recently took a job abroad with a foreign employer (at the income level above) and I tried refinancing my loans through SoFi. They offered me a 2.85% interest (WIN!), but then later rejected me because the source of my income is foreign (even though I'm on a permanent contract, way more stable than your typical US at-will employment arrangement). 

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm in the process of appealing the decision with SoFi because they're acting dumb. I currently ALREADY indebted to them (I've borrowed from them since 2013-2014); I've never missed a payment, and I've taken personal loans that I've since paid completely in full 24-36 months ahead of schedule. Needless to say, I'm a stellar borrower. I argued that, from a risk perspective, they should WANT me to refinance at a lower rate because I ultimately am on the hook for less money. In other words, if I'm already making payments to them at 4.5% interest, surely it would lower their risk exposure if I had to make lower payments to them because of a lower interest rate (of course, cynically, they probably like the 4.5% interest because it's more profitable, but they're framing this as a risk thing).

1) I could refinance with another lender, but I don't know which bank/lender is generally open to refinancing student loans for someone with foreign income. Any suggestions?

2) Any other suggestions? I'm pretty upset about this.

personalfinance,Can you give me some guidance on whether a cash out mortgage re-fi vs a consolidation loan makes sense?,"My wife and I are looking to refinance our student loans since the interest rates are high (&gt;6%) and we're on graduated repayment plans, so we're not making much headaway against the principal and payments will be going up soon. We have about $35k in student loans total and they're all federal subsidized. We also have about $100k left on our mortgage (30yr/4.25% on a $187k house). Our current monthly payments are around $800/mo for the mortgage and $170/mo for student loans.

The two options we have been talking through are to refinance the house, but get cash back to clear out the student loans or get a consolidation loan for the student loans as well as refinance the house.

Looking around, I think we can get a new 30 year mortgage with the cash back at about 3.75-4%, so around $640/mo. This is an extra $330/mo (which is awesome!) vs what we pay today. I'm worried this will be complicated to set up getting cash back with the bank though.

Consolidation loans look like a 10-yr loan with 4.5%, which would be $360/mo. If we also refinance the mortgage, that would take our payment down to around $480/mo, so an extra $130/mo.

It seems like the obvious decision here is to pick one and not just keep status quo, but not sure how to make the choice. The whole house refi is nice and provides a lower monthly payment, but is also a longer payback period.

personalfinance,My spouse is $30k in credit card debt. What can I do to help without just paying it myself?,"UPDATE: Thanks all for responding. Sorry, I really should have prefaced more about our situation. My wife herself is reluctant for me to just outright pay for her debt that was separate from me. I understand that we are together now and share it, but it has more to do with accountability and NOT shaming. That being said, it just doesn't look like she's able to realistically do this by herself due to timing of her new career. She was always part of the discussion in finding a solution. Since we're newly weds and trying to be more financially responsible we wanted to check all options before sinking lots of savings into reducing debt. I know ""just pay it"" may seem obvious, but we didn't want to skip over any other options, hence me posting on here for help.

Sorry if my initial wording of this post sounded like shaming, that's far from how I feel. I guess this post should have been more about advice on budgeting TOGETHER.


Hello PF, first time poster, be gentle!

My wife has $30,000 in credit card debt from a failed entrepreneurial endeavor. Currently, she is in her first year at starting a new career, which at the moment doesn't pay well and isn't very consistent. It just barely pays for the minimum payment each month. Unfortunately, it looks like her getting another corporate job even temporarily to pay debt, is looking unlikely for right now. 

I just started a job that pays pretty good, so I'm paying rent and various other bills to help out. I also have a lot in savings, but I'm starting the process of slowly putting it away for better use (investing, etc)

What are our options? My first idea would be for her to do a credit card consolidation service or personal loan with a lower interest rate. But her income may be a problem since she's essentially a low end freelancer. Is there a way I could co-sign or jointly use my income/credit for a better interest rate without getting myself into financial trouble?

As a last resort I'm thinking I could even just pay the lower CC ($6000) and have her pay that back separately over time, so she could focus on one payment.

TL;DR: Spouse in bad debt with low salary, but I have good money and savings. How can I help her with using little or no money of my own? Thanks!

EDIT: This is her debt incurred BEFORE getting married with some of it even before we met. Not sure if that matters now since we're now shouldering it together, but just wanted thoughts or newbie advice. I personally feel that there needs to be some financial responsibility on her end, which she agrees, but given her current income, that may be untenable. I'm willing to help pay it down, but was wondering if there's any red flags or financial tips I should be aware of before doing it. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Federal government benefit/salary question,"1. Why does the federal government advertise social security in a 3 part retirement plan: pension, tsp, and social security? Doesn't everyone get social security benefit and a tap/401k? So the only main difference is a pension? 

2. For the pension, If one earns their 3 highest avg salary in a higher COL area such as DC, then relocates to a rural town, is the payout going to be less? Also if the government gets a 2% raise, 1% inflation and 1% cost of living, does the pension go up by 1% col or 2%? Also if I move to cheaper col area how will that affect it?

3. Are all retirement/genera benefits the same for all gov? I.e sec, federal reserve bank, White House, doj, dod?

4. Could/Will federal benefit get better/match to private sector in the future? Private jobs get new born baby leave, higher 401k match, stock discounts, similar health benefits? But seems like gov benefits are not as good as before? 

5. If given the choice of 100k gov salary, with max potential of 140-150k (gs-14/15) or 110k-150k gov contractor with max potential of 200k.. which one would you take? Assuming in late 20s. Will late 50 self regret leaving gov or not taking excess money and investing it? 

Will this change your mind if partner is in private and will make $100-200k+ around your max potential?",finance
Ripple,Commonly asked Questions with Answers about Ripple.,"**This is for newcomers, Veterans investors or people who know about ripple will benefit zilch…. Most Likely. **


I seems to keep seeing the same posts over and over again in the ripple subreddit so I thought I would put something together with questions even I had that are already answered and a quick rundown for new investors in ripple, and new people investing in general. 


**First what is a ripple? 2. What does Ripple do? 3. How would ripple function like the internet? 4. Who’s behind ripple? 5. Is Ripple like bitcoin? 6. Does that mean ripple is bitcoin rival?7. How would ripple benefit bitcoin users? 8. How many ripple will there be?** *This was published in 2013 The plans haven’t changed its still the same plan*
https://www.coindesk.com/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-ripple/



**What if other banks develop there own coin?**
“Payment systems today are where email was in the early ‘80s. Every provider built their own system for their customers and if people used different systems they couldn’t easily interact with each other. Ripple is designed to connect different payment systems together.”



**Where can I buy Ripple?**
You have to buy it on an exchange which most require identification purposes because they are legitimate business dealing with your money. A quick google search reveals https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple/trading_exchanges 


**Where can I store ripple?**
Best answer is what level of security do you want.
You can store it on an exchange which most people see as something that can be hacked and stolen more easier than a desktop Wallet. Most secure is Cold Storage something not connected to the internet at all. You can store it on the Snano Ledger or a computer not connected to the internet at all. Almost all of this can be searched on google https://coinsutra.com/best-ripple-xrp-wallets In this article it even addresses the question 


**How much will a ripple be worth?**
Short answer is do you have a crystal ball? Because nobody knows what a ripple will be worth in such and such a time. Many will talk about Market Cap https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6xo1ls/much_ado_about_marketcaps/  and some talk about Valuation. Valuation is close to what this company will go for. So the question is how much it will be worth? Besides those two you, always look to see what a company is doing to increase their market so they remain profitable. 



 Lets say you might buy into let’s say a pharmacy developing a cure for cancer at like .$10 a share because they are unlikely to find a cure but if they did you bet that $.10 share could be worth a lot more. Ripple is not a consumer product much like how Ethereum itself plans to work in the background without people knowing there using it, ripple will be similar. Sure, you might see people load ripples onto their phone so they go to; let’s say china, and buy stuff there, kinds of like a “Visa Cheque?”. If you take just that point alone you should start to see where this company is targeting.  So how would you invest in such company? You buy a ripple coin and you are “kinda of” indirectly investing in the company. 


Here is a great post on the maximum value of ripple https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6irqhs/mathematically_speaking_what_is_the_highest_price/
 Particularly 
*“Mathematically speaking...
If you assume that the max market capitalization of the currency would be the entire M2 money supply of the world.. This includes all coins and bank accounts. It does not include stock accounts and investments. While people are currently using it for speculation, I'd argue that when it reaches 100% of M2, there would be no point in speculating anymore. 
I've found a lot of conflicting numbers regarding M2 global supply, but let's assume this site is accurate:
http://inflation.us/money-supply/
$68.7T would be the highest theoretical market cap. The current market cap is $11B. This would give a highest theoretical price of $1,749. Keep in mind, this would mean every transaction across the world would be done via ripple. You'd pay your bills, buy your groceries, pay parking, etc all in ripple. It'll never happen, but that is my theoretical high.”*


Also take into consideration that the above is Market Cap and Does not account for Valuation of the company. The Jist of it is that everyone is using it as a global currency (“which would be huge”) but it has not value. So imagine everyone having to use a system but there is only 100billion coins on a world scale this would be in short supply so the price has to go up
. 

**Economics 101**
Market Cap? 
For those still not getting it; if there is a 100 people in a city and they have to use only 10 coins for transaction then those coins market cap would be $10 dollars approximately because if I wanted let say buy an apple and the person only accept these coins then I would have to own at least $.50 cents of that coin to buy said apple regardless if I find value in that coin or not. 


Valuation and investments 
Lets assume in the same city that somebody wants to be rich from this very weak system that only can trade with this coin. Then they could get ahold of 5 coins and hold it in a safe. Now there is only 5 in circulation for 100 people to use now the coin is worth double because you took out half the market. Now it is worth $20 dollars but that rich guy now wants to cash out so he sells 3 of the coins. Now because there is more in circulation it’s worth less. 


The same thing happens with daily trading except millions are bought hold then when the price is right they sell. 


**Sell Walls and Buy Walls and Whales.** 


Some exchanges you can see ripple buy and sell walls All it means that someone has put out an order to sell ripple at X amount of dollars let’s use some reasonable numbers. Big investors buy .20 cents lets say they spend 100 000 000 million and they all wants to sell at .25 cents. That’s a 25% increase. That would be increase of 25 million dollars. So the in order to break that sell wall there would have to buy orders of over 125 million to increase the price So lets say those investors got it wrong when they sold there was 250million dollars’ worth of buy orders at .25 cents if they wanted to get back in the game they would be salty for sure because they would have to invest the 25million they made to continue making more money at the same precentage. And that is the game you see on day to day. Once prices start hitting higher the gains are small it might go from $1.10 to $1.12 in a day that’s only 11% increase you stop seeing this behavior of 100 mill to maybe $50 mill. And so for and so on these types of day traders are called whales because of the large numbers. You may even see posts of people putting buys and sell orders to intimidate other large whales. But for the long term investor it is irrelevant because you see Value in the company and could buy in at .20 and see it go to .15 and hold because you know the company will do well regardless of what lots people will say, always buy in the dips and hold onto what you got as the saying goes.
Swift and Swell.
Ripple is also targeting at replacing SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)  with Swell, which is happening in Toronto on Oct 16 with two big names coming there. This is a post  https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6vw8vt/weak_hands_tend_to_have_the_loudest_mouths/ from someone who talks about the lead up which brought the price to .27 to when it fell back down. There was hype which brought the price up from $.15 to .27 almost complete double of price just from a few tweets to banks. I’ve also read people complaining about how these people the two main speakers (Dr. Ben Bernanke and Sir Tim Berners-Lee)are just paid, There is post addressing it that ripple is not just paying for their names, they are paying for their industry contacts. It always works about who knows who. If knew someone who sat as the Chairman of the The Federal Reserve System from 2006 to 2014  during the economic crisis in America and they gave there nod of approval you bet you would take it as serious business. Of course they could just be talking about blockchains and how it could change how change finance and even that is a benefit. It will be noted that Bernanke term was not without some dumb business calls but he is only human like the rest of us and there was no “Great Depression”  just a recession. Bernanke should he have seen the collapse coming but that is another topic. Also at the conference they will be discussing how the trailing went for banks. Which is big news banks talking to ther banks.


**How much to Invest?**


In all fairness lots people come here asking how much should I invest?
Best answer is nothing more than you can afford to loose. Even if you only invest $100 and it becomes becomes $200 then you have been an extremely successful investor. Sure you would like to see that $100 dollars become $50k but that’s not successful that is extremely lucky. Even those that bought bitcoin for nothing and now are selling for millions it could have easily gone the other way nobody was to know what time, and hard work would tell. Ripple is only around because of what Bitcoin started. 
Ripple is different from Other Blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero) The run down on this is that it has 100billion coins no mining. Its not private so no ties to illegal activities such as “Drugs, Human trafficking and Sex Trade”  

**Other Stuff**
Lastly The most promising news I came across is: Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years. https://hackernoon.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-important-invention-in-the-last-500-years-c90b0151c169 If you read this you might start to understand why some people talk about Ripple being like Amazon, huge potential and huge Growth, but nobody knows for sure.

I have revived a $10,000 scholarship from the company I intern for and want to make sure I am using it wisely. I have also revived a surprise grant from financial aid for almost $5,000. So that's about $15,000 towards paying off my debt.

I have two private loans adding to $50,000 and multiple federal loans for 18,000. This includes interest, my full loan break down is [here](https://m.imgur.com/a/eAzzu) .

personalfinance,Investing for IBR Tax Bomb at Forgiveness,"I've been running a few numbers on how to handle federal student loans when under an income based repayment plan.  I'd like to know if I'm correct in my thinking.

Say a person has $60k in loans, at 7%, and is under an IBR where they only need to pay $100/mo based on their income.  Interest is going to be $4.2k per year, but since it never capitalizes, it just simply accrues and doesn't compound (one of the benefits of IBR).  In other words, the balance is going to grow by $3k per year ($4.2k minus IBR payments).

Let's assume income remains the same, so that IBR payments are the same.  After 25 years (300 months), the balance on this loan will be $135k ( (60000 * .07/12-100) * 300+60000), with the lendee having paid $30,000 (300*100) in monthly payments. This balance will be forgiven, but it will be treated as income  and taxed as such (hence the tax bomb).  Assuming a tax rate of 30%, this will be $40.5k.

I am thinking the lendee could invest ~9k in an S&amp;P500 index fund within the first year or two of repayment (edit:  in an IRA so that dividends or gains don't increase AGI ), and assuming 7% average compound growth over 25 years, this would grow to $47.6k and cover the tax bomb (plus some 15% capital gains taxes upon selling the fund).

Does this all make sense?  Assuming the lendee doesn't lose IBR status, and the government doesn't drop loan forgiveness, would this be a wise strategy to follow?",finance

Currently I work as a nursing assistant at a hospital with good pay and insurance, and they will pay $10,000-$16,000 towards my loans over two years if I sign a contract with them agreeing to work there for that amount of time.

Manufactured home - 170k purchase price, Rent $1300 including water. Built in 1997, Great condition. 
     - 90k down payment, 20 years fixed rate of 5.99% interest rate. Approx 2k monthly including rent+mortgage+insurance. 
Townhouse -500k, most townhouses built in 1970. 
      - 100k down payment, just ran a mortgage calculator 4% for 400k including property tax. Came out to be 2.5k total.

I feel like I'm in a bit of a special situation here, but nothing dire...

I recently switched jobs from a government contractor to a start-up. I was unemployed for three months looking for work and blew through all of my emergency fund and savings. Since I recently just started getting paid from my new job (~100k/yr, Boston, USA) I'm starting to pay off some small debt I've put on mine and my wife's credit cards. Here is the breakdown of what I accrued in three months:

**$2500 on my CC @ 10% interest**

**$1400 on my wife's CC @ 18% interest**

**$1000 from my parents (no immediate payback date, this might be a gift)**

We'll get charged interest in the beginning on October. Starting this month, I no longer need to use our credit cards since income is flowing. Though, my rate of income ($6100/mo) and my rate of monthly expenses, it could take me a few months to pay this off, and with those interest rates, it doesn't look too pretty (but not insane).  

**Here are my questions:**

1. I have about 30k in a 401k. Should I take the 10% withdraw penalty and just pay off those CCs? I was thinking that if it came to it, just borrow $5500 for the debts above.

2. I can sign up for an American Express CC with 15 months no interest, and with a 10% interest rate. Is paying off CCs with another CC a bad move? I would probably pay these debts down in ~4 months naturally.

- Live frugally, but not as a I should.
- $0 in savings, and $0 in an emergency fund.

personalfinance,[Debt]Looking for advice on dealing with debt,"Hello all. My wife and I have about $40,000 worth of credit card/auto loan/student loan debt. Most of that came from when we were both young and dumb and didn't make much money. Now, we're in a much better financial situation and are looking at ways to deal with all of that.

We currently make enough money to make payments on everything we owe. We pay more than the minimum, but not by a whole lot. We  don't really have enough to put into savings. My wife pays into a state pension so we are pretty happy with that. I am a federal employee putting money into a Thrift Savings Plan. I know the hard and fast rule is to not touch retirement, so I'm not looking at that.

What I am looking for is ways for us to pay down our debt quickly. I'm considering refinancing our home to pull that out and pay off as much as possible. We owe about $123k and our home is worth around $146k. It looks like, just based on the calculator I looked at, we'd be able to keep around the same or even lower our monthly payment. 

What I'm really looking to do is pay off all our credit/student debt as quickly as possible. That should free up about $1k per month that we can start putting either into retirement or back into the home to replace the equity we would take out as quick as possible. 

We are both much more responsible now and aren't looking to free up credit just so that we can spend it again. Is this a smart way to go about it or should we be looking at something else?",finance

Long time reader here, thanks for advice to help me get my finances in check.  Using recommendations from here, I was able to refinance 25k in private student loans at up to 13.5% into one loan at 6%. Still a bit higher than I'd like, but a good step.

Now I'm at a point where buying something near end of the year is feasible, I think. Asking for your thoughts/advice in my spot.

28 years, making 44k. Mid year and end of year bonuses that keep going up the longer I'm at my company. This years was 4k for Midyear and I would think at least $5,500. for end of year Bonus. 

Total year earnings of roughly 50-54k.  As well as a raise for next years salary &amp; Bonuses
Raise from year 1 to 2 was $4,500.00
Mid &amp; End year bonus year 1 is $1,000 &amp; $2,500
Mid &amp; End year bonus year 2 is $4,000 &amp; TBA

I've got about 8k in the bank now, and at end of the year I will have about 12-13k, if I live how I have been.

Is is a better choice to put money down on current student loans (about 35k) or think about putting money into a 1br/2br Condo, assuming a good price (130k or so) &amp; Interest rate?  Credit came back is 811 after my refinance, so rate is not the biggest concern.

I currently live with a roommate to split costs, but really want to start working on getting equity.

Also have car payment for next 2 years of 329.

I make roughly $750 every two weeks which is after my insurance, 401k, Roth IRA and taxes are taken out. My rent is $362.50 and utilities end up being around $40 a month. 

I'm trying to budget and return to living with in my means ideally with in a year or two (which can be considered extreme but I need to get out from under this debt before it gets worse). I do not have a savings account and have always been terrible at saving any amount of money. I'm used to eating cheaply and take good care of myself. I try to take the bus to most far distances but can't avoid it at times. 

If anyone has any basic tips on budgeting and paying all of this off with in my ideal timeline or anything that would be most appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance to get rid of PMI?,"Background:
Purchased in 2009 for $210k
Appraised at $240ish
Financed $190k (30y fixed) 
Current rate is about 4.7%
Currently Owe about $167k

We've paid extra every month, so we are below the PMI threshold, but they won't drop it until when the amortization schedule says we should be below unless we petition it. This requires an Appraisal.

According to Zillow the value of the house should be back in the 200 range...

1) if the appraisal didn't mean anything when I got the loan, why is it needed to drop the PMI?

2) If I refinance the balance, what do they compare against to determine if I need PMI? The appraisal didn't determine getting out of PMI the first go around why is it OK now? If they just use the original sale price, what's the purpose of the appraisal?

My big fear is that I go through all this, pay for an appraisal, and end up right back where I started... Well I should be able to improve my interest rate anyway.

3) What happens if they appraise it at $170 for example? Would they refinance and slap me with 15 more years of PMI?

What's my best option?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for critiques for my 5 Year Plan,"Before we get started, I'm 27, currently renting an apartment with my 23 yo girlfriend. We are both self - employed. Looking to get married in the next year or so. 
I don't have much debt and none of it is currently accruing interest I just want to get it taken care of. She has no debt.

Because I'm young I think it makes more sense to start other potentially better yielding, long term investment strategies before maxing out my IRAs every year as soon as they are opened. I only list it as a primary goal once so I have experience with it. 

The goals listed are minimum goals for the next 5 years. Additional goals are listed after in case I reach my primary goals early.
Buying property is a long term goal but not necessarily in our 5 year plan so it is listed consistently under additional goals.

I don't make a ton of money so all my goals are around $2,000/month potentially split between two people. 

The general order of importance is savings, retirement, ETFs and bonds, then individual stocks and mutual funds.

Interested to hear your ideas. 

5 Year Plan

Debts: Don't worry about investing until you are no longer in debt. 
-Alyse for AT [$2,000]
-Other debts [$1,600]

Savings: $10,000 in online savings account, which generally offer better interest rates than other savings accounts. Use bank for checking only. [Liquid, low risk, low payoff] 

CDs: no risk, interest accrues at a fixed amount, cannot be touched for a set amount of time. [Not Liquid, low risk, higher payoff] 

Investment Accounts: more risk in short term but can accrue higher interest rates than a savings account and CDs in the long run.
[Liquid, but better to have for long term, higher risk, higher potential payoff] 

First goal = $14,000 to pay off debts and to create emergency fund

personalfinance,I'm considering using a 401k distribution to radically jump start some more responsible budgeting/spending.,"**The numbers**:

1. 40k of debt scattered across a number of a number of cards, half of which are in fairly high interest rates.

1. 36 years old, married, filing jointly.

1. 2016 income was 145k, of which ~ 101k was taxable.  This year should be approx 155k gross.

1. 150k in an old 401(k) and no restrictions on withdrawls.

1. No other savings.  All other equity is locked up in single family home.

**Theory**:
I have two kids, one of which will be in college in 5 years.  After a decade of lackluster planning, half-hearted saving, and a complete lack of budgeting, I realize I have to make some serious adult decisions.  I am capable of making a permanent change.  


**Plan**:
Take a 401k distribution and pay off a large amount of the unsecured debt.  I realize this is long-term affecting my retirement potential, but a cash infusion to pay down debt is going to free up hundreds of dollars monthly in interest/cc bills that i can use to snowball/avalanche remaining debt.  This will all be a jump start to a very permanent change in my spending habits.  This would probably have to be in the 40-50k range in order to stay under the next tax bracket but still have enough pay down power after the typical 10% withdrawl fee and withholdings.

**Concerns**:

1. Going into the next (28%) tax bracket and screwing myself next year
2. I'm okay with hurting my long-term plans because I expect to have stable, increasing income and can earn my way back to a healthy retirement.  I just don't want to cripple myself for the sake of a weak jump start.

Is this just a horribly stupid idea?  I personally feel like this is also partially symbolic and mentally a way to shift into a more serious mode of spending. I make more than enough income in order to dig my way back out of debt.  Am I fooling myself?",finance
personalfinance,5 year Roth distribution rule for conversion question.,"I have been contributing to a Roth IRA through both backdoor (5.5k) and mega backdoor (27k via after-tax 401k).

I'm in the process of buying a second residence and I'm running through various scenarios with different cash down (15% vs 20%) and their respective interest rate.

One of my simulation entails taking money from the Roth IRA that is entirely funded via (mega)backdoor conversions. I only plan to take out the contributions and not the earnings.

I realize that I can withdraw the contributions tax free because I won't be touching the earnings but I'm confused by the 10% penalty and 5 year rule. Does this apply to conversions? Will I incur a 10% penalty on contribution withdrawals since they are conversions from non-tax exempt IRA and after-tax 401k?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, ye had one job. Strict monetary policy.","Bitcoin is already in more trouble than people for some reason are admitting. Bitcoin Cash is the most damaging attack on Bitcoin to date, and people simply are not acknowledging that fact (most Bitcoiners anyway).
Adam Back says on Twitter, Segwit2x ""may"" subject the 5k Bitcoin price to ""cancellation"" if enacted. What makes no sense to some of us is why BCH does not do this already. In fact I think it will unless it is completely and permanently defeated.
Right now Bitcoin's mining power is split and chasing 42 million bitcoins! This is a complete violation of Bitcoin's core value proposition, that the hash power will protect strict monetary policy. It has failed to do that.
I bought my first bitcoins coming into the MtGox bubble in November 2013, at bubble prices. I lost those in MtGox bankruptcy and bought more. I remained faithful to Bitcoin through all of 2014, 2015, 2016 and most of this year. But I finally gave in and sold at 2700 before the BCH fork.
I've missed out on BCH, and giant BTC price gains since I sold.
But damn. Strict monetary policy is just gone. I don't know if or when I will ever buy what crypto again. I love what they can do.
But Bitcoin... ye had one job. And you blew it!
I think there's a fair chance the total BTC/BCH price will fall back through my sell level again.
Not sure I will want it, though.

*edit*

Including my final response here.

""Your sell was probably a mistake""

Yes. Yes it was. When I made it I believed in it but I got burned and lost half my bitcoin value. I wouldn't have done that on purpose. I thought Bitcoin was really broken this time. Market is telling me it's not.
Now people are saying it's headed only up from here. Well, clearly being a bear since 2700 was a fail on my part.

But I'm damned if I'll buy back in right now. Every instinct I have (except my experience with cryptos!) tells me to stay away since I already triggered my tax event, until the market settles. Pay my taxes (I don't even know how bad that's gonna be) and take a look next year.

Maybe I'll be looking at all the cryptos twice what they are today. And MtGox wondering what to do with 2 billion dollars in a half-billion dollar bankruptcy.

I admit I'm not a bear anymore, just got burned by something bigger than I could understand.

My girlfriend uses Regions. And they charge her a fine every month to have an account. It's not large, $5 or something. I believe they also charge a low balance fine for the same type of account. Small fines like this are a turn off for me. I will not use a bank that charges me for using them. This seems like a bad business strategy due to the fact that there are plenty of banks that provide the same/better/more basic services for free. I see no reason for someone to open /keep a preexisting account at a place that charges for its services. It seems like a waste of money for the average person. What am I missing?

I have a few questions:


- What happens if I have a card with a company that is going out of business? When they eventually close the account (should be within a few months), will I lose all of the positive effects it has on my credit score; i.e. transaction history, credit line, on time payment history etc. Should I expect any negative effects from the account closure?


- One of my credit card companies has me set at what I believe to be a low credit line, considering factors such as income, age of account, on time payment history, card utilization, etc. I have a checking account and 4 investment accounts with this same company as well. They have not increased my credit line in about a year now, and say there is no set schedule for account review - it's ""random."" Is there anything I can do here, aside from prompting the request myself which would result in a hard inquiry to the bureau?


- Do you have any other tips to improve credit score that would have fairly quick results?


- About what score is sufficient when it comes to getting a loan approved for a home? I believe our maximum need would be about 250k after a sizable down-payment. I've read that 750+ will bring in the lowest interest rates, but how accurate is that? What if you're slightly above or below - is there much of a difference?

I wasn't making anything &amp; was living off credit cards and loans. Also, I was engaged and well.. that got broken off for good reasons. Part of that was me not feeling comfortable living a life I couldn't afford. I was spending trying to keep up with a life that I didn't earn yet and it created many bad habits I'm starting to tackle.

I'm comfortable spending $5350 a month to tackle debt. I'm allocating an additional $1230 a month to debts. Also, I've started selling items on ebay, got a roomate, cut spending money eating out, going to pause dating, etc.

I've calculated by paying the lowest balance and snowballing I would payoff this off in March of 2019. I'm going to also try to lower my spending to $3750 to free up another $400 dollars to go torwards debts. So about an avg of $1630. That would get me paid off by November 2018. (My goal)

But what else could I do? I would consolidate but I don't want to lose my credit history. I've never tried calling to lower my interest rate. Would that be an option?

--------------------------------------------------------
Dear Mr. Quattroman:
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding net-neutrality and internet freedom. I always appreciate hearing from my constituents back home as it helps me better serve you in the 115th Congress.

Since its inception, the Internet has been used to transform telecommunications and has led to groundbreaking developments and innovations. Keeping the internet free of government control has allowed it to thrive and prosper in unimaginable ways. Unfortunately, as you may know, in 2015 the FCC reclassified the internet as a public utility which subjected it to further government regulation. Recently however, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has indicated support for repealing some of those regulations.

Rest assured I fully support keeping the internet free of regulation, taxation, and needless federal intrusion. It is paramount that we keep the Internet independent so that we don’t stifle progress and hurt future ingenuity. Know that I share many of your concerns and continue to be a strong supporter of a free and open internet. While I am not a member of the committees with direct jurisdiction over issues surrounding the Internet, please know that I will keep your thoughts in mind.

Again, thank you for contacting me. Please do not hesitate to do so in the future, should you have any other questions or concerns. I encourage you to sign up for my e-newsletter by visiting my website at www.mariodiazbalart.house.gov to receive regular updates.

personalfinance,Need help figuring out - pay now or pay later?,"In med school, living almost entirely off of federal loans at 6% fixed for the life of the loan.  Getting private loans at a lower interest is not something I want to do.  
  
I am wanting to look into getting invisalign-style braces (the clear retainer kind) and I don't know how to figure out if it would be better for me to put them on a payment plan with the company and mitigate some of the interest gained (but pay more overall) or pay one lump sum.  
  
I know it's probably a simple calculation, but I've always been confused since there are different frequencies of compounding, etc.
  
  
Option 1: $1,850 lump sum (maybe plus tax I assume?)
Option 2: $95/month for 24 months
  
Obviously we can't guarantee what the loan rates will be for the next 24 months since I take out loans each year and the rates can change, but let's just assume they stick at 6%.  Or maybe someone can see if the financial decision changes at 5 or 7%.

But IRS.gov says that since my LLC has only a single member, it is not eligible for its own taxpayer ID; it says that earnings should be filed under the single member’s social security number.  But in this case, the single member is not an individual; it is an SDIRA that does not have a social security number.

personalfinance,Social security bank accounts?,"First off, I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question but r/AskReddit didnt really fit the question either so I apologize in advanced. 

Basically, my girlfriend told me something that she was told by someone at work and I'm really skeptical about it because it just doesn't sound real. 

So she told me there are numbers on the back od your social security card that are linked to some kind of ""federal bank account."" Essentially you can access this money in a way that you can pay off large debts such as a mortgaga, student loans or something large like that. You can't just access it and take money out and even if there's a lot of money in the account you're limited to what you can use.

Is this even a thing or just some crazy conspiracy wrapped around social security? 

To me it seemed like the only logical explanation would be its your social security value and thats what you're supposed to get in increments as social security checks but even that sounds crazy.",finance

So some background information: I just graduated this past May and make about $2,700/month after taxes and before they take out my health and dental. I currently share an apartment with my sister. My parents, sister and I originally agreed to split rent so that I pay half and my parents pay my sisters half but that agreement has not panned out the way we originally agreed and so I pay the full $961.95/month. 

I have just found out my private loans (though Wells Fargo) will run me about $1,254 per month, minimum payment. This does not include my federal loans which, depending on which plan I go with, will realistically be somewhere around $200-300 per month. I'm currently in grace period and have until November before my first payment is due and don't think I'm going to be able to pay $1400/month. 

Any advice on federal loan payment plans and/or what I can do about my private loan payments?

30,000 at 10.99%
28,000 at 7.74%

personalfinance,Private Student Loans are the Devil,"I went to school and accrued an overwhelming amount of debt. When I started taking out student loans I didn't understand the long term impact. My family was poor and I needed to pay for college so I saw it as my only option. Flash forward many many many years later and my debt is at an overwhelming amount and the repayments are literally impossible. I'm eligible for the 10 year loan forgiveness program for my federal loans because I work in non-profit, but the bulk of my loans are private (about $200,000 total) and the interest rates are awful (some at 11%). Just this month they took $2,400 from my bank account. The problem is that I make $1600 a month and my partner only makes $2,000. 

I know a solution would be to get a higher paying job but that isn't an option for me right now. I've looked at loan consolidation companies, but because of how much I'm paying for student loans, I am unable to alleviate other debt and my credit score is getting worse and worse every day. And even when I went to cosign with my father who makes $100,000 a year on paper (the bulk of it goes to medical bills for his and my mother's chronic illness which they have to pay out of pocket... pre-existing conditions, shitty insurance company, etc) I couldn't find any companies who would work with me. 

My Dad found a lawyer that says they reduce private loan debt, but they ask for a $750 fee and 18% of the overall debt. Which I know is much less, but I'm afraid it's a scam.  

Are there any other options? Or reputable agencies that work to alleviate private loan debt for people with bad credit? Or should I just turn to a life of crime/fake my own death? At this point, my options are painfully limited and I am drowning in a pretty vicious cycle. This is probably a lost cause but I'm desperate. Please help!

Edit: Some folks are questioning how I managed to accrue $200,000 in debt. In short, I was dumb and went to a private school to get an undergraduate degree in the human services field and a masters to work in higher education. Then I couldn't find a job and the debt kept growing while I wasn't able to make any payments. Finally found a job, but it doesn't pay big bucks. I am fully aware that it's my fault I'm in this situation. I do have a second job cleaning some houses when I'm not working my full time so I should have added that amount to my income- about $500 more per month. Everything that doesn't go towards paying for my necessary expenses goes to Navient. I'm even looking into getting another part time job. Basically, I just need to know if there's hope for reducing the amount so I can keep my head above water. Hope that helps clear up some questions.",finance
Bitcoin,How do I craft a good response to a non-believer?,"I took the plunge yesterday and bought my first Bitcoin from an ATM in town. Only $25 to start but I plan to buy on a regular basis from now on since my savings account hasn't moved in years.

I told my family over dinner I did something revolutionary, and my step-father scoffed and said it's dangerous as it isn't backed by anything, unlike money which is backed by gold. I responded by saying we've been off the gold standard since 1973 (US removed it in 1971, the rest of the world followed).  I sent him [this video](https://youtu.be/GNo7MDN5-0g) from Extra History, this was his response:

""Thanks. But ... Bitcoin is not a currency. It's an asset. While currencies are no longer backed by the gold standard, they are backed by something tangible: their country's economic output., made up of goods and services. Bitcoin is not only virtual, it's finite, at 21 million units. Given the very fact that its value is based on perception, it is inherently unstable. It must be. A better analogy for Bitcoin is a company's shares, of which there is usually a finite amount. The value of those shares fluctuates, sometimes wildly, according to public perception of their worth. Shares are an asset, not a currency.""

I was going to respond with this:

""Currency is defined as a system of money in general use in a particular country. Unlike shares, I can spend my bitcoin at shops in my country and/or online. That it is digital doesn't matter.

It's a tradable asset and like any other tradable asset it has volatility issues, but so do currencies backed by countries with economic output. Look at 1923 Germany, Nigeria last century and now Venezuela. I admit Bitcoin is more volatile but it's no different than any other currency that can be influenced by public perception. It is backed by economic output, it's just not centralised in one country. Instead data miners around the world are creating that value by using computer power rather than manpower. Bitcoin's market capitilsation is currently standing at USD$72 Billion.

The finite amount of Bitcoin is like any other currency too. There is a finite amount of gold and a finite amount of money in the world. However gold prices can be influenced by gold rushes which sends gold prices plummeting. Rampant money printing can cause huge inflation in local economies. On the other hand Bitcoin becomes harder to 'mine' as more miners join the network. Only 1/3 of those 21 million units have been mined and once the mining is over that Bitcoin will still exist while miners can migrate to other cryptocurrencies. I only spent USD$25 yesterday and received 0.005 of a Bitcoin. You don't have to own a whole Bitcoin to own some, just like you don't need to carry $100 notes everywhere.""

personalfinance,ALERT- New PayPal Phishing Scheme,"On mobile, so apologies if I missed any subreddit rules that this post may violate, but I didn't know where else to put this and wanted to get the word out.

I just experienced an attempted PayPal phishing scam that was pretty devious and I'd like to prevent anyone from falling victim to it. First, I got a (genuine) text with a PayPal security code. Shortly after that, I received a phone call (that turned out to be spoofed) from 402-935-XXXX (a number that is actually connected to PayPal). I answered, and an automated voice asked me for my telephone passcode/PIN.

I'm certain the goal was to obtain the telephone pin and then immediately use it to call PayPal and request assistance with a password reset. PayPal would see the genuine attempt to reset the password, they'd spoof the call to appear as though it came from the registered number, and then use the telephone PIN to convince the rep that it was a legitimate request. 

PayPal's fraud department has a log which records all contacts initiated by PayPal, which was how I learned (after changing my password and calling to report what had happened) that the text was genuine and the phone call was not. I hope we can spread the word and prevent people from getting scammed and this seemed like a good place to start since I know your subreddit's thing is helping people with money, so... hopefully this is related enough?

Side musing: after I reported the scheme, they asked me to report it to a different department that could actually alert the right people to do something about it on the PayPal side and transferred me to them and I've now been on hold for a total of 75 minutes, so... I kinda think reddit might have a chance of being a more efficient way of doing something to help stop the scammers.",finance

I also explained my situation and all they could give me was information on a 15 to 25-year repayment plan. When I asked them how I should be go about using this extra money to pay off my loans they said “their calculators aren’t capable of figuring this out”. They suggested I contact a financial expert. 

I’m fine with doing that but, before I do, I wanted to see if anyone here had any suggestions on what I should do to get these paid off ASAP.

personalfinance,Mortgage from a bank vs. borrowing from family (US/California),"I'm a first time buyer and was recently pre-qualified from Wells Fargo for a loan (3.77% APR) on a house purchase in California.

My parents offered to give me the loan at a lower APR. Their idea is to get me a better deal and they don't mind making a bit higher interest rate than in a checking account.

My main question is if there is a net FINANCIAL benefit (putting family politics aside) in doing such a deal with my parents for both parties. 

Specifically:

1.  Would I get the tax benefits of interest rate deductions vs. a normal bank?  
2.  I'm guessing there's a rule on 'market interest rate' and there are guidelines on the interest rate they can set. For example, it can't be a 0% interest rate or it starts running into some sort of gift tax issues? (I annually get the $28k ($13k per parent) maximum already)
3.  Since they get interest, I know they would pay tax on that income. Are the rules the same as if they received income from bank interest?

Any other helpful questions or comments would be appreciated, thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Owe student tuition and have about 30 days left to repay,"Ok so I basically dropped out from college almost a year ago with high student debt (around $10k). Most of this (about $8k) is due to the university from unpaid tuition, and the rest (about $2k) is what I owe in federal loans. 
I have been neglecting that debt for almost a year now and I recently got an email saying that they would turn over my name to the California Tax Board and place my account to a third party collecting agency if I do not pay it within 30 days.

personalfinance,Private loans or retirement savings for eduction costs,"Hello! 

I have recently moved abroad (to germany) to return full time to university. I went today to apply for my residence permit, and unfortunately was not approved due to not meeting one of the financial requirements. Germany requires a special blocked account with about 7,000Euros for students. I read in several places online that many americans are able to 'get around' that requirement by simply having enough money, even if its in a US account. Unfortunately that wasn't the case for me :( 


Now to my question for PF - 
I have the money available, in an IRA account (around 27,000USD) - more than the required amount I need to deposit into the German bank account. However I am concerned about the penalties for withdrawing this money. Its my understanding that I could use this money to pay for education costs, but would still have it as taxable income when I file next year. (maybe worth noting that I worked almost half of this year, with an income of just under 20,000) 

I have already accepted a federal student loan (of 9,000) to cover the tuition &amp; fees for this year, so unfortunately fed loans aren't an option for me, if I take a loan it would need to be a private student loan. 

Which option makes more sense; to shop for a private student loan, or rather withdraw from the IRA account and pay the penalties? I am unsure of what exactly I should be calculating to look at the real cost of each option. 

Any advice would be great! :)",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) My debt has finally caught up to me and I need some help.,"Hello r/personalfinance! A good friend recommended this subreddit to me several months ago as it helped him out a lot with his situation, so I'm hoping I can put some of your advice to good use as well.

I'm 25, living in a suburb out of Vancouver, and I can no longer ignore the growing canyon of debt nibbling at my toes. It started with one credit card when I was injured at work in 2012, and after traveling, tattoos, a college diploma, several years of hedonistic 'YOLO, I'll deal with it later' spending sprees, I'm now $23k in debt and my limits are about to run out. I definitely wouldn't say I don't have anything to show for it, but these interest rates are KILLING me. 

I'm not sure which info is relevant so I'll just lay it all out. I still live with my parents, pay them $225/mo for rent and utilities. This kindness is drying up incredibly quickly, so I basically fear being told to find somewhere else to live constantly, but that's a separate issue. I don't drive or have a car because I can't even come close to affording either, especially with gas prices the way they are in Vancouver. I walk to work, make $13.15/hr, around 33 to 35 hours per week, so after taxes, benefits and everything else I take home $1200 to $1500 per month. Roughly $3k of the debt is from student loans but I'm on a repayment assistance plan until February. Since I'm no longer a student, I need to change up my debit card, which was free with a monthly RRSP contribution. I currently have $1,073 in my RRSP, $360 in a TFSA. 

Here's the main issue: I have a credit card and a line of credit, and both have high interest rates. The credit card has a 8k limit and I'm at 7,512, and the interest rate is 19.99%. My cellphone bill (112/mo) and Spotify ($16 - I know I should cancel this but those ADS, MAN..) come out monthly, and I use the credit card to load my transit card ($40/mo) and for the Starbucks app (works out to around $150 a month..I work in a place with a Starbucks in it.. there's really no excuses for this one.) The line of credit is a 10k max and I'm at $8300, with a 10.87% interest rate. The interest payments get taken directly out of my chequing account, unlike the credit card which is piled right on to the amount. Both are about $75 and $120 respectively.

I try to make at least one payment a month but lately the payments are meager, definitely not the minimum payments, and this interest is creeping FAST. Right now I have $160 in my chequing account, and three days until pay day.

As for budgeting, I try and do meal prep so I can still eat healthy, but I do eat out with my partner relatively often as well. My monthly grocery spending amount for July was $325 and August was $241, eating out for July came to $240 (including alcohol) and $182 for August. Sometimes I take a cab to work when I'm running late (my walk is 45 minutes!) and that's around $11 a trip, July I took 4 trips, August I took 8. I was also sexually assaulted on that route last summer so sometimes I literally can't walk or I have a panic attack and I have to get to work somehow, so a cab is the answer. Lastly, I spent $260 in July on clothes, gifts, books and various other outings (I went on a family reunion vacation) and $121 in August.

I know my biggest immediate hurdle in tackling this will be eating out less and eliminating the non-essentials. I don't have much of a social life right now because of my money situation, I just stay home and listen to podcasts (because they're free) or read. I want to start a family in the next five years or so and it feels so irresponsible to do that with any debt and no savings, but I kind of feel like I'm running out of time! Do you have any other advice for me? Should I get rid of my retirement and savings accounts and dump them into my credit card? Please help!!",finance

personalfinance,Paying for a car with my brother,"Excuse my poor english please, i'm from south america*

So i got a new car in early 2014 with a loan. Initial payment was 10% of total cost of the car and monthly payments of around 300 USD (5% interest rate) for 7 years.

In those times my older brother had his own car, and i paid for the car for two years (2014 and 2015). In 2016 i had to leave the country for work. My brother asked me to leave him the car so the wife can use it and he would be making all the monthly payments. I tried to sell the car but couldn't because of low prices and recession back in that year. I agreed and he paid for the monthly payments for another two years (2016 and 2017). 

I am now returning to my home country and he no longer has the other car and we both are in need of my car. Unlike me, my brother is in position to get a new loan for a new car, but he doesn't want to do it saying he already has too much debt (hes currently paying for a house).

In total i have paid around 7500 USD and hes paid around 5500 USD.

I offered him to pay for the 5500 but he refuses. He says i already *gave* him the car.

personalfinance,Question with repeatedly bounced checks,"Since the beginning of this year, had numerous amount of checks being bounced (basically every check since then),  and over a couple of different reasons. For the first 2 quarters of the year, it was always with my employer having ""insufficient"" funds and I would never be able to cash my checks UNTIL the day after my next check arrived at work. It was either that or have them cash out my check at the job. Recently, I'm now running into the issue of being given the error  of ""Unauthorized: Refer to Maker."" I went in to ask more about this error to a bank-teller and I was sat down with one of the managers to go through it. She explained to me that either the employer was either forgetting to authorize the check or there was an error in the system. What I really question is how does an employer as big as the one I work for continue to have the same error every week. 

To keep this limited, I will let you guys know the employer I work for is the hugest fast-food chain with thousands of restaurants nationwide. I don't know how an employer working with a big-name company could keep having errors like these continuously happen. I haven't been in a bad financial situation so far (living with parents still, plenty of money stored to get by, proper spending budget, college hasn't taken a bad toll on me). But over the past couple months my checks have been bouncing back over not being authorized. The most annoying part has been to wait on receiving the cash for the check because they always arrive very late for me. For instance, a check i was due at the end of July/beginning of august(4th) and another mid-august(18th) (2 back to back checks), I just received the money for them this past week from the store, and just to arrive to another check that has been unauthorized.

My question now is, Is there anything to help me with this problem? Is there any type of claim to make or something? Because it's not the fact of receiving checks late that is bothering me, it is how I receive them and how they react to the issue. I've told my employer before about the issue to warn them about the errors coming up to see if they can prevent them. Nothing. I've alerted them about how trying to just cash my checks has gotten me in trouble already at the bank. To elaborate, I've been approached by security to be sat down while the tellers were going to verify that I wasn't attempting to commit fraud or something. If anyone could explain that part to me, as I still remain confused, please tell, I will be very appreciative of any advice. Another issue is how my GM reacts to my issue and how the office handles my issue poorly. I first let my GM know when a check is not going through, and she is fed up with having to cash them out for me (not understandable why I am seen as the bad guy here). Secondly, if I don't get any better response from her, I call the office in charge of the payroll, but they've kept putting me on hold and hanging up on me. Now I've felt like I've been blocked on some instances as sometimes when I call, the call ends before the ringtone starts going. I'll stop before I feel like I pointlessly ramble about how bad the company is, but I truly feel as if it's not being treated professionally. I'm looking for any advice for this. Anything would probably help at this point.",finance

I am actually waiting to hear back from my boss as to whether I get the whole thing or just a share of it, but either way it's worth more than a month of my current income.  

If this check is mine, I know that the smart thing to do is put it in my savings account so that I will be covered in some future month when my fees fall short of my needs.  Because I work on strict ""commission"" as an attorney on contingent fees, I know that at some point there's a risk that I won't have enough fees to cover my bills and financial goals in a particular month.  For all I know that could happen as soon as January based on the fees I've already accumulated at this firm.  It probably won't happen for a while and may never happen, but at the same time it could happen practically any month.  

I've been making great progress on my debts over the last year.  My debt situation is still pretty bad but at the moment the bills are manageable and I've been putting more than $1k a month to reduction.  My next planned step is to take out a home equity loan to refinance the few that are still at high interest rates, and while it's counterintuitive to increase debt for the sake of emergency funds I'm also tempted to pull extra money from that to set aside for lean months.  But that's not the immediate question.  

When I deposit this check, I'm going to be incredibly tempted to throw it at debt (and cut my interest expense by over $100 a month).  But I don't think that's the right move while there's less than a month's expenses in my emergency fund.  Tell me if I'm right or wrong on that, but the real question is, how do I discipline myself to not touch the money?

I have *never* been any good at saving.  I have always succumbed to money ""burning a hole in my pocket"" and that's even a part of my student loans - I got a lump sum more than enough to survive the semester and somehow went on a spending binge and ran out of it before the semester ended.  Part of this is also bipolar disorder, which is mostly under control but impulsive behavior happens quickly and uncontrollably.  In light of that I've never bothered trying to save because I've viewed it as futile.  But I'm 36 and trying to not act like a child with my money anymore.  

How should I go about disciplining myself not to spend this money or apply it to debt so that I can have a healthy emergency fund?  Would it be wise to put it in a less-liquid place like a mutual fund instead of my savings account that's just two clicks away from a transfer to checking?",finance

CryptoCurrency,For those who are new,"Let me start this post by saying to those that are new that I understand how confusing this all can be, we've all been there and I sympathize with you. That being said, you need to help yourself and seek out the information you need to be informed. Ask questions if you need, most of us are helpful and enjoy the community aspect of cryptocurrency, but don't expect others to do any work for you, especially if answers are just a google or two away. I won't feel bad if you make make mistakes that stem from you being unaware or incompetent. We are all aware of the pain a mistake in the crypto universe can cause, I've made mistakes myself, but most mistakes are easily avoidable and if you don't know enough to avoid or fix simple mistakes that have been made hundreds, if not thousands, of times before, you have no reason being here. I know that may sound harsh but we all have better things to do than help you try to recover seed words or spoonfeed you every aspect of how a cryptocurrency works. 

With that said, I've been around for a while and I've noticed a growing issue in all of the crypto communities that I am involved with: many people fundementally do not understand what cryptos are and lack a basic understanding for how they work. I suspect that many have began to invest in cryptocurrency after all the news recently but didn't bother to look into what they actually are or how they work. I see this as a very big problem for long term growth and adoption because user ignorance can easily be mistaked for system errors or shortcomings. 

Basically everything I am about to say has been said before many times in many different ways by many different people but its important and apparently must be said again. For the purposes of this post I will not be speaking about any specific cryptocurrency but instead be speaking about cryptocurrencies in general.


Lets start with what what a cryptocurrency is:
A cryptocurrency is a decentralized ledger system that does not require the users to trust a central authority for adminstration of the network. Instead administration is performed automatically by predefined algorithms (set of instructions). The decentralized nature of the network is what allows the system to be trustless. When I say trustless, I mean that I don't have to trust any individual or organization, like a bank, what I am trusting instead is the underlying algorithms and their implentation in code, which is why it is very important that a cryptocurrency be open-source. You (or anyone else) are able to verify that all actions on the network are valid at any point.  

In order to create a system like this, we rely on math, specifically cryptography. [HERE IS A GOOD VIDEO EXPLAINING THE BASICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do). This type of cryptography relies on the fact that multiplication is easy and factorization is hard, especially with large numbers. But what stops people from accidentally creating the same numbers you might ask? I don't mean large numbers like 8000, I'm talking large numbers like 256 bit numbers, which mean that there are 2^256 possibilities of numbers to choose from - or enough numbers for everyone on earth to have several billion addresses - this means a collision is extremely unlikely but theoretically not impossible. For a computer, trying to factor numbers this large is extremely difficult and computationally intensive. With current technology, it would take longer than the age of the universe for a computer to determine the corresponding private key to a known public key. This ensures that only the real owner of the public key has access to the encrypted information because the private key is necessary for decryption. Cryptocurrencies leverage this to create the decentralized ledger. In a cryptocurrency, users generate a set of keys, one public and one private. These keys are related to each other but are ultimately just numbers 

- the crazy strings of text you see as an address are just numbers, they look that way because they are not reprented in a base-10 numbering system (what we are used to) because they are so large. This is done for user convience because nobody wants to deal with a 256 digit number. -

The public key serves as a users wallet address (you can think of this like an account number) and the private key is what allows the user to access their funds (you can think of this as a pin number). When someone wants to send funds to someone else, person A uses their private keys to ""unlock"" their coins and send them to person B's public key. At this point, person A no longer has access to the coins because they don't know person B's private key. (This is where miners come into the picture but I'm not going to talk about that as it has been throughly discussed elsewhere and isn't as relevant for everyday use) Therefore public keys serve as IDs in the crypto world and this is perfectly fine because a public key can be given to anyone freely without fear of them being used to determine the public key because of what was discussed above. This has important implications. Mainly that THE PERSON WHO CONTROLS THE PRIVATE KEYS OF AN ADDRESS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE ABLE TO ACCESS THE COINS CONTROLLED BY THAT ADDRESS. PRIVATE KEYS ARE YOUR LIFE IN THE CRYPTO UNIVERSE. IF YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE PRIVATE KEYS YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE COINS SIMPLE AS THAT.

When people talk about a wallet, they are talking about a program which maintains private keys for you. Most also do other things like watch the balance associated with an address or allow you to create new key pairs but ultimately the purpose of a wallet is to maintain your keys. These wallets come in many different formats - hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano, software wallets like Exodus, paper wallets (qr codes representing the numbers) - but they all serve the same purpose, holding private keys. Because these private keys are so important, you must be very vigilant in protecting them, even beyond how you protect your other passwords or even your banking information. If you mess up nobody will or even help you and there is no going back. There is no support number you can call to reverse the transaction like there is at a bank. It behooves you to act as if everyone is always watching and your computer is always compromised even if it isn't all that likely.

Now because of the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, it becomes difficult to buy and sell them/exchange them because you need to find someone willing to participate in the transaction with you basically in a void, just like how classified ads work. Most people don't want to wait around weeks to find someone in their area willing to buy their bitcoin or whatever, which is why exchanges were created. An exchange is a service which allows users to buy/sell/trade cryptocurrencies. (Most) exchanges, unlike the underlying network ARE CENTRALIZED and DO require trust. An exchange basicially works by users sending their coins to addresses (public keys) that the exchange controls, essentially giving their coins to the exchange. The exchange credits the user in their system and allows them to use that credit to use their service. Examples of exchanges are Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex, etc. EXCHANGES ARE NOT WALLETS because they control the private keys of the coins and AN EXCHANGE WILL NEVER GIVE YOU THEIR PRIVATE KEYS. This is why it is a bad idea to store your cryptos in an exchange because ultimately you have zero control over what happens to those coins - you are trustig the exchage to do what you ask them to and that they actually have all the coins they say they do. You can think of an exchange as a bank in the sense that they will manage and keep track of your money for you but EXCHANGES ARE NOT BANKS. At this point in time, cryptos are not regulated in the same way that banks are, meaning no FDIC insurance, no federal mandates, etc. This means that if an exchange gets hacked and the private keys (coins) get stolen, you will loose your money because there is nothing anyone can do to reverse the transaction. This is what happened with MtGox and Bitfinex. This is a strength/property of the network not a short coming. There is no ""fix"" for this without centralizing the ledger, essentially just making a bank and destroying the trustless aspect of the system. Another thing to realize is that most exchanges are somewhat sketchy (many operate without real addresses, are incorperated offshore or in places like Delaware, have poor support, or don't disclose who runs them ) and don't deserve your blind trust. These are not even Google/Amazon level companies. Personally I trust Google more with my email than I trust an exchange with my cryptocurrency.  I'm not saying don't use exchanges, exhcanges are great, but I am saying that you must be aware of the risk and what you are actually doing otherwise you may get burned.

The other important implication is that because these are just numbers, every address that can exist already does exist. This sounds strange but think about it, all the sets of keys (numbers) are mathematically related and that relation is a property of the number not something that is attached to the number by some process we can perform. Why is this imporant? Lets say you send your money to an incorrect address (maybe a typo, maybe an address for a different cryptocurrency, maybe only a partial address) - what happens? The system functions exactly how it was designed and exactly how it was supposed to, meaning that the public key is used to sign the transaction and give ownership to whoever controls the corresponding private key. But just because we sent it to a random address that might not even be registered on the network doesn't mean that the random address doesn't have a private key (cause remember thats a property of the number) it just means that we don't know the private key and because of the properties of cryptography and the limits of computation we are unable to determine the private key from the known public key (or the mistaken address). What this means is that the coins are effectively lost forever because nobody has the private key to move them. Technically speaking, if someone had the private key the coins could be moved with no problem. If this were not the case, the entire system would break down so people requesting that this ""issue"" be fixed have a fundemental missunderstanding of how the system works and it actually is literally impossible to fix this issue if we want cryptocurrencies to be decentralized and trustless because who gets to decide to revert a transation? How do we stop them from abusing that power? Therefore it is extremely important to always DOUBLE AND TRIPPLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESSES before you send anything and if you are moving a large amount it is always preferable to send a small test amount first. 

Cryptocurrencies give a lot of control to the user. Much more control than basically any other system I can think of that we are familiar with. There is no going back cause you messed up and there really shouldn't be. We shouldn't be coddled by the system, we should be able to make our own decisions even if they are bad ones (like sending coins to a wrong address). People need to know what they are getting themselves into and the basics of how the system they are using works otherwise they will make painful accidents. You wouldn't invest in a stock without knowing what a company did, similarly you shouldn't invest in a cryptocurrency that you don't understand, at least at a very basic level.

btc,For those who are new,"Let me start this post by saying to those that are new that I understand how confusing this all can be, we've all been there and I sympathize with you. That being said, you need to help yourself and seek out the information you need to be informed. Ask questions if you need, most of us are helpful and enjoy the community aspect of cryptocurrency, but don't expect others to do any work for you, especially if answers are just a google or two away. I won't feel bad if you make make mistakes that stem from you being unaware or incompetent. We are all aware of the pain a mistake in the crypto universe can cause, I've made mistakes myself, but most mistakes are easily avoidable and if you don't know enough to avoid or fix simple mistakes that have been made hundreds, if not thousands, of times before, you have no reason being here. I know that may sound harsh but we all have better things to do than help you try to recover seed words or spoonfeed you every aspect of how a cryptocurrency works. 

With that said, I've been around for a while and I've noticed a growing issue in all of the crypto communities that I am involved with: many people fundementally do not understand what cryptos are and lack a basic understanding for how they work. I suspect that many have began to invest in cryptocurrency after all the news recently but didn't bother to look into what they actually are or how they work. I see this as a very big problem for long term growth and adoption because user ignorance can easily be mistaked for system errors or shortcomings. 

Basically everything I am about to say has been said before many times in many different ways by many different people but its important and apparently must be said again. For the purposes of this post I will not be speaking about any specific cryptocurrency but instead be speaking about cryptocurrencies in general.


Lets start with what what a cryptocurrency is:
A cryptocurrency is a decentralized ledger system that does not require the users to trust a central authority for adminstration of the network. Instead administration is performed automatically by predefined algorithms (set of instructions). The decentralized nature of the network is what allows the system to be trustless. When I say trustless, I mean that I don't have to trust any individual or organization, like a bank, what I am trusting instead is the underlying algorithms and their implentation in code, which is why it is very important that a cryptocurrency be open-source. You (or anyone else) are able to verify that all actions on the network are valid at any point.  

In order to create a system like this, we rely on math, specifically cryptography. [HERE IS A GOOD VIDEO EXPLAINING THE BASICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do). This type of cryptography relies on the fact that multiplication is easy and factorization is hard, especially with large numbers. But what stops people from accidentally creating the same numbers you might ask? I don't mean large numbers like 8000, I'm talking large numbers like 256 bit numbers, which mean that there are 2^256 possibilities of numbers to choose from - or enough numbers for everyone on earth to have several billion addresses - this means a collision is extremely unlikely but theoretically not impossible. For a computer, trying to factor numbers this large is extremely difficult and computationally intensive. With current technology, it would take longer than the age of the universe for a computer to determine the corresponding private key to a known public key. This ensures that only the real owner of the public key has access to the encrypted information because the private key is necessary for decryption. Cryptocurrencies leverage this to create the decentralized ledger. In a cryptocurrency, users generate a set of keys, one public and one private. These keys are related to each other but are ultimately just numbers 

- the crazy strings of text you see as an address are just numbers, they look that way because they are not reprented in a base-10 numbering system (what we are used to) because they are so large. This is done for user convience because nobody wants to deal with a 256 digit number. -

The public key serves as a users wallet address (you can think of this like an account number) and the private key is what allows the user to access their funds (you can think of this as a pin number). When someone wants to send funds to someone else, person A uses their private keys to ""unlock"" their coins and send them to person B's public key. At this point, person A no longer has access to the coins because they don't know person B's private key. (This is where miners come into the picture but I'm not going to talk about that as it has been throughly discussed elsewhere and isn't as relevant for everyday use) Therefore public keys serve as IDs in the crypto world and this is perfectly fine because a public key can be given to anyone freely without fear of them being used to determine the public key because of what was discussed above. This has important implications. Mainly that THE PERSON WHO CONTROLS THE PRIVATE KEYS OF AN ADDRESS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE ABLE TO ACCESS THE COINS CONTROLLED BY THAT ADDRESS. PRIVATE KEYS ARE YOUR LIFE IN THE CRYPTO UNIVERSE. IF YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE PRIVATE KEYS YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE COINS SIMPLE AS THAT.

When people talk about a wallet, they are talking about a program which maintains private keys for you. Most also do other things like watch the balance associated with an address or allow you to create new key pairs but ultimately the purpose of a wallet is to maintain your keys. These wallets come in many different formats - hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano, software wallets like Exodus, paper wallets (qr codes representing the numbers) - but they all serve the same purpose, holding private keys. Because these private keys are so important, you must be very vigilant in protecting them, even beyond how you protect your other passwords or even your banking information. If you mess up nobody will or even help you and there is no going back. There is no support number you can call to reverse the transaction like there is at a bank. It behooves you to act as if everyone is always watching and your computer is always compromised even if it isn't all that likely.

Now because of the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, it becomes difficult to buy and sell them/exchange them because you need to find someone willing to participate in the transaction with you basically in a void, just like how classified ads work. Most people don't want to wait around weeks to find someone in their area willing to buy their bitcoin or whatever, which is why exchanges were created. An exchange is a service which allows users to buy/sell/trade cryptocurrencies. (Most) exchanges, unlike the underlying network ARE CENTRALIZED and DO require trust.

Bitcoin,Coming China currency devaluation will send BTC soaring?,"Let me first state that I am very new to reddit and cryptocurrency and still have a lot to learn.  So I ask for forgiveness in advance for any mistakes I may make.
  
I did however find two articles I found interesting and wanted to see what you thought.  The first (https://dailyreckoning.com/chinas-red-october/) states that currently China is in an Impossible trinity; they have a fixed exchange rate, open capital account, and independent interest rate policy.  They will need to cut one leg out soon and this article seems to suggest they will devalue the currency by as much as 20%, with this happening as soon as October. 

The second (http://www.forexnewsnow.com/forex-analysis/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-and-chinese-yuan-devaluation/) observes the inverse relationship between the Chinese Yuan and BTC.  When the Yuan loses value bitcoin increases.  This makes sense, putting your money in bitcoin not only preserves its value but increases it.  

My last observation from the first artice is that the last time China devalued its currency in 2015, and keep in mind it was less than the predicted 20% coming this October, it sent shock waves around the world and the US stock market fell by 10%.  This could create a huge surge in BTC price.  Chinese citizens would be flocking to BTC to protect their assets all the while the stock market would be bearish.  This would make bitcoin even more appealing to big time investors as BTC would be flourishing in a time when stocks are falling.

personalfinance,Debt Galore... But need a car for commuting. Advice?,"Hey everyone. I’m a recent graduate with my BS and I’m looking at a number of expenses coming at me. Here’s a quick breakdown:

 - $35,000 in private school loans

 - $30,000 in federal school loans

 - $1,700 credit card debt

 - Lease on my car ends in January


I’m making under $45k a year and plan on living at home for a few years to attack my private school loans. I found some great resources on here and plan to refinance them for a drastically lower rate and hopefully have them paid off in less than 5 years. All of my loans (federal and private) will eat almost half of my paycheck in that time frame. And I’m only paying about $300 more a month to refinance them for 5 years compared to 20 so it didn’t make sense to be to keep the burden on my back for a much longer period of time. I have until April to begin repayment.
  

I’m planning on paying my credit card off in the next 1-2 months, which I can realistically do. I’m hoping to lower my utilization so that I can increase my credit score.
  

However, my big dilemma is with my car. My lease is up in 
January and I was paying $215 a month. I didn’t have the discretionary income at the time to worry about fixing up a car (which is what had seemed to happen with all of my previous beaters) so leasing just made sense to me. I also have only put 20K/36K I’m allowed to use because I never drove very far for anything. However, now I am commuting for work- this is about a 45-60 minute drive each way (so up to two hours driving a day). I’m driving 35 miles one way for a total of 70 miles per day. 


I would love to lease again, but I’d only be comfortable with a minimum 30k mile/year limit because I’m putting on around 18,200 miles per year and I’d want some wiggle room for running errands, visiting friends, running errands for work etc. So it doesn’t really make sense to lease anymore, although I’d feel very reassured with a newer car and warranty as my vehicle is necessary for my commute. Additionally, I don’t really want to own a car that I’m just going to be beating up with miles. 
So my next option would be to buy a preowned that’s around 10-13k (that way said vehicle is not super high in mileage and hopefully more reliable than the 3-5k I’ve purchased over that years that just end up costing $1500 in repairs each year). 


However, I won’t have money to buy this in cash. I could try to save some between paying off my CC and before my school loans start, but I also wanted to try to build a nest egg of savings for any incidentals. Basically any advice would be helpful! 


**TLDR:** Have a lot of upcoming expenses to pay off; however, wondering what is the best option for a car that is necessary for commuting?",finance

I am trying to find the best way to pay down my credit cards. I want to do this both as quickly as possible, and with paying the least amount of interest.

Here is my current status:

2 credit cards
- 10,200 balance at 9.15%
- 9,600 balance at 23.9%

I currently am paying the minimum of the lowest interest rate card. I pay the minimum on the higher rate card, but also put my entire monthly bonus towards this card. This bonus averages about $600 a month after it is taxed.

My future plan would be to get a 0% APR card at 18 months with a 3% transfer rate and put as much on it as its limit will allow. I would then pay the minimum on the lower interest rate card and the 0% card. Then pay the minimum plus my bonus on the higher rate card.

Is this my best option? Or would it be better to use that bonus to pay the 0% card and keep rolling from the higher rate to 0% as it is paid off?

* London is expensive! ...but I will live in the Uxbridge area, just outside.

* **$850 a month accommodation.** I will be dorming, I am hoping to find a cheaper room to rent once I make friends and know the area after a year. 

* I am fortunate that my dad will help me cover my rent, so I won't have to worry about that. I'm assuming he'll deposit $1000 a month in my account to help with food and boarding. Bless his soul, I owe him so much!

* **LOANS per year: I qualify for unsubsidized loan of $20,500 with 6% interest rate** and **GRAD PLUS loan of $24,872 with 7% interest** So that's a total of $45,372 a year in loans. I'm leaning on avoiding having to use the GRAD PLUS loans.


* I have only a credit card debt that I plan to pay off this month, I used it to pay for my flight and accommodation fee. **$1,500**

* I have **$19,402** in my savings (17,902 after I pay my CC debt)




My question is how much should I plan on paying per semester with my savings? I don't want to take the whole thing out, and want a safe cushion to have. Especially after I graduate, to pay for my state boards which is expensive, and support myself while I look for a job. Realistically, I think it might take 5 months to find a job (testing, obtaining state license, studying, interviewing). I want to graduate with as little debt as possible (who doesn't!) but also don't want to be SOL because I spent all of my savings.

gaming,Alternative to the Fallout games?,"Hey guys,

So I spent the better part of the last couple of months getting really into the Fallout franchise. I ended up really enjoying the franchise itself, and I really love New Vegas...when it works.

To make a long story short, I finally became so fed up with the broken, buggy nature of the games that I stopped playing them. Even with mods, I still ran into lots of trouble. 

Can anyone recommend another game that I might like? To be honest, I find it a little baffling that these games are notorious for being somewhat broken. I don't understand why Fallout/Bethesda games in general can be so messy when almost all other popular games don't run into issues like this.

When New Vegas is functioning, I like exploring the wasteland, spacing out and walking around, never knowing for sure what I'm going to run into while I'm out there. I've never learned much about guns in my life, and I feel like I learned a lot from Fallout. Never really understood the difference between handguns, shotguns, and rifles, for example. I'm *that* uneducated on it lol

But yeah, I like exploring a big open world, learning how to utilize different weapons, learning how to snipe. Never pegged myself for a scavenger, but it's somewhat exciting when I crack open a lock and find some good stuff inside. 

In fact, Phantom Pain hit a lot of the points I'm looking for, except for the fact that there's not much in terms of exploration once you've sunk enough hours into it.

Net neutrality describes the concept that Internet providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally and content providers should not pay for priority access.  Since the Internet was developed, the market and consumers have driven innovation and expansion, which has caused the Internet to thrive in a relatively regulation-free environment.  However in 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a new rule, called the Open Internet Order, which would prevent Internet providers from negotiating priority access agreements and would prohibit them from blocking or discriminating against any lawful content.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in January 2014 that the FCC does not have the right to impose heavy-handed regulations on the Internet under Title I of the Telecommunications Act.  The federal government can only regulate public utilities like telephone service and electricity.

On November 10, 2014, President Obama formally announced his support for net neutrality, and he encouraged the FCC to reclassify and regulate the Internet as a Title II utility.  A Title II utility under the Communications Act of 1934 is the most heavy-handed version of all Internet regulatory proposals.  It was comprised of 16 rule parts, 682 pages, and 987 rule sections.  It provided the FCC an enormous amount of power to dictate prices, practices, innovation, and business terms to Internet companies.

In a 3-2 decision on February 26, 2015, the FCC announced its approval of the 317-page net neutrality rule that classifies broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) as “common carriers” to be regulated under Title II.  The reclassification removed ISPs from the purview of the Federal Trade Commission to the FCC.  On June 14, 2016, the U.S Court of Appeals for Washington, DC, in a 2-1 vote, upheld the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order.  The ruling denied the petitions for review, which effectively sustained the rulemaking. 

On March 23, 2017, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 34, legislation to disapprove of the Open Internet Order under the Congressional Review Act.  Congress can use an expedited process via the CRA to overturn final Executive Branch rules.  The CRA process allows Congress to act on a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 session days of receiving the final rule.  The resolution must be approved by both chambers and signed by the President.  Once signed, the measure stops the rule and prevents similar rules from being issued unless Congress enacts a new law.  The House passed S.J. Res 34 on March 28, 2017, and President Trump subsequently signed the measure into law on April 3, 2017. 

The CRA simply keeps existing consumer protections and regulations under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has been under its purview for nearly two decades.  The Open Internet Order never officially took effect.  Therefore, the CRA did not reduce or change existing consumer privacy regulations.  I voted in favor of the CRA because I believe treating ISPs as public utilities will deter new investments in infrastructure, obstruct improvements to existing broadband networks, and discourage new market entrants.  While there is broad agreement that ISPs should treat all legal content equally when delivering it to paying customers, achieving an “open Internet” does not necessitate a dramatic new federal regulatory regime.

On May 18, 2017, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Restoring Internet Freedom.  The rulemaking proposes to reverse the 2015 Open Internet Order and returns ISP under the framework of Title I of the Communications Act.  Mobile broadband Internet would also be returned to the original classification as a private mobile service.  The FCC is seeking public comment on how to best proceed on rules addressing the practice of blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization.  The rulemaking’s open comment period begins on July 17, 2017, and ends on August 16, 2017.   Please visit the FCC’s rulemaking page for updates on the proposed rulemaking and opportunities to submit public comments. 

I support the FCC’s initiative to begin rulemaking on reversing the 2015 Open Internet Order.  I will continue to monitor the rulemaking process and encourage individuals to submit open comments.  Moving forward, it is important to have a bipartisan effort that includes all stakeholders, the Internet community, and service providers to work toward the best open Internet structure.

financialindependence,Deferring income tax via annuity but with very low investment return,"I am about to encounter a large windfall, probably between $700,000 and $1,000,000. I have the option of taking it either in cash, or in an annuity that pays out over 10 years. I won't know the exact amount until after I have made the decision that is the subject of this post- although there is no specific relation between the amount and my decision, it is just a matter of timing. I've been advised that this windfall will be taxed as ordinary income.  Thus, if taken in cash I am immediately turning over 40% to the government. If taken as an annuity, I would get somewhere between $70,000 to $120,000 per year depending on the final amount.  Regardless of the final amount, the annuity effectively works out to something like a .75% interest rate over the ten year payout, but lets me avoid some of the tax burden.  Of note, I am a high wage earner so my tax burden is already high. But, I am in a U.S. city with no State, county or city income taxes.

I crunched the numbers and it seems like the annuity is a better deal because of the tax avoidance effects. I compared taking a 40% hit and investing the remainder to investing the income stream on each payment as it came in, and over a ten year horizon the annuity seemed to pay slightly more. 

My big question to the group is whether there is something I may be missing in terms of evaluating an income stream vs. a lump sum payout. 

I am actively pursuing FI with a savings rate of around 40% while repaying student loans. But I am near the start of the journey, and while this windfall would represent a huge advance toward FI, I'm not comfortable making this decision without some input from folks a little farther along the path.

I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want to advertise a big windfall like this to folks that know my reddit account name.",finance

personalfinance,"Wage data for vocational community college, trade and for profit educational programs","Hello personal finance 

Many posts and comments recommend individuals pursue educational opportunities in order to improve their income. These posts tend be mostly anecdotal, or rely bias and hunches about the labor market. There's a better source of information that provides actual data regarding mean/median wages broken down for vocational programs via the Federal Government's Gainful Employment Debt to Earnings data. 

[Gainful Employment Debt to Earnings Data] (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/ge)

Download the spreadsheet under the heading ""Debt to Earnings Rate Data"". 

**Background**: The Obama administration implemented Gainful Employment in response to for profit programs defrauding students with bogus outcome data on graduate employment and wages. The rule itself actually covers public and for profit programs. Essentially any program that doesn't end in a terminal degree at public institution (so AA, BA, etc) has to disclose student level records to the federal government, which then is used to calculate mean/median program earnings. The catch is that the Department of Education doesn't say how this data is queried, only that the source is the Social Security Administration. 

**How to read the sheet:** if you're only interested in looking up wage information, the most useful columns are ""Institution Name"", ""CIP Code"" (program), and ""Median Annual Earnings"". If you're interested in the rest of the columns, download and read the glossary (can be downloaded below the spreadsheet).",finance

btc,Please start a security vulnerabilities disclosure bounty program for BCH wallet implementations and hosting,"There's a certain attitude among some wallet providers (I'm looking at you electron cash) that concerns about security are FUD. They host their sites without SSL, get their domains suspended, and god knows what holes there exist in their account and server setups ready to be exploited.

I'm suggesting that a security vulnerability bounty program is started, that rewards white-hat hackers to report those vulnerabilities and collect a reward for it. Because if we do not have such a program, then black-hat hackers **will** discover those vulnerabilities and then we're fucked.

If a major wallet gets hacked (in whatever way and fashion) it will lead to a major loss of confidence in BCH (and an endless shitstorm by the smallblockers). This kills the BCH.

The program has to be professionally setup. It needs to be a registered non-profit organization, so that it can collect and pay out funds and be legally above the board. It needs to be represented and administered by trusted members of the community and wallet implementors, and it needs to be staffed by security professionals who know how to run such a program.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"19yo in College With Student Loans, Considering Credit Card/Want to Refinance","Hello to all, I am new to the personalfinance community and Reddit as a whole as I have been a bit of a lurker. I have just transferred to a different college and will be starting in January, I won't need any private loans for the next 5 semesters, and then I'll have a B.S.E. in Computer Systems Engineering.

My federal loans come to $3,500 subsidized and $6,000 subsidized so far. I also have two private Sallie Mae loans: $9,400 @ 10.4% and $9,100 @ 8.8%. I have been placing $150/mo into each of the private loans.

My credit score comes up as 654 under Chase Credit Journey and 655 as FICO Score under Sallie Mae. They have risen ever so slightly as I have put more into them recently: $150/mo/each vs $25/mo/each as a minimum during college.

My grand question is this: Should I just attempt to raise my credit score through regular loan payments right now, or should I get a student credit card and regularly have &lt;=10% utilization on it?

Be it autopayment or manually managing it, I can be responsible to only use the credit card as a front over my bank account for credit building. I do not have an emergency fund at the moment, but am able to start building one quickly as all work I need done on my car is just about over, and I am under my parent's roof rent-free.

The credit card I was interested in was the 'Discover It Chrome for Students', no fees and a 2% back on gas/dining is a nice little bonus.

I am shooting for a credit score of about 680 then looking to refinance as my private loan rates are high. Any suggestions, pointers, and assistance is greatly appreciated.",finance

I am a manager at a fast food place and I work about 30 hours a week at 13.50. I want to leave my job because I don't like management and I always have to close the store, I rarely open. I would like to work in the morning but my other two managers won't change the shifts because well who wants to work night? Also im not respected and the employes never do their fucking job. I am absolutely miserable and I've fallen into depression to the point that I am just numb at work and don't give a shit. My expenses are 200 for rent and 20 for the phone. I live with my parents so I guess it's not so bad. I have about 600 in the bank (I've worked there a year, been manager about 4 months now, and yes I know I've been careless with my money) so I'm thinking if I put in my two weeks notice mid October  so I can have enough money saved up for a couple of months . If I live frugally. I have no student loans and have my tuition is  payed of by the Governor fee waver here in California. To make matters worse they fired another manager, as she had a lot of problems, to bring me in and I feel if I leave this soon there going to be mad and I won't have good references as they would be short staffed.

Regarding my student loans, they are federal loans are are eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I've contacted my loan company and informed them I am in the process of completing the paperwork for it.

My loan company suggested I do an income based repayment plan.

Essentially, I can make minimum payments using my full-time salary and have about $200 left over for food, gas, and other expenses. What I want to do is make the best out of this additional $1200/month I'll be making for September-December and February-May (I lecture these semesters). This semester, I got lucky and am teaching two courses, so I expect to make about $7.5k, paid out over the course of 4 months.

My understanding is to get down the highest percentage loans first... 
I know either way, it's going to take a while to get rid of this. I want to make the best of this ""additional"" $8k a year. If I put it towards the credit cards, I can pay off **all** of them by December. Is that my best course of action? My short term goal is to get my total monthly bills down. 


Burning questions: 

* Should I pay off all credit cards first? (I can do that within the next 4 months)
* Should I consolidate the student loans? 
* Does the loan forgiveness program benefit me in this situation? As in, making monthly payments based on my income for 120 payments and waiving the rest. Or, should I bite the bullet and pay it off in less...

Hello everyone, short time lurker, first time poster here in this subreddit. I've seen the occasional success story crop up on here, and the common theme seems to be the posters thanking this community for helping them get out of debt.

So now I come before you all admitting that I've reached my limits. I can no longer tolerate the $20,000 in defaulted federal student loans burdened upon me by my younger, dumber self a decade ago. I flagrantly refused to pay back my student loans in an act of defiance against the federal government, and now I'm paying for it. Now I'm tired of it and it's time to humble myself and ask for help from those who are more financially successful.

I'm currently an Assistant Retail Manager making $11.50 an hour. I'm turning 31 this year, and I live rent free with my dad in a paid off mobile home. My only real current financial obligation is my car insurance, which costs about $18 a month minimum to maintain, and has an overall premium of about $400. I get paid weekly, and up until this most recent paystub, was making about $400+ gross per paycheck. However this most recent paycheck was about half that, for the same amount of work. I haven't received any notices since starting the job, but I suspect I'm being garnished. 


I don't have a very steady job history either, two years seems to be about as long as I'm able to last at a company before it all goes to hell, so I'm always scared to take on any major financial responsibilities because I'm always concerned that I could lose my job at any moment. 

As you can probably tell, I'm horrible with finances and no good at making a budget, and need all the help I can get. I have no savings to speak of other than physical assets that I'd rather not liquidate, as I've pretty much liquidated what assets I can already.

personalfinance,Should I use Mortgage Points for a reduced rate (with inflation in mind)?,"This has been asked a few times in the last couple years, but I had a new question regarding inflation...

So taking a .25% rate decrease (3.625% to 3.375%) would save us about $14,000 over the course of the 30 year fixed loan ($280k loan amount on a $350k house), but it would cost us over a point in closing costs ~$4,000. Doing the math, it seems like the break even would be around 9 years, which we are definitely hoping to keep the home for that long.

My question is that $14,000 over the life of the loan will be realized over the time in the form of $40/month reduction in our payments. If everything were in 2017 dollars, that'd be a no brainer ($14,000 saved - $4,000 spent = $10,000 saved in 30 years).

...however, due to inflation, $4,000 in 1987 would now be worth $8,700 (depending on the rate). Assuming that trend continues, the $40 per month we save is worth less and less over time and the amount we paid in 2017 for the lower interest rate is worth more and more. (sidenote: How do you calculate the $14,000 saved interest value accounting for inflation?)

I'm thinking that paying for points' ""break even"" year is *actually* much longer than 9 years and it makes sense to keep the higher rate, lower closing cost (0 points) and have more options for a refi if rates go lower or if we want to sell in the next few years...

Am I thinking about this correctly? It seems like I should definitely go for the higher rate...",finance
personalfinance,Debt and Federal student loans kills chances of a job?,"Hello, firstly I want to say that this is something my friend is going through and since she doesn't have Reddit and I do, I'm posting it. 

She always has little side jobs like online selling on Etsy, Craigslist, etc. Well she didn't really bother to work a full time job bc she saved enough to live on and also didn't have the emotional strength to work after her older brother passed away and her half sister did as well. She dropped out of college a few years back bc of that too. She's been living with her cousin.

 Anyways since writing is her passion, she decided to perhaps go back to college. Bc of this She applied for a lower paying jobs to get her by until she secures a more career/job/internship in the writing Field. Or a full time job to save money.

When I say low paying, I mean low paying. This part time job only paid $8 an hour and less than 20 hrs a week. Yet, it required a background check and drug testing. Which she agreed to get, thinking nothing of it. Well, she basically was told the job was hers but then received a letter stating that they had decided to rescind the job offer after doing a background check. 

She did say she had student loans 20k she hasn't​ paid and a few credit card debt around 2k she didn't pay off yet. So I'm thinking her debt was what came up and perhaps that was a reason.

 I didn't know what to tell her and advised her to ask the hiring manager what came up on her background check. But I'm not sure what else she can do. Maybe go to social security offices and ask if anyone's using her ss#?  So does anyone have any experience or knowledge about something like finances stopping someone from a low paying job? I know federal, government, military and more lucrative jobs would deny someone of a job which is reasonable but never a part time hourly job!

(And if it were a case of a bounced check obviously it would be for the full and total amount of the cheque, no?) 

Getting nowhere, I went to my local branch. The rep seemed dumbfounded. Explaining that he didn't know what the removal was for and that they had provided no notes on their end to explain, there's ""nothing he can do besides send an account inquiry to HQ and wait to hear back in about a week"" 

Beyond that, to actually make the necessary purchase that was declined to start this whole mess, I had to transfer some $100 from my savings to my chequing account (insert Kevin Hart reference) and immediately thereafter, my bank removed ANOTHER $120 from my Savings this time, leaving me overdrawn on that account and facing overdraft feed and penalities.

At this point I've withdrawn what other funds remained in the account and now I just want my money back so I can close my account and never deal with them again, but I feel stuck doing nothing for the next week (nevermind trying to put my life and finances on hold for the week and probably longer; sorry r/personalfinance , I'm living paycheque to paycheque for the time being) and having no rea recourse afterwards. Please help. 

FYI I have no lines of credit or debts/loans against me for which this could be going towards, and am fully squared away with federal taxes and the like.",finance
financialindependence,Long term capital gains tax vs traditional IRA,"I've been trying to do some calculating of what my tax rate in retirement will be, and have come to this conclusion assuming the tax structure of today doesn't change:

**For someone who is planning to retire with &lt;$37,650 of income (15% tax bracket), there's no difference between investing in a Roth IRA and a normal taxable brokerage account.**

This is based on the fact that:

1. Long term capital gains are taxed at 0% for those in the 15% tax bracket

2. Roth IRAs are withdrawn tax free

3. You pay taxes on both types of accounts before investing

The main difference I see is that the Roth IRA doesn't count towards your calculated income while the capital gains will, but it doesn't make any difference if you're planning to stay in the 15% tax bracket.

Am I missing anything, or is it really that easy to not pay taxes in a lower income retirement? Of course, any money in a traditional IRA or 401k will still be taxed up to 15%.

EDIT:
To summarize response of why a taxable account isn't quite equivalent to a Roth

1. Dividends will be taxed while working

2. Rebalancing/sales in a taxable account while still working would create taxes, so to be equivalent to a Roth you would need to hold until retirement.

3. Capital gains are counted as income if you are wanting to get Affordable Care Act discounts

4. Many states will tax capital gains as income, even if it's 0% on federal taxes

5. More legal protection exists with Roth and generally is more likely to remain tax free",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my home?,"Throw away because money and stuff...

I am considering refinancing my home and would like advice on whether I should move forward with it or not.

Current Loan
Principal: 166,750
Monthly: 1147
Interest Rate: 3.625
Maturity Date: 3/01/2045

I've been in the house about 2 1/2 years and am mostly happy with this mortgage (minus the PMI). The payment is managable and the rate is decent.  Problem is that I also have a note for solar panels.  These weren't the best decision so go easy on me.  Here is the information on that loan.

Solar Loan
Principal: 23,000
Monthly: 228
Interest Rate 9.99
Maturity: Not sure? 20 years?

This loan began at 130/mo with interest only payment until the ""inventive payment"" was met.  Unfortunately I failed to make the incentive payment. The governemnt rebate, which was supposed to cover the payment, came through via my taxes around the same time as a DUI (fucking stupid, I know) and legal fees took precendence.  This also triggered a rate increase from 6.X to 9.9 moving my monthly from 130 to 228.  The solar incentive is about $7k.  I believe the rate and payment will return to this amount whenever I've satisfied the incentive balance.

This loan has been stressing me out for the last year and half and I would like to get out from under it. Thus, my desire to refinance the house.  I also would like to move to a 15 year note.

My home was valued at 187k at time of purchase and now is closer to $225k-$230k.  A home in my neighborhood with an identical layout but no solar panels just sold for $230k.  I think mine will appraise for at least that much.  My mortgage buddy tells me on cashout refis 80% LTV is the max so I would need a $237k valuation.

I have about $5k in stocks that I consider my emergency fund.  My wife and I bring home about $6.5k/mo.  All of our predictable monthly expenses add up to around $3400 (working on a strict budget with ynab but not there yet).
I also have stocks vesting and my bonus payment (assuming team share is realized) come April 2018 that amounts to roughly $12k. 

My goal is to extract enough equity to satisfy the solar loan and have about $7k left over for home renovations (DIY shed and patio). Refinancing would also get me to a 15 year note, drop PMI and preserve my emergency fund from either projects or solar incentive.

Does refinancing seem like the way to go?  I'm feeling pretty convinced after typing it all out.  Interested in hearing your thoughts.",finance

I do not have health insurance yet and was in the process of getting it with Fed Ex since I just hit my 90 days so I had to go to a walk in clinic.
I met with the doctor 2 weeks ago yesterday and got my drug test form and when I met with the doctor she thought it was ridiculous I had to go to a doctor (also pay out of pocket) to get a note saying I threw up. She said she saw cases all the time of people throwing up from a lot of water and had no idea why I needed to provide a doctors note saying that.
She had me call my terminal to ask what exactly the note needed and they said a ""diagnosis"" of why I couldn't give a sample. The doctor told me she could not diagnose me with anything as there was nothing wrong with me and couldn't put one so she gave me a note with her business card to make sure Fed Ex called her directly so she could explain.

I dropped off the note and the drug test sheet to the ""boss"" of the terminal and he claimed he faxed them over as soon as I gave it to him. He said he would let my boss know when he heard anything from corporate Fed Ex as he said that is who is handling it.
It has been 2 weeks since I went there with 0 communication from them telling me any updates. I have texted my bosses every morning up until about a week ago when they stopped replying to my texts.

personalfinance,18 yrs old - need advice on what I deserve for pay,"In advance, I just want to say please read everything through before commenting. I don't want any ""you kids are so entitled"" because that's not at all what this post is about.

I've worked at local technology store that makes a good amount of business for 13 months now. I've only been on a weird part-time type schedule for the past year. I was full-time 40hrs over 5 days during last summer and then when I went back to school and only did 3 days for 18 total hours. During this past summer I was scheduled 3 days for 24 hours but many weeks I worked 32 hours over 4 days because we're short staffed.

I started at $10/hr which is a little above min. wage around here and I just received a raise to $12/hr. Normally I would think this is a good raise, but I know some of my co-workers who don't bring the same skills to the table make $13/hr to $15/hr and are a few years older than me (21-25).

Those skills include:

* Only person proficient enough in Photoshop to make ads/signs (although rarely called upon)

* Only person who knows how to manage our website (run through Wordpress so it doesn't require too much maintenance)

* Very knowledgeable with Apple Software (We deal with a lot of Apple Products &amp; customers have lots of questions)

On top of that, I have become a better salesman than I was when I started, can perform the majority of my job without any issues, and have most customers very pleased when they leave the store (only 1 complaint ever, multiple compliments). I have been late 2 times (5 minutes &amp; 10 minutes) and have called out twice (had the flu &amp; lost my voice). My only downside is that I am not there 5 days a week like others because I am committed to my education. They're flexible with my schedule which I appreciate but they also really need good employees and they're hard to find.

I just received this raise the other day. Should I speak with my boss about getting a competitive raise? (I can get $13-17 at some stores/warehouses nearby)",finance

I'm 30/M and I have racked up about $18k CC debt over the last ten years, from stupidity, traveling and some medical payments. I have addressed that I have a spending problem and don't use my CCs anymore, and instead use the cash method or just go without. I have:
CITI at $8522 (19%) paying $219/month
Discover at $4606 (22%) paying $114/month
Chase $3276 (14%) $50/month

Rent: $850
Car payment: $240
Student loans: $174
Car insurance: $95
Utilities and wifi: $130

I am actively looking for a new job to make more money as I haven't gotten a raise in 3 years and don't see any growth happening soon within my company. I have started driving for Uber on nights/weekends and try to make at least $50 a week (some weeks are harder than others) to have the extra money for CC payments. I'm also cleaning out my closet/house and selling things on Craigslist and Ebay. 

My question is, with me having such high interest rates on my CCs, is taking the offer of a $17k, 5 year fixed loan at 12% from SOFI to pay off the 3 credit cards, paying $388 a month the best option? I have a 730 credit score and have shopped around but this seems like the best I've got. If I get a better job, hopefully making $55k-$60k which is the average for my industry and having a Master's, I can afford to pay at least $450 on the loan, as I've created a budget for myself and will continue to live below my means. I can also make $300 a month driving for Uber that will go directly to that. It seems like it will be easier to just have Autopay go to one place, and will allow me to cut up my credit cards. I feel like I'm drowning and I would love to turn 35 and be debt free.

* VW will be giving me ~$18,000 
* I would like a fuel efficient vehicle as I drive a lot
* I have a ""used"" vehicle that will come with a roughly $8k tax credit that I could purchase tomorrow. Comes with a 3.2% interest rate.
* I have a ""new"" vehicle without the tax credit, but is roughly $6k less purchase price. Comes with a 0% interest rate.

**In Depth**

I'm deciding between a plug-in hybrid that I've found for roughly 7k off new MSRP price. All plug-ins come with, what will be for me, an ~$8k tax credit. As I make about $100,000 this will be incredibly helpful to me. The other vehicle is also a hybrid but is not plugin. 

The first vehicle will cost me about 29k out the door (not counting money down) with a 3.2% interest rate. The second will cost me about 23-24k with a 0% interest rate. The first is ""used"" but title-less, the second is totally brand new. 

With the first vehicle, I honestly love it. But when I break it down, the least I'll owe on it out of the gate is 16k at a 3.2% interest rate. However, once the tax credit goes through, I can reinvest my refund right into that loan. Also, it will basically be gas free for me as the commute would be covered totally by the battery. All that said, my monthly note with the loan and the insurance will be about 500/month if I trust these calculators. But I don't know how much it would be after a refinance.

The second, I get to drive it as a manual even though it's hybrid and I love that. It also gets about 58mpg which will be super great. But not as good as infinite. Also, there is no tax rebate to cash in at the end of the year. But, 0 interest is literally free money. That never happens. My monthly note with insurance would be about 300/month.

Everything that we discussed was relevant and essential to Komodo; it does not concern the upcoming announcement.


The following is my best attempt to capture what he explained to me. 


If you find this article helpful, you may contribute to jl777 and Komodo as a whole by investing and engaging in the community.


And you may also send me a tip at the addresses at the bottom.


**A brief first-pass description**


To understand Komodo, we need to understand that blockchain technology is a complex and rapidly evolving economy. 


Problems are legion with any blockchain.


But, furthermore, blockchains that attempt to remain anonymous and decentralized have an exponentially more difficult time over blockchains that instead go back to centralization.


For absolute newcomers: decentralized means that ""basically everyone is in charge,"" whereas centralized means that ""a small group of people can take control."" 


There are advantages and disadvantages to both routes, and benefits and costs to both routes as well. 


Decentralization is the hard way, and it is the way that blockchain inventor and Bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, meant all of this ""blockchain stuff"" to be. 


It prevents a small group of people (like ""The Federal Reserve Bank"" in the USA) from taking control over everyone else.


But keeping things decentralized is difficult.


Add in privacy and anonymity on top of that...and things become exponentially more difficult.


The Komodo team is comprised of several industry innovators who seek to stay true to this difficult road.


In spirit, among other things, Komodo embraces the phrase, ""Power to the people.""


**Getting more technical.**


At the core of Komodo is simply the philosophy of providing a service to the blockchain community: simplification, reducing costs, security, and anonymity/privacy are a few of its core offerings.


As more and more blockchains appear, each with their own purpose and intended audience, it will become more difficult for each blockchain to find a place in the world.
Komodo offers services to these blockchains that enable them to be more secure and cost effective.


As an example, say you have an entrepreneur who wants to run a niche-market blockchain. The project will only ever interest 10,000 people, and that's okay. The problem is, in order for the entrepreneur to run this blockchain, she would need lots of people from the outset to help, including nodes to keep track of how people are spending their coins and and computers working to secure the network from an outside attack (which would, theoretically, ruin the entire project).


Instead of trying to do everything from scratch, the entrepreneur could start from the Komodo framework and kind of ""link off"" of it with her own audience. On a daily basis, for instance, she and her audience would do their sales and swaps with her customized currency, but at the end of every day (just by way of example), for security purposes they would ""check in"" with the Komodo framework. 


The Komodo framework, being far larger and more secure, would run things over and make sure that nothing's changed.
To do this ""check in"" would cost a transaction fee on the Komodo framework, which would be paid in KMD.


So, Komodo is the business, the asset chains are the consumer. 


When you buy KMD now, as potentially more and more asset chains appear and use KMD, the KMD supposedly becomes more valuable.


Also, you can get a 5% rate of interest on your KMD holdings while you wait. All you have to do is swap your coins around a little bit between wallets, to show that you're still alive and kicking.


In addition, Komodo offers a few services that are rare, if not non-existent, elsewhere.


One of the foremost among them is privacy in transactions. It can hide who the sender and recipient is of each payment, as hide how much was transacted.


Komodo has some of the most competitive technology in this area, having acquired much of it from ZCash and from the experience of the team on their previous project BitcoinDark.


The logo of the Knight and turtle shell, therefore, show what Komodo is about: Security (the shell), and the right to privacy (that is, ducking inside your shell, when you choose).


Finally, for everyday non-programmers, like me, Komodo also offers services. You can trade coins on the Komodo platform (like Bitcoin to Litecoin, for instance), just like you would in an exchange. You can also use coins that are tethered to fiat prices, which would give a much needed amount of stability in this cryptocurrency environment.


That's about it! I took up my position in KMD earlier today and will be hodling through the upcoming market chaos (crazy dips and rises) that is to be expected with the announcement.


Performing this investigation and putting it together into a shareable form took roughly 9 hours of my time. If you found it valuable, tips are appreciated at the following addresses.


Happy trading!

Bitcoin,In response to the large thread on the front page about Inflation/Deflation because a LOT of the commenters seem to be unfamiliar with the economic reasoning behind a limited money supply...,"Deflation is a boogeyman because of nominal debt. Governments use inflation to reduce debt burden. That's the short of it and why there is an incentive to mislead the public from a fair evaluation of the economic consequences of inflation. It is a hidden tax, and that's it.

**Reposting these two comments I made in other threads**:

""Inflation is a tax on patience. It biases present investment and consumption opportunities over future ones. You can think of savings as an investment in an economy that does not exist today but may in the future. It is a bet against the current array of opportunities which can help one avoid systemic risk.

If you think society is going the wrong direction, you can both avoid the pitfalls of that trajectory and help shift it by betting against the economy through saving instead of investing or consuming. It is basically a meta investment.""

""Savings can be understood as a potential investment in some future enterprise or consumption of a future good. So people do not and would not save indefinitely or for no reason, they are saving for when a suitable opportunity in line with their time preferences presents itself.

One thing your contingency ignores [savings death spiral] is self-employment. In a scenario where savings is extreme (and improbable), households may become more autarkic, meaning self-sufficient. This would reduce the division of labor and the efficiencies normally gained from it, but perhaps it may in certain situations (such as a widespread decrease in social trust) be rational. That is a minor point though, just to illustrate that an extreme level of savings could be rational.

Normally, the general level of savings would not be so extreme. Eventually, the increase in savings would cause entrepreneurs to accept very high interest rates on loans, above the rate of appreciation of the money unit. So, savers would make more money by investing than by saving. We can assume the level of savings would then equilibrate.

What would probably happen (under normal circumstances) in an economy with a deflationary currency is that time preferences would be reduced, which in a simplistic sense, means that people would be less wasteful, more prudent and patient, which would raise productivity. Additionally, long-term growth in productivity would be raised due to reduction in the severity of business cycles; the artificial severity that is caused by inflationary monetary policy.""

The arguments against deflation in the other thread are basically just repeating the government's propaganda. If you are going to argue for inflation, at least argue from the standpoint of political convenience because that's where it finds its purpose.

The mistake is the result of *aggregating* consumption and investment opportunities *over time*. ""We need to increase the economy's investment-juice, stat!"" When these opportunities are disaggregated, it is clear as day why inflation biases present opportunities over future opportunities. This bias impedes the economy's ability to correct itself, thus creating systemic risk.

The deflationary death-spiral fable is a such a pile of garbage, you'd have to be a Phd student to believe it.",cryptocurrency
Ripple,Capturing other value,"The illustrious sjoelkatz mentioned in another thread how the value of XRP can be increased via additional use-cases, so I decided to spend some time this morning thinking about this, and what markers we can look for to help us guess how progress is going on that front.

By my dumb-ass eye, the biggest problem with crypto is regulations.  To see what I mean, consider the case of marijuana laws in the USA.

If we look at states that have legalized weed in the USA (e.g., Colorado), the biggest problem the industry faced/faces is banking.  Federally, weed is illegal and banks are not supposed to deal with crime profits.  That means these otherwise legal dispensaries are forced to do business in cash as no bank wants to accept deposits from them and risk federal regulatory/legal problems.  Crypto is in a similar boat; it exists in a regulatory grey area, which means businesses, especially large ones, are going to be hesitant to adopt it as a form of payment.  If Ripple manages to jump through these regulatory hoops, be it in the USA, Japan, or other countries, then it will open the door for XRP to be accepted as payment for goods and services much more easily.  This is the most obvious use-case, but also the most competitive.

For example, XRP could be used as an alternative to internet payment services such as PayPal or simply using your credit card (or be hooked into existing services such as Uber).  There are a surprisingly large number of people who simply don't have a credit card due to poor credit or simply not wanting one, and using XRP in this fashion will not only drastically cut down costs for vendors who pay large fees to Visa and MasterCard, but also reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud, and allow those who don't have a credit card to easily make online purchases without having to buy a Visa gift card or a take out a secured credit card.  Again, a lot of coins are going down this avenue, but Ripple's banking ties likely (or at least hopefully) put it out near the front of the pack.  In fact, if banks need XRP for international transfers, I would guess the'd be happy to convert XRP to fiat for corporate customers.  From the services point of view, I would guess a lot of companies like Uber pay an arm and a leg in fees due to transferring in-and-out of multiple currencies, so using XRP behind the scenes will likely save them a lot of cash. (sidebar: Japan has a large manufacturing sector that specializes in component parts.  This means lots of companies from all over the world have to hold Yen to buy parts from Japan, then use those parts to make their own products.  If XRP becomes legal tender in Japan/[insert country here], companies could hold XRP instead of Yen/[insert currency here] and save a fortune on fees and lost productivity due to international transfer times.)  

Assuming the regulatory questions are addressed, a possible avenue for capturing value that may be unique to XRP is using XRP as a safehaven for investments.  If XRP gets adopted by banks, then it is likely safe to assume that XRP, as an asset, has achieved a high level of price stability.  Yes, the price may fluctuate over time, but it will generally trend upwards due to growth in the global economy, and should be more stable than the stock market as it will/should be less susceptible to boom-bust cycles.  Thus it is theoretically possible that XRP will be viewed by investors much the same way they view bonds: as a safe, stable investment. (sidebar: this would be a HUGE market to tap into, at least by my dumb-ass reasoning).

Another interesting idea that came to mind in light of the Equifax hack is the idea of tying a unique Ripple wallet address to each individual, kind of like an improved SSN.  Of course, there is a philosophical debate to be had about this idea, but I haven't had enough caffeine yet to go down that rabbit hole.

Finally, I am not a finance guy so I am not sure how viable this idea is, but I could see Wallstreet building some complex financial instruments around XRP.  I mean, if they can turn my mortgage into a security, bundle it up with the mortgages from everyone else in my neighbourhood, then chop the entire package up six-ways to Sunday and sell it to some foreign investors, I am sure they will find a way to do something creative with XRP.  If they do, how this will influence XRP's price is a black-box to me; but nothing exists in a vacuum, and I am sure it will impact XRP in some fashion.

... I lied, I have one more idea: compensation.  Part of the reason executives like to be paid in stock is (i) they are taxed at a lower rate, and (ii) they tend not to lose value over time (aka $100 USD in 2000 has more purchasing power than $100 USD in 2017, but 100 share of company X are likely worth more in 2017 than they were in 2000).  Given that XRP also has these properties, I could see some companies turning to XRP as an additional form of compensation as there would be no regulations/laws that tell executives when they are, and are not, allowed to sell.",cryptocurrency
financialindependence,"25yo Canadian, trying to reach FIRE in the land of low salaries, and a year off before FIRE...is it possible?","Long time reader, first time poster. Before anything else, here is a snapshot of my finances:

Debt

1. 10k student loan (works as personal line of credit, 3.5% interest rate)

2. 280k Mortgage (2% interest rate)

3. 18k car loan (5.8% interest rate)

Income/position

1. 62k/yr salary (civil engineer, promotion is currently coming down pipeline)

2. part time masters student (tuition is 1000/semester)

3. RRSP - 15k (drained from home purtchase)

4. TFSA index funds - 5k

5. Cryptocurrency - 50k (started with 3k, 3 months ago and got lucky)

6. living in owner occupied duplex I purchased this year, top rents out for 750 (nothing included) and I live downstairs in the 3 bedroom. I rent out the other two rooms (all included) for 450/month each. Effectively, this means my rent is free.

I max out my rrsp, then contribute 900/month to my TFSA, and the rest goes to bills expenses etc, which I feel is high provided I dont have a rent to worry about. My largest expense is my car, which is a 2014 mini cooper countryman I purchased a year and a half ago, payments semi monthly of 232 dollars. I walk to work during the summer and have been thinking about downgrading, but its only 3.5 more years to be paid off, and I really dont know (because the resale value of a 2014 mini seems promising) if it would put me ahead in the long run. 

My financial goals:
1. Take a year long honeymoon with my partner once I a marry. Weve been dating for about a year now, but it would be in a classic volkswagen vanagon 1979 minivan converted to be useable, and we would do North america for half, South america for the other.

2. Have car paid off...

3. Be able to make 1000/month passively BEFORE I leave on the 1 year leave. I recognize that means that I would need 300k using the 4% rule, but the duplex once I move out would provide 300-400 a month, and my ETH miner currently provides me with about 150/month.

4. To be able to come back to a better job once I leave for a 1yr mini retirement

5. To take this mini retirement before kids

My plan was to purchase 2 more duplexes in the Nova Scotia area (one of the lowest paid provinces, but my family is here and I see many of them every week) before I leave. In Nova Scotia, you are allowed to put 5% down, so that means about (with closing costs) 20k per home. 

Could any of you veterans please give me guidance about any necessary changes I should make to reach these goals or adjustments to reach it faster? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I love this community, and one day, to truly be part of it.

personalfinance,Should I Get a Loan to Pay Off Credit Card Debt?,"Hi PF, 

I have 3 credit card balances with a total balance of about 25k. I've had these cards for a few years so they are definitely not on introductory interest rates. I checked one of the cards and I've been getting $100+ finance charges monthly so I can assume similar on the others. The debt is split pretty evenly across the 3. I got to this point because I got a job right out of school in tech making 65k. For a couple years I went to a bunch of music festivals, traveled, went out most weekends, and bought shiny new things. Nothing lavish or above my means, but sometimes unnecessary. I would put everything on my credit cards, and then whatever money I had left after rent/bills/student loans, I would just split that up 3 ways and make a payment on the credit cards. It was always above the minimum so I thought I was doing ok. It kind of hit me recently when I checked my credit score and saw that the biggest detriment to it was the high percentage of credit usage, which has slowly been crawling up recently. 

I'm now 26 and making ~75k and starting to see that despite high payments, I'm not doing well enough in bringing those balances down. I live in an expensive city and still have student loans, so after rent and those payments it gets hard to make significant progress in paying down my debt. I have used them much more sparingly recently, but even the small things add up. 

My question is: Is it wise to take out a personal loan to pay off that credit card debt in one fell swoop? I would hope I could get a better interest rate on a loan than what I have with the credit cards. I would just make 1 payment on that loan each month and not touch the 0 balance credit cards (barring an emergency) until I pay off the loan. I've done some research on this but some tailored advice would definitely be of help. Thanks!

personalfinance,Retirement savings vs. paying off mortgage (CAN),"Hello PF,

I am a new home-owner and am finally making enough money where I can save a decent amount of money monthly after paying my bills.

My question is, with interest rates on the rise and a 4-year fixed mortgage (2.49%), do I prioritize making bulk payments against my $440,000 mortgage, or contribute money to my RRSPs - my contributions are not matched by my employer.

Here's my sitch:

* I make $120k per year and my fiance about $75-90k
* $440,000 4 year fixed mortgage at 2.49%
* No contribution matching from my employer
* We are currently renovating so all of our savings ($30k) are ear-marked for that

My plan was to contribute the max amount to my RSP, and then use my large tax-return to make a bulk-payment on my mortgage. My mother-in-law is telling me I should not contribute anything to RSP and instead put as much towards my mortgage as I can, because when my rate is re-negotiated in 4 years interest rates could be much higher than current.

I’ve been calling around to different banks and credit unions to ask about interest rates on auto loans. My credit score is around 780. However, I have ~30k in student loans from undergrad that haven’t paid down as much as most loan providers would like. I have been on an income based repayment plan since graduating from undergrad four years ago, and just within the past year and a half have been able to make more substantial monthly payments on my loans. But anyway - the auto loan providers who I’ve applied with have all come back with much higher interest rates than I was expecting based on my credit (I'm getting offers between 6-8%). 

I’d love to hear if anyone has any advice on how to proceed - am I just going to have to eat it and take one of these loans at a higher interest rate, or is there hope to find something lower, taking into consideration my debt to income ratio? If I do end up taking one of the higher interest rate loans - is there any hope in refinancing and getting a better rate down the line? My student loans are deferred while I’m in school, and I’m not required to make any payments on them. I am however planning to pay off at minimum the interest that accrues on my unsubsidized loans, but it’s not likely I’ll be able to make any substantial dents on the principal. So I don't feel like refinancing while I'm in school is much of an option...

Any advice/thoughts/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Should also mention, many of the credit unions/banks I've talked to have stipulations on how old the used car can be (in addition to types of dealerships the car can be purchased from). Most I've talked to require the car to be 2011 or newer, one I've found requires 2007 or newer.",finance
personalfinance,I just got Navient to reduce my private student loan payment from $620 to $262 a month.,"I just wanted to share my story with this sub, since it's actually a years-old post from here that led to my success story.

Up to this point, my Navient student loans have represented the largest chunk of my monthly $1200 in student loan payments. I was struggling like hell to keep up, and all the odds were stacked against me in terms of having those payments lowered; it was a private signature loan, meaning I didn't qualify for any type of forgiveness or forbearance. It was also co-signed by dad, who has great credit and plenty of disposable income on paper, but in reality much of it is tied up in buying the business he inherited from my grandfather. I also was unable to refinance with any other lender, meaning I was pretty much stuck with the 10% interest rate from Navient.

Inspired by the post I read here, I called the number specifically for what they call their ""rate reduction program"" and explained my situation to a very helpful woman on the other end. She took a verbal statement from me about my monthly income and expenses, and based on that told me I may be eligible to have my interest rate reduced significantly. She did a soft pull on my credit, then asked me to have my co-signer call back and go through the same process.

The next day, I called back and got a different representative. He looked at the financial statements we had given the night before and told me that while I qualified for a concession, my dad had shown ability to pay and therefore the most he could offer was a six-month forbearance at a reduced payment of $560/month. I was crushed, but decided to ask for clarification anyway: ""so there is no way you're able to offer me the rate reduction program?"" He put me back on hold, and to my surprise connected me with the woman I had originally spoken to. She looked at my account and told me she could reduce my interest all the way down to 3%, bringing my monthly payment to $480. I pressed a little further, and she then offered to also increase the repayment terms from 10 years to 20 years, for a monthly payment of $262. She also readily offered the information that there would be no penalty whatsoever for paying off early. 

I was honestly stunned. After years of being stonewalled by everyday customer service reps at every lender because of my dad's financial situation, this lady was able to get me a solution in less than 24 hours that not only brought my payments down to a manageable amount, but do so while *significantly reducing* the amount I would pay over the life of the loan.

I'm telling this story in the hopes that someone else in the same situation can benefit from my experience. A few caveats that do bear mentioning:

* This is technically not a permanent rate reduction, it is considered a type of forbearance. It will initially last 15 months, at which point I will need to call and reapply for the reduced rate. I assume this will be based on changes in my income, and I'm prepared for the possibility that my payments will rise over time (although not beyond my old amount, since that agreement is still technically in effect.)

* It seems the program is very much at the discretion of the Navient rep you get, so it's definitely in your best interest to treat the first person you speak to with utmost respect and answer their questions as accurately as possible. I was 100% honest about my monthly income, all my monthly expenses and whether or not I could prove each one, and any assets I had (including a small retirement account that I was worried might disqualify me right off the bat). She in turn was 100% honest about my options and the implications of each.

* For the 15-month period of the loan, I had to give a debit card number that my payments will be automatically withdrawn from each month. I did get to choose the date of withdrawal, however if I ever have a payment fail to go through, I run the risk of losing my eligibility for the program.

* Finally, as the original post suggested, it seems this program is only available to those already delinquent on their payments. As of this morning I was about 15 days past due. (Unfortunately) from past experience, I don't believe this reached the level where Navient would have reported it to any credit agencies, but I won't know for certain until the next time I view my credit report. So while it wasn't an ideal way to go about things, I wasn't in a position to make the payment to begin with. I'm just glad that worked in my favor for once.",finance

My partner and I (both attending UC Berkeley) are thinking of getting married. She is a California resident, I am a permanent resident of another state. We are both US Citizens.
She makes $10k a year, I make $10k. I have around 7k in stock, she has maybe 1k in savings.

I have a couple questions. Does marriage to a California resident automatically confer me residency as well? How would my financial aid package look like (I tried going through my university but there's not enough resources - I've been on the waitlist to meet with a financial aid advisor for weeks now). I'm not sure exactly how FAFSA works, but is federal aid different from aid from the school? I used my university online financial aid calculator and it said I would have to take out 60k in loans, even with a combined income of 17k. I assumed this is because I am not a CA resident, but shouldn't the government still give me aid even if the school doesn't?

Lastly - how would I go about setting up an ironclad prenup (which law firms?). I know in some states income due to a degree obtained during marriage will have to be shared with your spouse for the rest of your life, and I would like to avoid situations like that. I just want that in the event of a divorce, things would just go back to how they started - no splitting assets, etc. Sorry to be blunt, but I'm not interested in any idealogical arguments as to why we shouldn't or should be married - any arguments should be related to the financial aspect of the situation only.

To start off, i am 18 years old just got my first credit card with a $500 credit line and 21.24% interest rate. I make roughly 550 a week and my monthly expenses are around 300.When i was getting the card i asked basic questions but didnt have time to ask everything i wanted because i had to head to work. So here they are:

1)If i buy something that is $250, Is it better to make multiple smaller payments before the end of the month? or just pay it out in full at the end of the month?

2)How does interest work? Does interest only apply if you dont pay by the end of the month? 

3)Is it bad to make big purchases like $450/500 and pay it off at the end of the month?

4) Does owning a credit card affect tax returns in any way?

[Congress Just Signed ""The Four-Wheeled Patriot Act""](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-08/congress-just-signed-four-wheeled-patriot-act), Zerohedge 9/8/2017

Leading argument from the article is, ""Whenever Congress does something unanimously (or nearly so) *you can rest assured it’s in their interests, not ours.* ... This is the law that exempts *automated* cars from the safety requirements that apply to *autonomous* cars – that is, the cars which are independent of government control and controlled by us.""

Edit: Actual bill (headed for Senate) is here, [SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3388/text)

Skimming through commenting on things of note.

* Takes away rights from States to pass regulations regarding design, construction, or performance of automated vehicles

* Cybersecurity of automated driving systems restricts manufacturers from selling products unless meeting certain standards. Item 3) is ""A process for limiting access to the self driving system"". This strikes me as providing the backing of federal regulatory power to limit the ability of product owners to work on their purchases equipment (see farmers struggle with John Deere, using copyright and locking down system in a way to make farmers dependent on service agreements. At what point do you no longer 'own' but only allowed to 'rent'?). Other end is that locking down access only makes the products less secure by barring independent security researchers from being able to audit the code, rip it apart and find security flaws that must be fixed. This system must be open to scrutiny or critical failings will exist causing harm far longer than necessary. Look to groups frequently finding creative flaws in vehicle automation systems to unlock. If there's a flaw, it will be found. Speed up that process.

* Requires rear seat occupant alert system. Anyone know the intent here? Is this an existing requirement in vehicles on the market? Assuming possibly related to air bags in the rear seats of the vehicle. 

* Requires manufacturer develop a privacy plan available to the customer. Looks like offloading the burden of thought onto the creativity of the manufacturer to load everything into Terms of Service, signing away every right in return to use the product. The standard Facebook model of Terms and Conditions. Posted actual language below for review. Obligatory recommended viewing for the documentary ""[Terms and Conditions May Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzDgBITDaRY)"".

&gt; (1) A written privacy plan with respect to the collection, use, sharing, and storage of information about vehicle owners or occupants collected by a highly automated vehicle, vehicle that performs partial driving automation, or automated driving system. Such policy shall include the following:

&gt; (A) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the way that information about vehicle owners or occupants is collected, used, shared, or stored.

&gt; (B) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the choices offered to vehicle owners or occupants regarding the collection, use, sharing, and storage of such information.

&gt; (C) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the data minimization, de-identification, and retention of information about vehicle owners or occupants.

&gt; (D) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to extending its privacy plan to the entities it shares such information with.

* ""(4) If information about an occupant is anonymized or encrypted the manufacturer is not required to include the process or practices regarding that information in the privacy policy."" - So if a company uses the weakest forms of encryption, or are lazy about anonymizing data ""there, I deleted the names column! anonymized!"", there is no requirement to inform the public how this process is taking place. That will lead to information collected neither anonymized or secure.

* Federal Trade Commission to provid enforcement of violations of the privacy policies.

Returning to the Zerohedge article, it builds out from the argument that automated vehicles are a means to limit a publics freedom of movement by a government. Imagine a revolutionary force trying to operate in a country without vehicles under independent control, if the means of transportation can be immediately turned off by the government in power that fight ends quickly. On the less radical considerations we have the ongoing domestic spying program that has wrapped itself around western societies. There is a discomfort with this idea in that once that control has been mandated, how does one erode it and return to independent freedoms?

At the core here what stands out to me is the big issue not getting enough attention - who owns data? What rights do individuals have to the data generated by their works or activities? Many of the abuses and mind numbingly stupid headlines we see today (see Equifax) are simplified by observing a publics **Right-to-Data**. **1) The individual gets final say regarding how their data is used, and shared, requiring explicit sign-off for those uses. 2) The individual holds the right to retract authorization for use of that data generated by them at any time.** These are modern privacy rights that really need to be fought over and amended into the US Constitution to observe the inherent rights of man in a modern age. Without this many of those already enshrined have been undermined and weakened, contorted into pretzels no longer recognizable.

So who do we trust? Zerohedge has a point in the current environment there is no shortage of examples of US government pushing bills saying ""no, just trust us. we left these parts vague and there are concerns but we'll shore that up and add detail later."" then lawyers are employed to maximize the size of the trailer that can by driven through those massive holes in the language. 

Automated driving is an incredible technology to bring to the world, but there needs to be careful thought and be wary of these systems becoming mandated. Now is the time to be wary and guard against autonomous driving becoming somehow ""illegal"" or infrastructure non-existent.

personalfinance,Does owing more than the initial loan balance affect my credit score?,"After moving into a high-paying field and lurking r/personalfinance, I have been aggressively paying off my student loan debt with a combination of snowball and avalanche methods. I have been paying off my high interest rate loans first, in order of size (smallest first). I have four student loans and 100% on time payments.

Today though, I looked at Credit Karma and saw the following line on my accounts page for one of the loans: ""You've paid off -8% of your student loan amount."" The loan is larger than when I started because of compounded interest due to forbearances I placed years ago (NEVER AGAIN!).

Does the fact that I owe more than when I took out the loan negatively affect my credit score? I could pay more to get it to 0+%, but this loan has a lower interest rate, so I've only been paying the minimum amount on it and focusing on my higher-interest loan.

personalfinance,(UK) Question regarding the interest rate of this savings account (AER/gross p.a. variable),"[Here is the account I am looking at.](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/flexone-regular-saver/features-and-benefits)

My question is about the interest rate. If you scroll down to look at the details, it says:

&gt; The balance on 12 monthly deposits of £100 paid on the first day of each calendar month with an interest rate of 3.50% AER/gross p.a. (variable) would be £1,222.75.

From a maths standpoint, I would have thought if you had the maximum amount of money, £1200, in the account on the final day of the year when the interest is paid, it would give you a final balance of 1.035*1200 which is equal to £1242 (103.5% of £1200). But according to the website, it gives you only £22.75 which is just more than half £42.00.

Reading what AER means at the bottom of that page makes me understand (perhaps incorrectly?) that it basically pays you 3.5% of the money held in your savings account at the end of the year, rather than each month of the year. If that understanding is correct then it should be paying £42 if you have the maximum amount of £1200 in the account.

I don't think this is to do with taxes either, or is it? It does say that the rate is a gross rate, i.e. before taxes, but this is a savings account in a 'child's' name, and I read elsewhere on the website that the personal savings allowance was much higher than £1200 per year. I don't think it would factor into it either but my 'income' currently is nothing, if I pass my upcoming job interview, my income will still fall under the 'personal allowance' tax bracket in the UK meaning I don't get taxed on it.

A couple hours later, I was meeting a friend to get him set up with a crypto wallet. I opened my Jaxx and the Eth balance was 0. And below there was a transaction out. I didn't do any transfers. So I looked at the tx on etherscan. Sure enough my wallet had been emptied and also my GNO coins all taken. I opened my imtoken wallet to see that my GNT and EOS tokens were also all transferred out.

I'm not sure how this could happen with a hacker just having access to my email. They must have remote access to my phone also to see the private keys which are not encrypted stored on the device. Not sure why it isn't, a lot of people use Jaxx and imToken as a quick mobile wallet. Security needs to be beefed up. I am usually very cautious and wary of fishing links and never click on them.

personalfinance,Simple questions on interest rates and mortgages,"1. How is interest calculated exactly? If I'm looking at buying a 170,000 home for 15 years at 3% interest, that's $5100. Since its APR, that means 3% per year, right? So over 15 years that's 76,500. However the mortgage calculator tells me that I'd be paying 41,000 over the course of the loan. How is that that number reached? Is it because of the reduced principle as time goes on?

2. On 15 year vs. 30 year, the calculator says 41k vs. 122k over the course of the loan. How? Shouldn't it simply be double, 41k vs. 82k? This is with both being 4% (although I know in real life they vary a bit with a lower rate for 15 year)

3. If the mortgage includes the interest up front for the first few years, how do you save on interest payments in a 30 year mortgage by paying it off sooner, if you've already paid the interest up front? Is it just not ALL the interest up front, only a bigger chunk at first?
Please help me understand, thanks!",finance
Bitcoin,The wedge between two worlds – An overview of Bitcoin as a reserve asset,"Much has been made of bitcoin as a reserve asset. Immune to the frailties of the centralised financial system, bitcoin is a secure store of wealth that is more accessible and liquid than gold. 

Historically, only sophisticated and high net wealth individuals have tended to store any portion of their wealth in gold. People of low to moderate socioeconomic status had very little alternative to storing their wealth in domestic currency. Bitcoin is not subject to such barriers to entry meaning for the first time in history, people of all socioeconomic classes are able to store a material portion of their wealth outside of the traditional financial system. 

The current growth and volatility in the price of bitcoin simply reflects that the asset class is in its infancy. The bitcoin market will inevitably reach maturity and the price will stabilise. The only hypothetical capable of explaining this process is as follows; imagine, that rather than the price of gold developing over centuries, gold had been invented overnight and the market was required to suddenly determine its price.  

The current volatility and degree of market manipulation in bitcoin will inevitably be supplanted by a more rational, sophisticated and highly liquid market. In comparison to established financial markets, the conduct of the bitcoin market could be properly characterised as child’s play. The eventual largescale entry of sophisticated institutional investors, including investment banks and hedge funds, will fundamentally legitimise the market and will allow bitcoin to be priced on a more rational and efficient basis. 

When the market reaches maturity, whether the price is $10,000 or $100,000, bitcoin will be subject to the core factors that determine the price of any reserve asset, including inflation, monetary policy, utility, economic performance, uncertainty and risk. When capital flees traditional fiat denominated assets, it will seek refuge in bitcoin. In the face of financial instability and risk, including geopolitical risk, people will be able to efficiently convert part or all of their fiat asset base to bitcoin – an asset that can be transferred to anywhere in the world and cannot be destroyed, nationalised or stolen provided the owner knows their private key.

The above concepts have been well covered in literature relating to bitcoin. However, in considering the reserve status of bitcoin, one factor that is commonly overlooked is that with the explosion in the value of the broader altcoin market, bitcoin now plays a significant role as the reserve currency in that market. 

The total value of all cryptocurrencies (excluding bitcoin) is over $50billion. Although we speak of this market value in USD, the market for altcoins is in fact denominated primarily in bitcoin. They are overwhelmingly purchased, priced and traded in bitcoin, not fiat. Bitcoin is the reserve of the altcoin market, meaning that as this market continues to grow, the structural significance of bitcoin will be further entrenched. In the event that there is a mass sell-off in altcoins, investors will seek refuge, at least at first, in bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is the bridge between the world of altcoins and the world of fiat; it is also the reserve currency of both worlds. Bitcoin’s core value proposition is as an alternative reserve asset, providing an accessible and liquid alternative to fiat currencies, but this value proposition will continue to be complimented by the structural role of bitcoin in the rapidly expanding altcoin market.    

Author’s note: I recognise that in addition to the factors considered above, the price of bitcoin will depend on the utilitarian value of the technology. As the underlying bitcoin technology is developed and applied, the price of bitcoin will increase. Valuing this aspect of bitcoin is complex and not within the scope of this article.",cryptocurrency

Let's say I pick one stock and its history prices of past 30 years, and price is given in a montly basis. And I use that as my Y.

For X, I use features like company revenues, profits, growth rate, etc for that company as well as interest rate, inflation rate. Also that data is spread in a monthly basis.

So the total sample size is about ~550 (80% used as training set and 20% as testing set) and currently I am just using various shallow layers (1-3) and with various hidden units in each layer (2-30) along with combinations of different learning rate, optimizers, batch sizes etc. So far I couldn't get any good results.

-People in this thread are recommending Ally, Discover, and Capital One, which all have rates of 1.15%-1.2%. Some do have some requirements about how long it takes to transfer money and minimums you need for an account though.

-Other people are recommending investing, which sounds like a good option once I have a bit more

-NerdWallet and BankRate are two sites with helpful information for comparison here.

personalfinance,How to divide income between loans and everything else?,"Hey all,

I feel bad taking up space on this thread with my first world problems, but I am trying to learn how best to split my income to pay off debts while still having enough money on hand for other things. My assumption is that I am keeping too much in cash, but would love to hear from my fellow money nerds here are r/personalfinance. 

Currently, I have ~$90K in student loans left at ~3.8% interest, paying $875 biweekly (estimated payoff Dec. 2021). I will occasionally dump a few thousand extra into these loans when I have some extra cash (saved up, tax refunds, sell something, etc.). Only other standing obligation is rent/utilities and gym, and I pay off my credit cards in full each month. 

At last check, I had ~$54K in cash (~$18K savings at 1.2%, ~$8.5K checking at 1%, ~$25K checking at 0.6% interest), as well as ~$41K in investments (of which ~$14K is 401K and ~$8K IRA, the rest a bit more liquid). I just doubled what I am putting towards my 401K each paycheck from 5% to 10%, but take-home pay is still ~$2500 every two weeks. 

I believe my cash hoarding stems from a time of relative poverty (food stamps, credit card maxed out, begging from parents) a few years ago, so I have been hesitant to dip too low. Also, my larger checking account is with Ally, so if I dip below $15K there the interest rate drops to 0.1%. My current line of thinking is to switch all checking over to my Aspiration account paying 1% on all balances, but not sure how closing the Ally account may affect my credit, since I've had it a couple years longer than Aspiration. Also, clearly, I should probably put some towards my loans to pay them off faster, but again I'm not sure how best to allocate. 

Any tips would be much appreciated, the advice I've gotten from here so far has always been helpful.",finance

Or perhaps I should start another account since I can budget some money to go into retirement every paycheck.

Okay. So. I'm finally graduating in May but with a load of debt that I did not imagine when I first started school.

Let me start off and preface by saying that I am an accountant by trade, and in fact I am only about a half year of experience short of being a full-fledged CPA, so I have a pretty good handle of smart finances. 

With that being said, my mom's uncle passed away suddenly a few months back and left my mom and her cousins a sizable inheritance, with my mom receiving about $200k, before any taxes on IRA/401k distributions. From a tax perspective, I have my parents covered. However, I am wanting to cover everything to make sure she is making smart choices from a personal finance perspective and for investing. 

Below I list out my recommended steps:
1. Set aside appropriate sum to cover federal/state tax on distribution from estate
2. Pay off credit card balances, approx. $10k (been barking up this tree for too damn long)
3. Pay off any miscellaneous debts
4. Set aside reserve fund to avoid getting into credit card debt again
5. Stuff remainder into passive investment account
5(a). Invest 60-40ish in bonds/stocks
5(b). Stay away from high expense ratio funds and exorbitant fees
6. Contribute max contribution limit to Roth IRA annually (dad still works, so still eligible)
7. Go to an attorney and get a will/revocable trust prepared
8. Reevaluate insurance levels (AFAIK they are not over or under insured)

personalfinance,401k vs Federal Retirement Plan,"I've received an offer for a federal government position, but the salary is the same as my current job. The main reason I'm considering this position is because of the retirement plan, but I'm looking for some insight on whether the federal retirement plan makes sense for me financially. 

My current company's retirement plan has a 401k that has a unique employer matching system - they contribute X% of your salary based on your age, regardless of your own contributions. These contributions are vested immediately. I've maxed out my 401k contributions annually since I started working (I max out my IRA as well), but it would be nice if there was additional incentive for doing so. See below for how they do the employer contributions.


Age | Contribution for First $26k in Calendar Year | Contribution for Remaining Salary in Calendar Year
---|---|----
&lt;35 | 6.34% | 6.34%
35-44 | 7% | 10%
45-54 | 9% | 14%
55+ | 14% | 19%


The federal retirement plan consists of the TSP, Basic Benefit and Social Security. The TSP functions like a 401k and they match your contributions dollar for dollar up to 5%. The Basic Benefit is the pension plan that pays out based on the following formula: Years of service * 1% * high-3 average salary (highest average pay earned during 3 consecutive years of service), but also requires a payroll deduction of 4.4% of my gross salary. Social Security also requires a payroll deduction, but since it's hard to predict what I will be getting out of it during retirement, I've decided to exclude it from my decision making.

Here are some assumptions I'm making.

* The plan is to either stay at my current company for 30 more years or work for the federal government for 30 years. I will be eligible for retirement at this point.

* I'm only expecting cost of living raises at either position (1-3% annually)

* I plan to continue maxing out my 401k or TSP annually regardless of the position

* My gross salary is the same at each position ($100k)

* I am in the &lt;35 bracket at my current company for another 4-5 years

personalfinance,Wife and I need help in making the right investment to get my parents out of poverty.,"First of all, I want to thank absolutely everyone who has contributed to this subreddit. I was never taught how to save and invest for retirement since my family was poor and lived paycheck to paycheck but thanks to all of you I have come a very long way!

&amp;nbsp;


So here is the situation:

My parents (53 and 51 years old) currently only have about $20,000 saved up for retirement in my mom's 401k account.  They also have about $1,000 in their savings account.  They bought the house where they currently live in 2003 for $205,000 with an adjustable rate mortgage. The house is currently worth $284,000. The ARM plus the fact that they took out a huge loan from the house in 2009 has set them back quite a bit. They now owe $370,000 on their house. They are paying roughly $1,200 a month with a fixed rate mortgage after they refinanced.




Currently only the $284,000 is building interest and the bank has placed a hold on the remaining $86,000 to make it easier for them to pay. My parents make just enough money to pay the mortgage, bills, and basic living needs.  Because they are fantastic people, any extra money they ever had was invested in their children’s education (They had saved and paid off my $80,000 school loan which allowed me to start my work life debt free).




Now I live in the Bay Area and my wife and I (26m 25f) make approximately $190,000 minimum (assuming neither of us get bonuses or work overtime) but the figure is closer to $200,000 a year. We both put $18,000 in our 457b and $5,500 in our Roth IRA with Vangaurd. On top of that, we have a 6-month emergency fund and all of our finances are taken care of. I've come up with a plan to help my parents and try to get them back up on their feet and I'd like to see if it's the best option possible.

&amp;nbsp;


Since my parents owe so much on the house they currently live in, I want them to go ahead and short sell their house which will, to the best of my knowledge, leave them debt free and ruin their credit. 

&amp;nbsp;

I will then go ahead and buy them a house for $350,000 under my name which will also be my primary residence. My wife and I have zero debt and zero loans. We currently rent a 1 bedroom and will continue renting after we buy the house. We have a couple of credit cards that we pay off fully each month and our credit score is 797 (me) and 776 (her). We still have to shop around but the one bank I have talked to so far has approved me for either a 30-year fixed at 3.5% or a 15-year fixed at 2.75% and both would be with 5% down-payment. My thought is that I want to go with the absolute least amount of monthly payments and the least amount of down payment (which is 5%) because interest rates on mortgages are so low and any extra money we have is better off being invested elsewhere. 

&amp;nbsp;


The 30-year fixed at 3.5% will require a monthly payment of $1,914.82:




Sale Price: $350,000

Down payment: $17,500

Loan Amount: $332,500

Principle and Interest: $1491.22

Property Tax: $85

Insurance Premium: $225

Mortgage Insurance: $113.60

Total: $1914.82

&amp;nbsp;

Since my parents can only contribute $1,200 a month, I will be making up the difference which amounts to a payment of $1,914.82-$1,200= $714.82 per month. The idea is that I'd rather have $1,200 month of my parent's money to go into a house that is worth paying for rather than a $370,000 mortgage that will take a lifetime for them to pay. After my wife and I max our 401k, Roth IRA, pay rent for our 1 bedroom apartment, pay bills and groceries, and a little set aside for fun money we will have about $30,000 (after tax) left over. 

&amp;nbsp;


At first, I thought of using that money to pay off the house earlier. But after some reading, I realized that since interest rates are so low, it's much smarter to put any extra money you have available into a taxable brokerage account.


&amp;nbsp;


After even more thinking I realized that since my parents are very close to the age of retirement, it would be even smarter to place any extra money I have into my parent's Roth IRA account (which would be a total of $13,000 per year since they're over 50 years old) and after that is maxed out, my mom's 401k account (which would be a total of $24,000 per year). And just to clarify, we would do this by having my mom contribute to her 401k and I would be paying my mom what she normally would make had she not contributed. If we do this, that means the money would be accessible in 7-9 years with no penalties if we ever find ourselves needing it. 


&amp;nbsp;


More specifically, I plan on moving them out of the house after a couple years and buying another one while renting the old one so that eventually it can be used as supplementary income during their retirement. The extra cash on their Roth and 401k is going to be an awesome safety net when I get to that point. 



My parents are extremely frugal and I will be in 100% control of their money and we trust each other tremendously so other than the fact that this money is going to be sitting in their account, what pitfalls do you guys see with this plan? From what I've read, I think this is the best way to move forward.


&amp;nbsp;


Question 1:

Do you guys have any suggestions on doing things differently than how I've described? 

&amp;nbsp;


Question 2:

We can currently rent the house my parents currently live in for at least $1450 per month which would mean a profit of $250 per month. My dad suggested renting the house out instead of short selling it but he is okay doing either. What do you guys think?

CryptoCurrency,"Welcome, Agrello - Skynet's Antithesis","Hello everyone. I'd like to articulate further on Agrello and what they wish to offer to the world. This is an enormous project that is potentially global in scope, limited to no single country, but meant for all. There is a rapidly growing community presence for this project, which I deem appropriate for what Agrello is truly worth.


The AI aspect of Agrello's platform will not only match users to their relevant smart contract template, but it will, additionally, alert the client of his or her legal obligations and rights. With the assistance of the AI feature, both parties will not have to dwell in ignorance of the minutiae involved in contracting. Statutory and federal legislation in many countries is too often esoteric in nature to the common citizen. This WILL change. Their AI, if implemented successfully, will prove to stand as an powerful utility in their total product. Too often do people get swindled, one way or another, from contractor to contractee, employer to employee, and so forth. Agrello aims to break down and resolve this societal problem through their philosophical approach. I believe this is Hando Rand's intent.


During the rise of the Industrial Revolution, the necessity for large workforces arose to meet production demands. Humans became machines of flesh and bone. With the increasing demand for such workforces, came the nefarious means of which to employ such volumes of people. Unfair wages and working conditions were the main opponents of the working class at that time. Law is designed to protect the livelihood of people. Without it, justice is simply nonexistent and impossible. This is the fundamental role of law.


Just as the body responds to foreign bacterial organisms and viral entities with antibodies, workforces all around the world eventually joined together to form unions as a response. As individual workers, an employee stood nearly no chance. Unions were an attempt to fight against the terrorism inflicted upon the working class.


Justice is at the core of legislation. Law is the ether that engulfs every single human being on this planet, from the 1% to the remaining 99%. Without a perfectly resilient legal system, people will continue to endure the many pangs that infect our system. I believe that Agrello is the next generation attempt at creating that perfectly resilient legal system. 



My fellow Redditors, ask not what Agrello can do for you - ask what you can do for Agrello.

If you would like to support me in my continuing efforts of elaborating what Agrello prepares to do, please refer to the addresses below. Thank you for your time, concern, and attention.

CryptoCurrency,A thread about a town in Switzerland accepting Bitcoin to pay tax has inspired me to educate people on this seemingly unpopular opinion,"I saw a post earlier celebrating the fact that a town in Switzerland is accepting Bitcoin to pay taxes. Within this thread, the most upvoted comments were of the mindset, ""I like taxes and pay them gladly, if you don't shame on you"". I find this mindset very counterproductive to one's self interest. To quote my reply verbatim, here you go:

&gt;The idea of ""taxation is theft"" HEAVILY depends on the context of the taxation.
For example, the ""taxation is theft"" ideal can easily be applied to American income tax. I don't have the time nor the patience to explain the workings of the Federal Reserve and central banking in a reddit post, but essentially the U.S. government spends money they don't have through a process of deficit spending, then they sell bonds to the banks, who in turn sell these bonds to the Fed, which they own a share of (Which makes the Fed not federal at all, as no government agency is owned by shareholders).

&gt;When they sell these bonds to the Fed, they create more currency in circulation, as the Fed doesn't pay out of pocket, but instead generates more currency.
This process is why the American Debt Ceiling constantly rises. And who is tasked with paying it off? You guessed it: working class. We pay it off through INCOME TAX. The fact that income tax was put into law in the same year the Fed was founded is no coincidence.

&gt;This whole process is FRAUD, therefor American income tax is theft.
The worst part is, the debt ceiling heightens proportionally to the amount of money used to pay it off, so it can LITERALLY never be paid off. There is no way to escape this debt unless you avoid income tax.
Currently, each American born owes about 250k to the U.S. government as soon as they are born due to income tax (assuming they are working class). This debt will span generations to your kid, and your kid's kids, then your kid's kid's kids, etc. Income tax is our most unfair tax.

&gt;Edit: To comment on what u/Ecologisto specifically said: Governments rely on working class with the same mindset as you to pay tax, while the people at the top of the pyramid scheme sit back and laugh. They especially find it funny when you see yourself as a good citizen and get pissed when other working class citizens don't pay taxes, so you in turn reprimand them. I don't mean to sound rude, but I'm just stating a perspective.

As I had said in the reply, in the context of income tax, the people at the top of this pyramid scheme love it when you pressure your fellow working class into abiding by our most unfair tax. This mindset is dangerous not only to yourself, but to others. I think cryptocurrencies have a huge potential to undermine income tax and the Federal Reserve, and I don't think this potential should be viewed as shameful.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Take a bank loan to pay off a car loan?,"Not too long ago I took a bank loan to  pay for school, I also consolidated son debt (paid off credit cards and my toolbox) that loan ended up being $10,000 over a 3 year term its at about $7,600 left on it now. Now I've also got a car loan through a different bank, set up by the dealer.  The opening balance of that loan was $39,781.65 in 15 days I will have been paying into it for 2 years and it has a fixed interest rate of 6.49% per year. I currently still owe $30,604.01 after paying it down for 2 years paying $275.25 biweekly. If I take a loan from my bank to pay off the car loan, I've got to be able to get a better interest rate or something right? Make similar payments but pay it off quicker? If so should I just combine my current bank loan and the car loan? Or pay off the bank loan first then do it?. . . .  or is this all just a pipe dream and I'll get a similar interest rate from the bank? Another reason I'm interested in this, is I'll actually be able to keep live updates on how much I still owe and be able to make extra payments into the loan when I can afford it, and that's always good right?

personalfinance,0% interest credit cards vs. a low APR.,"My wife and I have ok credit and we have been getting 0% interest credit card offers for years. At first we thought it was a good idea to transfer all our balances to the 0% card and paying it off little by little as extra money would afford. Then, when the 0% timeframe was about to expire, we would get a new 0% card and transfer the balance to the new card.

Of course we started with a smaller amount and the balance transfer fees we not that large but now that we have basically consolidated all our debt into this one sum, each transfer is adding a fair amount to the total.

If we were to get a loan with a low APR or even a credit card with a low Interest rate, would we be saving money? I'm not sure how the interest rates work on credit cards. Is it monthly interest added on the outstanding balance every month or is it an average added over the course of year?

Bitcoin,China bans Bitcoin trading exchanges. They will create their own version of Fedcoin. Here's why,"Please note that anytime I've put China in the title and exposed a negetive truth about China i get a lot of downvotes. Your offsetting upvote is greatly appreciated if you agree. 

China's debt problem is far worst than anyone can imagine. But China looks at the US and sees that the people can be kept ignorant of the danger. 

Bitcoin is a global financial safe haven and an obstacle to the debt blinding ponzi scheme. Central Banks print currency out of thin air creating perceived wealth that actally steals value from existing currency by diluting it. Bitcoin is fixed and deflationary and offers an alternative to fiat as a store of value. China knows that if the majority of their citizens discover this difference, their ability to hide debt by printing more Yuan is futile. 

The US eliminates political leaders who move away from the dollar reserves. China is elbowing their currency to compete and replace the dollar as the world currency. Most recently in oil trading. Bitcoin is a non-political option to both. China sees this and is taking the step to eliminate the competition. 

China's next step will be to ban Bitcoin and all crypto except its own version of Fedcoin, possibly Bcash in my estimation.  Bitcoin is still in its embryonic state but the more the world sees what Bitcoin is against inflationary fiat and the Central Bank debt hiding ponzi scheme, the higher the demand.  

We must replace the media push of Bitcoin as an illegal criminal tool with the protection of wealth against inflationary Central Bank debt hiding fiat.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Why I fear the mass adoption of crypto,"It’s been almost 10 years since the last major crisis, the financial crisis.

After this crisis, the actions of central banks and governments around the world have facilitated a huge run up in asset prices, but also in debt. The total debt in the world is now so large that should interest rates go up to long term averages, there will be considerable difficulty to service the debt. What’s more, because of the low benchmark interest, investors looking for larger returns have invested in more and more risky assets. And because the recovery is one sustained by financial instruments, it has almost only benefitted the wealthy/corporations, again making it more difficult for a real (retail) recovery to happen.

These three factors have resulted in a hugely unsustainable situation that requires cheap money to continue to grow the GDP at a very low level.

Seeing all of this, many commentators have predicted a huge crisis over the last years, and so far it hasn’t really come. As long as the music is playing (cheap money) and confidence stays high, that’s not going to happen anytime soon, I guess. But knowing all of this, central bankers and others in charge of the world economy must either be ignoring the situation or planning for it. I hope/think they have, and I think crypto currencies have been invented or at least supported by the international community for exactly that reason:

To facilitate a semi smooth transition away from USD and other fiat currencies, and prepare for a big reset.

Now, the next part is even more thin foil hat-ey, but bear with me. Seeing how ‘stupid’ the central banks and governments have acted before, during and after the crisis, it’s almost like they wanted this to happen. And since globalisation has always been a stated goal of the international ‘responsible’ class, and crypto currency at some point perfectly serves a world in which money can be moved without borders and without laws, the invention and promotion of crypto currency could very well fit within these goals.

How you feel about this depends on your political believes I guess. Seeing as a large part of the crypto world is right-wing libertarian, I imagine the above doesn’t sound so bad. I believe corporate power is as much of a threat to people as is government power. What’s more, crypto seems to me to increase inequality over time. For these reasons, I fear the mass adoption of crypto currencies, even though I am excited about replacing the current monetary system.

I think crypto/blockchain can be an incredible force for good, but in the ‘wrong’ hands, it can also become incredible destructive. Keep an open mind.",cryptocurrency

I keep seeing that I should have more saved away for an emergency fund, while others are saying to put more into a 401K or figuring out maxing out a ROTH account, while others are saying that paying off student loans first and foremost is what I should do, others are saying start investing?? But, I guess also, I shouldn't be doing investing until loans are done with?

I'm 23, and have ~26K in student loans between 8 groups:  
~$2,400 with a 6.8% interest rate  
~$2,100 with a 4.66% interest rate  
~$5,200 with a 4.66% interest rate  
~$5,200 with a 4.29% interest rate  
~$2,000 with a 4.29% interest rate  
~$4,300 with a 3.86% interest rate  
~$2,100 with a 3.86% interest rate  
~$3,300 with a 3.4% interest rate

I've been using the avalanche method: minimum payments for the other loans and contributing a some extra money into paying off that 6% loan first. Payments have gone from ~$300 to ~$260 a month since, but I've still been maxing it out to $300/month for that 6%.

I'm wondering though if I should just take out the ~$2k from savings and pay that one loan off in full, then start contributing the extra money going towards that to one of the other higher loans like the 4.66% ones? Or if I need to save up more in my emergency fund before then, and if so, how much more?

I have $7k in savings, make $44k/year and get paid bi-weekly, monthly rent is $590+utilities. I stick to a budget, use my first paycheck on rent/bills/food and try to put the rest into savings, but apparently I should be doing so many other things financially too? I'm going a little crazy.

Maybe it's a bit rash, but I'm wondering if getting rid of that high interest student loan as a first move would be a smart and help in the long run? All of the other reddit posts I've read basically all arrived at the consensus of paying off the debt all at once. But my situation wouldn't be all at once, but it'd be ridding me of my highest interest loan for me to contribute more towards another one?

I'm sorry this got so long, any advice would honestly help...maybe sort out everything going through my mind all at once. :(

EDIT: Well, I WAS going to pay off the chunk of student loan and build my savings back up but my roommate just told me my depression's like a black hole and they don't want to live with me anymore, so now I'm just going to stress save more money for when our lease ends and try not to kill myself!

2: if the bank/credit union allows, Refinance my car at $18k with less than 50k miles on it get a payment closer to $300/mo (I plan to keep it till the wheels fall off anyways) then try to get a personal loan to pay off the $12k credit card so that my credit card account doesn't get closed, I keep the 10 year credit history, the credit usage % goes down, credit score goes up(?)

*The reason my car is so expensive is that at the time I bought it I had a job making $45k/yr (laid off) and bc it literally costs me nothing for gas I decided to keep it and bc I bought it brand new I'm way upside down on it.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance student loans and first mortgage,"Hello r/personalfinance
A bank in my area started a new student loan refinance program, that I am thinking of taking advantage of. One of the qualifications of the program is you have to have a mortgage with said bank. I am trying to crunch the numbers for myself to see if it makes sense for me to use the program.

I currently have a 30 year FHA mortgage fixed at 3.875% with a balance of about $122,000- I just took out this mortgage in Feb. 2017

I have about $36,000 in student loan debt at a variable rate. The current rate is 2.50%, and is up for potential increase at the end of Sept. The rate is based on the 3 month LIBOR+a certain percentage. my rate can't increase more than 1 full percent per calendar year, and can never go above 10%. This loan currently has a 25 year amortitazion 

I visited with a mortgage lender at the bank with the student loan program, who gave me a few numbers. Their current FHA rate is 3.375% fixed for 30 years, my total mortgage payment with P+I and escrow would probably go down by about 10$/month. They then also refinance the student loan as a separate (unsecured) note at a fixed rate of 1.75% for 10 years. I would then have to pay all closing costs of the refi out of pocket, which she said would be around $5,500. 

would it be worth my while to take a loan out against my car, which I currently own out right for the $5500 for say, 2 or three years at 3.49%.

the interest rate on my student loans right now isn't bad, but i worry about where the interest rates are headed, and by refinancing I could take my student loan debt from a 25 year repayment to a 10 year.

in essence, does it make sense to finance $5500 to pay for closing costs in order to lower my student loan interest rate, and shave 15 years off of my repayment.",finance
personalfinance,"Trying to pay off credit card debt, in a unique way.","Alright, here is the story. 
I was a not so intelligent college kid and racked up around $3,500 in credit card debt before I graduated. I have never once missed a payment, but the debt is still there. I am getting married in a few weeks which has not helped the payment situation either. 

I have been going over in my head how to pay off the debt in the best way, while also attempting to buy a home in July. I recently came up with an idea that I wanted to run passed a few of you. 

Currently, I can get about $5000 in trade in for my car. I was considering trading it in, using the money to pay off my debt and putting the remainder in a car loan. I would make sure to spend no more than 10K on the car, putting my payments around $200 a month. I figure that a 4% interest rate on a car loan has got to be better an 20% on a credit card. I also figure that a mortgage company is less likely to deny me for a car payment, than credit card debt. 

I know the best solution is to just pay the debt off aggressively and push off buying a home, but my current rent of $1300 is not something I want to stick with when I can get a cheaper home and be paying around $900.

stocks,The SLEEPER overvalued stocks...,"When people talk about overvalued stocks they always bring up companies with huge PE Ratios or Sales to Price ratios. Like AMZN, TSLA, NTFX, ect.

But IMO there is an even more dangerous class of stocks that are overvalued RIGHT NOW.

**I'm talking about Blue Chip stocks that have moderately high PE Ratio's but close to zero revenue growth.**

Look at some of these jewels:

1. GE:  29 PE : Negative 3% revenue growth

2. MCD: 26 PE : Negative 3% revenue growth

3. MMM: 24 PE : 2% revenue growth

4. WMT: 19 PE : 2% revenue growth

5. IBM: 12 PE : Negative 5% revenue growth

6. JNJ: 22 PE : 2% revenue growth

All of these stocks are easily 20-30% over-valued and could face multiple PE contraction.  Revenue growth is basically ZERO in industries that have very little growth in them.

The only thing keeping these stocks afloat is the trend in ETF's and low interest rates.  But eventually investors will exit these zero revenue growth stocks and assign them a more rational 10-12 PE ratio.",finance
gaming,"My top 50 games, #39-32","#39: The World Ends With You

The World Ends With You took me completely by surprise. From the outset I loved the aesthetic, and while the storyline sometimes edges on needless teenage angst it is compelling nonetheless. What really drives the story is the amazing cast of characters and the intriguing concept of the reaper game, where the dead get a chance to get brought back to life by competing in a gauntlet of challenges coordinated by a demon. You play a young troubled boy who had just been plugged for reasons unknown to him who is now at the whim of the Composer, some kind of Demigod who runs show around this stylized version of the Shibuya district in Tokyo.

There is a good amount of hype attached to building relationships with characters while playing a game that would latterly decide the fate of their life. You kind of know that sacrifices will be made but the exact nature of the sacrifice is unclear. These relationships never feel forced either, you care about them naturally over the course of the game rather than the story forcing them upon you. The obstacles you overcome together really make you feel apart of something bigger, and the main character seems to come out of his introverted shell as the story progresses. It just feels natural and believable and the writing is very well done.

A large part of the game involves exploring Shibuya while completing missions at the behest of conductors, who are like demons or something. You scan and fight “noise” monsters in a dual screen battle, trying to pull off combos using pins to dictate what motions your character will do as you swipe furiously around the bottom screen, and control the top with buttons if you are really hardcore. You have to base your characters move set off what fashion trends are popular in each area, making certain moves more effective and layering in some tactics. There is another level of strategy to choosing your moves as certain pins just naturally synergize with others, and as the game progresses you will naturally realize what works and what does not. It all feels very fluid, never tedious. There is a bunch of random minigames as well and there is some degree of puzzle solving stuffed into the already quite robust experience.

The games themes are quite deep, dealing with societal isolation, the superficiality of life, and the importance of friendship and love in this messed up world of ours. The World Ends With You is a game that has a lot to say and really makes you want to hear it. The game really picks up towards the end when more important plotlines come to light and you start to realize the deeper darker forces at work. Really the game just oozes feeling and you can tell that the creators really put a lot of work and love into this story, I strongly recommend it for anyone with a DS if not for its inventive gameplay than for the interesting tale it weaves.


#38: Ratchet and Clank 3

Some games do not covet pomp and circumstance. Some games are just for simple enjoyment. Ratchet and Clank falls solidly into this category. The story and characters are not complex, but the gameplay is addicting and the environments colorful and varied. There is a sense of progression deeply rooted into the core of the game so that you always feel like whenever you pick up the sticks to play you achieve something. Not to mention that some of the moments in the game are satirical and hilarious, and the titular characters Ratchet and Clank have a fabulous dynamic, that leads to another layer of entertainment.

Later sequels of the game are not exactly my favorites so I want to give special consideration to the third game, titled Up your Arsenal. The games after the third installment, while still good, never quite gripped me like this one. This one nailed weapon upgrades like no other game I know, even today. But more than that, the weapons were just really creative and fun to use. There are also various gadgets you collect and equip, a whole other set of mechanics while playing as clank, and even a multiplayer mode if one still wanted more after the campaign. One could play the game for hours and continue progressing and collecting and having fun, it just offered so much to fans of the series I couldn’t help but be impressed.

While the story is a bit generic, the villain Dr. Nefarious is entertaining and supplies ample motivation to continue to blast through waves of enemies. The game has hilarious is somewhat obvious twists (I’m looking at you Courtney Gears) and is just overflowing with personality, from the characters of Ratchet and Clank themselves to even the smallest least dangerous of enemies. I mean really how could you not be endeared to this world with all these colorful characters inhabiting it. Whimsical and lighthearted Ratchet and Clank is a prime example of action platformer and deserves at least a look from anyone who has a PlayStation.


#37: Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2

The old Tony Hawk games were dope and if you don’t think so I feel sorry for you. These games were just exhilarating, plain and simple. Not to mention the soundtrack was dope full of late 90s and early 2000s hits. It captured the feeling of that point in time really well, especially with regards to the golden age of MTV teenage pseudo-punk culture. 

There are a bevy of other things that makes this game great besides its general atmosphere. Your character has great weight and handles well making pulling off combos extremely rewarding. The customization was cool, especially for the time, and the unlockables, cheats, and score driven gameplay gave the game a lot of unique angles of approach and gave it a tremendous amount of replay-ability. You could even create your own park if the developer designed ones did not do it for ya. 

Ultimately, I don’t think there is a whole lot to say about this game as it is not extremely complex or difficult to understand. It does not try to do more than it has to, it understands what it is and delivery’s that skater experience as best as it could within the virtual world. It’s fast, it’s fun, and it has character, and what more do you need in a sports game.


#36: Team Fortress 2

Okay if you have not seen the TF2 meet the character videos go on YouTube and check them out, they immediately endeared me to the game and it’s classes. Team Fortress Two is just brimming with character and charm backed by some of the most inspired multiplayer shooting mechanics I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Each class feels powerful in its own right and different to play. Teamwork is important for success but sometimes the chaos that ensues when playing with randoms has a certain poetry to it. My personal favorite classes were the Solider and the Spy, one is armed with a rocket launcher and a shovel, and the other with a knife and a mask that can make you appear as you are on the other team. Every class is well designed and balanced, the maps are well crafted and the game types are all fun. Payload, the quintessential game mode, places you on either offense trying to escort a cart to a goal line or on defense doing whatever you can to stop the enemy from escorting that cart to the goal line. Each class excels in different ways and on different terrains and for different objectives. Choosing what to play can be overwhelming at first but as you continue to play and get a hang of things you will find a world on action and depth open to you. TF2 is really a landmark in the shooter genre and should be visited by any fan of such games. Overwatch got nothing on the OG baby.


#35: Vanilla WoW

I must admit that I am slightly biased here as my love of WCIII had me already invested in the Lore of the World of Warcraft before I even played the game, and if you are going to enjoy WoW investing oneself in the lore is pretty much mandatory. WoW was one of the few games that when it came out completely floored me with what it presented. Blizzard had managed to create a living-breathing world here that promised near limitless hours of entertainment. I mean the sheer size of it was daunting for my young mind to comprehend, and the fact that I would be playing side by side with millions of strangers an intimidating concept.

In terms of vision Blizzard succeeded on all fronts with WoW, and its influence can still be felt today. It was one of those truly revolutionary games that you had to really play at the time to truly understand. That is why I qualify my choice as Vanilla WoW, not WoW, on this list. The expansions, while perhaps technically more impressive games, never recaptured the initial reveal and entrance into Vanilla WoW, Vanilla was the start and it made bigger waves than any expansion ever could.

Going into BC, WotlK, or Legion never quite could recapture that childlike wonder I felt creating my first character back in 2004. The gameplay was grindy, I mean super grindy, and there is way more handholding and go arounds in the modern version. Back in the day you really had to work for your items, and if you saw someone with badass armor it was not because they paid some gold to make their item look different it is because that was the item itself. Seeing someone in high level pvp was actually intimidating, and if their sword was shining I would turn around and walk the other way ashamed of my noobish blue gear.

I was never good. I hardly raided and I was young so I didn’t have the mental capacity to tackle high level pvp or arduous quest chains. I mostly just enjoyed my time in a small guild running dungeons and exploring the vast landscape. I hesitate to think of any game that ever gave me as many awe inspiring moments as WoW did even if I could not unlock the true endgame. The varied races and classes all felt different and interesting, and while the game was not perfectly balanced, it was not a huge deal as most people were not playing extremely competitively. The real diamond was in the relationship you formed with the world and the other players within it. Servers actually meant something, you pvped against people in your world, not from all over. If you played enough you could actually remember the same people and rivalries and little meta games would form naturally.

Bosses and Leaders of factions were amazing, I loved the feeling of being an underling, someone extremely weak caught up in the stream of something bigger. You see those skulls under the enemies’ health bar and you just walk the other way and go back to killing ghouls and bandits. The time and effort it took to level really gave you a sense of pride and accomplishment when you finally progressed a level or completed a dungeon. Getting that special drop you were grinding for was a feeling of almost pure elation. You could go anywhere, do anything, and while quest variation was not exactly the games strong suite each area felt unique enough and came with their own different feelings and appeals. I loved first entering Desolace, The Blasted Lands, or Plaugewood just to name a few. Entering Stormwind for the first time was amazing as well, even though for me it was as an attacking Horde player.

However, I must say this, the game actually has not held up in my mind. I am of the opinion that if you missed this one there is no going back. Most of the systems that initially made the game interesting and different have been beaten into the ground and by comparison with recent games are tedious and slow. The developers have tried to stem this tide with little success even though that have added some interesting features as the game has aged. They even changed the entire world at one point, a decision that made me miss the vanilla experience even more. Not to mention it is just crazy expensive, requiring a monthly fee to play. The only way I would ever get back into the game is if they released a vanilla version, maybe only with the BC expansion and the original Zul Aman, my favorite raid. 

Also, when I found that Blizzard had completely abandoned the RTS side of Warcraft I began to resent WoW. I appreciated it at first but not to the degree that I was okay with it skewering one of my favorite franchises relegating it to the MMO format, which, as time has show us, is not one that has retained its initial allure. That being so, it is impossible for me to deny the influence and genius that surrounded the release and initial patches of WoW. It really was a phenomenon that informed the way I viewed video games ever sense.


#34: Age of Empires 2

Age of Empires 2 was the first non-Nintendo or educational game I ever played, and from the start up screen I was fascinating. I think the discovery of the power a game can hold when one is a child is a very potent thing and Age of Empires 2 was that game for me. To this day I have an appreciation for real time strategy games mostly do to my origins with this game. I sunk hours into free matches and the campaign. Exploring the map, developing you army and your base, skirmishing with others, and even playing team games where coordination would dictate the outcome of the game all absolutely enthralled me. Before I had only played the likes of Mario and point and click adventures, Age of Empires II just had a level of depth unfathomable to me at the time.

Beyond that though it was just a really solidly balanced and designed RTS game. No unit felt ancillary, every building had its place, and there was a fair amount of resource and unit micromanagement that kept me in the moment, not just always thinking of the next big progression I was aiming for. Now keep in mind I never played this game at a high level, hell I must have been like 7 or 8 at the time, but I had been involved in the Chess club and I knew a bit about controlling a board or map with pieces or units. I translated my rudimentary knowledge into a decent albeit probably mechanical terrible understanding of the game that allowed me to compete online at the lower levels.

Age of Empires II ushered in a new era in gaming for me, one with vastly more potential than before, but beyond that it was just amazing fun to play with others and I still look back on it today with deep fondness.


#33: Tetris

The OG puzzle king that reigns to this day. I remember playing this shit on my phone along with brick breaker in school. It is simple yet addicting and even had some interesting multiplayer modes that expanded on the original games greatness. I expect everyone knows what this is by now and if you haven’t I have no clue why you would be reading a list about games in the first place. I think this game is a true classic in every sense of the word and should hold some kind of spot on just about every kind of list ranking videogames. It’s popularity and influence is indisputable.


#32: Counter Strike

Counter Strike is, for me at least, the quintessential tactical shooter that pretty much should be played at least once by anyone interested in multiplayer games. Level designs are simple yet surprisingly full of depth, allowing for quick understanding and fun while at the same time containing a hidden level of complexity. especially when playing against experienced players.

Guns feel good, I mean really good. Gameplay is smooth and intense. There is never a dull moment, even when things are quiet. Fear of snipers and campers keeps one on edge. The game practically forces you to work together with your teammates to survive. One must calculate and anticipate your opponent’s actions, pick the right weapon for the situation, coordinate flanking, and camp when necessary. This list can go on and on. Once you start playing there is just so much to get into, it becomes almost a completely different experience at higher levels. And the best part is that, whether you just shoot wildly and run around in casual, or actually work tactically and intelligently in competitive, the game is heaps of fun. You don’t have to sink a million hours to get to the good stuff (looking at you DOTA2).

Moreover, the most recent iteration, global offensive, has come along way from its moded roots to what I dare say has the best mechanics of any modern multiplayer shooter (rip CoD). It just plays good, period. Counter Strike is fun in groups, whether playing competitively or casually, has a diverse community of fans, and can be enjoyed at virtually any pace. As I said, a must for any multiplayer minded individual.",technology

* Term: 36 months  
* Payment: ~$233.53  

I used a mortgage refinance calculator to try and figure out if it would actually save me money, but it said I wouldn't.

btc,Why I fear the mass adoption of crypto,"It’s been almost 10 years since the last major crisis, the financial crisis.

After this crisis, the actions of central banks and governments around the world have facilitated a huge run up in asset prices, but also in debt. The total debt in the world is now so large that should interest rates go up to long term averages, there will be considerable difficulty to service the debt. What’s more, because of the low benchmark interest, investors looking for larger returns have invested in more and more risky assets. And because the recovery is one sustained by financial instruments, it has almost only benefitted the wealthy/corporations, again making it more difficult for a real (retail) recovery to happen.

These three factors have resulted in a hugely unsustainable situation that requires cheap money to continue to grow the GDP at a very low level.

Seeing all of this, many commentators have predicted a huge crisis over the last years, and so far it hasn’t really come. As long as the music is playing (cheap money) and confidence stays high, that’s not going to happen anytime soon, I guess. But knowing all of this, central bankers and others in charge of the world economy must either be ignoring the situation or planning for it. I hope/think they have, and I think crypto currencies have been invented or at least supported by the international community for exactly that reason:

To facilitate a semi smooth transition away from USD and other fiat currencies, and prepare for a big reset.

Now, the next part is even more thin foil hat-ey, but bear with me. Seeing how ‘stupid’ the central banks and governments have acted before, during and after the crisis, it’s almost like they wanted this to happen. And since globalisation has always been a stated goal of the international ‘responsible’ class, and crypto currency at some point perfectly serves a world in which money can be moved without borders and without laws, the invention and promotion of crypto currency could very well fit within these goals.

How you feel about this depends on your political believes I guess. Seeing as a large part of the crypto world is right-wing libertarian, I imagine the above doesn’t sound so bad. I personally believe corporate power is as much of a threat to people as is government power. What’s more, crypto seems to me to increase inequality over time. For these reasons, I fear the mass adoption of crypto currencies, even though I am excited about replacing the current monetary system.

I think crypto/blockchain can be an incredible force for good, but in the ‘wrong’ hands, it can also become incredible destructive. Keep an open mind.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Will Cryptocurrencies disrupt U.S./other governments?,"Hey all, I'm about 2 months into the crypto world and have been diligently learning about the numerous altcoins.

So obviously there's a lot of factors that play into the valuation of a currency, but traditionally centralized/fiat currencies issued by a government are essentially a representation on how that country is doing. If a country is doing well, the government is managing interest rates well, and the country is growing economically the value of the currency will increase in relation to other foreign currencies. 

Now here comes my issue, seeing the rise of Bitcoin, decentralized currencies value is basically derived from its usefulness, store of value, and ultimately the demand for said currency. It was created to cut out third parties such as banks and allowing us to trust fully send money to whomever we please.  And while blockchain tech and cryptos are still in their infancy, there will come a time when all major governments will need to either accept the currency and have it become usable to the average citizen or in some form outlaw it.

So my question is how can a centralized and decentralized currency currency coexist in one country?

personalfinance,Trying to budget and handle debt as an almost college grad,"Hello lovely people of PF!

I have one course left to complete my undergraduate in computer science. Currently, I am working full time (70k gross, net ~1,600/biweekly) in a high-ish cost of living area. I acquired credit card debt through some recklessness, some bad timing with getting sick, and being stupid and putting tuition on a credit cards one semester. I had a 580 credit score, which I'm kicking myself for now since I once had a 760.

Breakdown:
Credit Cards:
A - $1,000 at 20.99% APR (min ~$50/month)
B - $3,745 at 0% for another 8 months (min ~50/month)
C - $2,800 at 20.99% APR (min ~75/month)
D (Store Credit Card) - $486 at 0% for 11 more months (min ~27/month)

Loans:
Federal Loans (sub and unsub):$21,992 varying between 3.76% and 4.66% (deferred until March 2018)
Sallie Mae total: $4455 at 9% (min $50/month)
Car: ~$10,000 at 4% interest 

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $1515
Electricity: ~$80
Gas: ~$70
Cable/Internet/Phone(landline):$136
Car payment: $210
CC Minimums: $200
Loans: $50
Gas: $60
Emergency Fund: $150 (sometimes more if I can spare it)
Food: $400 (yeah I need to cut this WAY down)

I also had a decent chunk of one time expenses (ex. tables, chairs, pots and pans, etc) the past 3 months that were mostly furniture and setting up my new apartment. Plus some school expenses.

I am covered by my parents for car insurance, health insurance (I also got my own plan since my dad is looking to retire in the near future) and cell phone.

I am contributing 6% to my 401K and my company matches 4%. I contribute to my HSA monthly (hoping to max out contribution next year if I can afford it) and I am relatively healthy now.

My goal is to be out of debt in 3-5 years. 

I tried cutting down expenses. I wanted to reduce my cable/internet/phone bill by cutting it back to just internet. I called to cancel today and got a new price saying I would only save $15 because I got a bundle and a promotion. I need internet because I work from home sometimes and have to be on call if there are issues. I don't know if they were just saying high numbers to get me to keep the expensive plan. I don't use the landline and I watch TV but maybe 3 hours/week so its not worth having.

I have a $600 emergency fund with Ally, and about $700 (checking and savings) in a regional bank account I've had since the beginning of college.

I stopped using all but 1 credit card, and I exclusively use it for gas and traveling. I pay off more than I put on it each month.

Questions moving forward:

1. Would it be better to move all my money to Ally for better interest rates?

2. I want to close my credit card accounts (as I pay them off). I've had one since I was 16 that my mom cosigned, and I am concerned if I close that one, it will delete my credit history from when I was 16-20.

3. How do I negotiate with service companies about rates? I don't know if there's much I can do with my provider since they're exclusive to my complex (and they know it).

4. Would it be worth moving to a cheaper place? The ideal plan is to have my boyfriend move in with me, but he doesn't have a job (recent college grad). I'm in a good location but the COL is higher because of the area I'm in. I chose this place because its 20 minutes from school and work (school and work are about 50 minutes from each other) so I wanted to be in the middle of everything.

5. I was using extra money each month towards my Sallie Mae loans, car and credit card my mom cosigned for because the car and CC were cosigned by my parents and Sallie Mae will probably screw me over based on what I've heard. Am I allocating everything correctly? Should I start paying more than minimum on other things instead?

6. My job has offered to fully fund a masters degree in systems engineering (contingent on me graduating in December 17). Will that defer my federal loans if its a part time online degree? I definitely want to get a graduate degree because if I stay with the company, you need a degree to move up to higher bands.",finance

I am faced with a lot of questions:
Do mortgage balances include the total lifelong interest that will need to be paid that is added WITH the principal? Or should the balance just be the base principal? Do mortgage refinance loans add on to the principals, or is it caused by the increase in value to the home?

personalfinance,"25, about $58K in student loan debt from masters but wanting to go back to school. Advice/thoughts on my proposed solutions.","Hey everyone, I wanted some advice of how to best approach this situation. I’ve made some pretty poor financial decisions in my life and I’m currently thinking of solutions. 

Background: I’m 25 years old, currently living in China. I graduated from the university with my Masters in Counseling Psychology in August 2016 and I took out loans to finance the whole Masters. Right now, I owe about $58K in loans. 

During my whole Masters study (2 years), I didn’t work and I didn’t make any payments. I just studied, lived with my parents and occasionally worked during my first year but not my second year of my Masters study. After I graduated in August 2016, I had a 6-month grace period where I didn’t have to make any payments towards my loans. I got a job working as a school counselor/motivational coach in a high school and was making little money, not enjoying it, and regretting studying counseling psychology. I didn’t want that career anymore and I just finished it to finish the master’s.

I had a friend who had moved to China in 2015 to work as an English Teacher and he told me to come over and work in China and I took the advice because I was fed up and bored and feeling existential with my current life. So I moved to China in December 2016.

I make 15000 RMB a month here (around $2.2K). Before I moved to China, I applied for the income-based repayment plan on my loans to pay back the loans based on how much I’d make in China and when application was processed, they deemed that I wouldn’t be making too much and I pay $0 each month on the plan. Basically, I’m not paying anything at the moment for my loans. 

My contract with my current school ends on December 2017. A lot of the money I’ve earned has gone to my credit card debt (I owe about $2K at the moment) but I’ll have that paid off by the end of my contract. And the rest of the money has gone to nothing important because of existential crisis. I plan to go back to the USA on December 2017 after my contract ends.

Maybe this year-long gap made me rethink my life and I decided I need a career that pays much higher. And I’ve come up with two-three solutions:

Solution 1.	Reapply for the income-based repayment plan for my loan and go back to China in January 2018 for one more year and save up as much money as I can and go back to school for any type of engineering. I have many classes under my belt from my Bachelors and I will ask schools if they will accept those credits. Once I use up all the saved money on tuition, take a couple of more loans to finish the bachelors in engineering and use the engineering career to pay off all my loan debt. My reasoning behind this way is that engineering will yield a much higher income than my current degree (counselors/therapists barely make anything) and I’d be able to pay off my loans without too much hassle. 

Solution 2.	Once I go back to the USA in December 2017, find out all about engineering classes and credits and try to take out loans and start studying right away and finish the engineering degree as quickly as possible and get a job.

Solution 3.	Once I go back to the USA in December 2017, find a job with my current master’s degree and do that. The problem with this one is that (as I mentioned before) counselors/therapists don’t make a lot. In addition, in order to increase their salary, they need years of experience and a record of those hours, state licensure, direct supervision and continued development and those all cost money.

Bitcoin,Former IMF boss argues that countries should spend more and increase the national debt indefinitely,"**'Government debt does not have to be repaid at all'**

**VVD PROMINENT JOHAN WITTEVE - The Netherlands have to stop being economical, says former IMF boss and prominent VVD-member Johan Witteveen (96). The forthcoming cabinet has to roll the money, even if there is again a budget deficit. ""Otherwise, the euro will not prove sustainable.""**

The pile of paper next to his armchair reveals that Johan Witteveen has not stopped in the past. The papers include correspondence with Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Christine Lagarde, who chairs the International Monetary Fund as Witteveen in the seventies. In addition, the 96-year-old letters have written to Chancellor Angela Merkel, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and New French President Emmanuel Macron. ""I am very old, but still busy,"" says the VVD in his Wassenaar study room.

**You are a man with a mission. What are you so angry about?**

""The euro is under pressure because countries like the Netherlands and Germany have exported far more than importing for years. As a result, we have a big surplus on our balance of payments. If we had had the gold and the D-market, we had made our coins more expensive over the lire or the peseta, by means of a revaluation. But because we are in a currency union with the euro, that's not possible. ""

**Why is that a problem?**

""The euro is too cheap for the Netherlands and Germany. The imbalance in the eurozone is only increasing. Southern euro countries can not compete with us. If it continues, the euro will not prove sustainable. ""

**What should the next cabinet do?**

""We have to invest a lot more. In our healthcare, in Defense, in our dikes. And to pay that, the budget deficit may increase again. In billions, government debt goes up, but as a percentage of gross domestic product, the debt remains the same because our economy is growing. ""

**That's how the debt remains affordable?**

""Exactly. There have been unilateral fiscal deficits in recent years. By cutting so much, unnecessary unemployment and injury have been caused. I think that's wrong. ""

**Making debts, we do not often hear from a VVD's mouth. What does Mark Rutte think of your proposal?**

""He answered me extensively. I appreciate that. He says that the Netherlands is already investing more, because we are pumping (and selling) less natural gas, while government spending is rising. Rutte, The Dutch Bank, the Central Planning Bureau, the entire Dutch establishment, all under the paralysis of German pressure. Klaas Knot became president of De Nederlandsche Bank because he supports the cuts. Otherwise he was never chosen. ""

**But what's wrong with putting the tering down?**

""That's our calvinistic feature. There is absolutely no need for the state debt to be fully repaid. It is said: in a household you can not spend more than it enters. But that's not the case at all! To buy a house, we also take a mortgage. ""

**There you pay interest.**

""It is about the debt to remain affordable. Now the idea is in the air that it is wonderful to have no blame. But it is quite normal for the government to make useful investments. That's possible now, without increasing taxes. In addition, interest rates are low. We are doing ourselves too short. In my time as Finance Minister (in the government-De Jong, ed.), We looked at the balance of payments. The surplus was the space you had to invest. ""

**Do you get more response outside the Netherlands?**

""Macron, Merkel and Juncker are watching my story. Christine Lagarde sent me a very positive response. I received her a large stack of consultation pieces that the IMF exchanged with the European Commission. In that, the IMF comes to exactly the same conclusion as I do. ""

**With the reelection of Merkel, Germany, and also the Netherlands, does not seem to be heading any other way.**

""The admiration for Germany, which makes it so good, I understand. But at the same time, the country has neglected its infrastructure. The Germans could give themselves more. And the Netherlands too. ""

To maximize shareholder value, the Sponsor has begun a process with the Trust's professional advisers to evaluate, among other options, the feasibility of forming an entity to hold the Bitcoin Cash and distributing interests in that entity to the Trust's shareholders. As part of that evaluation, the Sponsor expects to engage in discussion with relevant regulators, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to ensure that the Trust continues to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Receiving regulatory guidance in respect of such a distribution, while prudent, may be a lengthy process of several months or more.  There can be no assurance regarding whether or when the Trust will obtain such guidance.

If and when formal guidance is received, the Sponsor will determine a record date for any potential distribution. However, the Sponsor can offer no assurance as to whether or when shareholders of the Trust might participate in any value attributable to Bitcoin Cash.",cryptocurrency

We met with a mortgage broker who suggested we wait it out as we'll have to accept a higher interest rate if we only put 3% down. We both have excellent credit, over 750. Is it true that we will have a hard time getting a low rate with 3% down? We're also in a bit of a seller's market in Florida, so we expect home prices to continue rising over the next few months, so is the savings on interest really worth it if we end up in a higher priced home?

Four times faster, four times the supply, will stabilize at ¼ of BTC, or roughly 30x what it is now. But still, what happens when the mines run out and you have to depend on the holders to maintain the network? Actual specie is very hard to destroy, that’s one of the things that makes it specie. But BTC and LTC don’t exist without their networks, and do we trust those networks to exist when there’s no more mining incentive to keep ‘em clean? Asking for a friend

It’s stupid and I hate it but it’s true, especially because the tech on BCC kinda totally sucks. It’s hella slow and basically rests on Moore’s law being Newtonian, if not Einsteinian, in its consistency. If we were at all smart we’d all buy it &amp; take the next four months off. But we won’t because we’re dumb fucking manimals who love the hunt. Fuck you BCC, for making an idiot out of me every goddamn day. Speaking of impatience

2 - XRP
 
Yeah I get it. It’s not a crypto. It hates you because you aren’t a bank. It’s mobbed up and centralized and all that shit. It’s everything we told ourselves we weren’t here for. But here’s the facts: that central bank you hate so much? It’s powerful not because it issues fiat currency. It’s powerful because it controls the rate at which banks lend to one another. That’s the realness, friend, because that’s the rate that matters and that’s what XRP is targeting. Ever try and make a swift transfer? Holy shit does that shit suck and suck slowly.
 
You want to whine about big banks? Well pick a side. Goldman or the Fed. Because XRP is going to actually do what everyone wishes BTC could - assuming they don’t get friendster’d by some better version down the line – it’s going to liberate the financial system not for the mommas and the poppas but for the pros. And sadly, we are living in the pros world. Anyone who understands the monetary system from a non-ideological position knows this. But it’s going to take five years and we all plan on being dead of MOON POISON by then. Fuck us.

It already has a dedicated community of buccaneer utopians living it up on magic islands just over your horizon.

personalfinance,Recent home reappraisal: Should I pay extra on my mortgage to eliminate PMI or focus on higher interest debts?,"About a year ago, my wife and I started getting serious about finance (28M and 33F with 2 kids). We paid off our credit cards and are working on paying off debt. Unfortunately, neither of us has very marketable degrees, so our income is limited (combined 67kish with me working part time at night to avoid daycare costs). I have $17k in student loans, but I plan on this being forgiven when I finish my teaching certification and teach for a few years. My wife has $70k @ 6.8% in student loans from seminary, which was our plan to pay off next. 

This month we found out our home was reappraised by the county auditor from $82k to $99k. Our mortgage is currently for $85k since we bought a couple years ago for $93k and only put 3% down. This means we went from having about 8% of our home paid off to having 15% paid on the new value. I know once we have 20% paid, we no longer have to pay PMI. Would it be smarter to throw money at the mortgage to eliminate PMI first before paying student loans down, even though the mortgage is at a lower interest rate of 4.125%? We are putting about $600 extra a month toward debt beyond minimum payments, but the student loan balance is on an income based plan and the balance will increase if we put that extra elsewhere.

Thanks.",finance

So I've got really good credit over the years (car loans, credit cards, student loans etc) but my wife has never had a loan or credit card, she basically has no credit.

My wife's income is significant and want it to be considered in our assessment. 

What is the smartest/quickest/easiest way for us to build her credit?

personalfinance,Trouble breaking into advertising from public sector.,"I (27) am a project manager working at an electrical utility company that is technically a federal position. I hate it. 

My day to day job is to track budgets, write project scopes, strategize on future work, organize meetings, manage communications, etc. Typical PM stuff. The work itself is technically market research, so it's a mix of technical and qualitative work, but I definitely work in a field that is large, slow moving, immune to innovation. As a PM, im stuck using excel for nearly everything because no PM programs or applications work on our ancient, high security systems. 

Outside of work, I'm naturally a creative type. I paint, act in films, do comedy theater, hang out with artists. That's my tribe and I am deeply motivated by creative work. So I want to work in advertising or a similarly creative field. 

I've been flooding the market locally with a cover letter that has been reviewed by a couple friends who work in advertising, and I've got a laundry list of agencies im following. 

No word from anyone. 

I've got a meeting with a recruiter next week that I'm chomping at the bit for - but I'm afraid agencies will think I'm a lazy public employee who won't cut it in an agency environment (based on a stereotype, not me!), or that they'll ask me to start at the bottom of the ladder, taking a pay cut that I cannot afford (currently 65k/yr).

personalfinance,Recently Married: What to do with debt and house?!,"*Apologies for the throwaway account, I have been a long time reader of this sub-reddit and have slowly implemented some of its teachings but a life change has prompted me to come forward seeking specific advice.*

**Background info:**

* I am in my late 20’s with a stable career making $60,000 annually in the US in a city with a high cost of living. After we both graduated grad school last June, my fiancé and I aggressively started paying her student loans from the medical field. We started at around $130,000 and will be at $75,000 next month (note not all of this payment is from our income, we both had other assets that we dumped into the loans last year). 

* Average interest rate for the remaining loans is 5.75% (we attacked the high ones last year). She is in a residency making $50,000 annually but will make closer to $70,000 next year. 

* Our long term goals are to pay the loans ASAP and buy a house in 2 years (requiring a $60,000 down payment).

**Some financial info:**

* We have received around $25,000 from the wedding and that is currently in a money market account with a 1.2% interest rate. (We got married last month.)

* I have had an actively managed mutual fund with 1.36% fees for almost my entire life that is now up to $17,000. My time on this sub had made me realize that I need to change this to an index fund because it is costing me several hundred dollars a year. 

* Loans are $1,300 a month, but we try to pay closer to $2,000 or more each month.

* We have 3 months expenses in an emergency fund

**Some of our options moving forward:**

* Keep the $25k from the wedding in cash, put the $17k mutual fund in an index fund, and keep adding to the cash until we have $60K for a house while paying as much to loans as possible.
     - I feel that if I have a good cash cushion, I can be a little more adverse to risk here and keep a substantial amount in an index fund? I am leaning towards this option.
* Convert to other combination of cash and lower-risk index fund while paying as much to loans as possible.
     - Am I being naïve and should take on less risk over the next 2 years? More cash, a bond index fund, etc?
* Put a portion of the $25k and $17K into the loans for and instant 5.75% return. 
     - Not sure about this option because the interest rates are on the low side now. It would feel great to really hammer out the loans.

Just wanted to get some different views on our options and see if we are overlooking anything major? If I end up keeping a lot of the money in a mutual fund, should I just open a taxed Vanguard account separate from my 401k and buy a few index funds?

I do not have flood insurance because my home is not in flood plain and there is no history of the area ever flooding before.  

I cannot make my mortgage payments with my rent. The house is unlivable so that means no rent. 

The area has not been declared a National Disaster Area so I cannot apply for FEMA.

So, I basically have a flooded house that I owe roughly $135,000 on with no insurance, no FEMA, and no money for repairs.

I have applied for assistance under the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) since my area has not been declared a Federal Disaster yet. So waiting to hear from them. My property manager has been in contact and told me that the renters have moved out in town with friends for the foreseeable future. They will be placing the utilities in their company's name to retain service until repairs are complete. I will have to repay them for utility expenses at the end of every month.

personalfinance,Post-Bankruptcy Advice,"I'm 23 and a few weeks ago I filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy after saving up for months to pay my attorney. I know it was the right move because I am drowning under $45,000 in credit card debt. Yes, I know I'm an idiot and I screwed up badly. I used credit cards as a method of self-harm in the aftermath of losing most of my immediate family within 2 years, being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, going through a traumatic breakup, experiencing a sexual assault, alienating many friends, losing a good job, and flunking out of school. What's done is done and I can't undo it. All I can do is make sure I don't make the same mistakes again. I know what I did wrong and I think I have a decent idea of what I need to do going forward. Like I said, wracking up the debt was a self-harm thing. I didn't cut, I swiped.

With that being said, what can I do to make sure this never happens again once my case clears at the end of this month? How do I begin to rebuild my credit? Unfortunately I still have $30k in federal student loans hanging over my head without a degree, but my goal is to go back to school as soon as my mental health permits. The loans are currently deferred but repayment is going to be a reality in the near future. I've heard that IBR might be helpful with the student loans. Any advice there is appreciated! I've applied for Medicaid and will be tackling my mental health issues head on once I am approved. My income is limited and I'll be leaving my apartment within the next month to move home or with family friends (still tbd) rent free. Obviously I need to work on getting a full time job, but until my mental health stabilizes I don't see that happening. I currently work a variety of contract jobs that are 1099 income - saving money for my taxes has been an issue and it's something I really need to get better at. How do I know what I need to set aside from each check I get? Should I have a separate bank account just for tax money? I grew up in a paycheck-to-paycheck environment so I'm used to running my checking account down to pennies which makes it easy for me to ignore my tax liabilities until they hit me like a freight train in April. Any other random financial pointers are also appreciated!

Disclaimer: I know the bankruptcy will follow me for the next decade, but I also know it's not the end of the world; if you're just going to say that bankruptcy was a horrible option that will ruin me forever please keep your opinion to yourself. I've already heard enough of that kind of talk out of people, it's not constructive advice.

personalfinance,I've let my family put me into a bad place finnancial and I'm not sure how to get out of it. What can I do?,"So to preface, I am the only one in my family working at the moment.  It is far from a household supporting job at just shy of 20k a year.  I was living with roommates about a year ago when they got laid off and asked if I could move home to help with bills.  Being young, I did. For 4 months it went fine.  Then the money I gave for bills started going elsewhere and bills became delinquent.  Soon I had 800$ power bills and 250$ water bills from fees and late fees.  I ended up having to use credit cards to pay household bills.  My stepdad got a job but needed a little boost to get tools and a vehicle in order to do the job.  I helped him out and got him out working.  He was making well over 5k a week and was sending money home to cover my upfront cost I gave him and household bills.  The money was sent to my mom.  Fast forward three months, he's laid off from that job, my mom spent the money on other things not bills, and I was never told money was sent home to give to me.  So now I'm out the upfront cost of bills, cost to help my stepdad go to work, and misc fees associated with my little brother graduating high school.  Overall in about 8k in the hole in pure credit card debt and a little over 3k in a personal loan.  

As it stands I'm making barely enough for the minimum payments which will never pay these cards off, my credit is not good enough anymore to try and consolidate for a lower interest, and my family still isn't working nor do they seem to care about my situation.  I had to put my schooling on hold and focus on getting hours at work to cover my bills and I can't afford rent at the moment somewhere else.  I'm stuck where i am and don't really have someone to go to for help.  What can I do to unbury the Hatchet.  I'm not drowning, but I'm stagnating and making no positive progress.

I have about 550-575$ come out every two weeks in household bills. My paycheck is anywhere from 400-750 every two weeks.  I haven't touched my 401k or anything like that and I really don't want to.  I spend about 100-200$/ month on food/drink/grocery items.  Less if it's a tight check.

The debt is spread about:

4k card 1

1k card 2

1.5k card 3

1.2k card 4

3.2k loan 1

Should I stay my course of paying evenly across all the debt or should I be trying to focus something down.  The interest rates in the cards are all the same rate.  Should I try and pursue a consolidated loan for the smaller cards to lower those 3 interest rates or should I avoid the inquiry in my credit. Should I make minimum payments on all but 1 item then dump anything excess into that one and pay them down one at a time that way? Should I focus on the larger amounts to pay less interest of on the lower to free up funds to pay the higher down.  I hate being stuck with no real idea where to go.

personalfinance,Did not shop around for Mortgage...Now What?,"Hi!

Somehow in my confusion of trying to find a home, I never actually thought about shopping around for a mortgage. My realtor gave me a recommendation for Movement Mortgage. I did all my paperwork beforehand as recommended by my realtor and the mortgage company. Movement is known for underwriting buyers even before they find a home. This makes them more competitive against cash buyers. 

I actually lost the first bid on the house to a buyer that made an offer with cash. That offer fell through during the inspection, and we were lucky enough to make another offer right after.

The agreed upon price has been $196,000 with 1.5% seller assist. (edit: with no points)

My original lender, Movement gave me a rate of 4% with a 5% down payment. I am told this seems like a decent rate.

However, when I do mortgage shopping online. I got quoted by American Federal Mortgage Corp. at 3.625% with a 5% down payment. (edit: with no points) I have not submitted any financial documents to this company for review yet. How accurate can this quote be without submitting anything? This is just the advertised rate I got over email by a representative based upon zip code, credit score, and down payment.

Contract was executed 8/29 and I believe I agreed to close by 10/3.

The second company said I would have to get the seller to agree to extend the closing date if I wanted to use him.

Movement is well known for closing on time. I am worried if I go back and try to get a better rate, I might lose the house since the sellers might not agree to change the closing date. I have a good price on the house.

Questions...My movement mortgage guy says 4% is a great rate for a 5% down payment. How true is that? I have excellent credit, like above 780.

How much can I trust the other company? Are online and email advertised rates even real? I forwarded my quote to my Movement mortgage guy and he basically said 3.625% is unrealistic. He sent me a link to http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/mdc_bonds.html 
to show that no one was offering below a 3.73 and that was with a 20% down payment.

I realize I could have done this whole process better...But this is where I am at now.

Any Advice? How bad should I feel about screwing up in the long run? Should I try to refinance if I go with movement mortgage?

personalfinance,"Buy car with cash, or pay off private student loans?","First time posting here! I have a financial dilemma. 

First, info about myself. All values are in USD.

**DEBT** = total of 48k

--I graduated in January with 80k of student loan debt -- 50k of the debt is private, and 30k of the debt is federal.

--Since January, I've paid down the *private* student loans so that I *currently* owe 18k. (I've also been making regular payments towards my federal loans, and am paid ahead until October of 2018.)

--I have **no** other debt.

**INCOME** = between 85 and 110k 

I am in sales, so my annual income depends on performance and fluctuates. It's looking like I'll make about 100k this year if I keep my current sales velocity.

**Expenses**

Car (2001 Honda Accord) = 0 dollars, because I own it; however, it's old and has 153k miles on it. Right now, it seems mechanically sound, but it could break down.

Rent = 925/month, amazingly nice place for the money

Utilities = about 200 per month 

Groceries and eating out = 500 dollars (300 eating out, 200 groceries -- yes... I could cut this down a *lot*)

Private student loan payment = 350/month.

Other = about 200/month.

TOTAL spent= approx. 2,475/month

TOTAL income (after tax) = approx. 5000/month

Liquid assets = 22,000 currently

**THE DILEMMA**

I have a rare opportunity to purchase a 2015 Ford Fusion for 80% of market value (which comes out to 10,164 dollars, plus tax). I know the person I'm purchasing it from, and it's in excellent condition.

My *plan* was to pay off the remaining 18k of my student loans at the end of the month (which would be a big mental win for me, as it's a big goal of mine). My private loans would be completely paid!

However... my family has all been telling me that my car is old/shitty, and I should upgrade to something more reliable. If I buy the car, I can't pay my student loans off; however, it's a decent deal.

**THE QUESTION**

What would you do in my situation? Pay off the 18k of private loans, or buy the car for only 80% of market value?

Thanks!

Edit: to be clear, I'll be saving about 2,850 dollars from buying the vehicle at 80% market value. And my private student loans are at a 3.2% interest rate, and my federal are 4.5% (but, I still want to pay *private* first for qualitative reasons)",finance

personalfinance,Is it possible to ask the holder of my federal student loans to remove the late mark on my credit report years after I paid it?,"My parents were handling my student loans. Due to my being a bonehead, I blew the opportunity at free tuition. My parents told me I was on my own with my student loans. I knew about the private loans but not the federal loans. I pulled my credit report and realized I had a delinquent mark on my report. I paid the amount that was delinquent immediately and have been making my regular monthly payments (have never missed a payment on any other account). 

Am I able to call the holder of my federal loans and ask them to remove the mark? The delinquency happened in March of 2015. Things are much better now but this derogatory mark seems to be holding my credit back and I really don't want to wait the full 7 years, if possible.

Thanks!

TLDR: Can I ask someone to remove a delinquency mark from my credit report 2.5yrs after paying the delinquent amount?",finance

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan AutoPay (Direct Debit) .25% Interest Rate Reduction - Actual Application is Fairly Deceptive,"I currently have a mixture of federal student loans serviced by FedLoan Servicing.  The interest rates (3.03 to 6.55%) and amounts vary as well as the loans from undergrad were subsidized and the loans from grad school were not.  I am currently enrolled in their AutoPay program for around $100 over the required payment for a few years.  I am in the standard repayment plan.

I was looking to increase this soon, but was curious to see how much I would save by decreasing my AutoPay amount to just the minimum and making an additional payment that I could target at the loan with the highest interest rate.  FedLoan states they split the overpayment based on the percentage of the total balances each loan makes up.

Their website as many others state that ""You qualify for a 0.25% interest rate reduction when you use Direct Debit.""  

As I was setting up my amortization tables and getting a baseline something was off based on just the interest I had accrued in the past 5 days since my last payment.  After numerous checking I have verified that the 0.25% interest rate reduction is not what I thought nor what many others thought. 

I thought my highest interest rate at 6.55% was being reduced to 6.3%, but is in fact being reduced to only 6.53%.  The percentage is being reduced by .25% only! The math:

Actual: 0.0655*(1-.0025) = 6.53%
vs
Perceived: .0655 - .0025 = 6.30%

If you Google this there are tons of websites and blogs stating the savings of AutoPay based on my perceived calculation, which for large student loans starts to look fairly attractive.

It is even worse for my lowest interest rate of 3.03% it reduces to only 3.02% vs 2.78%

Would this allow me extra time to pay the accrued interest to have a chance at paying straight towards the principal before my grace period ends sometime late 2018/early 2019? Am I somehow cheating the system? Did my university make a mistake? Should I say anything?

personalfinance,Payroll error? Help me understand my pay numbers,"**Update: It has been resolved. They admitted their error. Thank you for the help!

**Edit: I entirely understand that my actual taxes are calculated while filing and that if they withhold more than needed, I will receive a return. The issue here is that they are claiming they withheld LESS than what was actually taken out of my paycheck.

Hey everyone, I'm going to do my best to explain the situation. Thank you in advance for your time. I've been in talks with the payroll company about this and we are not coming to mutual understanding.


For the last year, I was paid an hourly rate. At the end of my year, I receive $4,000 as an “education stipend”. It is basically a bonus. I do not see a penny of it in any way until the end of the year. Well, the end of the year came and…


My paystub reads as followed (I’ve combined things for ease of understanding):

Worked Wages: $1,429.43

Education Stipend: $4,000.00

**Total Gross Pay This Period Before Taxes:** $5,429.43

Federal Income Tax: $1,003.61

Social Security: $336.32

Medicare: $78.66

Workers Comp Insurance: $5.84

**Total Taxes This Period:** $1,424.43 (~26% of $5,429.43)

Based on these amounts, Gross Pay - Withholdings = **$4,005.**

The check they gave me was **$2,937.70.**

**TLDR; they took out (a.k.a withheld) $2,491.73 and I said they should accurately reflect that on the paystub because it will impact my tax filing. They're arguing they only withheld $1,424.43. Their explanation can be found below.**



Apparently, the payroll company decided to log the $4,000 as **imputed pay**. Because my actual worked wages ($1,429.43) nearly zeroes out with the taxes to be withheld ($1,424.43) based on worked wages **and** the stipend, this would mean my check would basically be almost $0 (is actually $5 if you do the math) because imputed pay is a “non-cash benefit” that has zero cash value.


But I didn’t actually receive this as a non-cash benefit, so to get around that, the payroll company ran the $4,000 separately as a reimbursement. They told me they ran a test payroll to get the reimbursement number. “This payroll was run only using the imputed pay amount- $4,000. This amount was taxed regularly and the check amount came out to $2,937.70.”


$4,000 - $2,937.70 = $1,062.30

$1,062.30 is approximately 26% of $4,000.

**The total amount I received of the $5,429.43 was just that check of $2,937.70.**


The payroll company insists that the $4,000 amount “was only taxed one time- it was taxed as part of the regular gross wages.” Which refers to the $1,424.43 amount.


But this $1062.30 that was deducted shows up nowhere on my paystub. The $2,937.70 is just listed as a reimbursement, which doesn’t get taxed as a reimbursement. But the $4,000 will be included in my total annual income when I file taxes/receive my W-2. Based on my paystub, it makes it look like I only had $1,424.43 withheld when I actually had $2,491.73 withheld.


**Looking at all of this, it appears that they withheld 26% of the gross pay, which includes the $4,000 stipend. Then they taxed the $4,000 again separately during a test payroll to calculate my reimbursement amount, withholding another 26% to get to $2937.70**


 **Yet, they insist that it was *only withheld taxes once as part of my gross pay*, not accounting for the $1,063 they withheld from the stipend amount as well during the test payroll. Based on their claims, when I file taxes, the W-2 they provide me with will report that I only had $1,424.43 withheld when it fact, I had $2,491.73 withheld.**

personalfinance,Help with numerous debts and settlement offers (sort of an update),"About a year ago (see this account's [old post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/56wpzc/deeper_into_financial_ruin_not_a_care_in_the_world/?st=j7ily9f8&amp;sh=f43a7244) ) I made a post laying out my financial situation and work history.  Unfortunately nothing has significantly changed in regards to my job situation or mental health. In addition, another credit card account has since went into default. 

I'm writing to ask for advice on what I should do with offers to settle the first two accounts that went into default when my finances went downhill. 

I have contacted a bankruptcy attorney who suggested I file but I cannot afford the fee. I had someone offer to pay the fees but they backed out so I don't really know what to do. 

Here's a summary and update:
Account #1 Original balance $10,000+
Settlement offer of 90% at $1,000.

Account #2 Original balance $6,000+
Settlement offer of less than $1,000

Account #3 Balance $13,000+
**Now defaulted and debt sold to collections** (1 year ago was not yet in collections and was trying to make partial payments)

IRS Original balance $3,000+ 
They took my federal income refund and applied the balance so I now owe about $1,500+ and am past due but in a non-collect status for 1 year(?)

Online credit account $3,500+ - still in good standing with a low monthly payment from family helping out

Student Loans (from now defunct ITT Tech) from 2002. Remaining balance $5,000+
In non-collect (IBR) status because of no income. I don't think they can be discharged because it was so long ago (in relation to the recent ITT closing thing)

Family / personal loans - still have not paid any of these down. 

The attorney said that if I filed I would have to list all debts including personal money received from friends and family and that everyone would be notified and some of it might be counted towards income for the year depending on something (I forgot exactly what.) 

So the question is do I bother trying to borrow more money from family to use that towards settling only two of (many) accounts? That would still leave me with almost $20,000 in other recent debts (online credit account in good standing and recently defaulted credit card.) My credit history is already ruined and my score is in the low 500s now. 

Or 

Do I somehow come up with money to file bankruptcy and discharge as much as possible? 

For those wondering why I can't get a job...I don't know. I've applied for about 8 jobs over the last 6 months and have not gotten anything.

personalfinance,Should I move? | Gifted 28k per year towards a home,"Hello! Looking for opinions and insight on my situation:

First, information about me and my finances:

----

32 years old. Married. 2 children under the age of 3.

Current income: $0.00 (I *recently* sold my small business).

Average gross income from past 5 years: ~$200k.

Home owner for past 5 years.

Assets:

Source | Amount
---|----
Cash | ~$275k
Home Equity | ~$265k
IRA | ~$120k
Other | ~$15k

Liabilities:
I have a 30-year conventional loan with a principal balance of $354k. Interest rate: 3.875. No other debt.

----

Wealthy grandparents want to help my family move into a different home. They plan on giving us a $600,000 loan with an interest rate of 3.00%. They would gift us $56k this year to bring down the principal to $544,000. They would expect us to make monthly payments on interest only. They would pay down the principal by $28k per year ($14k annual exclusion from each grandparent).

---

While this is very generous, I am hesitant to move for the following reasons:

1) If we stayed at our current home we could pay off the home much faster and pay interest on $354k instead of $544k.

2) After selling my business, I am uncertain what the future holds. For example, what if I take a job offer out of state. I am also considering starting another business.

3) If the grandparents pass away I am uncertain if we would continue receiving the $28k gift to pay down the principal.

However, if I don't move the deal *might* be withheld or they *might* not be willing to gift us the same amount to apply toward our current home.

Should I just move to ensure I get the $28k tax-free gift that must be applied toward the home? Are there other things I should consider?

personalfinance,Help with Get on Your Feet Forgiveness Program,"Hello, I recently graduated from college with roughly $28,000 in debt from federal loans.

Bitcoin,Let's discuss something tech-related for a change: Sidechains!,"Okay rbitcoin, yeah yeah J Morgan yeah yeah blah blah boo hoo.  Okay?  Good.

So here's what I know:

1.  The original [sidechains](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) paper seems to have grown out of gmaxwell's ramblings about [CoinWitness](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=277389.0), which would entail adding a [zk-SNARK](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/snark-20110817.pdf) verifier into Bitcoin Core.  A zk-SNARK verifier would allow Bitcoin fullnodes to have a programmable verifier, with the data being verified (e.g. entire sidechain blocks) not needed to be provided to the verifier, just a tiny 288-byte transcript (the proof).  Note that fullnodes don't even need to execute the programmed verifier themselves, just check the 288-byte proof that the program was honestly executed by someone else with a lot more processing power.
2.  CoinWitness was planned to use the [vnTinyRAM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf), a virtual machine for running a von Neumann program. You could write a C code verifier and compile it to run on vnTinyRAM.  RAM here is Random Access Machine, not Random Access Memory, BTW.  Note however that vnTinyRAM has limited number of ""clock cycles"" i.e. instructions it could execute; it won't allow true Turing completeness, as it requires termination, and if you reach the cycle limit the verifier is treated as if it failed.
3.  CoinWitness could be used for a lot of different financial systems, not just sidechains!  For example if you could program perfectly, you could set up a trustable Chaumian bank or a trustable mixer (well, trustable if every user was reviewing your code before they used it, LOL).
4.  zk-SNARKs are cool, but [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437.pdf) rather nicely shows the importance of not depending on novel crypto.
5.  zk-SNARKs also require a trusted setup (i.e. someone generates some random data from a seed, and promises not to keep its seed, something like that), at least according to some treatments I've seen (don't know enough cryptography to know which ones are correct or if I'm missing something).  Some newer papers seem to be using called ""PCP"" to skip the trusted setup, but increases the size of proofs and the load on verifiers.  See also previous item for the importance of not depending on novel crypto.
6.  So... zk-SNARKs are out.  The Blockstream sidechains paper thus focuses on SPV proofs.  Blockstream's Elements sidechain includes SPV proofs, and uses SPV proofs for main-&gt;side transfers.  In case you're curious, Elements uses fedpeg for side-&gt;main, since they were working with an unpatched mainchain Bitcoin.
7.  SPV proofs kinda suck.  You need a mechanism to repeal them by showing a longer SPV proof that shows that the side-&gt;main transfer didn't actually occur.  That mechanism should also be repealable by showing an even longer SPV proof that shows that by golly, yes the side-&gt;main transfer really did occur you dolt (to be specific: a withdrawproofverify UTXO is unlocked by an SPV proof, and must then be paid to a UTXO that is unlocked either by a timelock, or a reorgproof.  The reorgproof is an even longer SPV proof that should pay back to a withdrawproofverify UTXO, and you would then retry with your even longer SPV proof of existence (withdrawproof) presumably the sidechain had extended by that time, which an attacker would have to counter with a yet longer SPV proof of non-existence (reorgproof), etc.).  And so on.
8.  So, drivechains instead of SPV proofs.  Drivechains use miner voting to determine if a side-&gt;main transfer did occur.
9.  Miner voting, yeah, that mechanism which prevented SegWit from activating until August this year.  Miner voting is totes fine, guys.
10.  There are actually two drivechain proposals, one by Sergio Demian Lerner/Rootstock (OP_COUNT_ACKS) and another by Paul Sztorc/Truthcoin (upvotes/downvotes on coinbase tx).
11. Drivechains require merge mining, so every sidechain miner needs to be a mainchain miner.
12.  Paul Sztorc is proposing something about ""blind"" merge mining, which is basically that the sidechain miner is theoretically separate fro mthe mainchain miner, and pays the latter to put some hashes (presumably sidechain block hashes) on the chain.  This style of sidechain miners doesn't have a way to affect miner voting, though, just the hash committed to in the merge-mine, so I don't see why he bothered.",cryptocurrency

Last friday I was paid a dividend of $0.16 to my Federal Money Market Settlement Fund even though I chose the reinvest option when opening the IRA and I'm not sure why?

On the balances and holding page of the retirement fund, the dividends/capital gains elections is all set to reinvest. But on the Money Market Fund, I saw that the dividends/capital gains elections for this fund were set to N/A so I changed them to reinvest as well.

Would making that change solve the problem? Do I have to transfer it manually? I just want all money to go back into the retirement fund and make sure it does in the future. Thank you all in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Help! Wife's College is getting ready to report same amount again to credit agencies.,"Looking for advice. My wife had a federal Perkins loan for school up til 2006. These are forgivable if you work in certain fields. In this case health care. My wife was submitting the paperwork for this loan appropriately for about 2 years. Then she went back to school and the school resumed deferment on the other loans. She quit a year later but did not restart the yearly paperwork for the Perkins loan right away. I am not sure what exactly happened over the next year but emails had occurred between the school and herself. In 2014 I submitted new proof of her employment at the request of the school to resume forgiveness on the loan. I felt at this point, the school didn't accept this paperwork and began collection. We also were now being sued by the school for the money. And received a court paper via sheriff at our home and legal paperwork. My wife's father got involved and we filed all this information with the court. As far as I know it was dropped after that. No more lawyer paperwork on the schools behalf came to our home. But a year later the college began sending late notices on the Perkins loan. As of today we received another letter stating they were moving it to collection again. I checked my wife's credit reports and it shows their original claim from (2000-something) and it says it falls off October 2018. 
Tldr 
Can a school or company continue to resubmit the same claim to credit bureaus?
Also, yes i know, my wife unfortunately takes a back seat to financial responsibility. My father in law and I have been working with this. This is the only instance of financial grief in our lives.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage renewal approaching - struggle to make ends meet - Canada,"Currently living in Canada. I'm pretty terrible with money and it causes me a heck of a lot of stress. I'm working towards trying to be more financially responsible and I have a very important time coming up. My mortgage is up for renewal on October 31st and I'm considering consolidating my debt into my mortgage. I'm barely getting by at paycheck to paycheck with a little help here and there.

I have two loans, one for my car and one for a high interest credit car that I was struggling to pay off. I took out a loan to pay my credit card off to get a lower interest rate. Both these loans together total 40,000 CAD. The amount owning on my house is about 290,000 CAD.

My payments are all biweekly.

- Mortgage: 675$

- Car Loan: 242$

- CC Loan: 142$

I suppose what i'm wondering is. Is it a good idea to roll these two loans into my mortgage when I renew it? Is there any sort of rough way I can estimate what my mortgage payments would be after rolling the debt together?

For example, if I roll all this debt into my mortgage and my payments only go up to 750/800$ that would be a huge saving and would really help me with my bills. But how can I be sure this is going to happen?

Any info/suggestions/slaps in the face is appreciated.",finance
Bitcoin,Mentality behind the sell-off trend in china,"I caught up with a friend of mine, a student at Peking University in Beijing, who tried to explain what's really causing this tiny (yes, tiny) panic sell-off in China based on the word on the streets.
Hoarding of Bitcoin has been a trend for sometime in China. It started off with the bigwigs but then middle class and even students joined in. They borrowed heavily from local lenders and pawn brokers to buy even on the slightest dip. Although the interest rates on these loans were high, the bull reassured them. When BTC hit the 5000 psychological barrier and eased off, the buying rested too. At this point, the interest rates were sky high and people were looking for a reason to sell off and they got one starting with the fake news. 
What we are seeing now is the sell off by people who  are being or have been ravaged by the loan sharks trying to get out as fast as they can. There are still thousands or maybe even millions of hodlers in China and once the weak structures are cleared (sell-off may continue for a while) , we can witness quality bull run.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Best ways to structure a family loan?,"As a bit of background, I've been looking to purchase a multifamily home in the greater Boston area to live in and rent out the other side.  If the purchase price is ~=&lt; $625k, I am perfectly comfortable with the loan options on the properties; however, above that value, things like PMI start to really put on an enormous strain.  I know the typical advice will be to wait and continue to save, but let's put that aside for now.

I'd like to discuss how to best structure a fair family loan for $70k from my parents.  That is by no means a small amount of money and they are nearing retirement so that is another consideration.  As one would expect, they currently have a large percentage of their finances in cash, bonds, or equivalents.  I'm trying to structure a loan that will benefit myself on the purchase, as well as provide a relatively safe return for them.

*As a quick note, once i exceed the ~$625k point, the PMI rate jumps from 0.3% to 0.8%*
______________________
**Here are my thoughts:**

* $70k loan over 10 years @ ~4.0% interest
* They will earn $15k in interest over 10 years
* I will save ~$70k over 10 years due to PMI and mortgage interest
* This keeps my total monthly payments about equal between a 10% down or a 20% down and using a family loan

**Collateral and early $ recovery options**

* $31k contributions available from my ROTH IRA
* HELOC on the property at year 20XX market rates
* Lower my current 27% (with company match) retirement savings between 401k and ROTH IRA
* Move out and rent both units finding cheaper living arrangements elsewhere
* Sell the property

________________

This would all be laid out in a contract, and I should probably speak with an attorney and/or CPA.  From my perspective, this feels like a fair loan.  I am paying a bit higher interest rate than what I can get on a mortgage, and there are multiple options for me to repay them early if necessary.

From the perspective of a fair loan, risk, etc., what do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,To Pay School Loans Aggressively Or Not To Pay,"Hello personalfinance, as the title says, my wife and I are trying to decide if we want to pay my student loans aggressively by living cheap and not going on any vacations, or to pay them off as scheduled making near minimum payments. Here are the facts regarding this decision: 

$20k in student loans, averaging 4.25% interest rate

Estimated $4,000 a month take home income

Roughly $2,200 in monthly expenses

No kids.

I did a quick estimate that  if we save ~$300/month and put $1,500 toward my loan each month, we could have it paid off in about 14-15 months. But, this requires us to live a bit more frugal and not take any vacations. The other option is pay ~$200-300/month and be less frugal. I would really appreciate some advice/opinions on what you've seen work and how that affected your future. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation (USA-NJ M23),"I have seen a few people post on here mainly about their personal situation and I figured I would like to hear from the community on what their thoughts are in my case.


About a year ago I began my first job out of college making $45k while living on Long Island and commuting to NYC. Shortly after, my girlfriend at the time had broken up with me and I took to some retail therapy, bought a ton of parts for my car (I am a HUGE car nerd), and made myself feel happy. I look back at that and believe that it is truly one of the biggest mistakes in my life.


Since then I have taken a position at another company making $65k with full benefits and many other goodies. I moved off of long island and into an apartment with a new girlfriend in New Jersey. The car that I dumped about $5k into is now beginning to shit-the-bed so I have bought another car (0% Financing for 63 Months) and I am looking to sell the original one. I have my monthly budget and both my girlfriend and I stick to it, but I find that we are both struggling to make it to the end of the month. 


My current debt situation is as follows:

$10,164.16 – Chase Credit Card ($600/Month)

$187.15 – J. Crew Card ($60/Month)

$437.13 – CFNA ($180/Month)

$4,054.35 – PayPal ($200+/Month)

Aprox $9,000 – Student Loan

$40,104.98 – J. P. Morgan Auto Loan.


I know that when Debt Consolidation is brought up it is generally a hard no from everybody; mainly due to people not correcting spending habits and looking at it as a fresh start to then rack up even more debt. I have corrected all of this and have stuck to a very steady budget since June. I strongly believe that debt consolidation will help me set aside money, as right now I am not in any ability to save due to aggressively paying off my debt. My goals for saving initially are not huge, I just want to buy my girlfriend the ring that she deserves, but I hope to be settled into a house sooner rather than later. If I were to consolidate my debt I would do it with just my credit cards alone, and maybe my student loan (has a small interest rate of 2.19%). I would leave my car payment out of it, for obvious 0% reasons. Im not looking for this to be a ""fix all"" solution as I know that I still OWE the money and that this is not a clean slate by any means. I am just looking to do this in order to help myself save.

personalfinance,Pay off car/student loans or invest?,"I am currently sitting on $20,089 in liquid assets (cash). Seems not optimal.
My monthly budget is $2030/month including investments (401k etc.). 6 month emergency fund = $12,180. I have $7909 that I would like to either put towards loans or add to my investment portfolio (+4.8% YTD) - whatever is the more +EV decision.

Current debt: 

* $11,764 @ 3.75% for vehicle paying $610/month because it's a 24 month loan.

Student Loans totaling $15,208 at the following (all federal):

* $7,538 @ 4.41%

* $7,636 @ 4.04%

What do you think is the most +EV decision, pay off loans (which one?) and/or put money in the market? As a recent (currently employed) college graduate I've been told that it may be beneficial to keep some student loan debt around because you can negotiate loan pay off credit with employers.

I have a 750 FICO with 30 accounts (churner). Do you think it might be a good idea to refinance the vehicle loan at a lower rate?

I was thinking about paying off the car in full even though it's not the highest rate %. This would free up the most amount of income ($610/mo) which I can then put to use for paying the student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Experience Refinancing Loans (Including SOFI Bad Experience) Read all documents before signing.,"About me: I (like a lot of lurkers here I expect) fall out of the typical very well off posts or barely scraping by.  I am somewhere in the middle with decent income, student loans, mortgage, car payments, 401k up to the company match, emergency fund bigger than is financially optimized but I like to have plenty of cushion, etc.  

Background:  I have a very stable job so it was time to refinance my graduate student loans of ~100k sitting currently at 6.5%-8.5%.

Plan of attack: I did soft pulls at all the well known names for student loan refinancing.  SOFI, Citizens, commonbond, earnest, elfi, discover, lendkey, and probably a few more.  SOFI offered the same lowest rate as a couple other companies and I began the application process.  (I didn't like that earnest wouldn't let me complete the application without giving them my login and password for my primary checking account so they were immediately crossed off the list.)

Where I made it difficult:  I didn't complete the application because I was in the process of applying for and receiving a energy efficiency loan for home upgrades at 0% interest (put my money to better use elsewhere) and my application stated I was not allowed to have any other open loan applications.  It took ~1.5 months to go through the energy company, multiple smaller companies to handle paperwork, and the bank.  Once that was completely done with I went back to the student loan refinance with SOFI.  SOFI application was still listed as open and I couldn't delete it or begin a new application.  I updated my paperwork to be the most recent copies of required documents and I submitted the application.

Problem:  I was approved by the next morning and when I went to sign the paperwork it had ~1.25% higher interest rate than I was told I was applying for (a difference of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan between the two rates).  Of course fine print says rates can change before the final paperwork is signed.  The customer rep said it must have expired - so I asked why it let me apply stating those rates if it was expired and why it wouldn't let me re-apply or delete the open application.  He then said he sees that I requested to have to application cancelled verbally which I know is 100% not true.  I explained I was frustrated that it let me apply stating the interest rate I qualified for, nothing was in error with my account, and the interest rate on the paperwork was unreasonably different than what I was led to expect (not to mention the reasoning behind the difference doesn't make sense.)  SOFI said I had 2 options: sign the paperwork or cancel the application.  I cancelled the application.  I then reapplied with a soft pull through SOFI and was offered an interest rate 1.0% less than the paperwork from that morning!  That makes little sense to me but I was already applying to many companies for the best rates again.

Solution:  I didn't choose SOFI because the first time I learned of *significant changes in the terms* of the loan I applied for was after a hard pull and no attention was brought to me of any changes of terms compared to my application at all.  Customer reps appeared to me to be web assistants walking people through a simple application process or say sorry instead of someone who could fix a problem.  I went with the next company that offered the interest rate I initially wanted which is ELFI.  I will update with the experience - they require a bit more paperwork than sofi and a personal reference.

**TLDR and MORAL OF STORY:  Read all paperwork before you sign it because terms can change from applications and it's up to you to be sure you know what you are signing.**",finance

personalfinance,Unsure whether I should take out a Federal Unsubsidized Loan or pay out of pocket for remaining tuition bill.,"This is my first time posting here so I will begin by saying Hello! I am currently an enrolled student at a New York State University ,and my bill will be due in a few days. I come from a household with an income of about 40,000$ for the five of us, so I will be paying for my education myself. Because of this, I have received the maximum aid from TAP &amp; PELL. I am already taking out 4,500$ in a subsidized loan for this academic year, but that still leaves about 5,000$ on the bill for the year (2,507$ due this semester). I still have the option to take out an unsubsidized loan for about 2,000$ which will bring my yearly bill down to 3,000$; therefore, it would be only 1,500$ due each semester. 

I work summers as a head lifeguard and have managed to save up 6,500$ in my bank account. This is where I become conflicted--I am unsure whether I should take out the unsubsidized loan and pay the rest out of pocket, OR I can evade the unsubsidized loan completely and pay the 2,500$ out of pocket for this semester. I am hoping to move off-campus next semester as it would lower my bill tremendously (Projecting a 3,500$ decrease). 

I should also mention my field of study as it will help determine my future average salary. I am a dual major: one is TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and one is Asian and American Studies with a minor in Japanese Studies. I am hoping to be able to teach English in Japan post graduation. With this in mind I hope someone can guide me in the right direction, and would greatly appreciate any financial advice that can be offered.

personalfinance,Balance transfer on credit cards?,"I have some credit card debt that's not on a good card because of the interest rate.

personalfinance,A friend posted this on Facebook about student loans and I too want an answer!,"""I thought of a stupid but simple idea, perhaps someone can enlighten me here. I looked on the federal student aid site concerning school loan interest rates (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates) and it states that your daily interest on a loan is calculated by multiplying the days since you last paid your loan by the principal balance by the interest rate (Principle x days since last paid x interest rate). Does that mean that, say, if I have automatic payments set up monthly, and I pay by a small increment every day (could be 5 bucks or something for a total of 150 extra bucks paid on my loan) that my loan WILL NOT accrue interest; since the days since I last paid will always be 0???

I know the statistics on people coming into large amounts of money are not great, but I don't plan on or have any desire to purchase anything big that is not an investment. 

Prior to the lawsuit ending, I was convinced I would leave a significant portion structured, but now I'm leaning the other way. 

(I haven't seen the structure plans so this is just a guess)

If I structure $X for 20 years I may get a higher interest rate on my money and untaxed payments. However, there is no principal and after the payments stop that is it. The money is gone. 

If I take a lump sum (the initial sum will remain untaxed) I can invest my money at the average interest rate and will then be taxed appropriately on the earnings. However, this option allows me to hold onto my principal amount. The money can last longer and possibly increase if I'm smart about it. 

This is just my understanding of it and is probably a crude representation. If anyone knows about this type of thing and wants to tell me what I'm missing or just not understanding I'd love the help.

Funds which are federally taxable but state/local exempt, such as interest from treasury issued bonds and notes, would be completely federal+state tax-exempt in a state taxable HSA? What about bond mutual funds which hold 100% treasury issued investments? Dividend distributions which result from bond interest payments are completely tax-free in an HSA? What if the fund realizes capital gains due to principal increase. Are these state/local taxable or exempt?  
  
What about TIPS? Are the principal adjustments made semi-anually taxable at the state/local level in a state taxable HSA or are these distributions fully exempt?  
  
Mostly, I am curious about investments in HSA that might result in no state/local tax obligation and perhaps saving on needing to take special consideration when filing state tax returns. Would any type of fund result in not needing to do any state tax filing at all for states that do not recognize HSAs (ie same as federal)?

CryptoCurrency,Debitum Network - feedback / review needed to help build great decentralized business borrowing ecosystem,"There is huge amount of small and medium companies out there that have no access to extra financing, hence they are not able to grow, invest in new technologies, products or services as fast or as much as large companies and corporations. World bank states the amount of extra financing needed in this sector is around $2.1-2.6 trillion.. That's why big companies get bigger but small companies mostly remain small and hit their heads against invisible business ceilings!

Two partners and I have been working hard to help solving this issue for 3 years now, as we established a company providing accessible financing faster for small companies based on their outstanding invoices to their customers. We have seen companies being able triple their revenues thanks to our service - no surprise Lithuanian business confederation named us ""The Financial Service of the Year 2016"". We have already served more than 20M Eur and our outstanding portfolio is around 3M Eur. However, we are still far too small to actually solve the whole problem globally.

I also have an extensive IT background and have always tried to innovate technologically. I am actually also involved in a small IT boutique that specializes on new and modern technologies. So when we started researching blockchain technologies we quickly understood that this is next big thing in many spaces.

Our new project we are working on is Debitum Network. The purpose of this post is to get community feedback about the idea, this is very important for us.

Based on our technological and financial background we quickly understood that at the moment it is not possible to fully rely on smart contracts when talking about international lending. Say, smart contract is not able to reach out to borrower's bank account or in the worst case to liquidate borrower's assets or fill them for bankruptcy. Hence more actors are needed than just borrower-investor. That is exactly how Debitum Network is envisioned on a high-level:
* borrower willing to get money, puts up an asset (ideally automatically via inter-ledger integration), configures smart contract and waits
* risk assessor makes risk assessment and records it in smart contract so other can reach it by transferring tokens.
* investor willing to lend money can pick various assets based on risk assessment and other data, smart contract is used to store who invest in what assets
* borrower either repays to investors via smart contract OR new smart contract for debt collection is automatically created after late payment and a debt collector can perform his work on ground in return for tokens.

We believe that such process-based approach allows to open financing process for more players and actually create actual over the border co-operation. By involving many actors in Debitum Network ecosystem it will become self sustainable and it will be able to develop and operate in a truly decentralized manner. We also believe that this is the only way - to create a new market place and to help smaller companies access financing, grow and thus close that huge gap of $2+ trillions.

Please take a look at our [whitepaper] (https://debitum.network/whitepaper/). We would really appreciate your feedback no matter if it’s positive or negative. This is very important for us. Also read our [blog] (http://blog.debitum.network), and join us on social media to keep updated about the progress.

Trading,"Gold Falls To Lowest In Nearly Two Weeks, U.S. Inflation Data In Focus - Indian Stock Market Tips","Gold edged down early on Thursday to hover around its lowest in nearly two weeks, with investors turning their attention to U.S. consumer inflation data later in the day for clues on the timing of further interest rate hikes.

Fundamentals

* Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,320.21 an ounce by 0048 GMT, after earlier dropping to its lowest since Sept. 1 at $1,318.96.

* U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down 0.3 percent at $1,324.50 an ounce.

* Asian stocks edged down on Thursday, consolidating after ascending a decade-high, while the dollar held steady before the U.S. inflation report for August is published.

* U.S. producer prices rebounded in August, driven by a surge in the cost of gasoline, and there were also signs of a pickup in underlying producer inflation.

* The European Central Bank's chief economist renewed his call on Wednesday for a ""steady hand"" in conducting the ECB's ultra-easy monetary policy despite a positive growth outlook.

* The Bank of England must decide how forcefully to talk about the prospect of a first interest rate rise in a decade on Thursday when it will weigh up the need to help Britain's Brexit-bound economy against tackling a jump in inflation.

Bitcoin,"At only $60B market cap, the central banks are colluding to stop Bitcoin. This is probably the greatest affirmation of Bitcoin's potentional that can be made by anyone.","Look at the size of China's economy and China only holds about $15B in Bitcoin.   The PBoC is raking premptive action not due to money laundering as they claim. The amount is irrelevant if 100% of Bitcoin in China was used.  

Namibia, an African nation, has their Central Bank banning the purchsse of Bitcoin. Africa has many small nations where Bitcoin would be better suited and more economic than using their own currency. 

Stronger Central Banks like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China (all private enterprises that have the majority of people believing that they are part of their government but they are NOT) want smaller countries to use their inflationary fiat so they become wealthier. Fractional banking creates (simply prints) currency and creates value when people believe they have to repay with something of value, typically labor.  Bitcoin offers a deflationary option that holds value far greater than Central Bank printed currency. 

Central Banks members hang with people like Hymie Dimon and Mohammad El-Erien.  These high profile people are used as talking heads to try to influence their peers in the industry.  Greed and insight within the industry will counteract that effort. CNBC and Bloomberg are swayed by who pays their bills. For the most part they're an annoyance but are easily discounted. 

The real challenge is the Central Banks who only need to influence a majority, not all, of a goverments politicians.  They then can influence laws against Bitcoin. 

Let's beat them at that game. Write your politician. Meet with them at your meet up. Make a transaction with them. Explain to them how we see threats to this  great technology. Make sure they understand it so if the come out against it, you will know they have been bought and can provide their political opponent with that fact. 

The central banks work together and their efforts are on the radar.

personalfinance,Monthly Cash Flow,"Hello PFers... I'll get right to the point for those of you that have monthly spreadsheets and track what comes in / out do you do this based on Net Pay or Gross Pay?

I have a financial advisor and according to their formulas we now have a monthly deficit of several thousands?  Meanwhile in my monthly net pay spreadsheet where I track all the expense I show a positive balance.

There was a major life change which was marriage.  

Seeing the FA gross pay deficit is alarming (I'm hoping some formula is wrong or a typo).  Meanwhile is my net pay sheet deceiving me?

This guy claims that we have Fed/State/FICA/etc combined to be $6k a month which makes no sense when our pay checks obviously show much less than that.  This is calculated by looking at our pay stubs and adding up those then you multiply that by either 24 or 26 depending on your pay cycle and then divide that by 12 to get the monthly cash flow... Does this mean we might be paying taxes when we file? Current deductions 0/0 and 1/0... Combined AGI is $195K, there is a rental property in there too.  

Am I really fine or should I modify my spreadsheet to show gross pay with tax deductions?  I mean we should get most of that back when we file... I hope.

EDIT: Rough data
I don't have the sheets on me now but I can tell you this off the top of my head...

At least 10K net pay combined coming in.

My house $1700

His rental house $800

Car insurance basically $200 a piece (I pay mine once a year his is twice a year)

My car payment $470 (15K left on it at 0.9% - really payment is less I just send more)

Food groceries dining out $300-$400?

Health bennies wife/hub plan - $500

water- $30

electric/gas utility-$165

tv/internet/phones-$320

dog misc - $100

May be forgetting some other items...

I have 12% going into my 401k - 10% into a standard and 2% roth - employer match 4%
His... 10% - employer match as well.. soon to be 12% after I move him to my insurance plan. 5% into standard, 5% into roth.

The Euro is going through the same QE. Europe's central banks have the most negative interest rates in the world. Many members  of the EU are insolvent. They have no choice but QE and inflation will kill their savings. Bitcoin is their only safe haven. Maybe Fine collectables, guns and alcohol but they're not portable. 

Bitcoin is the greatest threat to the private owners of the central banks. Even the big banks think central banks are unnecessary. But they have the money to bribe politicians.

personalfinance,"I think Navient, my student loan provider, is cheating me. What can I do?","I have A LOT of loans by Navient. Started at 106,000K, I'm now at 98K. Every month for over a year the minimum payment was around $850 and fluctuated. I have ALWAYS payed $1150 every month, with more going toward my highest interest loans. I've always done this manually (no-auto pay). 

I almost forgot a payment a couple months ago, so I signed up for auto-pay and figured I'd just log in every month and continue to add my extra payment as I'd been doing. Auto-pay comes with a 0.25% interest rate decrease on each of your loans.

Well the payment is due tomorrow, so I figured I'd log on and make sure everything was in order. My new minimum monthly payment is, suspiciously, $1152. I called to ask how on Earth my minimum payment went up so much and she said it's because each of my loan interest rates went up by 0.25%....I asked why the cost went at all and didn't just cancel out if I'm supposed to get a 0.25% decrease for signing up for auto-pay. She said that auto-pay discount won't kick in until ""possibly"" the next billing cycle even though I signed up two months ago.

So not only am I very suspicious of the interest rate increase, but now I am unable to overpay on my loans until the auto-pay deduction kicks in, which will translate to hundreds of dollars of unnecessary payments for me. 

I've printed every statement available on Navient and found that they don't even have any statements before September 2016. I've been paying since December 2015, I don't know where they went as I know they had once been there.

I'm aware of the multiple class action suits against Navient for a number of reasons. I'm very concerned about this. Has anyone else had this experience with them? I live very modestly and give up a lot of things in order to tackle these loans, and I just feel like I'm doing everything I should and still getting screwed. Anything I can do about this?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that with Navient, you can't set up an amount for auto-pay that exceeds the minimum due, which is why I would have to make any additional payments separately. I also noticed that one of my (4) loans is fixed, when I thought it was variable, making the 0.25% increase on that one sketchier.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Score Question - How fast is it updated?,"Between my wife and I, we have 8 credit cards (some major banks and some like WestElm and Amazon, etc) with $50K in total available credit.  Some are in my name alone (2), some in hers alone (5), and one in both.

Couple of questions:

* How long will it take to reflect these changes on my credit report?  Days?  A whole billing cycle?
* I am planning on buying or leasing a new car soon, which could take my credit from Good (Equifax 741) to likely excellent.  Does anyone have a good sense of how much different potential interest rates would be between ""Good"" and ""Excellent"" credit?

My fiancé and I set out to keep our wedding under 10k, but our cost has ballooned to around 18-19k. Neither of us makes a ton of money.

We have considered cutting out the wants vs the needs but all deposits are paid and we are set on doing the wedding exactly as it has been planned. This leaves us with the grim option of financing the rest of what we owe. We have a little more money being given to us (probably 1k) and what we can make in the next month. I'm planning on going to my bank and asking for a 9k personal loan this weekend. I'm planning on getting a 5 year payment plan set up and hoping for a low interest rate. 

I'm open to suggestions on ways to keep our debt under control, but I feel the need to pick up a part time job after the wedding to start chipping away at the debt. 

Edit:  Thank you all for the sound advice!  So far I believe that we can cut out the DJ and florist. Off the top of my head that would eliminate about 3k. I also have another 3k set aside for the honeymoon that we are just going to have to spend now. My dad has equipment for entertainment and my brother has wimo lights he can hook up. Her step mom can probably do the floral arrangements. A big factor driving our price up so high is that we didn't want any of our family to have to work during our wedding, but I think we are going to have to throw that notion out the window in order to avoid going in to debt. I know my fiancé has her heart set on everything we've booked and I really don't want to disappoint her, but I also really don't want to start our marriage off in debt.",finance

Utilization is definitely 90%+ which hit her credit score hard. She used to have ~760, but now only has 680 due to utilization.


She has about 33K annual income currently.

 Pays no rent. Lives with her parents.

 470/month 6 year car loan ( terrible idea I know but she won't give it up, says cars are her passion or something )

 200/month for insurance.

 150/month on gas.

 70/month on internet for her family.

 120/month on Crossfit. ( Says that it helps her deal with anxiety )

 100/month maintenance for her dog.

 I think at least 300/month just to pay the minimums on her cards.

It has about 74,500 miles on it and I still owe about $15500 on it.

I'm looking at a 2017 Subaru Forester. I'm not 100% sure what the final price will be yet, but somewhere between $25000-27000. I've already gone and shopped rates at a couple places and found I can get way closer to 3% this time around (creditkarma tells me 760, discover credit scorecard tells me 807). 

So here's where my questions start. First, knowing that I need to get rid of my wrangler, is trading it in or selling it privately going to be my better option? I read that you can get more money by selling it, but it takes longer. Is something like carmax a good option to sell it? My wife is going back to work soon, so I need to have a new vehicle reasonably quickly. I have no experience in the arena of selling vehicles, I'm really lost here. 

I'm going with the Subaru because I know it will be a reliable vehicle that will last a long time, so I think it will be a good investment. Am I wrong in thinking that I'll have a lower monthly payment though? My payments on my jeep are $415 a month (though I'm paying $500 to pay it down faster). With such a drastically lower interest rate and not that much difference in the price of the Subaru vs the price of the wrangler when I bought it (something like $21000 after I put $5000 down) I should be paying less, right?

CryptoMarkets,SandCoin tokens sale is already on September 18!,"**Dear friends!
The SandCoin blockchain option starts in just a few days — on September 18!**

We invite you to take part in bidding and launch this large prospective project with us!
Here are some facts to prove that it’s profitable to buy Sandcoin tokens.

**Firstly,** dealing with Sandcoin, you invest money in the real product. When the development of the sand quarry is over, one sandcoin token will be immediately equal to one cubic metre of sand. At the same time, during the ICO stage, you can buy it at a price three to four times lower than the average market price!

**Secondly,** dealing with us you invest your money in development industry. Sand is an irreplaceable material for construction and our investments in this industry are much more reliable than any fiat currency. Our piece of land of more than 100-hectares is located in 10 km distance from the Central Circular Road construction. The territories along this huge construction site will be actively developed very soon. Particularly, there will be built a railway connection along the Central Circular Road, speed highways Moscow-Noginsk-Nizhny Novgorod-Kazan and new accommodations. The builders will need sand and sandcoin tokens will be liquid at the stock exchange and their holders can resell to the developers and gain profit.

**Thirdly,** dealing with us, you invest your money in the working project. The SandCoin team are the experienced specialists in the construction industry. At this moment, all the expert works on the sand quarry development have been done. The company has got a sand extraction license of Geological Institute from Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency of the Russian Federation. According to the estimates of the geologists, there will be extracted about 90 000 cubic metres of sand per month. This way, if the market price of one cubic metre is $5.30 today then the profit from the sand quarry will be almost $ 500 000 per month.
These are not just empty words! The action plan is already approved and we are ready to start just when the ICO is over.

personalfinance,Girlfriend has finally opened up about her student loan debt and we have no idea what to do about it.,"I bought a house last year and moved in with my girlfriend. She's not on the mortgage and pays me “rent.” Her student loans are a topic she avoided like the plague every time I brought it up. 

Well this weekend when I sent her a Google Wallet request for her share of the rent/utilities, she broke down and confessed that she couldn't afford to pay me the full amount. So I'm finally getting a chance to look at her debt now. 

I didn't go to college, I don't have student loans. So I'm kinda lost when it comes to what type of loans these are and whether or not they can be consolidated/refinanced. She has told me before that she could not consolidate any of these loans for reasons that didn’t make sense to me. I’m hoping she’s wrong. 

She has 9 active loans totalling $58,250.46 with interest rates ranging from 3.25-8.68%:

3 loans are “stafford subsidised.”
3 loans are “direct loan,” 1 subsidised, 2 unsubsidised.
These first six are all from the same lender.
2 are debt collectors for loans she’s already defaulted on.
1 is a “federal parent plus loan.”

Obviously I’m going to get her on a budget right away and start attacking the highest interest rate first, which on the plus side, also happens to have the lowest balance.

Once the budget is sorted out I'd like to try and see if we can save money and time by consolidating/refinancing these 9 loans into 1 or 3 but… What’s a stafford subsidised loan? Unsubsidised? Direct? Is there any reason why I can’t refinance all these into one loan with one interest rate and one payment? Or at least, fewer than 9 payments?",finance

personalfinance,Can I take a loan to cover my credit card debt? 13k in debt and so overwhelmed,"Hello. I'm wondering if I have the option to take a loan to pay off my credit card debt and pay that off instead. Would it be a better option so long as the interest rate is lower than my credit cards? I'm so over my head in credit card debt and paying so much each month and in interest charges that I feel like I'm never going to pay them off.

If this is an option, what are some good lenders out there?

personalfinance,Should I Refinance My Mortgage?,"I live in IL (not Chicago) and pay a 3.625% interest rate on my mortgage. I'm interested in refinancing my mortgage to lower that interest rate and shorten the loan term. I am wondering if 3.625% is a reasonable interest rate. Would I be wasting time and money by trying to lower my interest rate? 


Background information:
My husband and I purchased our home in June 2015. The total price was roughly $115,000 and we paid a down payment + closing costs. Our mortgage ended up being (roughly) $91,000 with a fixed interest rate of 3.625% over 30 years. As of August 2017 we had paid the mortgage down to $65,592. My husband has a credit score over 800 and mine is mid 700. We have no plans to move out of this house for at least a decade. I would like to have the house paid off in the next 5 years.

personalfinance,Stupid Decision of getting a car loan. Looking for options to get out of it or lower my interest rate.,"A little back story. A couple years back I flipped and totalled my car due to hazardous roads on my way to work. Now at the time I had no credit. So me and my dad went and bought a car at a credible used dealership.

My interest rate is 10%. I'm also trapped in the loan for another 4 years. I can afford the payments but I need money to be able to send myself to college. I'm basically living paycheck to paycheck right now with very little money to actually spend on myself. I haven't had a vacation in probably 5 or 6 years. 

I can't refinance the car because it's too old and I have no idea what to do. Also the car is no where near what it was worth when I bought it. Is it possible for me to contact the bank and negotiate a new loan now that my credit score is considered great?

Edit: Blue book value is trade in value 3,168-4,145. Private party 6,049. Currently my loan balance is 7,623. Problem with me just selling it out right is I need a car where I live car.",finance

MachineLearning,Conditional GAN learns to an extent and then destroys what it has learnt,"Hi.

I am trying to train a basic cgan for MNIST based on labels (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) in keras. I am concatenating the noise and condition at the input for the generator. For the discriminator I concatenate the condition after applying 3 consecutive convolutions to the input image (so that the image structure can be interpreted without destroying it by adding conditions right away). The condition is then also fed to a dense layer before adding it to the sigmoid output. The network seems to learn upto 200 iterations where it generates more or less number-like structures but then later starts to just destroy what it has learnt and generates big white blobs covering the whole image. (number pixes are white and background black). What could possibly be wrong? below are my G and D networks. I am using SGD optimizer with lr 0.0005, momentum 0.9 for both G and D. Any ideas?

personalfinance,"If you get a tax refund, you have more identify theft risks than if you don't.","Keep in mind that if you are concerned about identity theft exposure, tax return processing ignores any credit freeze.  Someone can use your address and social security information to file for your tax refund, and they will end up getting it in a distressingly high number of cases.   (The IRS has been improving efforts to combat this, but it's still a big problem, especially if crooks are able to get your previous tax return data, which is available in various underhanded ways.)

It's a bureaucratic nightmare to try to get your money back in that situation as well.

""Unfortunately, if you’re victimized, establishing that you are the real taxpayer due a refund and getting what you’re due can be an ordeal. The IRS will require you to report the fraud and fill out a form establishing how you learned of the crime and what tax years are affected. The agency also suggests that you file a fraud report with the Federal Trade Commission and report it to all three credit bureaus. ""

One quick and easy fix is to change your withholdings so you don't get a refund.  They can't steal what you don't get in the first place.  While some people like using the IRS as a form of forced zero-interest savings, that has its own risk that you can eliminate by saving the extra money in more secure ways.

personalfinance,My wife and I are trying to refinance some of her student loans and are meeting a lot of resistance from everywhere we apply. Help?,"Hello

So my wife has about $100k in debt from her bachelor's degree. She makes about $50k a year and I make $40k. We are good responsible borrowers who always pay our bills on time. We have no credit card debt. I have about $20k in student loans that appears on my credit report but I do not pay these, my parents do. Wife's credit score is 765, my credit score is 748.

About $65k of the $100k total are private loans currently held by AES. The highest interest rate is 10.83% and the lowest is 5.8%. the rates are variable and the payment rises every year. I want to get it into a fixed rate now. This $65k is the amount we're attempting to refinance (the rest are federal loans with lower interest rates that I'm leaving alone). 

Unfortunately we have been repeatedly denied by the major lenders. First they claim that my wife needs a ""co-signer"", which is fine I am more than happy to do that to refinance them (I'm paying for them anyway). Then they claim that my ""debt to income ratio is too high"" to cosign. 

What I don't understand is this makes no sense. We have been paying steadily on these loans for years. We spend $780 every month on student loans. Thats like a mortgage payment, and we've been making it every month for six years now. So it isn't as if we cannot pay. The one company initlsly offered us 5.11% but then once we completed all the paperwork and sent our documents they rejected it anyway, but at 5.11% we would have paid $88 less per month and paid the loan off almost a year earlier than now. 

My point is we already have this debt, it's already something we pay for. We're just trying to refinance it which is the responsible financial decision here. I can't understand why they won't approve us. We have tried calling for reconsideration but nobody gives us an inch  they just steadfastedly say we don't qualify. 

We have tried Sofi, Citizen's Bank, and Education Loan Finance.

Tomorrow the IMF and EC together with the USA federal reserve have a press conference that because cryptocurrencies are used to circumvent embargos (like the one on North Korea), they will immediately review the business of all exchanges in the Euro zone and suspend their banking licenses. Market crashes lower.  
In the next three months most countries in the South America and Asia follow. The market continues to fall.  
After 3 months EU and USA issue an order that any digital asset like the existing cryptocurrencies become illegal, but at the same time they will issue a common blockchain cryptocurrency XX. This XX will in beginning be attached to the average value of USD and EUR (but will in time decouple) and the national banks will stand behind the value, similar like they do in national bonds today, but also have certain access to the ledger of confirmed private accounts. They offer to exchange any other existing crypto currency (that by now are not worth much) into the new XX, where the origin of the value can be proven (which hardly ever can be). Most people jump at the opportunity. The existing cryptocurrency market shatters into small fragments mostly consisting of only few anonymous coins.

stocks,$AAPL Has Something of a Lock on 3-D Sensing Against Android,"From Barron's:

&gt;Apple Has Something of a Lock on 3-D Sensing Against Android, Says Rosenblatt

&gt;Apple's patents on ""3-D sensing,"" and exclusive deals with suppliers such as Lumentum, may offer the company something of a lock on the technology of augmented reality, according to a report by Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities.

&gt;Apple (AAPL) Tuesday introduced its iPhone X, and the Street is fascinated with the implications of ""augmented reality,” including both “Face ID,” the feature that unlocks the phone, and the various applications that use the rear camera, for things like new kinds of video games.

&gt;Among those pondering Apple’s augmented reality is Rosenblatt Securities’s Jun Zhang, who today argues that Apple has something of a lock on the technology, which may create some barriers to competitors building phones using Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google’s Android software.

&gt;Zhang, who rates Apple shares Neutral, speculates on the chips in both the front-facing camera of the iPhone X, the so-called TrueDepth camera, and also what may be in the rear camera of both the iPhone X and the iPhone 8, the cheaper iPhone that was announced on Tuesday as well.

&gt;Collectively, these chips and functions are referred to as “3-D sensing.""

&gt;Zhang goes through several details of the “flood illuminator” and the “dot projector” components in the TrueDepth camera, which he expects to be supplied by Lumentum (LITE), Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI). He then writes ""We also believe Apple has an exclusive agreement with Lumentum, Finisar, and II-VI on VCSEL+DOE structured lights and 100-300 VCSEL array formats,” referring to the chips involved.

&gt;""This makes it difficult for Android smartphones to replicate Apple’s 3D sensing model,” asserts Zhang.

&gt;In addition to the TrueDepth camera, Zhang thinks that the rear camera contains a “Time of Flight depth sensor” provided by ST Micro (STM) to make possible augmented reality applications: ""We still believe STMicro has a depth sensor in the rear cameras of the iPhone 8 Plus and X models as we believe that is where high-power VCSEL lasers and IIVI is used.""

&gt;""Our industry research suggests that STM supplied an upgraded version of the depth sensor to Apple this year […] In our view, the ToF depth sensor is enough to support the AR camera combined with ARKit.""

&gt;It all comes down to patents, Zhang believes, which may be an obstacle to Android copying Apple’s work:

&gt;Our research suggests that smartphone OEMs’ interest in 3D sensing has increased following the iPhone X announcement. For Android, we believe Orbbec is the matured 3D sensing solution, although perfor- mance is far below Apple. Nonetheless we expect Chinese OEMs to adopt this solution in the first half of 2018. However, because Apple has some patents in 3D sensing, we note that it has become increasingly diffi- cult for other players to develop the 3D sensing solutions with a similar combination of perfor- mance+accuracy+power consumption. We expect adoption ramp to be in late-2018. Our industry research suggests that many 3D sensing model suppliers are waiting for Lumentum's small packaging of the edge emitter laser solution.

&gt;Of note, Zhang also addresses what some believe was a failure of the Face ID function during the demonstration on Tuesday. Although Apple executive Craig Federighi appeared to struggle on stage to have the phone recognize him, Zhang writes that Face ID improves over time:

&gt;Investors were disappointed to see the Face ID demo fail on the first attempt on stage, but according to our understanding, the system has a self-learning function where the more a user uses Face ID, the more accurate the readings become. Overall, we are not concerned regarding this first time mishap.

&gt;For a different perspective on the Android prospects, see today's post about the upgrade of Qualcomm (QCOM) from Northland's Tom Sepenzis. Sepenzis thinks Qualcomm and Himax will have a promising business supplying the Android camp with an alternative approach to 3-D sensing.

I've been through a divorce and being destitute several times (not the divorce part)  after leaving home young.  I grew up in the 80s and 90s middle to upper middle class.

  I am trying to return to a middle class lifestyle and retire early.  Basically I plan to r/leanfire without an rv. I estimate I need about 300k to retire on the lifestyle I want. Maybe less. I'm hoping to retire by about 45. I can keep working if I want as I love what I do.  I purchased (financed) a house this year with money I saved up over a 3 year period.

Anyway, I've been plugging away at this since just past 30. Basically the moment I learned this was a life option I jumped on it.   My SO while he's made steps in the right direction and I'm proud of him. Is financially in his infancy and has only made the changes due to years of prodding . He Doesn't seem like he's going to come around to this whole financial thing.

I've already made clear that we can stay together but I will not marry him with his finances like this and that I will not combine finances or credit with him.  I gave him the opportunity to go halvsies on the DP for the house to make it truly ""ours"" and he came up with $0. Literally.  So it's in my name only.

 He complains that he doesn't make enough and never has money left over.  We split the bills (he reliably pays) and he makes about 10k a year more than me. I put about 50% of my income away and he has none left. I don't see hoards of items or anything. I've tried figuring it out but I think it's all going to man toys and tools and food.  He's also paying some of these things off via credit. Its not a huge amount, I think a couple grand but at our income level that a lot and the interest rate I'm sure is insane.

I've tried talking to him about saving money and not paying interest and he agrees he should but he insists it's a ""I don't make enough money"" thing when I can show him it's clearly a lifestyle choice.  He feels deprived just thinking about not buying stuff. He shops when he's depressed or bored. Its gotten better but it's still there.

Has anyone been in this situation? What happened?  He pays his share, and is a great companion but I'm concerned as to what happens with our increasing gap in wealth. I'm not planning on traveling the world or anything like that once retired but maybe I'm not thinking of something. 

Please, I ask not to bash him unfairly in replies. Hes a good person but he's stuck in a bad place. We align on most other things. 

 I am fully aware he is not going to change and I'm just looking for stories of others in similar situations.


I can clarify things if needed. I wanted to keep the original post short.  Thanks

EDIT:  it looks like people have used this thread to attempt to pick apart my financial plan. I'm on mobile and people are not reading my previous replies so I'm going to put this here once and stop replying to posts

Yes I understand that is about 15k a year once the house is paid off. YES i can live on that including repairs, cars and medical. I will continue to work part time to maintain my medical if needed. I can rent out rooms if things get stupid. I know how to flip things and can come up with money quickly if needed. 


I live a very frugal and resourceful lifestyle and lived on 8K while saving for the house. In southern California.  While I was living in Orange county...

 Thanks for the concern but I am done explaining myself that not what this thread is about. People on reddit said I'd never have a house EVER 3 years ago when I posted my plan and income and look how that turned out. So again thank you but I'm confident I can pull this off.

Check out r/leanfire guys. I'm not the only one who is doing it this way.

My wife and I purchased a home in coastal region in Florida last year and we love it here. We're within walking distance to the beach and the house is very comfortable now that we've remodeled it.

We purchased the home for 490k, believe it be worth around 600k now and owe 140k.

As we're in a flood prone region, we carry a flood policy with a max of 250k (highest federal limit) and a homeowners policy with a max of 320k (which would cover our rebuild costs - the value is in the land).

Between both insurance policies, we pay roughly 5k/yr. Taxes are another 5k. We're hearing that flood insurance may go up however as the federal program is in a deficit.

We're in a position to pay off the house entirely but last week we were unfortunately struck by Hurricane Irma. Power is still out but no major damage thankfully.

This has me thinking if living here is really a wise choice as our plan has been to FIRE in 8-10 yrs. I'm concerned that: 1.) if we have a more devastating storm after we retire it would be difficult to rebuild without full-time incomes 2.) I'm beginning to question if having so much money wrapped up in a house is really wise? 

Outside of the house, we have:

 * 325k in a managed brokerage account (I know folks don't like advisors here but we like ours)
 * 75k in a self managed brokerage account 
 * 300k in a 401k
 * 175k in cash and smaller investments

So basically, the house is a little less that half our current net-worth. And based upon my calculations it would be worth around 1/4-1/3 once we FIRE.

Does anyone here live in a risk prone area? Are you staying when you FIRE?

My other thought is that if we did get something less expensive (250k ish), we would be very close to our FIRE numbers right now. I'm not sure if this matters as we're planning to work for a little longer but it would be nice to have the freedom to go part-time.

I'm also wondering if we should pay-off the house now if we're considering moving. We could use the money we have now for a substantial down payment on something less expensive/risky?

personalfinance,Opening a savings account,"Hi PF! I finally finished paying off my student loans, my next goal (besides maximizing retirement contributions) is to generate a 6-month E-Fund.  I've budgeted to hit my goal for the E-Fund amount 15 months from now.  The only thing left to do now is to choose a bank!

I have a checking account with Citizen's bank, I'm going to make a trip into a branch soon to see what they offer for savings accounts.  I'm really interested in knowing more about online, high interest rate savings accounts (Ally, Barclay's, GS, etc.).  This is only for E-Fund, so I'm not overly worried about transfer/withdrawal times.  Mostly I want something I can trust, with a decent mobile or web app to check my account.

personalfinance,Am I fucked? Is there any way I can fix this?,"Throwaway, obviously.

31, married, with a 6 month old. Sole provider in my household.

In the last year, I moved across the country for a job I thought was a promotion within my same company. It wasn't. I was lied to by the internal recruiter (who was later fired for his actions in my recruitment). I ended up making about $60K less than I was told I would. Ate up my savings to the point of having nothing in my savings account and nothing in my 401K. Our daughter was born in March, around the same time 1 of our 2 vehicles got repossessed, got evicted from our apartment, and began living paycheck to paycheck.

Managed to get my old job back, at my old pay rate, back in my old city (in Texas).

After 2 months of couchsurfing with an infant, and a dog, we finally got into an AirBNB style apartment for $2K a month (all bills paid, month to month). We are going to stay here a few months to get consistency for our daughter. It's a nice place and we like it.

After the insanity of feeling like I've failed as a father, husband, and provider, I'm looking at a $10,700 commission check on the 29th of this month, and got paid $1600 base pay today.

Here's what I've done so far, and what I need to do in the immediate future.

Have cancelled all subscriptions services. AppleMusic/HBO GO/Etc. Have restructured my cell phone bill to be almost $100/month less (I pay for my indigent parents' cell phone bill, which only accounts for like $20 a month for their flip phones). Switched car insurance from Geico to Progressive which is saving me almost $100 a month or $1200 a year.

We eat clean food only, which is great. We buy a 50lb bag of brown rice, a 20lb bag of pinto beans, and 10lbs of quinoa, at a time. The rice lasts us 3 months, the beans and quinoa about 6 weeks. We don't eat a lot of meat, but when we do it's clean/grass fed. We also have to buy coconut milk, since she's lactose intolerant and breast feeding, but we've gotten really good at finding the best deals.

I owe $6600 to the collection agency for the apartment. I owe $4400 on the car that got repossessed. I owe $1200 to the birth center where we had my daughter (and they've been super helpful with my situation so far, not sending things to collections).

I need to spend about $500 to get drivers licenses and car registered here in my state. She's also pretty vehement about getting all of our passports for us, and needing to get her name changed on all the stuff. All of that, with passports would be about $1000.

I also need to pay off the balances on our leased phones, and get caught up on the car payment, since I'm running about 45 days behind for the last 6-8 months.

All told, between paying off phones, getting our car registered, licenses, passports, and caught up on a few payments behind, I'm looking at about $2500. I also need to pay rent and car insurance which comes to $2200.

My net-nut for the month is as follows:

Rent - $2200
Car Payment - $450
Car Insurance - $212
Gas - $175 (1.5 tanks a week in a Subaru Impreza)
Cell Phone - $150
Food - $600
Laundry (on site, no W/D in our unit) - $90

My take home is roughly $3K base, and I'm taking home on average about an extra $5K after taxes in commission. Last month was a little bit of an outlier.

I'm so lost. I've never ever been able to manage money, my parents couldn't either. Credit according to Credit Karma is in the tank. So is her credit from years of being a traveling musician. Updated my W4 with my employer to show married and 3 allowances, so that should up my take home.

Whew. That's depressing writing all of that. I have a couple of questions for y'all.

1) How fucked am I in regards to renting a place? I know I could pay off the collection agency, but don't evictions get stored in a rental history? Is there any way to fix that?

2) Outside of my current car that I'm keeping. The amount I have in collections is roughly $15K. Is it worth it to pay those off, even though they'll stay on my credit file?

3) Should I be exploring bankruptcy options? I don't think I should given that with this job, I can pay off all that debt in 3-6 months. I'm more worried about the eviction keeping us from the ability to get a permanent place.

I lurk here all the time, and thanks in advance to everyone who replies. I really appreciate it.",finance

personalfinance,Best course of action to sell a car with a lien,"Due to some recent changes in my career I ended up moving to NYC. With that in mind, about two years ago I purchased a 2011 Honda Accord SE at around 50k miles with the help of a loan through a credit union. The loan, about 1% interest, still has $9,000 remaining so the car has a status of lein. I do not need this car in the city and need the money spent on insurance/payments sooner then later. I am currently trying to sell my car, now around 76k miles and in excellent condition, but have had no luck and I believe it is because I do not hold the title. As far as I can tell I have two options unless I can find a buyer. First, I could take out a new personal loan from somewhere like lenders club to pay off my auto loan, although I would now have the title and more potential buyers, the loan interest rate would go from 1% to about 7%. I understand this loan would be paid off when I sell my car (private buyer KKB and Edmunds just over 9k) but only if I am able to sell it in the near future. I also have the option to sell it quickly through a dealer or something like carmax. Most of these places have offered just over 7k for it, so about 2k would come out of my pocket to get rid of the car completely. I am trying to think of what the most reasonable approach is and how to not negatively affect my credit from either losing a loan or taking on another. Thoughts?",finance

I found out today that my car has died and I need to buy my next car. Is it better if I...

A) Pay down the debt of the first card today to improve my credit rating so I can get a more attractive loan? How quickly is this reflected in my credit rating? If I'm looking to buy a car in the next week, will that help my rating at all in terms of bringing down the amount of credit I'm using?

B) Should I put it toward both cards equally? They have only a minor difference in APR, by less than 1%. Does it impact your credit to be really close to the limit on one card, and not another? Or is it only your overall use of available credit?

C) Should I use this $3000 toward a down payment on my next car because paying off this debt won't impact my credit rating quickly enough to make a difference? I know the APR on a car loan is significantly lower than a credit card so I'm guessing this isn't the best option, but I've always bought cars with cash so I'm looking for help!

personalfinance,Interest payments on my student loans seem higher than they should be,"I have 10 federal student loans with rates ranging from 3.15-6.55% that I just started making payments on the principal for this month. I only just started the job I have now about two months ago so I'm still working on building up an emergency fund before I start really attacking these loans so I'm only making the minimum payments right now. When I looked at the breakdown for each of the loans, I'm paying a lot more interest on these loans than I should be after using the formula the company supplies to calculate interest payments.

As an example, one of my loans has a current principal of $1,301.59 at a 6.55% interest rate. The company supplied formula to calculate the interest payment is ((p*i)/365.25)*n where p is the current principal balance, i is the interest rate, and n is the days of interest needed (# of days in the billing month). For August, using this formula, the interest payment should have been ((1301.59*.0655)/365.25)*31 = $7.24 but when I looked at the breakdown, I paid $15.03 total for August, $4.02 of which went toward principal, the other $11.01 went to the interest. Using their formula again, ((1301.59*i)/365.25)*31 = 11.01, the interest rate comes out to be 9.97%.

All of my other loans through this company also have higher than makes sense interest payments like this. Am I doing something wrong with my calculations or is there something I'm missing?",finance

personalfinance,I am 24 years old and currently make ~115k after year end bonus. What do i do with my extra money?,"Hello everyone! I follow this sub fairly regularly but have not seen a post quite tailor to my situation so I thought I would ask some advice. Here it goes:

Income: I am 24 years old and make $100,000 gross per year paid bi-weekly. My pay also includes a yearly performance bonus that is between 10% &amp; 20% w/ 15% being target. I am expecting 15% bonus this year (was 17% last year). My company also matches my 401k investment $1 for $1 up to 7% of my salary. My health care is completely covered by my company (no premiums).

Expenses: Some of you may be a bit mortified by this section but some of this is justified. My current expenses are around $4,500. I know this is very high but I am currently helping my fiance get through pharmacy school which will take about 2 more years. She will have a salary of around $100k starting out as well so it is worth it for me to suffer for the time being. Also this includes EVERYTHING, haircuts, entertainment, ect. i.e. I will never go over this even on my most lavish entertainment months (Could have an additional $100/mo or so for savings). This however is possibly another discussion on here so I will not go into more detail.

Debt: Currently I have student loan debt, credit card debt and car loan debt. Student loan debt: ~$30,000. Payment is $375/month w/ average interest rate of like 5%. CC debt is ~$7,000. However ~$4,000 of this is for a engagement ring i bought w/ 0% interest for 12 months. (Other 3k is from school when I was stupid). Combined car debt for both of is ~$40,000 w/ monthly payments of ~$800.

Savings: I currently have ~$15,000 in my 401k. I have 2 months of emergency fund saved up.
 
Breakdown: Here is the gist of my financial situation and where I am looking for help. Monthly income is ~$5150 after taxes, Expenses ~$4450. This leaves me with ~$700 left over.

Plan for next year: All indications are that I will get a raise of ~3%. When my bonus is paid (Feb.) I am going to pay off my credit cards in full and use the rest for an emergency fund. This will put me out of credit card debt and up to ~$1,000/ month I can save (w/ two bonus checks throughout the year). I will also now have ~3 months emergency fund.

Options (?): I am asking your opinions here because I am kind of clueless on how to invest. (Almost got talked into a whole life insurance policy)

1. Raise my 401k to 15% which would leave me at ~$400 left over each month. Use the remaining to increase my emergency fund?

2. Invest a portion into a mutual fund?

3. I am almost out of the pay scale to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA so should I even bother at this point?

4. Will most likely use 1 of my 2 additional check for a year of vacations (my fiance and me are long distance to this is kind of a must). What should I do with the other check $2,575?

5. Take it all and start day trading penny stocks? (kidding)

- I have $13,000 in savings.
- The only debt I have is my car. Monthly payments are $350 and I have $16,800 left to go. The interest rate is 2.65%.
- I have 2 credit cards which I pay off in full every month. 
- Other than my car payment, my other monthly expenses are rent (~$600), cell phone (~$100), misc. subscriptions (~$25), and then normal day to day expenses. I have a significant commute, so I'm spending about $200 a month on gas. Car insurance is about $340 every 6 months.
- I also have $500 in the MyIRA program but it's being phased out so I need to figure out where to refocus my retirement saving efforts.

Any advice you have based on my current position would be very much appreciated! I'm also wondering...

- Should I be investing? Where do I start? 
- When I have a spare buck should I put it towards trying to get my car paid off quicker, or something else?
- Now that the MyIRA program is being phased out, what should I do with that money?

We expect to have around $20,000 put aside for the down payment by the time my dad retires.  We also will have about $15,000 available to us (if necessary) by borrowing against a 401k and IRA (although I really don't want to do this).  The house in question currently shows up on Zillow at $350,000.  In the booming front range, the value has gone up nearly $100,000 in three years and is expected to continue as the front range explodes.  My parents keep talking about giving us a ""gift of equity"" if we want to buy the house, but I am unclear of how that works.  But the main idea seems to be that, since they will save 6% by not having an agent, they are willing to gift us that amount (in equity)--which could make a huge difference on the down payment.

My wife and I believe we can afford it.  We are in our late 20s and combine for just over $100,000.  Outstanding student loans and auto loans add up to about $350/month.  No kids (yet).  We are pretty extreme budgeters so there's no much else that isn't necessary other than Netflix and MoviePasses.  I had hoped to put off buying for a couple years so we could have a better downpayment...but prices are booming, interest rates are low, and this is a huge discount on a beautiful home.

I'm looking for advice on several fronts:

First, does anyone have experience with buying without an agent?  How did it go?

Second, does anyone know how ""gifts of equity"" work?  Can I apply it to the down payment or will it just a discount on the principal?  

Lastly (and probably most complicated), I become eligible for promotion in 2018.  A promotion would be a $13,000 immediate pay bump and huge perks down the line.  But to be a likely candidate for promotions, I have to be willing to move (which we are).  We are well aware that it is not usually worth it to buy a house and resell it within months or even a couple years.  Is this a wash if we are getting the house at a discount anyway?  If I get a promotion elsewhere, what are the major things to consider if we decide to rent out the house instead of sell it when we move?

It's a lot of questions, but I appreciate any input.  Thank you in advance.

EDIT: A few more thinks after some of the comments.  My wife works at a bank that will wave a large amount of the closing costs.  So we are good on both closing costs and emergency fund money.  Also, we have been told by her bank that so long as the gift of equity plus out down payment get above 10%, they would forego PMI (which is huge and I should have mentioned earlier...but we are still not 100% on).  But, we have no intention on getting anywhere close to 20% down.  That being said, we absolutely can afford the monthly mortgage payments (my calulations have it somewhere around $1700/month without any PMI.",finance
investing,Does anyone else feel like the stock market is actually undervalued right now?,"There have been a lot of threads lately about imminent collapses and crashes, and yet the market continues to hit all time highs. Corporate profits are expected to increase for the foreseeable future. The Federal Reserve has done an incredible job of ensuring that rates are low enough so as to spur economic growth but high enough to prevent inflation. The Chairmen (and women) have found an economic ""goldilocks"" zone where stockholders are confident that growth will continue but also confident that it will be slow enough that rates will not increase much beyond where they are now. Low volatility reflects the Federal Reserve's ability to charter a steady course. The markets have figured out that things are, and will continue to be, more steady than they have ever been before. I actually think we will see a sub-8 VIX sometime in 2018 if not 2017.

Banks are situated better than they have been since the 1950s. The summer stress tests proved that. ISIS has been defeated, and let's face it--North Korea is not going to risk it's existence by doing something stupid. They are trying to garner attention, but at this point it's like the story of the boy who cried wolf.

The political realm is not without its problems, but there is absolutely no need to change current legislature to keep stocks going up. We really are in a new paradigm. If you look at the economic history of the U.S., it's full of huge whipsaws--until the early 1980s, when steady growth became the new normal. I'm not sure why this is (I'd be interested to hear any ideas), but my pet theory is that the Federal Reserve's economic models are vastly more superior than at any time before. Improvement in these models has allowed them to charter a steady path forward. The 2008 recession was this generation's Great Depression. Just like it took 75 years for another crash that bad to happen, I don't think we will see anything like 2008 for another 75 years--or even more.

Based on long term interest rates (30 year treasury rate is 2.77%), this is the most stocks have been undervalued since August 2015, July 2012, and October 1998. Ask yourself; one year beyond each of those dates, where did the market go? In all seriousness, there is no reason to not buy both stocks and bonds at this point, but stocks are clearly the better deal.

My short term target for the S&amp;P 500 is 2600 by the end of earnings season in late October. Longer term, I see us crossing the 3000 threshold by early 2019 (just extrapolating the trend). Here's where I will go out on a bit of a limb: the S&amp;P will pass 5000 and the Dow will pass 36,000 by the end of Trump's second term. Yes, I am assuming Trump will be re-elected. I realize a lot of us don't like some of his more controversial moves, but as Bill Clinton said, ""It's the economy stupid"". And there is absolutely no reason to think the economy will not continue on it's current trajectory far into the future.

I am fully invested in SPY at the moment, and I suggest you do the same. I'm interested to here other's strategy's going forward (although I believe time in the market is better than timing the market, I still like to hear the variety of things people have tried at that have failed or worked). Thoughts?

personalfinance,Nearly 500K in debt,"Hi there, 

I'm a dental student, about 20 months away from graduating with my degree. I live and go to a very expensive university (4 year doctoral program). After accounting for interest, housing, and tuition, I'll most likely be around $500,000 in debt. I'm single, and can definitely live with my sibling or even my parents for a while, after graduating to help pay off my loans. But being in the northeast and all, what is the most efficient way of paying off my loans, the earliest?

personalfinance,Protecting self from cancelled contract,"OH dealing with a company in CA.

On Wednesday the 13th when I came home from work, I was talking to my fiancee and she told me that she had consolidated her student loan debt. As I asked her more and more questions I became more suspicious as things didn't sound right and had her bring up her contracts. As I read the contracts, which my fiancee didn't, it turns out that the company, Performance SLC LLC, isn't part of the government and instead just instead applies for debt forgiveness to the Federal Loan office for you for a fee of $1,450, set up through a rotating credit plan through Equitable Acceptance. After freaking out I scoured the credit contract and there was a page that gives 3 days for cancellation.

I had her print the page out, sign and date it, took a picture with the signed contract and my phone showing date and time, and then went to Fedex to have it overnighted with tracking to where the contract said to send the form. The delivery was signed for the next day at the correct location and I printed out the confirmation. 

However, today she received a text message from Performance asking her for more information so they could perform the consolidation, she responded that she had sent the cancellation papers and that the service was no longer wanted. They responded by asking her why and that was the end of the conversation. She also received a confirmation from Equitable that they had opened the line of credit. She responded saying that she had executed her right to cancel in the contract and she included the picture of the signed document and the delivery confirmation. We also called Equitable but they have not gotten back to us.

ethereum,An invitation for brainstorming on a potential project on using Ethereum for tracking and paying for access to commons,"I am not a developer, so what I am writing here may be silly from the technical standpoint, and if so, I apologize in advance.

It seems to me that one of the potentially revolutionary applications of Ethereum could be tracking and enabling people to pay for the access to commons like streets, roads, parks, lakes, etc. Up until now, it has been rather difficult to do this given the high transaction costs involved. Thus, it is the states and municipalities that mostly manage and pay for such commons, quite probably in a very inefficient manner. 

With Ethereum, this might well change because presumably an app may track the GPS coordinate of a person, mark the moment she crossed the geographical boundary of, say, a park, register when she exited it and calculate and withdraw the payment.

The apparent weak link in this proposal is the problem of how to incentivize people to use such an app. After all, if we put guards to watch if people entering a commons have the app installed on their phone, it will take away the transaction cost reduction the proposal is supposed to bring. I hope, however, that it will be possible to find solutions if a lot of smart people become involved.

One option may be to just rely on people's conscientiousness. Most people aren't Hobbesian agents and thus a lot of people will be happy to make micropayments, especially if they know that there are no other modes of maintaining the relevant commons. Undoubtedly, there are other approaches, though.    

If this is possible, this may be especially heart-warming for those in the Ethereum community who are motivated in large part by the desire to minimize the government behemoth through technology and not just by reducing intermediary-created costs here and there, even though the latter is a worthy objective, too.

Looking forward to your fedback in the comments, and if someone thinks the project could be worth actually attempting to implement, here is my email: daniilgor2004@gmail.com. Admittedly, I am just a doctoral student in economics, so I can't contribute much to the project financially or development-wise but I'd be happy to participate in some capacity.

We are in our mid 30's and I've been switching our bond accounts and some of the mutual funds (not all, they hit some interesting sectors) into cheaper Vanguard accounts.

However, the stability of principal account has me confused.  It is a PLUS account ran by eplus:

personalfinance,Need help with our loan options,"TL;DR: We're trying to decide if we refi our mortgage to roll in a loan that's due, or just pay it off.

We have a home equity loan that's due - around $60k.
 
The bank is trying to convince us to open a new 30 yr mortgage to roll the $60k into it, where the main mortgage balance is currently around $290k. 

We have enough cash to pay off the home equity loan, so that's the approach I am in favor of.

The $290k is an existing 20 yr loan at 4% that we've already been paying for 5 years.  I estimate (via loan calculators) that we've already paid $80k interest on it.

A new mortgage would put us at an interest rate of 4.875% and we'd start all over again.

My partner wants to do it because she'd feel more secure with the lower overall monthly payments, even though it would increase our total interest payments by almost a quarter of a million dollars on top of what we've already paid.  There's a chance she'll lose her job, and we'd struggle to make ends meet if that happens.  The difference in monthly payment (keeping the current loan, vs refi the whole thing) would be about $380.  The add'l $380 would be helpful if she lost her job, but I'm not sure it's worth paying $250k in interest.  Not to mention we'd pay out around $4500 for the whole refi process (plus other possible fees).

I'm looking for arguments for or against either side.  Maybe there are other angles I'm missing, or maybe I need to have stronger arguments to assure my wife we'll be fine.",finance
personalfinance,Somehow accidentally signed up for a different student loan other than FAFSA help,"So I am a freshman in college and I had to go through some stuff on studentloans.gov (mps, making sure I understood the loan and everything) and I assumed this was for FAFSA and allowing them to give me the loan or whatever.

Basically, later that day I got an email from Mohela, which is a big student loan servicer saying that said ""We just received your new federal student loan disbursement from your school to service on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education (ED).""

Does this mean that they are the ones that the government went through for my federal loan or is this a different loan entirely, and if so, how would I go about canceling this???",finance
personalfinance,College Student looking for advice.,"Posting this under a throwaway in an attempt to remain anonymous from any friends who browse Reddit. Apologies for any abysmal formatting as I'm on mobile and this is literally my second post ever in 6 years of using Reddit. So I'll just dive right in then. 

I am a male in my younger 20s living in the United States. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on software development. I am currently a junior. My freshman year I took out loans to cover the cost of Fall and Spring semesters. After freshman year I joined the national guard in an attempt to help pay for school only to find my only real financial help came in the form of reimbursement checks after semester end which I can't receive this semester or next as a result of a flag (failed my run on a physical endurance test). In addition to not being able to receive the benefits this semester the checks themselves can take a very long time to receive without calling the education department every single day (think months to a year).

I work a part time job (it's full-time in the Summer) where I'm making $14.50 an hour throughout the day to help pay for food, gas, bills, and save for the next semester. I no longer live on campus (it's significantly cheaper not to), I instead share an apartment with my girlfriend splitting rent. Though I cover utilities entirely. 

Due to my parents financial standing I receive nothing from FAFSA other than unsubsidized loans.  I've also not had much luck with scholarships or grants. I do receive a very generous amount of help from my parents though in the form of being on their health insurance plan, them paying my car insurance, and paying the interests on my loans keeping the principle the same. Their help is certainly invaluable and is part of what keeps me from being too anxious about finances. 

Now for the numbers - 

Monthly income:
$900-1200 from work. 
$150-250 from drill. 

Monthly expenses:
$330 on rent. 
$50 on Internet. 
$40-60 on Electricity. 
Water is included in rent. 
$70 on gas. 
$150 on food. 
$500 into savings for incoming semester. 
$0-80 going out to eat. 

In the Summer I earn $2000-2400 a month and drill pay stops but I get a 1-time payment of $1500 for guard training. 

Each semester tuition and books cost a combined $3600. I did not attend school this previous Summer. 

I have a one time cost of $300 to cover the cost of a new computer to replace mine that died. Then another of approximately $180 to repair my chipped windshield before winter. 

Another job is out of the question as I go to bed fairly early to wake up early to run and workout. I go to work and class in a mix from 0800-1700 then homework takes me to bedtime. On some days I get between 30 minutes to an hour for free time which I used to use to play video games before my computer died. Now I just browse Reddit. 

My goals:

1. 24 hour gym membership so I can continue to run in the winter time and workout in a better equipped gym than my college provides. 

2. Start a retirement fund. I have none to speak of and don't even begin to know where to start. 

3. Pay on my loans which are $11,000 at 11% for the private, and $7,000 at 2.3% for the federal. As mentioned above my parents do pay the interest. But I would like to make progress on the principle. 

It seems over the last year and a half I've watched my savings erode from when I first left active duty at $10,000 to now which is $4,000. The only times I reach onto savings is for large sudden expenses and when a college semester starts. I gave money to family as well which is probably a large part of what set me back and I don't expect I'll ever be paid back. In Spring $3600 has to come out again but between now and then I will only be able to put away $2000. The Summer will hopefully allow for that to be made up for. When I retake my PT test this Summer I will hopefully get reimbursement back for next Fall and Spring. In a bad month I already spend more than I make but I use cheaper food to balance out. Is there any hope for improving my situation or meeting my goals before graduation? Or should I just wait and reevaluate my position after graduation?

personalfinance,Already paid expected federal taxes for the year. Can I stop withholding?,"Some of our pay this year came from bonuses, which had taxes automatically withheld at a 25% rate. Because of this, we have already paid as much in taxes during 2017 as we did for all of 2016. Our total income and the rest of our tax situation should be about the same for both years.

personalfinance,"Was paying CC debt incrementally, should I be more aggressive?","Here's my current situation (all dollar amounts are USD):

CC debt, various lenders &amp; interest rates, total for all cards to be paid off is $4800.

Student loans are $20,500, interest is virtually 0 (was at $1,000 but now my payments are going to interest first, so it does accrue to about $15 every two weeks, then gets eliminated again when I make a payment). I'm in grace until December 2017, but I've been making payments biweekly so that ~$500 gets paid to principal every two weeks.

Expenses: no rent, phone, power, water, internet (living with parents). Toiletries, food, and other expenses are between $100 and $300 every two weeks (for instance, I had to pay about $150 for tools at work this week, but events like that are rare).

Income: $1380 every two weeks. I've saved $1400 in the bank, that account is strictly an emergency fund. Have another account that I spend with until next payday, replenishing to get it back to $600 biweekly. I've been paying $400 on the CC debts every two weeks, leaving me with about $300 that I've been putting into the emergency fund. After reading here though, a lot of people point out that I'm essentially financing that emergency fund at the interest rates of the credit cards. My parents will absolutely take care of me if I need money (barring some catastrophe that wipes out my *and* their liquid assets), so should I immediately put all of my emergency fund to the CC debt, then pay as aggressively as possible to the CC debt with each check, saving nothing and putting every spare penny toward it? (I want to keep going slow and steady with ~$525 biweekly toward the student loans, and would prefer to not shift that $525 to the CC debt.)

*Edit: The main thing that prompted this post is that I'm mentally hung up on taking that $1400 and getting rid of it. I know that it's paying off my debt, so it's not wasted, but it's hard for me to separate my emotions on it. I'm basically asking for the most logical/economic course of action to take.",finance

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to take out a personal loan to pay off my credit cards?,"I currently owe ~$2100 on three credit cards. I'm not a really heavy spender, but some personal issues last year forced me to max out all of my cards (before that I paid off the balance every month).

The interest rates on my cards are ~24.99%. I have an account with the local government credit union and tonight I applied for an unsecured $2,100 loan to consolidate those expenses and pay off my cards.

The loan would be $2,100 at 10.75% for 24 months at ~$97/mo. I have a few thoughts with it -- first, it will consolidate my cards, which makes my life easier. Secondly, the credit utilization to my name will drastically decrease since I'll have $2,100 out of $2,100 in available credit on my cards. Third, being a two year loan, consistent payments will be good for my credit at a total cost of around $250 in interest over the two years it takes to pay it off.

Am I thinking about this the right way? I think it's a good decision.",finance

personalfinance,Graduating this year with student debt. How to refinance/what to do?,"throwaway here. Overall, I think I'm in OK shape, but I'm seeking some advice about what to do with my student loans and grad school.

I'm finishing a CS degree at a well-regarded school, and I've taken a tech job near San Francisco after I graduate (1 year from now) which pays quite well ($120k). All roses! However, to pay for my degree, I took out quite a lot of student debt. I have $88k in debt:

$5k @ 4.7% (stafford), $7k @ 4.2% (stafford), $7k @ 3.8% (stafford), $30k @ 10.7% (private), $20k @ 7% (private), $19k @ 7% (private)

I've been throwing money at them from internships and part-time work, but it hasn't made much of a dent in the principal.

I wouldn't be so worried, except the cost of living in the bay area is upwards of $1500/month, for even the most modest space (aka 5-6 housemates). Combined with the potentially $1k/month loan payment + any hope of saving for a house + transportation (screw Caltrain), I'm worried.

Questions:

-How do I refinance the garbage 10% interest rate? Should I try to consolidate all the loans? Where do I even begin with this?

-Is it wise to try to save for a house, or should I focus on paying these down as fast as possible? Houses are uber-expensive here.

-I really might want to go back to grad school (law school, perhaps) in a few (2-3) years, which is potentially slightly lower paying. How should I plan to make this financially viable? Obviously, this means saving money for grad school, in addition to dealing with the debt shrewdly.",finance
personalfinance,Whole life policy with loans against nearly all of cash value. Should we keep paying or surrender?,"My in-laws bought multiple whole life insurance policies over the years for my wife. They also took out loans against the cash value of those policies at various times. We recently took over paying the premiums, and I'm trying to figure out what to do with each policy. Here are the details... 

 
Policy #1:    
Death Benefit (incl additional coverage purchased with dividends) = $26,721  (initial policy was for $25k)    
Annual premium = $294  
Current Loan Balance = $2,445  
Loan Interest rate = 3.98%  
Net Cash Value = $732  
Total Premiums paid = $4,411  

Policy #2:  
Death benefit = $55,796  
Annual premium = $317  
Current Loan Balance = $8,258  
Loan Interest rate = 3.98%  
Net Cash Value = $1,169  
Total Premiums paid = $7,015  

My first thought was to surrender both policies, since we both have other insurance (and could buy term for much less if we decide we really need more).  Also, we can't really take advantage of one of the biggest benefits of a whole life policy - taking out a loan - since that's already been done. Instead, we're left with loans that we either have to pay off or let them continue to cut into the cash value (and death benefit).  Seemed better to just pull out the limited cash left, and take that and the money we'd spend on premiums and invest in something else.

But then I started to wonder about the tax hit, especially on Policy #2.  If understand things correctly, we'd pay tax on the difference between (net cash value + loan amount)  and the Total Premiums Paid.  Which, for that policy is ($1,169 + $8258) - $7,015 = $2,412 taxable gain.   
Is this correct?  
And what about dividends that have been used to purchase additional coverage?  Do I have to include those in the tax calculation as well?

I'm guessing I've left out other info that you all might need in order to answer my question.  Please let me know what else you need, and I'll do my best to provide it. 

Thank you so much for the help.",finance

Anyways I am 22 and just graduated college.  I am an engineer for a construction company currently making $62k/yr.  I get $5-$10k in company stock every year instead of 401k matching.  The stock goes up about 10-12% on average every year.  There's a chance I'll get a bonus worth a few grand but I don't want to count on that.  That's about it for my compensation.

I have no student debt, the only debt is about $20k on my dream car I bought (2014 Mustang GT).  I have always been a car guy and could not resist finally owning a fast car that I have wanted forever.  I was miserable driving my Honda Civic with 140 horsepower and my current car has 450 horsepower.

I can easily afford the car and make ends meet.  In fact, I could probably pay double the payment every month and still make ends meet.  However I have started looking at the opportunity cost of the car instead of the direct cost.  

If I could own a cheaper car I could save another $400-$500 a month.  I would like to start investing in real estate in the near future.  I know that real estate typically involves borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars and even a slightly higher interest rate can make a big difference.  I want to establish really good credit before buying anything.  My current credit score is about 720.  I just bought the car in June, will I take a significant credit hit if I turn around and sell it and completely pay off the loan only a few months after borrowing the money?  

Would it be better to keep the loan, build credit and drive my dream car but save less money?  Or sell the car and bank more money every month while possibly taking a big credit hit?

Any advice is appreciated.  Still trying to learn how this whole credit thing works.",finance
personalfinance,"Alright, long time lurker, first time poster here and I need some advice, this will be long and poorly formatted on mobile, but I'll do the best I can. TL;DR at the bottom.","I'll start this off by saying that I'm 22 now, and a welder by trade. Im on my second project now and have put in over 2 years with the company. I've been married since I was 19, my wife does work but it's not as much as I bring in so we mostly use hers for extra spending money because it's usually cash tips from her serving job. We use my money to pay the bills which is double everything for me, 2 student loans, 2 car notes, 2 insurance, 2 phones, rent, necessities blah blah blah. 

So basically a year and 2 months ago I was about 20 almost 21 years old. I was making pretty good money for my age, right around $2,000/week pretty consistently. So growing up poor and now making this money, I trade my car in and go buy a brand new 2016 ram 1500. 

I don't remember how much it cost when I got it but I didn't care and no one could convince not to do it, a good learning experience for me I guess. I've always been very stubborn and I convinced myself I had to have it. I put 4K down on it, took the longest financing option I could, my folks consigned for me because of their good credit, and everything seemed great. 

About 6 months later something happens and we have to get my folks off the cosign, so we refinance through our bank, get them off, my interest rate goes up like 9%, and they also won't finance as long so my payments went up to close to $1,000/month. On top of that I ended up getting laid off for 3 months, and I took a big hit to my savings. 

I started working again at the end of march, but I'm not making as much money, after taxes and my medical stuff only about $1,400/week. My rent is expensive, I still have 7 months left on my lease, hurricane Harvey put me out of a paycheck for 3 weeks(back to work now, not interested in applying for FEMA or unemployment for that time frame). 

So with the hurricane scare, and making less money, I decided I want to get rid of my half ton truck for a 3/4 ton, I want to get something older and used and cheaper, and get a nice camper, so I'll save money in 2 places, maybe 3 if my insurance drops. It's been the usual experience looking for a vehicle, the new ones are too expensive and the used ones have 250,000 miles. 

I found a 2008 f-250 with 98,000 miles on it, they're asking for 24,000 and that all seems pretty fair, but I owe 27,500 on my truck and they only offered me 23,500 for it. So I guess my questions is, would it be a good or bad idea to trade in my basically brand new truck for something 9 years old that I don't really know the history to? I would have to take their offer and just tack the other 4K on to the price of the ford. Does anyone what kind of payments I could expect with the note for 5 years at $28,000? Or is this a terrible idea and I should just keep my truck and work on paying it off?

TL;DR-make less money this year, want to trade my half ton for 3/4 ton, owe 27.5k, dealer offers 23.5k. Truck I want is 08, 98k miles, cost 24k. Should I take the 4K loss and tack it on to the 3/4 ton? Or am I stupid?",finance

I should have trusted my gut, and walked in to the dealership preapproved, but I didn't. Which brings me to my questions/dilemma.

The finance manager called me with ""great news"" and said that I could finance the whole thing (24,282), with no money down, for 72 months at 4.9% through Bank of America.

I know 72 month loans are largely preditory, and can easily result in a negative equity cycle.

I said that can't be the best offer out there.  He bristled over the phone and asked what I was thinking. So I said I'd prefer 48 but would consider 60 with the right interest rate. He said he'd get back to me tomorrow.

Well, I just got a notification from Discover that Bank of America, and only Bank of America,  received my credit score on yesterday.

Questions:
1- It would seem he is not shopping around, correct?
2- Is it too late for me to say, thanks but no thanks and shop the loan myself? Obviously I'm not psyched about the double pull off my credit, but I figured in a year or two I'll be above 8 again.
3- Is there an argument for going with the 72 month loan? 



Updating for anyone who happens to check back:
I took a lot of the advice on here. Credit unions had the best rates, and I reached out to a couple to inquire about membership. I also contacted my insurance company, and primary bank and applied for loans through them. My primary bank came back with a credit union like rate of 2.5% on 20k financed over 60 months because I had a type of checking account that they said knocked .5 off the 3.0 rate I would have qualified for. Done deal.

The finance manager was tripping himself when I called to say I needed a 20k bill of sale. He eventually admitted he wouldn't have been able to match that.

Lesson learned, and it's all thanks to you Reddit!

For all you, but you'll shoot your financial eye out because it isn't a 5-10k car, I agree it's more than that. But, after the accident my family just had, I'm not putting anyone I care about in anything other than a mid tier Subaru or Volvo. Insert financial shrug here.",finance

## 1. EquiTrader (EQT): $3.6 Million Market Cap

This is my favorite project that is currently under a $5 million market cap. EquiTrader is a social platform for traders where they can share their ideas and get rewarded by the community. EQT comes equipped with trading charts, indicators, trading tools and other features which will make it easy to make technical analysis. You will also have the ability to shadow other traders and make automatic trades based on what they do.

&amp;nbsp;

### Why I Like EquiTrader

There are a lot of reasons why I’m bullish on EQT, the main ones our outlined below:

&amp;nbsp;

**Perfect Product for Crypto**

&amp;nbsp;

Having a social platform where traders can share their investment analysis and then get rewarded is a perfect concept for this market. I think that a lot of the major crypto influencers will get on this platform and utilize it, which will then in turn help EQT get bigger. Once the platform is up and running the “crypto OGs” will do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to marketing because it benefits them too. I’m a big fan of any crypto project where their main audience is the crypto market. This is an easy foot in the door and will allow the project to gain traction much quicker. I think EQT will do this as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**Recently Acquired by a Major Crypto Influencer**

&amp;nbsp;

It was recently announced that EquiTrader was acquired by Aluna.Social, which is a company owned by Alvin Lee (https://twitter.com/onemanatatime). Having a big player behind the platform will be extremely beneficial once the platform is launched and he can start promoting it. Plus this adds a lot of credibility behind the project as well. I’m a BIG fan of this news.

&amp;nbsp;

**Many Upcoming Catalysts on Roadmap**

&amp;nbsp;

Public release of the EQT platform is planned for Q4 of this year and I’d expect a lot of traction to start at this point. In Q1 of 2018 they will release the iOS and Android apps, Q2 the beta of the social trading platform will be released (huge news) and then in Q3 the social trading platform will be released to the public.
We have at least a whole year of upcoming catalysts that will all have a major impact on the price.

&amp;nbsp;

**Currently Only Trading on Coin Exchange**

&amp;nbsp;

At this point you can only buy EQT on Coinexchange.io. It was listed on Cryptopia previously but when they did a coin swap they were removed. Why is this a good thing? The EQT team is in discussion with Cryptopia to be added now that the swap has been completed. Once this happens I’d expect a major pump. This will happen very soon so the major discount that EQT is currently trading at probably won’t last long.

&amp;nbsp;

**Proof of Stake: 30% per Year Returns**

&amp;nbsp;

As mentioned above, they recently did a coin swap and went from a PoW chain to a PoS one where you can get 30% annual returns from staking. This is an awesome return. I have already seen some great returns from staking.

&amp;nbsp;

### What I Don’t Like

The biggest complaint I have about EQT is the small issue and delay they have had doing the coin swap. Before the coin swap they told everyone to move their coins to CoinExchange.io and the swap would happen automatically, which worked great for those who followed the instructions. However, there are a lot of people that didn’t do this and now they are having to manually swap these coins. This has caused a long delay in terms of being relisted on Cryptopia, which in turn has hurt the price. This isn’t a huge deal, but it is a small complaint I have.

&amp;nbsp;

### Investment Potential

With a lot of catalysts on the roadmap until 2019, the potential of EquiTrader is hard to predict. However, I think a 10x from here, which would make the market cap only $34 million, is a very real possibility within 3 months. Even after a 10x, I still think it could get closer to $75 million before it would be getting close to what I think it should be valued at. As you can see, I think there is a lot of room for EQT to grow and I’m expecting it to do just that.

## 2. Hush (HUSH): $1.1 Million Market Cap

Hush is a very, very close second when it comes to my top 5 favorite projects under $5 million market cap. This project might have the most potential out of all of the coins in this list too. Hush is an anonymous coin that utilizes the Zerocash protocol that is forked from Zcash. There are quite a few Zcash forks out there, but this is the best one in my opinion (and the cheapest). It is a fairly new coin that launched in July 2017 so there have only been a few months worth of development.

&amp;nbsp;

### Why I Like Hush

There is a lot to like about Hush and the reasons are explained below.

&amp;nbsp;

**One of the Best Anon Coins**

&amp;nbsp;

Hush is a fork of Zcash but without the founders reward, which is the only major knock of Zcash. So without the founders reward it becomes a top notch anon coin tech wise. There are other Zcash forks out there, but none of them are sitting at this low of a market cap, which creates a huge opportunity for Hush. A very similar coin to Hush is ZenCash, which currently sits at a $14 million market cap, is another Zcash fork without some of the features of Hush. Combine all of this with the major pump all anon coins have been going through lately and Hush is looking prime.

&amp;nbsp;

**Great Team**

&amp;nbsp;

One of the members of the Zcash dev team, David Mercer, is now the lead dev for Hush. This is huge. Not only is he the lead dev but he is also working full time on Hush, which means all of the promised features on the roadmap will have a good shot at being completed. Along with the lead dev, there are 6 total team members. The size and talent on this team is practically unheard for a coin with such a small market cap. This is a major reason for me being bullish. I know that this team will get things done, which is all you can ask from a team.

&amp;nbsp;

**Counterparty on Hush**

&amp;nbsp;

This is the biggest reason I like Hush so much. They are planning on porting Counterparty to Hush and this will allow people to create Counterparty based assets with the security of Hush. They are also planning on having these assets being compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. These are killer features that make Hush a unique project.

&amp;nbsp;

**Only Trading on Cryptopia**

&amp;nbsp;

At this moment the only place to purchase HUSH is on Cryptopia. The Hush team has confirmed they have been in contact with Bittrex and I don’t think it’ll be long before they are added. Take advantage of it being only on Cryptopia before it gets added to other exchanges, once that happens the price is going to take off.

&amp;nbsp;

### What I Don’t Like

The major knock on Hush is their marketing. They are not putting much effort into spreading awareness. Their reasoning behind this is that they feel like they don’t have a finished product to market yet and that good tech will eventually win out. I like seeing a team that prides themselves on the tech of their project, but at some point they are going to have to start marketing it. Marketing plays a huge role in crypto. With all of that being said, I’m not complaining because it gives me more time to accumulate at these low prices. The only way people find Hush is from actually doing their own research. You won’t find it being shilled much on twitter because no one really knows about it. This will probably be changing in the near future.

&amp;nbsp;

### Investment Potential

The $1.1 million market cap it is currently sitting at is almost funny. I can’t believe it is so low. This coin should be sitting at an easy $10 million market cap SOLELY based off of what the project currently is. Factor in some of the upcoming features such as the Counterparty port and a standalone HUSH messenger and I think Hush could be worth at least $50 million in 6–12 months, if not higher. The reason I say it could be higher is because of the dev team. I’m very confident in the team and believe that in 12 months from now they will be working on features that will blow the current features out of the water.

&amp;nbsp;

## 3. Tokes (TKS): $1.8 Million Market Cap

Coming in at 3rd in my top 5 is a coin called Tokes. I’m a big fan and this is one of my long term plays that I think will be worth a ton in a few years time. This isn’t going to be a 10x coin in 2 months, but in 2 years it very well may be a 100x coin. Keep that in mind while reading. Tokes is a Waves based asset that is geared towards the marijuana business. They are looking to help businesses handle their money and provide a better payment solution for both consumers and businesses. They are also doing a few other really interesting things in this space and I will explain why I like Tokes in the next section.

&amp;nbsp;

### Why I Like Tokes

Tokes is a coin based around the marijuana business, but it does much more than the other pot coins out there. Tokes is looking to actually solve real world issues in the marijuana business and has partnerships with major players in their area. I will touch more on all of these things, but I want to make ti clear this isn’t just a “pot currency”.

&amp;nbsp;

**Provides a Fiat Gateway**

&amp;nbsp;

A major issue for marijuana businesses is that they are forced to operate as a cash-only business due to the federal laws that make banks not want to work with them. This is a major problem within the cannabis industry and Tokes is trying to solve this by creating a fiat gateway. Tokes allows for cash to be converted to TKS and vice versa so that it can stored electronically without the need to carry cash around. They also offer no fiat volatility risk because of their pegging system. This means that the $100,000 of cash they turn into TKS will remain $100,000 when they withdraw it. This is a major issue that is being solved by Tokes and gives their project immediate value and use cases. Keep in mind that this is something they are working on implementing and hasn’t actually been developed yet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Major Partnerships Secured**

&amp;nbsp;

Tokes is located in Las Vegas, where marijuana laws are some of the most lenient, and they have been hard at work building relationships and partnerships with the marijuana businesses in that area. Some of their partnerships are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Pisos: A dispensary in Vegas that is their first partner in their pilot program
Herbology Tours: Tokes purchased a 10% ownership stake in this company. More on this in a minute.
Cannabis Delivery Startup in California: Payment integration into their mobile app

&amp;nbsp;

Tokes purchased a 10% ownership stake in a Las Vegas cannabis tourism company and this has a couple of really cool benefits. First, it gives Tokes a foot in the door with a marijuana company where they can start integrating and testing their system. Second, it’s a great way to get their name out there and start spreading awareness. This will go a long way to help both consumer and business adoption. The last major benefit of this ownership stake is that they will get 10% of all of the revenue from Herbology Tours, which will be used to help grow Tokes. This revenue will also be used as a way to potentially buy and burn coins (more in the next section).

&amp;nbsp;

**Revenue Used to Burn Coins**

&amp;nbsp;

Tokes plans on getting into other aspects of the marijuana business and portions of this revenue will possibly be used to buy and then burn the coins, thus decreasing the supply. The revenue that they generate from their 10% ownership stake in Herbology Tours will also be used to burn coins.
Im a big fan of coins that burn their own supply and the markets go crazy when this happens (See $TRIG and $DAR). It’s worth noting that they are planning on burning coins with revenue, but it is not 100% concrete yet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Great Roadmap**

&amp;nbsp;

Their roadmap extends all the way into Q4 of 2018, which is good to see. There are also a lot of good things to look forward to and a lot of catalyst that should help the price increase along the way. Check out the roadmap [here](https://imgur.com/a/v6X53) 

&amp;nbsp;

### What I Don’t Like

The biggest issue I have with Tokes is their supply problem they have. Currently, there are only around 960k in circulation out of the total supply of 50 million (according to Coin Market Cap). The founders currently own the remaining ~40 million tokens. The good news is they are actively trying to solve this issue and release these tokens in a way that won’t hurt the price. One of the main ways they hope to remedy this situation is by putting all of the tokens in a smart contract and distributing it during a 3 year period. You can read more about their plans here.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not a big fan of the current supply issues, but I think the founders are on the ball on this issue and will figure it our without too many problems.
Investment Potential I really like the fact that Tokes solves a real issue by providing a store of value for cannabis businesses and allowing them to move away from cash only operations. This has so much value. Combine that with their current partnerships, pilot program and their upcoming roadmap and Tokes looks like a real good long term investment. 

&amp;nbsp;

Where Tokes could really see their value skyrocket is after they get a foothold in Las Vegas and establish their name in the cannabis industry, they will be the first company other cannabis companies call once their states become legal. Like I mentioned before, this is a longer term play but could be huge in a few years time. In the short term, I think they could easily get to ~$25 million just based off of continuing to lock in partnerships, releasing their mobile app and solving their supply issues.

&amp;nbsp;

## 4. SmartCash (SMART): $2.5 Million Market Cap

Coming in at 4th on my list is SmartCash. SmartCash is a fork of Zcoin, but it has a some of the same features as Dash along with a few unqiue twists that makes this coin very undervalued. The coin itself was started less than 3 months ago, so the project itself is still very new.

&amp;nbsp;

### Why I Like SmartCash

Any anon coins right now that haven’t pumped yet are of interest to me. It seems like everyday a new anon coin is pumping and the fact that SmartCash hasn’t yet is appealing. Not only has the coin not pumped yet, but it has a super small market cap and is a better coin than the majority of the other anon coins out there. Aside from it being an anon coin, the following reasons are why I like this project.

&amp;nbsp;

**Insane Staking with SmartRewards**

&amp;nbsp;

This is a major reason for this coin being in my top 5. They have a cool feature called SmartRewards which is a way for people that hold their coins in their wallet to get rewarded. The only requirements are that you must have at least 1000 coins and hold them for at least a month, starting on the 25th of each month. For example, you transfer 5,000 coins on September 16th then you would be rewarded on October 25th. Since this coin is so new, there has only been one completed round of payouts so far. During this first round each person eligible made 400% returns. Example, if you had 1,000 coins in there then you would have been paid 4,000 coins!

&amp;nbsp;

400% is insane and for this second round of payouts things are a little less extreme. At the time of writing this (halfway through the month) the current estimated payout is going to be 37%, still not bad at all! This numbers goes up as the month goes on and less addresses become eligible.
The reason for the drop off is because there are more eligible addresses than the first round. These rewards are funded by taking 15% of all of the coins mined from each block and then on the 25th of each month are distributed to addresses that hold at least 1000 coins. Not only are the returns very good, but this is also a great strategy to lock up coins and keep the price from dropping too much. SmartRewards is a huge reason for me being in this coin and I think it will be very popular once more people find out about it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Great Funding System**

I’m a big fan of their funding system and how they split the block reward. Their funding structure is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

* 80% Community
* 15% SmartRewards
* 5% Miners

&amp;nbsp;

Of the 80% allocated to the community, 70% of it goes to the community treasury and 30% of it goes to funding the team. I like the reversed model they have of paying the community the bulk of the rewards and the miners the least. I think this is a good way to get people involved and help grow the coin via community funded projects.

&amp;nbsp;

**Governance System**

With a large chunk of all coins mined going towards community treasury it gives the community a lot of coins to use on various proposals that will be voted on by the community. These proposals can be pretty much anything helping the coin grow and the community gets to determine if it is a good idea or not. Each vote is equal to 1 smart cash.

&amp;nbsp;

As of writing this, there have been 3 community proposals that have been funded. Those 3 include:

&amp;nbsp;

* Venezuela Food + Marketing Campaign: 2.8 million SmartCash
* SmartCash Cryptocurrency &amp; Entrepreneurship Weekend: 349,999 SmartCash
* Twitter Header Image Campaign: 50k SmartCash

&amp;nbsp;

As the community gets larger, I’d expect the number and quality of proposals to improve and then we will really get to see the benefits of this funding system.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instant Transactions via InstantPay**

&amp;nbsp;

This is a feature that is going to be implemented in the near future and would allow for near instant transactions. This is crucial to have if you are trying to be a coin that is used for everyday purchases, which SmartCash is trying to do.

&amp;nbsp;

**Not on any Major Exchanges**

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, the exchange with the largest volume where you can buy SmartCash is Stocks.Exchange and Cryptopia. Whenever Bittrex or Poloniex get around to adding this coin there should be a nice pump. Now is the time to accumulate!

&amp;nbsp;

### What I Don’t Like

I’m not a fan of coins with a large supply of coins and SmartCash has 5 billion coins as its max supply (451 million circulating). The idea behind having so many coins was to become the everyday coin that is used and its easier if people are paying in a small amounts. I get the idea behind it, but I would still prefer a coin with a smaller supply.

&amp;nbsp;

### Investment Potential

This coin is still fairly new and a lot of people have still never heard of this coin. I think as more people become aware of SmartRewards and the insane monthly returns that people will start to flow into this coin. Couple that with things such as masternodes (coming soon), InstantPay, a functioning governance system, and anonymous transactions and you have a severely undervalued coin at $2.5 million. Short term potential for this coin is at least $10 million market cap, but $25 million within a few months is completely reasonable. This coin has all of the characteristics of coins that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars so I don’t plan on selling this coin for a while.

&amp;nbsp;

## 5. Crypto Bullion (CBX): $1.3 Million Market Cap

Last but not least we have Crypto Bullion, which currently has a market cap of $1.3 million. This coin was originally developed in 2013 but has seen recent improvements that have made it a great dark horse pick. This coin is a 100% proof of stake coin that was originally created as a way to store value with a yearly interest rate of 2%. as mentioned above, it has become way more than this with the new developments that are currently under way. Let’s take a look at why I like this coin.

&amp;nbsp;

### Why I Like Crypto Bullion

Crypto Bullion will be having a hard fork before the end of the month where they will be implementing quite a few new features that I think takes this coin to the next level. Some of these features are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

**Masterbodes are Coming**

&amp;nbsp;

Once the hard fork occurs, masternodes will be coming to CBX along with Zerocoin anonymity. Once the masternodes have been implented it will make CBX one of the cheapest masternode coins on the market. These masternodes will earn roughly 9% — 18% yearly plus any of the fees they make from transactions. It will cost 2,000 coins to run your own masternode, which is currently around $2,000.

&amp;nbsp;

**Solid Roadmap**

&amp;nbsp;

They have a very solid 2017 roadmap leading into 2018 and they are planning on releasing a 2018 roadmap once this one is completed. I would expect a lot of cool new features to be added on the next roadmap. See their roadmap [here](https://imgur.com/a/WdXly)

&amp;nbsp;

**New Wallet Being Released**

&amp;nbsp;

They are currently putting the final touches on a new wallet and getting ready for the hardfork. All of this should be happening by the end of September.

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Supply**

&amp;nbsp;

As of right now, there are only around 1 million coins with a very low inflation rate of 2% per year. With staking, you would make around 6% per year in interest. This means the coins are rare and scarce.

&amp;nbsp;

### What I Don’t Like

From what I have seen, the communication from the dev is subpar and you can be left in the dark at times. Also, even though they have some cool features in the pipeline, they aren’t really bringing anything new to the market.

&amp;nbsp;

### Investment Potential

I think CBX has built itself a nice little niche with becoming a true store of wealth, unlike Bitcoin, and that fact alone should make it worth more than its current market cap. However, with the upcoming hardfork that will bring masternodes and a new wallet we should see a lot more investor interested in this coin.
I’m holding this coin until at least a $10 million market cap and probably even longer depending on what kind of developments happen in the meantime.

&amp;nbsp;

##Honorable Mentions

I’m not going to dive deep into any of these coins below, but they are worth mentioning.

&amp;nbsp;

* Circuits of Value (COVAL): $4.6 million market cap
* Zoin (ZOI): $524k market cap
* Terracoin (TRC): $2.5 million market cap
* AdShares (ADST): $1.6 million market cap
* Linx (LINX): $557k market cap

&amp;nbsp;

##Wrapping this Up

That is going to bring this article to an end. I hope you enjoyed reading and found a coin or two that might interest you. These 5 coins are all coins that I will be holding for nothing less than 10x each, probably even more. These are not your “safe investment” coins by a long stretch, but if you’re looking for some high risk/high reward coins then these might be of interest to you. I’d love to know what coins you are all fans of that I didn’t put on the list. Please share in the comments below.

I've been doing the max matching (5%) with my TSP, have low six figures in my savings account, and have zero debt but that's about it - I don't have any personal investments.

What I'm thinking of doing is:

1) raise my TSP contribution to about 25% to meet the $18,000/year max contribution and make use of the L2050 fund

personalfinance,Income-Based Student Loan repayment and taxes,"I am investigating options for federal student loan repayment. Let's say that I choose income-based repayment (IBR) and come to the end of my 20-year term and the balance of my loan is forgiven.

 This govt website says ""under current Internal Revenue Service rules, you *may* be required to pay income tax on any amount that's forgiven if you still have a remaining balance at the end of your repayment period"" (emphasis added).

Why does it say ""may"" be required to pay? Isn't it a sure thing that the IRS will want us to pay taxes on the forgiven balance? Won't we be required to report it and thus have it be taxed? Or is there a chance that they won't mark it? 

I'm not trying to cheat the system or not pay what I owe, it just seemed interesting that the word ""may"" is in there instead of ""will"". I mean it's a pretty sure bet that they are going to tax the forgiven balance, right?",finance

Basically, what I'd like to understand is whether or not there is a large advantage to paying this off quickly. As I understand it, with such a low interest rate, I would be better off paying the minimums here and using any extra money I would have used to pay this off quicker to invest in any manner, simply because on average it should accrue value at a number above 0.75%.

Of course, I would only do that as long as I am absolutely guaranteed a paycheck so there's no way I would ever miss a payment, and that is taken care of.

Through the lengthy process- I have accumulated approximately $90,000 in student loan debt between both federal and private loans. I have landed a job in the school setting which is my dream job...however pay is much lower than in comparison to the medical setting for my field. I will be making approximately $40,000 in the 9 month school year (stretched pay, that's $1025 biweekly take home). To supplement, I also have a small photography business that I hope to gain lots of clients during the summer months when I am off. Beings that my salary is on the (very) low end for my field, I am in the midst of signing up for income based repayments for federal loans. That's a 20-25 year term but I will also be applying for public service loan forgiveness which they get rid of whatever's left after 10 years (120 payments) if all works in my favor. IF all goes well with that repayment, I'll be paying almost $300 monthly for federal loans alone. With all of that being said, my worry is private loans. My total current balance of private loan debt is $26,603.34. What loans I have left are all still in grace (never been in deferment). I have 3 loans left that have large interest rates: 

1. $14,801.23 with 9% interest rate
2. $7,562.86 with 9% interest rate
3. $4,239.25 with 9% interest rate

I've read that some people have managed to settle for 40-50% of their original balance but it requires a larger ""lump sum"" payment. I don't want to have to be in deferment to do it. A lot of the articles I've read say they're willing to ""make deals"" but its only after people are in deferment. I don't want to do that to ruin my high credit score. Setting up auto-payment can reduce interest rates but literally only by like .5-2%. 

Also not sure about consolidation. No way I'd even think about it for my federal loans but to get a better interest rate for Sallie Mae....not sure advantages/disadvantages.

personalfinance,I totally misunderstood my student loan repayment (Income Based Repayment) and Amortization. I need advice on getting payments back on track.,"My wife and I have about $80K in student loans with three separate lenders (Mohela, Nelnet, &amp; Fedloan).  Right now we are signed up for Income Based Repayment but I realized we are not paying off the loan principle.  We are just paying the loan interest.

We are rebuilding our emergency fund after recently buying a house.  I do not want to abruptly increase our payments.

In addition to advice, any tools for building Amortization models for the loans would be helpful so I can see how much of an impact increasing payments incrementally would be helpful.  I use Payoff.io for all my loans but because the student loan payments are low and I am not paying the principle, I am concerned that the payment projections may not be accurate.

Edit:

I'm looking for advice on two specific topics.  

1) Should I talk to my student loan lenders about changing my repayment type to a more traditional payment schedule where I know the there is a specific 5, 7, or 10 yr fixed schedule?

2) How do I build an amortization schedule using the starting principle, balance, payments, and rates to determine my loan amortization schedule and test out increasing payments incrementally.  For example, testing out budgeting $900 vs $1100 a month toward repayment and seeing how that affects the length of payoff and interest paid.  

Most amortization schedules I have seen use the beginning principle, rates and payments.  I am on the Income Based Repayment (interest only basically) and have been making payments for several years.",finance

Bitcoin,How does lightning network avoid double spending?,"I'm trying to understand lightning network, and I wonder if someone here might help me out.

Say Alice owns 1 BTC. She bought it, has the entry in the blockchain and everything.

Now let's say Alice owes Bob 1 BTC. Instead of transacting on-chain, they create a micropayment channel using lightning network and enter the transaction there. Now, it's my understanding that this transaction looks just like a regular on-chain transaction, except it has not been broadcast to the network.

The wrinkle: say Alice sends Eve 1 BTC in an on-chain transaction before she and Bob settle their micropayment channel. Now Alice has no BTC left in the address used in the micropayment to Bob, which was supposed to have 1 BTC. Has Alice effectively stiffed Bob here?

I'm trying to read through the lightning network paper, but it's quite dense and long. If someone could point me to a section that might have some relevant info that would be great.

**Update:** Thanks for the explanations. I understand now that when Bob and Alice open a channel, that's an on-chain transaction to a multi-sig wallet that requires both Alice's and Bob's signatures to move money out of (and then lightning network protocol creates a ""commit transaction"" for both Alice and Bob which just requires their own signature to put the balance back onto the chain, if they so desire). Still trying to understand exactly how this ""commit transaction"" gets updated to prevent either party from broadcasting a previously beneficial transaction, but this is a step forward, thanks!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Confused with what to do with 0% interest loan from parents,"Hi!

My fiancee and I are buying a house together currently and are in the mortgage process. My parents are offering us a $20,000 0% interest loan to be payed out any whatever amount is affordable to us over time to help with this transitional period. I am currently waiting until after closing on the house to transfer the funds in order to not mess with the underwriting process. I have funds to choose the down payment amount without their loan. 

My question is, would it be smarter to pay off almost all of my student loan debt (22.5k) with a 6.55% interest rate or try to hit the 20% down payment in order to get rid of the PMI? Right now, my mortgage company is offering me an additional 1/8 of a percent off if I do the 20% instead of a 5% down payment. 

Home cost: 196k
5% down: 4% interest rate with around an 81 dollar PMI cost until I hit 20% on my house
20% down: 3.875% with no PMI

According to the website I found: Http://artofbeingcheap.com/removing-pmi/

It seems the PMI is effectively 7.59% interest. Does this sound correct? According to that website, I should pay off the PMI first. 

I could also take their money and invest it towards our retirement account in the market. Any thoughts on this or would this be a bad financial move?

That's why I have so much in the savings account. Therefore, I have about $40,000 in cash that I don't need immediately.

If I wanted to inherit a little bit of risk (e.g. bonds), would there be a better option than the Discover account?

I live in Minnesota and make $72000 per year. 23 years old. Maybe looking to purchase a $14000 car in 2 years. 

I currently have $19,000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA with 100% equities, $5000 in a company stock purchase plan, and $18,000 in my 401k with all equities. I intend to continue making the IRA and I am contributing 20% to the 401k and 10% to the company stock purchase plan. My employer matches 8% of my contributions.

I could open a taxable account and buy bonds, but I heard that's not the most tax efficient. Would municipal bonds (e.g Vanguard bond funds) that are federally exempt be better than my Discover account? As I understand, my interest in the Discover is taxed as income. If municipal bonds are exempt from some tax but have a similar yield, would that be better? I know that has some risk, but I'm foreseeing myself needing this cash anytime soon.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!",finance

My realtor recommended a local agent through Movement Mortgage. I could go with an online company and it looks like it saves me around .125-.25% interest. difference between 3.75% and 3.85%, etc...When I say online lender, I'm thinking American Federal Mortgage, Sebonic Mortgage, Quicken Loans even maybe?

How big of a risk is it to go with any of these companies? Could it cause my deal to go south? I am buying in a somewhat competitive market, but not extremely hot.

Ripple,Three potential catalysts,"#Introduction and disclaimer  
  
Everyone else does a bit of pontificating on here, so I'm going to have my turn! Please feel free to correct me if I have made any mistakes. And, of course, do challenge the ideas if you think I'm wrong. I hope these thoughts can spark some friendly debate.  
  
#Three Catalysts?  
  
Browse this sub and if you can get past the endless shitposts about 'lambos' and 'the mooooon' and 'should I buy now?' and 'how high can it go?' and 'what does market cap mean?' and 'what's the easiest way to buy XRP using Tuvaluan dollars?' and 'can somebody help me to tie my shoelaces?' and so on, you will start to see posts about three possible near-term catalysts.  
  
##1. SWELL  
Ripple Labs is holding a big conference (called SWELL) in October. It is taking place on the same days and in the same city as Swift's SIBOS conference. The keynote speakers at SWELL will be:  
  
+ 1) Dr Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; and  
  
+ 2) Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.
  
##2. THE LOCKUP  
Ripple Labs holds about 62 billion XRP. The company has pledged to put 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow account. The account will hold 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP each, with one contract expiring on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the 1 billion XRP will become available for Ripple to 'use' (which likely means sell to financial institutions). Whatever is not used at the end of each month will be put back into escrow and become available to Ripple 54 months later.
  
##3. XRP ADOPTION  
Ripple sells software that helps banks to lower costs related to overseas remittances. Ripple is working with over 90 banks globally, some 30 pilots have been run, and more than 10 banks are moving into commercial use. Ripple also sells XRP. This asset is intended to be used as a 'bridge currency' in conjunction with the Ripple software. Banks who use it can practically double their cost savings. As far as we know, banks are not using it in any great volume yet.  
  
#Why does XRP's price fluctuate?  
  
Well, why does any cryptocurrency's price fluctuate? Two reasons: speculation and demand.  
  
+ **Speculation:** Traders like to guess which way the price is going to head and they buy and sell the currency to try to make short-term trading gains. Investors are trying something similar, albeit from a longer-term perspective. They think the price will rise over the long term, so they buy the asset. This very process of buying and selling is what *causes* the price to move.  
  
+ **Demand:** Believe it or not, but some people actually *use* cryptocurrencies! Some drug dealers use Monero to make untraceable payments. Some people pay for goods and services with Bitcoin. Some financial institutions use XRP for overseas remittances. Hell, *I* use XRP to send money to my family, who are overseas.  
  
#What about these catalysts, then?  
  
So what impact will the abovementioned (potential) catalysts have on the price of XRP?  
  
##SWELL  
A lot of folks on here are very excited about SWELL. And I can't really blame them. The conference looks awesome. If you haven't checked out the agenda, you really should. It looks like a top-notch event. *But what does it mean for the price of XRP?* Well, it might cause a short-term spike if the day traders get as excited about this as the true-believers are. But once that price spikes, you can expect these guys to take profit and the price to correct accordingly. All the way? 50% retreat? I couldn't tell you. Which is why I'm no day trader. SWELL might also get some investors excited. People new to the crypto space will hear about XRP for the first time and their imaginations might be fired the same way ours have been. This could give the price a sustainable boost. ""To the moon?"" you ask. Don't ask. It's a stupid question and you're stupid for asking, ya stupid-face. ""But CuriousZerper, I heard Ripple may use the conference to announce that SBI is going live with XRP!"" I've read this, too, but it doesn't make much sense. Tech companies don't use conferences to  announce that they have new customers or that they their customers are using their products. They use conferences to showcase their products, to generate publicity, and to win new customers. I'm not saying some kind of SBI-related announcement is out of the question, I'm just saying it seems unlikely to me.  
  
##THE LOCKUP  
Ripple holds the lion's share of XRP. The company uses it to incentivize market makers. There is a fear among people who ""regurgitate FUD"" (hat-tip to /u/sjoelkatz for the phraseology!) that Ripple Labs might just dump this onto the market to make a quick buck. This is known as overhang risk. But dumping XRP would be suicidal for Ripple. The company's surest way to vast profits is to do everything in its power to make XRP the global currency of choice. At that time, every single zerp it owns will be worth that much more. *So what does the lockup mean for the price of XRP?* Well, materially, the lockup doesn't really do anything to impact supply. Ripple Labs in May said that it ""has sold on average 300 million XRP per month for the past 18 months."" So when the escrow takes place and Ripple has 1 billion XRP available for sale every month, this is still FAR MORE than it is currently selling. The escrow serves one purpose: to instill confidence. It will not limit supply, but it may convince some who are on the fence to get off that fence and jump into the pool. (The water's great; come on in!)  
  
##XRP ADOPTION  
I'll cut to the chase: this is where my hopes lie. The true, long-term, sustainable appreciation in the price XRP will come when the demand is there. Not demand from individuals who have a couple of grand to throw at the coin, but demand from financial institutions (and perhaps non-financial firms, too) who want to hold $50m worth, $200m worth, perhaps even $1b worth. If there are only 100b XRP in existence (and slightly less given that some portion is destroyed with every transaction), each token needs to be worth a hell of a lot more than $0.20 if hundreds or thousands of banks and companies want to transact with it.  
  
#Conclusion  
  
So, each of these three potential catalysts might do something for the price, but it is XRP ADOPTION that will have the long-lasting impact. And the stupidity of phrases like ""rockets to the moon"" overlooks that the adoption may just take place gradually. To borrow the lexical idiocy I have been railing against, the rocket may be halfway to the moon before anybody realizes it has blasted off!  
  
**tl;dr** SWELL and the escrow may each create a little momentum, but the key to any meaningful appreciation is the widespread adoption of XRP by corporate actors.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to fill out Claim of Exemption in California?,"I lost a good paying job about 4 years ago and had a series of bad luck financial setbacks including needing to replace my vehicle 3 times and emergency home repairs. I blew through my savings faster than expected and have not been able to get any kind of new savings together. Because of the sudden financial hardship I blew off the taxes and defaulted the credit cards.

I owed back taxes for both federal and state. I had hoped to have the back taxes settled before filing bankruptcy. State is taken care of but Fed has had setbacks. I'm re-sending the settlement packet tomorrow and hoping that will resolve that. However, our mortgage is now in jeopardy. 

We missed the May payment. It's the only household bill my wife covers and she blew it. I was looking for a way to cover it when my truck broke down (again -- it happens a lot). On top of that I was transferred to a department that doesn't offer overtime and her hours were cut taking away our health benefits. We were already in panic mode when our bank accounts were cleared out by a collection agency this past Monday. 

They got this month's mortgage and the $400 we had saved to put toward the missing May payment along with the money for the rest of the bills. I've had to borrow money for gas and food to get us through this week.

I'm trying to fill out the Claim of Exemption that came with the Notice of Levy packet that arrived yesterday. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this as so much is on the line. Google is useless.

CryptoCurrency,"Central Banks want in – The BIS (Bank for Central Banks) on ""Central Bank Cyptocurrency""","http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709f.htm

**Central bank cryptocurrencies**
*by Morten Linnemann Bech and Rodney Garratt*

New cryptocurrencies are emerging almost daily, and many interested parties are wondering whether central banks should issue their own versions. But what might central bank cryptocurrencies (CBCCs) look like and would they be useful? This feature provides a taxonomy of money that identifies two types of CBCC - retail and wholesale - and differentiates them from other forms of central bank money such as cash and reserves. It discusses the different characteristics of CBCCs and compares them with existing payment options.1

* [Two taxonomies of new forms of currency](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709/images/graph5-2.jpg)
* [The Money Flower: A Taxonomy of Money](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709/images/thumbnails/graph5-3.jpg)
* [The Money Flower: Example](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709/images/thumbnails/graph5-B.jpg)

**Conclusion**

As it stands, cash is the only means by which the public can hold central bank money. If someone wishes to digitise that holding, he/she has to convert the central bank liability into a commercial bank liability by depositing the cash in a bank. A CBCC would allow consumers to hold central bank liabilities in digital form.23 But this would also be possible if the public were allowed to have central bank accounts, an idea that has been around for a long time.24 We argue that the main benefit that a consumer-facing retail CBCC would offer, over the provision of public access to (centralised) central bank accounts, is that the former would have the potential to provide the anonymity of cash. In particular, peer-to-peer transfers allow anonymity vis-à-vis any third party. If third-party anonymity is not of sufficient importance to the public, then many of the alleged benefits of retail CBCCs can be achieved by giving broad access to accounts at the central bank.

Whether or not a central bank should provide a digital alternative to cash is most pressing in countries, such as Sweden, where cash usage is rapidly declining. But all central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale CBCCs makes sense in their own context. In making this decision, central banks will have to consider not only consumer preferences for privacy and possible efficiency gains - in terms of payments, clearing and settlement - but also the risks it may entail for the financial system and the wider economy, as well as any implications for monetary policy (Bordo and Levin (2017)). Some of the risks are currently hard to assess. For instance, at present very little can be said about the cyber-resilience of CBCCs, something not touched upon in this short feature.

personalfinance,"$85k in Student Loans starting in November, I need advice if anyone is able to help","TL,DR: $55k in private loans at 2%, 30k in federal loans between 3.76% and 4.66%. $19/hr full time income, $6,500 inheritance, no rent, $300-$500 monthly bills. What's my best move for my first few months of payments, and moving forward. Do I use my inheritance or keep it in the low risk fund it currently is in. I need to move out soon. Help!

  ----------------------------  

I graduated in May, moved across country, and just started work last week. I'm a 1099 contractor making $19/hr, working ~45 hours per week. My current contract will last about 6 months, during which I'm still actively looking for a permanent position and free to leave if I find one, and I also have a good chance at turning my current contract into permanent (but obviously not counting on that at all and I would actually prefer to go someplace else).

So that's my income. I also have $6,500 of inheritance in a very low risk fund that I can have immediately available. It was left to me for the sole use of my first loan payments. Is this a good move? To wipe out my inheritance on my first 6 months or so of payments while I continue to get on my feet?

I live with my parents currently, although they expect me to move out as soon as I can afford to do so in the coming months (and 100% certainly by the end of the year. EDIT: THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE WITH THEM.) No rent.

I spend between 300-500 a month in bills, including my phone bill, insurance, groceries, and misc expenses. The last two months were closer to the $500 mark due to car repairs (alternator, a/c pump, brakes and rotors, all of which I did myself.) I'm at $150 for September so far.

Loans:

Private - 4 loans, same terms, different amounts: 7 years - 2.00% - 13,670...14,571...14,984...15,079

Federal -

* 7,800 - 3.76% 
* 8,100 - 4.29% 
* 7,300 - 4.66% 
* 6,300 - 3.86% 

My fed loans are 10 years each. So here's where I need advice.

So my priority should be my federal loans with the higher interest rates, right? But the federal loans are the only ones I can choose a graduated payment plan for. I will probably need to take advantage of the graduated plan for my federal loans to stay afloat right now due to the high monthly payment of my private loans. And with loan payments of over $1k per month, I don't know how much extra I would have to target specific loans. Choosing a graduated payment plan cuts my monthly payments from roughly $350 to roughly $140 at the beginning and I only pay an extra $1,500 in interest over the next 10 years, which I don't think is too bad for being able to keep my current costs low while I'm still looking for a more permanent job. That extra $200 a month right now would be to help me move out.

I won't consolidate my private loans because the 2% is pretty good as far as I understand. The only payment plan they accept is the standard plan. So again, my payments will be very high considering I have 55k+ in 7 years.

I don't know what I don't know, and I don't really know what advice I need other than the fact that I'm very overwhelmed with the complexity of it all. I need to move out in the next couple months, but most of my income will go to loans and bills unless I wipe out my inheritance.

I did as much research as I could before posting but I could still use someone more knowledgeable to look over everything and tell me what the hell I'm doing. Thanks so much to anyone reading this.",finance
personalfinance,Budgeting for a small family,"First time poster here! I've recently come to the conclusion that my girlfriend and I are in dire need of a budget and quickly!!! 

Some background about us! I am 26m (27 on Sept 26th) while my girlfriend is 23. She has a 3 y/o son (who i freaking adore!!!) that she has joint custody of (50/50). No child support right per court order, that will be revisites once he starts school  (age 5). We are currently sharing her car due to a reposession on my end (Got in WAY over my head on a 72 month loan, paid 3+ years on it), but we work opposite schedules now. She works 15+/- a week at $9.63 an hour, and I am starting a new job (today!!!) at $22.00 an hour (over a previous  $18.18 an hour) with built in overtime every day. My current goal, finance wise, is to save enough for a down payment on a used car (probably $8-9k range) to keep my interest rate reasonable. I know my credit is currently horrible, mid 500s or so. I plan on tackling my debt once i can get my own car, so that my girlfriend can work more and bring more money home. We have talked about our budget previously, but didn't stick to it. I'm determined now, more than ever,  to get my credit and spending under control so we can move forward with our relationship and move on to the next step. As of now, we have no savings. I have one item in collections for $97 thst i plan on paying off once we get this budgetin full swing. I'm in the mindset right now that current expenses take priority over debt until we can get a handle on things.

Our rough budget totaling $2040 per month:
Rent-875
Phone-265
Electric-100
Internet-65
Insurance-20  (renters)
Gas-140
Credit cards-100 (all cards)
Food-300
Other-150

Income
B (me)- 535/week at old job, new will be roughly 800
A (her)- 300/bi-weekly

All of these are rounded to a rough average, but are fairly consistent month-to-month. We had an agreement when we moved in together that i eould cover 75% of the rent since I make a lot more and cover the electric bill each month. I did a break down of our monthly bills as if every month were 4 weeks to keep things even and occasionally have a spare paycheck to put towards debt.

Weekly costs For me
Rent-150
Electric-25
Phone-50
Gas-30
Credit cards-50
Food-75
Other 40
Total-420/week

Bi-weekly costs for her
Rent-100
Phone-30
Credit card-25
Internet-30
Total-185/bi-weekly


I had planned on keeping my old pay scale as my budget amount,  so that i could start saving something each week, probably about $50 every week for an emergency fund, with the remainder going to a car fund. I am going to borrow my mons spare truck in late October for about 6 months to save for a car myself, so gas expenses will go up a bit. 

My overall debt is about $9k: $5k from the repo, a student loan ($2k), and credit card debt ($900),and a few misc things i need to pay. The repo amount i plan on paying last, since it's the newest account. I know i have a lot of work to do, but I'm taking the first steps now.

Any advice on changes or any suggestions are appreciated. Most bills are set comfortably, phones are necessary, with a tablet financed (bad decision, but girlfriend is paying for that herself).",finance

I'm from Pennsylvania, which is where we bought the car and I got my loan through Wells Fargo as that was the company my parents always worked with.

I have never refinanced so I have a couple questions:

1. Should I first try to refinance through Wells Fargo? I'm not sure I want to do that because they have no real presence in Oklahoma, other than investing.

personalfinance,"Credit score 572, need to get to 720+ in 18 months. Possible?","Hi all,

My wife and I are looking into building a new home.  Currently renting, but have had two mortgages in the past with zero late payments.  Score is terrible due to high balance to limits and a few 30 day lates.  We would be looking at putting earnest money down in April, and should have ALL of our card balances at zero by then.  Most of my cards are in a debt management program and are currently closed, even though they report as being open.  Here's what I'm looking at:

Please note - this is NOT one of those things where they dont pay your cards and then settle the debt.  This is a non-profit that negotiates a lower interest rate, I pay them, and then they pay my credit cards every month.  Once I get the cars outside the program paid off (approx 2 months), I will start sending them an extra 2-3k per month to bring those balances down.

In Debt Management:

Barclays - Limit 5000 - Balance 4433 - Reported as open, current, no lates

CapOne - Limit 10000 - Balance 9800 - Reported as open, current, no lates

CBNA - Limit 500 - Balance 373 - Reported as open, current, no lates

Citi - Limit 3300 - Balance 3200 - Reported as open, current, no lates

Citi - Limit 1200 - Balance 1100 - Reported as open, current, no lates

Synchrony/Walmart - Limit 2500 - Balance 2300 - reported as open, current, no lates


Not in debt management:

Chase - Limit 4000 - Balance 3900 - Reported as open, current, no lates

Wells Fargo - Limit 4000 - Balance 3500 - reported as open, current, no lates

I have a paid home equity loan from out last house, with two 30 day lates in Jan and Jun 2016.  This loan was paid in full when we sold our house in Jun 2016.
I also have an auto loan that was paid in full as the result of a total loss.  Car accident happened in Oct 2016, but they didn't get paid by insurance until March of 2017, so they have me marked as late 90 days, and late between Nov 16 - Mar 17.


Auto Loans:
CarmaxAF - Balance 16k - current, no lates, opened May 2015
Mechanics Bank - Balance 11.5k - current, no lates, opened Nov 2016

Student loan balance - 81k - I'm in grad school and not currently paying on these


My thinking is to get all the credit cards paid off (including the ones in debt management program), which should be done by April.  Then I would put earnest money down on the house, which has a 10 month build time.  During that 10 months I would save up for the down payment.  Is there a different way I should approach this?  Is there any benefit to getting a credit builder loan (I've read about these from BMO harris, etc) or should I not try to open any new accounts?  I would really like to try to get my credit up to 739 by our close date (Approx Feb 2019) so I can do a one time PMI premium instead of the monthly payments.  Are those late payments to the home equity and auto loan going to totally screw me?

Thanks in advance for any advice you have.


**EDIT:  Thank you all for the slap in the face.  My wife and I have removed a new house from our goals.  For now our goal is to get all the credit cards paid off and then not using them and see where that gets us.  Additionally, we're going to rent another year to save up a huge down payment.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation loan worth it?,"Gonna be honest and open. 26, have a credit score ranges between 713-726. 8k credit card debt across 7 lines, 3 have no interest until late next year. 5k left on car loan. I recently heard about debt consolidation loans and I feel like it might be something that can help me breathe financially. I haven't done the math 100% down a tee but my predictions from using calculators is if I combine my car and credit card and do a 5 year loan it would be around 300 a month and that's 100% manageable to me.

My problem was I was super depressed the last 5 years and just bought stuff to make me happy. I've made big chunk payments on my CC debt and 8k is what I have left total. I've quit using them for the most part except 1-2 I put my gas/cellphone on that I always pay off each month to get reward points. Do you think a debt consolidation loan would be beneficial? 

EDIT: Extra info asked for. 

""1) $1,335 balance, ($1,072 of it no interest until May 27, 2018) Interest rate is 26.24%

2) $1,727 balance, interest rate is 19.99%

3) $1,531 balance, interest rate 19.99%

4) $2,106 balance, interest rate 18.99% (no interest for less than a month remaining for $919)

5) $2,298 balance, 19.99% interest (no interest until 3/01/18)

6) $272 balance, 26.99% interest (no interest until 3/20/18)

The 7th one is the just the one I put gas/cellphone on that I always pay off to get rewards points as they add up fast.  I also should have an extra minimum 700 dollars to maximum 1,200 dollars coming by November from my other job I can put towards these balances.

My average balance each month I have to pay for CC is 300, I could possibly do more, but 300 is the average I have left to pay.""",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) Sudden increase in CC declines from USA customers. Can't figure this out.,"I've posted about this in the weekend thread and received no response.

I've posted about this before about 2 months ago in a small business subreddit, but received no real response.

A question for anyone in or familiar with the banking/finance/credit card industries in the USA.

**Have stricter security measures come into effect sometime over the summer, or earlier this year, for USA-based credit cards making transactions with Canada or internationally?**

I have an online small business, located in Canada, 75% of my customers are from the USA.

After years with no problems, since July I have been getting frequent rejections of payments through PayPal from USA-based customers, 38 in the last ~60 days.  I installed Square for payments last week and it too has already rejected a few payments from USA-based customers.

I've already done troubleshooting with my dev, a few PayPal service tickets and with Square, and no answers have come up. 

It is a hassle since customers will either abandon their orders or get irate over the phone (one even demanded a discount for the inconvenience of THEIR card being declined.) I now have to frequently instruct customers to call their credit card issuers, request them to allow international transactions, and then they can place their order again where it's always successful the 2nd time around.

Today, I've had a customer order from the USA, they tried to pay by Square through my site, it was declined.

Here's the fun part:
They called in, and tried the payment over the phone with me using Square's app, completely external from my website, it was also declined!
I instructed her to call her credit card issuer to ask them to allow international transactions.
She called back to try the payment over the phone again and it was successful. (and it was the same card)

**Has anyone else in Canada been experiencing an increase in credit card declines from USA-based customers?**

I wish I knew if I was doing something wrong, or if there was something misconfigured in my site, paypal or square accounts, but it really looks like something external.


***edit***  I thought about not adding this, but after getting a DM confirming a suspicion I had...

The timeline.... it lines up closely to the equifax breach.  Equifax claims it was hacked may-july and *claims* that they discovered it July 29th and didn't disclose it publicly until September.  I started getting regular rejections July 7th.  I'm thinking that equifax knew about the breach earlier than they stated, some reports claiming this as well. Equifax likely shared the information privately about the breach in secret with Visa, MasterCard, banks, etc, where these companies in turn beefed up security.  It was really like someone flipped a switch.",finance
personalfinance,"Seeking student loan advice, PSLF","My wife and I are both teachers, and I just received the Teacher Student Loan Forgiveness (17.5k off loans) this left me with about 10k remaining in loans with a terrible 7.8% interest rate. My question is twofold, am I still eligible for the public service loan forgiveness program? Is this program likely to be around in 6 years once I actually reach 10 years of service? My loans are asking for a ridiculously low payment right now $78/mo. Should I just pay the minimum in the hopes that the PSLF is going to be around and work for me, risking paying a ton of extra interest? Or should I just buck up and try to pay this loan off early? I could probably put down 500/mo and pay it off in about 12 months.  Thoughts?

CryptoCurrency,The need to Politicize Cryptocurrencies,"Introduction

In many ways the realm of cryptocurrencies is riddled with new and exciting avenues for innovation and risk taking. This being the case, by its very nature, cryptocurrencies are politicized in their own right just by their very structure. No doubt, cryptocurrencies had this built into their DNA by their original founder Satoshi Nakamoto as his understanding for a need for a community driven world currency showed. To this end, Satoshi worked on his part of the equation by providing the framework for a new and equitable world currency. Our part, however, remains incomplete. We see that in our messaging boards and even market activity that our ideals, generally speaking, are not aligned with this overarching view of world change. This being the case, we have a need to change our ways. I argue that rather than letting our greed corrupt us into a speculative mania that we move forward with the idea of world change. The need for something of this magnitude has never been greater as the wealth gap between rich and poor is so great that it has not been matched since the eve of the French Revolution. We have the power to change the status quo. No political party and not many political movements can say this with as much power as we can. It does not require any bloodshed nor does it necessarily require any strife. It does, however, require or determination and pioneering as we are the first adopters of this new paradigm. I do hope each and every one of yourselves looks deep within yourself to realize that you are an individual. You are not some cog in a giant machine that forces you to go to work and live your life according to what society wants you to do. We have the tool we need to change our world but first we have to realize that we are people with unique ideas and ways. The only way, I truly think, for us to give way to freeing ourselves of this wall-less prison is through realizing that we can all make a difference if we understand that we are people with the free will to do as we want and to use this to create a world in which we actually want to live in.

Where the Power Lies

Power is a corrupting force, just look at the Federal Reserve. Created in 1913 by a collection of elites and bankers, this monster from Jekyll Island was from its very inception, crooked. On its surface, it was made to stop economic depressions as the idea of market manipulation versus extreme market corrections seemed very lucrative at the time but we must note that with such power came even greater consequences. For example, looking at the Great Recession of 2007-2008, we can see that bankers came to understand that they could simply count on this external agent to correct the market at all costs. They gave risky loans out to the public with the idea that they could simply leave their businesses with the taxpayers to foot the bill. It is no surprise that no banker went to jail for their actions as many of them simply went on to work for the same government that was supposed to regulate them. The Federal Reserve no doubt knew that something of this nature would eventually happen but to them it will never matter as they were never put into place to really fulfill their original purpose. Instead, they were put in place to create a stark divide between the rich and the poor. To accomplish this goal, they began inflating the value of dollars with the false argument that this would be used to pay off debts easier and stimulate the economy. Today, this phenomenon is so prevalent that the Federal Reserve has been using this inflationary tactic of quantitative easing since 2009. So, in essence each dollar that we have all had in our possession for the last 10 years has slowly lost its value over time as they have simply printed money out of thin air to cover debts and stimulate the economy. But we still haven’t yet discussed how this necessarily affects the common man. Today, most Americans have little to no investments. Instead, many of them have just enough cash to keep surviving. With stagnant wages and money losing value, you have an attack on two fronts as inflation not only affects pay but also the costs of goods and services – in layman terms, you get paid less and things cost more money. So who is profiting off of this system? The people in control. They work in a way that is meant for the house to always win. What I mean by this is that they control the value of money so that they can stack the cards against you every time you try to get ahead. Say your grandfather had the foresight to start saving his money so that his children would have a fund in the future. If he would have started saving his money in 1913, prices for goods and services would have been very much different than in 2017. Those dollars that he would have saved would be much more powerful than in today’s market by a whopping 96%. Just think of that, 96% of his money would have simply vanished because, you guessed it, the house always wins. So we can see that under the current paradigm that we will always face a disadvantage and also that things are bleak. If we have lost 96% of our wealth since 1913, we are almost working for free, and what does that make us? Slaves.

A Transformative Figure

When Satoshi created Bitcoin, he worked with others who shared his vision of a more equitable world whereby people acted as their own agents rather than outside forces. Cryptocurrency was always a mechanism by which people worked together to create a decentralized system that could never manipulate the common man as centralized systems always seem to do. There is no banker who can arbitrarily raise rates or inflate the money supply as there are a finite amount of coins in existence. Even with a growing number of altcoins, there will always be pure market forces that keep the system in check. Add to this the transparency of the block chain and you have a new paradigm in which the common man stands on the same footing as an elite. There can never be and will never be a house that can always win because we are all the house. Cryptocurrency, no doubt is our answer to a more equal world. Yet our temptations lie in accumulating for profit rather than holding it and using it for its purpose. It is up to us if we want this world and we simply have to take it. There is no political party that will save us like cryptocurrency can. In America, for example, there are two parties. While there may be some disagreement on the particulars of these two groups, they both support the same paradigm. It was Thomas Jefferson that once famously wrote, “I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies … If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around (these banks) will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered… the issuing power of currency shall be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."" We can see that even during the beginnings of what would later become one of the world’s most free and prosperous nations that antipathy towards banking was regarded as a critical issue in maintaining the sovereignty of the new nation’s citizens. Yet even the great Thomas Jefferson would not have been able to anticipate the new forces that would arise from the marrying of banking, corporatism, and government. Today we have the passing of Citizens United which essentially made politics a game of who has the most money. What’s more, we also have a solid two party system that is kept in power by the Commission on Public Debates. Sure, you can vote for another party but will your neighbor if they only ever hear two viewpoints on the TV? Furthermore, who pays for the funding of the Commission? You guessed it, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Why would they ever want to include a third or even a fourth option if it hurt their chances of winning? So in order to counteract this potential, the Commission sets arbitrary standards that are designed to exclude any third option like their 15% polling rule where the third party must consistently poll at an arbitrary 15% to be even considered for the debate. Good luck Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, you guys have fun playing the quiet game.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrencies, at least how I see them, are as John McAfee recently described “akin to the discovery of agriculture.” Not many inventions since this time have had the capacity to change the world so profoundly. Whether or not Bitcoin remains king, or another coin such as Ethereum or Monero take its place, is irrelevant. The political power of such a technology is overwhelming. We can see that political parties have their major disadvantages in our current struggle but there is hope in cryptocurrencies. They offer us a way out of the current system and change with the least amount of effort. I donated money to the candidates that I thought would offer the most change that I believed in, and you know what? They lost and I also lost my money. At least cryptocurrencies hold some of their value as volatile as they are. Furthermore, they act in a way that is not beholden to any particular power as it is in their very nature to create a more equitable world where no man’s labor and money can be stolen from him. I do also think that Bitcoin is going to face the power of the establishment and this foe is great. It is up to us to lead this fight. Some of us will take the time to educate, while others will add to the code, but most of us can simply use the technology and help others to do the same. This is the easiest way to help, yet is also the most important. To use this currency is to offer a political statement that you are an individual, that you are important, and that you have had enough. How easy is it to buy just a small amount of your favorite coin and get others to do the same? This is what we need the most and it is my sincerest hope that it actually happens. I am tired of scraping by only to have more and more of my livelihood stolen from me. I am a human being and I have value. Do you?

personalfinance,Advice needed on new loan with a lower interest rate,"I've been using the snowball method for the last two years now and have been able to payoff $25,000 worth of debt but I'm always looking for ways to speed it up.

Being the 1.82% isn't going to a bank but just back to into my fund, essentially I'm just charging myself interest, I don't think it's a bad idea but maybe I'm mistaken. I'd like to take the full $10,000 and apply it to my RV loan which is now at 6.39% rather than the Amex because I'm so close to paying that off. In theory the Amex will be done in just 2 months which will free that payment up to start applying to the RV loan.

A link to my bills tracking is posted here for all to see. [my budget](https://m.imgur.com/a/KTmsQ) I keep a month worth of bills in one account, allot myself $500 for spending, and $500 I keep in what I call savings, which is really just there incase I need it. Any surplus in my savings goes to bills as an extra payment. As you can see about $1400 a month.

My question is would it be beneficial to take the $10,000 and put it towards the RV loan or should I just keep doing what I'm doing? Also the Navy Fed CC goes back up to 9.9% interest in April of 18 which at that time I'll start looking for another 0% interest CC to transfer it to... not sure that matters much.

financial,Payday Loans or Advance Financial Flex Loans: The Choice is Yours.,"Payday loans sometimes seem like the greatest blessing, especially when there is just no other way of getting the money you need. The ever-growing number of people who take out these loans may make it look as if payday loans are a safe option. After all, so many people can’t be making an unwise decision, that too almost on a regular basis. But one needs to stop and consider that why mostly the same people are taking out such loans repeatedly. If you know anyone personally who has taken a payday loan more than just once, ask them and you will know the reality. They are not taking these loans repeatedly because it is convenient, but because the added loan cost to the principal amount makes it difficult to get out of the debt at once. 

A payday loan is a short-term and instant loan, often taken out as tiny amounts like $500 or less. Such loans are generally due on one’s next payday. The cost of the loan may range from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. The rates of interest are invariably high for all payday loans. For instance, a two-week payday loan with a $15 fee per $100 borrowed equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400 percent. The total principal and the loan fee is required to be paid back at the end of the loan term. Most borrowers are unable to do so and that causes the loan to roll over into a new loan with a new loan fee.

Now the question arises, what would low-income Americans do if not go for payday loans? There are other types of instant loans as well, such as, title loans or installment loans. However, all of them come with some or the other hidden terms that render those loans highly expensive. Whereas, Advance Financial [Flex Loans](https://www.af247.com/) are different than the rest. The first difference lies in the fact that Advance Financial Flex Loan is provided in the form of an open line of credit. As any unsecured, instant loan, the interest rates are higher than traditional loans for Flex Loans, but it is still less expensive than payday loans. The interest levied on Advance Financial Flex Loans works operates differently. A borrower is required to pay the interest only on the amount withdrawn from their maximum limit, for the time it is withdrawn. The remaining amount does not incur any interest, while being available to be used at any time one needs. There is no possibility of loan rolling over cost here because your one Flex Loan in the form of open line of credit usually extends till you can repay the entirety of it.

**Hello cryptophiles!** I posted essentially the same thing on the /r/ripple subreddit yesteday and someone suggested you ladies and gents might like to read it, too. Sorry if you've already seen this.

The following ideas are mine. They are the synthesis of lots and lots of reading over the past 5 months or so. Please feel free to correct me if I have made any mistakes. And, of course, do challenge the ideas if you think I'm wrong.

Browse the /r/ripple sub and if you can get past the endless shitposts about 'lambos' and 'the mooooon' and 'should I buy now?' and 'how high can it go?' and 'what does market cap mean?' and 'what's the easiest way to buy XRP using Tuvaluan dollars?' and 'can somebody help me to tie my shoelaces?' and so on, you will start to see posts about three possible near-term catalysts.  
  
##1. SWELL  
Ripple Labs is holding a big conference (called SWELL) in October. It is taking place on the same days and in the same city as Swift's SIBOS conference. The keynote speakers at SWELL will be:  
  
+ 1) Dr Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; and  
  
+ 2) Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.
  
##2. THE LOCKUP  
Ripple Labs holds about 62 billion XRP. The company has pledged to put 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically secured escrow account. The account will hold 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP each, with one contract expiring on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the 1 billion XRP will become available for Ripple to 'use' (which likely means sell to financial institutions). Whatever is not used at the end of each month will be put back into escrow and become available to Ripple 54 months later.
  
##3. XRP ADOPTION  
Ripple sells software that helps banks to lower costs related to overseas remittances. Ripple is working with over 90 banks globally, some 30 pilots have been run, and more than 10 banks are moving into commercial use. Ripple also sells XRP. This asset is intended to be used as a 'bridge currency' in conjunction with the Ripple software. Banks who use it can practically double their cost savings. As far as we know, banks are not using it in any great volume yet.  
  
---------------------
#Why does XRP's price fluctuate?  
---------------------
  
Well, why does any cryptocurrency's price fluctuate? Two reasons: speculation and demand.  
  
+ **Speculation:** Traders like to guess which way the price is going to head and they buy and sell the currency to try to make short-term trading gains. Investors are trying something similar, albeit from a longer-term perspective. They think the price will rise over the long term, so they buy the asset. This very process of buying and selling is what *causes* the price to move.  
  
+ **Demand:** Believe it or not, but some people actually *use* cryptocurrencies! Some drug dealers use Monero to make untraceable payments. Some people pay for goods and services with Bitcoin. Some financial institutions use XRP for overseas remittances. Hell, *I* use XRP to send money to family members who are overseas.  
  
---------------------
#What about these catalysts, then?
---------------------
  
So what impact will the abovementioned (potential) catalysts have on the price of XRP?  
  
##SWELL  
A lot of folks over at /r/ripple are very excited about SWELL. And I can't really blame them. The conference looks awesome. If you haven't checked out the agenda, you really should. It looks like a top-notch event. **But what does it mean for the price of XRP?** Well, it might cause a short-term spike if the day traders get as excited about this as the true-believers are. But once that price spikes, you can expect these guys to take profit and the price to correct accordingly. All the way? A 50% retreat? I couldn't tell you. Which is why I'm no day trader. SWELL might also get some investors excited. People new to the crypto space will hear about XRP for the first time and their imaginations might be fired the same way ours have been. This could give the price a sustainable boost. ""To the moon?"" you ask. Don't ask. It's a stupid question and you're stupid for asking, ya stupid-face. ""But CuriousZerper, I heard Ripple may use the conference to announce that SBI is going live with XRP!"" I've read this, too, but it doesn't make much sense. Tech companies don't use conferences to announce that they have new customers or that they their customers are using their products. They use conferences to showcase their products, to generate publicity, and to win new customers. I'm not saying some kind of SBI-related announcement is out of the question, I'm just saying it seems unlikely to me.  
  
##THE LOCKUP  
Ripple holds the lion's share of XRP. The company uses it to incentivize market makers. There is a fear among people who ""regurgitate FUD"" that Ripple Labs might just dump this onto the market to make a quick buck. This is known as overhang risk. But dumping XRP would be suicidal for Ripple. The company's surest way to vast profits is to do everything in its power to make XRP the global currency of choice. At that time, every single zerp it owns will be worth that much more. **So what does the lockup mean for the price of XRP?** Well, materially, the lockup doesn't really do anything to impact supply. Ripple Labs in May said that it ""has sold on average 300 million XRP per month for the past 18 months."" So when the escrow takes place and Ripple has 1 billion XRP available for sale every month, this is still FAR MORE than it is currently selling. The escrow serves one purpose: to instill confidence. It will not limit supply, but it may convince some who are on the fence to get off that fence and jump into the pool. (The water's great; come on in!)  
  
##XRP ADOPTION  
I'll cut to the chase: this is where my hopes lie. True, long-term, sustainable appreciation in the price XRP will come when the demand is there. Not demand from individuals who have a couple of grand to throw at the coin, but demand from financial institutions (and perhaps non-financial firms, too) who want to hold $50m worth, $200m worth, perhaps even $1b worth. If there are only 100 billion XRP in existence (and slightly less given that some portion is destroyed with every transaction), each token needs to be worth a hell of a lot more than $0.20 if hundreds or thousands of banks and companies want to transact with it.  
  
---------------------
#Conclusion  
---------------------
  
So, each of these three potential catalysts might do something for the price, but it is XRP ADOPTION that will have the long-lasting impact. And the stupidity of phrases like ""rockets to the moon"" overlooks that adoption may just take place gradually. To borrow the lexical idiocy I have been railing against, the rocket may be halfway to the moon before anybody realizes it has blasted off!  
  
---------------------  
**tl;dr** SWELL and the escrow may each create a little momentum for XRP, but the key to any meaningful appreciation is the widespread adoption of the asset by corporate actors.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Calculating income tax (state and federal) of a job opportunity with a state move.,"Hello PF,

My wife has a lucrative job offer that would require us to move. Currently we live in Illinois and she makes $220,000 and I make $69,000. This new opportunity would require us to move to Wisconsin and it would take her salary to $305,000 with a $110,000 sign-on bonus (given in the form of a 5-year forgiveable loan). 

My job prospects in this new area are unknown at the moment. I would likely take a pay cut. And, I would consider staying at home with our child. For the sake of some basic calculations, I'm only including her income. 

We would likely put the $110,000 bonus directly into our student loans (currently $210,000). Since it is being given in the form of a loan (forgiveable annually in $22,000 installments for five years), It seems I'd need to add $22,000 to our taxable income each year. If I'm using our standard deduction correctly, that would make our taxable income as follows: 

* $305,000 (salary) + $22,000 (amount of loan forgiven) = $327,000 - $12,700 (standard deduction) = **$314,300 taxable income**

Am I looking at that correctly? Then, based off the 33% tax bracket, my federal tax burden would be:

* $52,222.50 + 33% of the excess over $233,350 ($314,300 - $233,350 = $80,950)
* $52,222.50 + $26,713.50 (33% of $80,950) = **$78,936 total federal tax**

And then, when I'm calculating WI state income tax, the formula is as follows below. Should I be using my federal taxable income calculated with the standard deduction ($314,300)? Or, would it be my income plus amount of loan forgiven ($305,000 + $22,000 = $327,000)? The following uses the $314,300 number.

* $1,458.29 + 6.27% of the amount over $29,640 ($314,300 - $29,640 = $284,660)
* $1,458.29 + (284,660 * 6.27% = $17,848) = $19,306 state income tax

When all is said and done, that leaves us with an actual take home pay of: $305,000 - $78,936 (fed) - $19,306 (state) = **$206,757**

I think my next step will be to contact a tax professional, but I wanted to get some feedback on my ruminations first. I've done a similar calculation with our current income scenario and have found that our actual take home pay would actually decrease (by ~$2,000) taking this offer. Due to the taxable forgiveable loan, and Wisconsin's higher income tax rate. Obviously that doesn't take into account the $110,000 we'd take off our student loans right off the bat.

Are there any other major factors I should be considering? 
I know this is a loaded question. Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts.",finance

Bitcoin,Bitcoin &amp; Blockchain Tech For Philippine Real Estate - The Real Estate Group Philippines,"I saw a redditor here post these topics/links: [First Bitcoin Real Estate Purchase Recorded in Texas](https://www.market4cast.net/single-post/2017/09/18/First-Bitcoin-Real-Estate-Purchase-Recorded-in-Texas) &amp; [First Sale of Property with Bitcoin Done Successfully Sumaré / SP](https://guiadobitcoin.com.br/primeira-venda-de-imovel-com-bitcoin-e-feita-com-sucesso-em-sumaresp/)

It got me inspired to write an opinion piece. 
My country, the Philippines, despite having a tough talking president, is still riddled with corruption and red-tape. The industry that I'm working in (Real Estate) have barely improved over the past 10-years. I do believe Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology have a great potential to disrupt and improve the Philippine real estate industry. 

Disclaimer - I'm not an expert on both topic but I am very enthusiastic about it.

Here's my opinion:

To get things started, history was made in Austin, Texas when a house was purchased purely via Bitcoin: [First Bitcoin Real Estate Purchase Recorded in Texas](https://www.market4cast.net/single-post/2017/09/18/First-Bitcoin-Real-Estate-Purchase-Recorded-in-Texas)
Another case was recorded in the city of Sumaré, located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil: [First Sale of Property with Bitcoin Done Successfully Sumaré / SP](https://guiadobitcoin.com.br/primeira-venda-de-imovel-com-bitcoin-e-feita-com-sucesso-em-sumaresp/)

Real estate sellers, buyers and sales professionals are finally moving the needle. 

The Philippines is a potentially bright spot for Bitcoin and here's why.

The Philippine Central Bank released last 13 January 2017 its ""Results of the 2014 Consumer Finance Survey"".

One headline stands out:

Eighty six percent (86%) of households are unbanked

The report reads:

Majority of households or 86 percent did not have a deposit account. This means that only the remaining 14 percent save their money in banks. The foremost reason cited by households for not having a deposit account was not having enough money to keep an account.

Other reasons cited by households were: (1) do not need a bank/cash account (2 percent), (2) bank/institution location is far (1.7 percent), (3) cannot manage an account (1.2 percent), (4) service charges are too high  (1.0 percent), and other reasons   (1.6 percent) such as minimum balance is too high, do not like to deal with banks/institutions and do not trust banks/institutions.

Based on the odds ratios, results show that majority of household heads who are employed in private establishments and government are banked. In contrast, majority of household heads who are self-employed, worked for private household, other household’s farm, and in other informal occupations, are unbanked.

This is the reality on the ground. No matter how everyone glosses over the improved economic situation of the country, our financial institutions &amp; infrastructures are still apparently inadequate to support the masses in moving and expanding their money.

Just recently, we hired a staff member and learnt that he had no bank account. He uses LBC Pera Padala (LBC remittance) &amp; other local, non-bank money transfer platforms to send money to people in the provinces. Bitcoin easily solves this problem. As everybody on this subreddit knows, Bitcoin users could conveniently &amp; safely send coins to each other via their mobile wallets, without relying on banks or 3rd-party authority.

My friend, Federico Tenga, co-founder of Chainside, sent a coin from Italy to the Philippines, the transfer just took a few minutes.

The only thing holding the Philippines back is mass adoption, but we're moving slowly, but surely in that direction. There are currently only a handful of bitcoin exchanges (registered &amp; non registered operating in the country).

PhilippineStar.com reports:

BSP approves registration of 2 bitcoin exchange operators

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has approved the registration of two companies to engage in the operation of bitcoin exchanges as part of efforts to regulate the fast growing but potentially risky virtual currency industry.

Coindesk even had a headline that reads:

The Philippines Just Released New Rules for Bitcoin Exchanges

The more bitcoin exchanges we have, the faster this mass adoption would take place.

Now, we go back to Bitcoin &amp; Blockchain tech's impact to Philippine real estate. The first Philippine real estate sale that would be transacted through Bitcoin would (or might) have a huge significant impact to our general society.

This will signal a strong confidence not only in the cryptocurrency itself but also in the blockchain technology that powers it. Smart contracts and title transfers through blockchain tech &amp; other related services may very well soon follow, thus (i) accelerating the advancement in local &amp; international transactions, (ii) improving the industry's safety feature against fraudulent documents, (iii) mitigating data loss &amp; (iv) effectively organizing the chaotic real estate services industry.

As an example, here in the Philippines, majority of the contracts and property titles are still on paper, which are most often lost due to fire, flood &amp; other natural calamities. Its take a significant amount of time to reconstruct a title, blockchain tech will resolve this, since a title made under the blockchain tech would have multiple copies that cannot be destroyed or hacked or altered maliciously.

Furthermore, the current real estate services industry is very problematic with many scams and fraudulent activities still continue unabated. Multiple listings of the same property are being spammed all over the internet. Third-world problems that could be resolved by the Blockchain since it's a:

digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly. -blockchain-documentary.com

continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. -Wikipedia

Many governments have already taken steps to harness the power of blockchain technology, here's a great example:

[The First Government To Secure Land Titles On The Bitcoin Blockchain Expands Project](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/02/07/the-first-government-to-secure-land-titles-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-expands-project/)

Academics have also started exploring the possibilities of this new tech. Take a look at this:

[Blockchain: Digitally Rebuilding the Real Estate Industry by Avi Spielman](http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/spielman_thesis.pdf)

Utilizing Bitcoin and Blockchain tech in the Philippine real estate industry is the way to the future. I'm just hoping that the old politicians and bureaucrats controlling our industry gets thrown out or replaced by young and open-minded ones.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Lose/lose situation auto loan due to hurricane Harvey,"** Update: The bank's final offer is 9.39%. I need to get a lender to match so I can refi with the Credit Union. Otherwise that's my only option. 

3 months ago I purchased a 2014 Ford Fusion SE. I have been working on my credit and Capital One had offered 7.70% interest (which was much better than my previous interest with my first auto purchase loan). 1 month after purchase, I refinanced through my Credit Union at 4.09% through a promotion they were offering.  
Now, 2 months after refi, I was affected by Harvey and my new car has since been totaled. It has been one week since the car has been deemed total loss and Progressive has not contacted me or provided me with an appointment to discuss the settlement. (I have been contacting them and they say they will call me asap, they are backed up from the number of claims) I have no information on how much they are giving me. I am currently financially blind. The cash and previous vehicle I had went towards the 14' Fusion I purchased 3 months ago. I'm basically starting this new vehicle purchase with 0 down. *I have GAP   

Over the weekend I found two potential vehicles to purchase. Unfortunately there are 3 new hard inquiries on my credit - 1 for my Credit Union, 2 for two dealerships for the cars I found. I let two dealerships run my credit due to shortage of vehicles (every other vehicle I had saved/test driven has been sold), I'm not saying it was correct, I feel it was what had to be done at the time.  

Now, for the vehicle I want, the dealership said Capital One has me at 18% (more than double the interest they offered 3 months ago) and my Credit Union has me at 11%. My credit union said the promotion I used two months ago is still active and I will have to finance through Capital One (or any other lender), and refi through them but she cannot guarantee the 4.09% rate that I'm currently at. Now she is saying they gave me that low rate because capital one gave me the 7.70%, which is different than what she originally told me regarding the promotion. She said it was based off a 750 score and blah blah.  

I originally went to my Credit Union to see if they can simply agree to finance my new vehicle at the low rate without having to go through the whole refinance situation. I know she cannot make the decision but she said she will try to speak with the manager of the bank. I have been with my Credit Union for 5 continuous years with at least 4 completed loans (2 refi auto loans and 2 small personal loans to build credit) through them with 0 late payments. I feel like they should be able to assist me given the situation.  

I basically don't know what the smartest move here is. I don't want to commit to the 18% interest rate without my bank confirming that they will refi at the lower rate because I don't want to get stuck with that high rate. I'm pretty sure the dealership can get a better rate than the 18% Capital One is offering, but I'm still pissed that it won't be the 4.09 I'm currently at.  

Should I wait for progressive to see how much the settlement is for my totaled car? - I will most likely lose the vehicle I want and have to start over. Which means another hard inquiry on my credit.
Is there a better way to speak with the bank regarding the situation I'm in?

I'm about to be defeated over this whole thing. I can't imagine how the people who lost so much more than me must be feeling.",finance

personalfinance,Employer Health Insurance plans,"Note: this is only health insurance. Dental/vision not included.

I found out that my employer-sponsored health insurance plan I had last year is going up $27 a pay period(Essentially $54 extra a month). This has lead me to look into private insurance.

Long story short is I'm head of household with my wife and one 2 year old. My wife works as a nanny under the table and has no federal income.

Currently, my employer has 2 insurance plans we can choose from HSA or PPO.
For a family, the HSA would have a deductible of $8,000. I highly doubt we will get anywhere close to that so it's off the table. Employer contributions would be $500 annually to this HSA.

The PPO plan would cost 6,640.80 a year or 553.40 a month and is similar to what I had last year.
Our family makes roughly $55,000 a year before insurance and expenses.

Should I look into private insurance or is my employer offering a cost-effective plan? If there any way I can lower/offset the price of insurance?

I've looked into the Health Care Premium Tax Credit but don't think we are eligible due to employer coverage. Would getting private insurance to get this credit be a good move?

Thank you in advance for any/all help!",finance
personalfinance,"I have some student loans that are building interest and a good 6 months to a year before going to grad school. Should I start paying them now, or wait until after grad school?","I graduated from my undergrad in May. I took out a little over $22,000 to pay for all five years of college. Thanks to interest rates, I currently owe about $25.5K. 

I really want to go to graduate school and am applying for both next semester and the one after. I intend to be a lot smarter this go around and to take out minimal loans, if I take out any at all. By the time I graduate and my loans go out of deferment, I will likely owe about $30K (by my own estimations). In the meantime, I am taking random classes at the community college to keep my loans in deferment. 

My question is this, should I stop putting it off? If I stop taking classes, I could make a good few months to a year's worth of payments. Would it be worth it to bring that number down a bit before going to graduate school? I've seen what the payments will more or less look like (for some reason, the website is estimating that I begin paying back in 2019) and I think I can make them if I'm a little more careful with my money. It would be tight, but I could do it. If I wait until later, I imagine the monthly payments will increase as the interest does. In the long wrong, would it be worth it to start now or will the difference by minimal? 

Edit- Or, even more alternatively, should I wait on grad school for a while? Maybe spend a few years paying off some of those loans, saving money, etc. I'm honestly open to all suggestions here. 

Edit 2- More detail. The programs I'm looking into are distance learning graduate programs, so I'd still be able to work while completing my MA.",finance

I want to preface this by saying that i just want my mom to get an apology.

A few Months ago as a promotion for their supermeat boy Indiebox , the Indiebox company sent out packets stuffed with glitter to their subscribers as a snarky joke.

My mom had just recovered from getting a tumor near her eye removed. She u wittingly opened the envelope and the glitter got all in her eye/ the fresh stitches

Needless to say i was angry. But contacting indiebox on their FB just elicited snarky replies. Eventually i was told to email their customer support.

So i did. 10 times. And never got a reply.

I kept my subscription going , in the hopes that in some way, they might just decide to pay me heed eventually since i am a paying customer. Still nothing. I even posted on their fb again and just got snark.

Today, i decided to cancel my subscription. Lo and behold: My account apparently ""Doesnt exist"". Yet ive been billed for the past few months.

I want to know what is going on. Whats in the mind of the people running this company, because honestly- if you cant apologize for hurting someones Mother- at least have the decency to let me cancel my subscription.

TLDR: Skip subscribing to indiebox. The company does not give a damn about its customers, much less ones that it physically hurts.

I have screencaps of all of this. I can and will post links to them via imgur.",technology

technology,Mitch McConnell's stance on FCC's regulation on internet services,"(received this in my email, I live in Kentucky) Thank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) regulation of Internet services. Hearing from you helps me better represent Kentucky in the United States Senate. On February 26, 2015, the FCC approved an order that permitted it to regulate Internet service providers like public utilities under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, allowing tighter controls over broadband and mobile providers. Additionally, the order prevented the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from fully exerting its statutorily established authority over the conduct of Internet service providers who engage in anticompetitive behavior, like limiting or outright blocking access to particular websites or services of a competitor. For me, the FCC’s order brought upon great concern that this action would hinder broadband deployment throughout the nation, especially in Kentucky’s rural areas. Unfortunately, that is precisely what has happened after its implementation. Broadband investment across the country has steadily declined, resulting in less consumer choice and stifling innovation. Fortunately, the FCC under its new chairman, Ajit Pai, recognizes the role the FCC should play in removing barriers that suppress advances in this vibrant industry. The expansion of the Internet has been made possible in large part by a limited regulatory burden. For this reason, I was pleased to hear that on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted to revisit the 2015 order and is committed to considering the public’s comments in crafting a new rule. If you would like to submit a formal comment, you may wish to visit the FCC website at www.fcc.gov. Please know, I will continue to support policies that promote an open and accessible Internet for all Americans. I wholeheartedly believe that this may only be accomplished through a light regulatory touch. After all, many of the incredible technological achievements we rely on today were created thanks to a lightly regulated Internet. Rest assured, I will keep your thoughts foremost in mind as Congress continues to debate policies impacting the Internet. Again, thank you for contacting me regarding this important matter. If you would like to receive periodic updates from my office, please sign up for my eNewsletter at www. mcconnell .senate. gov, become a fan of my page on Facebook by visiting FB/mitchmcconnell or follow my office on Twitter @ McConnellPress.

personalfinance,Should I get a loan while in grad school?,"I'm probably not the only one in this situation, but hopefully I can figure this situation out. Currently I am in grad school, and have this semester and one more left. I have roughly $2,600 in credit card debt (spread across 2 cards) from paying for expenses and other things for grad school. I know that the APR is really high on these (20% on one, 21% on the other), and I'm looking to consolidate this debt into something that won't accrue so much interest. I have a good credit score which is ~720. Is taking out a student loan the best option, or should I take out some kind of personal loan? I'm not familiar with loans, so I'm not sure what all options are out there. What interest rates should I expect to get?",finance
personalfinance,How to stop wage garnishment for federal student loans and get them back to current?,"First, thank you for taking the time to even read this.

My situation:
I am 27 years old and the government has been garnishing my wages since February 2017. The post-tax garnishment rate is 15%. I make just about 40k so this comes to about $200 per paycheck (paid bi-weekly). I live in Pennsylvania. My federal loans total about 40k and I have another AES loan that I have never missed a payment which is about 10k. My payment for that loan is $123 per month.

I know I am dumb for letting it get to this point, but I suffered from some pretty intense depression immediately after graduating and didn't really care about anything - least of all paying off debt. I have since pulled myself up, got hired and held a job for almost 2 years now, and am finally ready to take on the challenge of rebuilding my credit.

My Goal(s):
Rebuild my credit by bringing all loans to current in the way that will most positively affect my credit (and allow me to one day again entertain the idea of being able to buy a home). 

My questions:
1) Where do I even start?
2) Do I have any refinancing options since my loans are in default?
2A) Are my loans even in default anymore (I ask this because I just logged onto credit karma and all of the previous accounts for my federal loans in default now say ""closed"")?
3) If my current credit score is 585, what is the best that I can expect to to be in the next few years (I've had a credit card for about 3 years that I've never missed a payment on)?
4) I'm currently in the process of trying to find a better job - is it possible that a new employer could hire me then at the last second (after I have put in my 2 weeks at my current job) rescind the offer after checking my credit? Especially bc I am in the finance field.
5) Should I just give up and flee the country?

Bonus Question: I have a gas bill for about 700 in collections from back in my depression days - is it best (from a credit perspective) to just pony up and pay that or would that be the wrong move in this case?


I tried to capture all the relevant details, but I assuredly missed something. I will clarify add anything that I missed, just let me know! 

Any help is greatly appreciated. I am just trying to get myself back on the path to a normal financial life.",finance

gaming,Kingdom Hearts 0.2 A FP Frame Issues,"I am not certain of my issue as I have surfed the internet trying to find a solution or at least a reason for the problem. My problem is that this game (KH 0.2 FP) seems to be running at what feels like 15 fps. To give context, I bought the game brand new, from Walmart, and played it on my new PS4 Slim Gold edition, which I purchased back in July from Gamestop, also new ofc. I am just now bringing this issue up because yesterday I finally beat every other Kingdom Hearts game and am just now seeing this issue.

I have already seen issues with the game on ps4 pro not being able to hold steady at 60fps, yet people claim the game runs steady at 30fps fine on the normal ps4. But not on mine it seems.

It is barely playable, so my questions are does this have something to do with my console (ps4 slim) or the disc? Has there been an update to fix this? Is there a solution other than buying a Ps4 pro?",technology
personalfinance,Facing a career change: Is it worth it to take less money to live where we want to permanently? (and related questions),"TL;DR - On a good but dead end career path that is tied to the east coast, wanting to move west. Luckily, I have two job offers in Utah: one with a company in a new field that gets me off that path but pays less, and one with my current job that pays more but is only temporarily in Utah (3-7 years) and keeps me on the same career path. Which option makes more sense given our situation?

*****

I'm sorry if this is more for /r/careerguidance but since I have hard numbers I wanted to ask this question here. Long story short, my wife and I find ourselves on the east coast and want to move back west. We're aren't perpetual curmudgeons; we've been very happy before in previous locations, but our current situation is just not what we want long term. Problem is, I have a pretty decent federal job out here that pays well(GS-11 right now with some bonuses =$87,000), has wonderful benefits, and offers ironclad job security.

While the job has lots of good perks, it is in many ways a dead end job as well. I'm learning tools and skills that are really only applicable to my current job (or other jobs in the same, small geographic area) and every year it makes it harder to break into a new field and find something that allows us to move to the west coast. I know that a lot of people might have advice here, but I've been battling with this for years already and it basically comes down to me making poor choices in college (polisci) and in my career choice that put me perfectly in a career that I only realized later ties me to the east coast.

So for those two reasons, 1. Geography and 2. dead end career, we want to switch careers and move west.

Luckily, we have a found a couple options that will get us to Utah which is close to lots of family and some amazing outdoors. As a side note, we've lived in Utah and aware of its shortcomings and would absolutely love to live there again. Just wanted to mention that to stem the tide of ""Utah sucks!"" comments that might come in. We're not mormon, but can live with that culture, especially in Salt Lake.

*****

So without further ado, here are the options:

1) A project management position with a smaller, software related company:

* Initial offer (which I plan to negotiate up a little) $52,000 and an auto raise to $57,000 after six months
* Between $460 and $490 a month for insurance for my family of four, $45 month for dental
* 401k matching up a quarter on the dollar up to 4% (meh)
* Stock options (which I know don't mean anything)
* 10 vacation days, 5 days PTO

* **Pros:** change into a career that is pretty mobile and interesting to me, permanent on the west coast, close to sooooo many things that we love
* **Cons:** salary decrease, benefits decrease, less job security than my federal job; likely more work and more stressful work; we would have to pay for our move to Utah

2) Current job which has a temporary position in Utah for at least 3 max 7 years.

* Pay would decrease slightly to $81,000 due to cost of living decrease.
* ~$320 every 4 weeks for insurance for family, ~$30 for dental
* 401K 5% employer contribution (some of it auto, some matching)
* 20 days annual, 13 days sick leave /year (ridiculous, I know)
* **Pros:** Decent salary, great benefits, good job security; would pay for move to Utah
* **Cons:** Always tied to east coast though; after stint in Utah would have to move back to east coast. Boxed in career wise.

Our current situation and what we have saved at this time:

* We want to buy a house and have $50,000 down saved up. We thought we'd have more but these job offers kind of came up quickly so we don't have as much as we'd like.
* We would like to buy another car soon for my wife and two kids and have $10,000 saved up. Again, plan was to have more and just buy a small SUV outright.
* We are debt free currently and if it matters have high 700s credit.

*****

With all of that, here are some questions:

* Taking into consideration the financial, career, and.. emotional aspects of this decision, am I absolutely crazy to take the PM job with the lower salary? Are there financial aspects to this career change that I don't seem to be considering?
* If we were to buy a house in Utah, would it makes sense potentially to take some of the $10,000 saved for a car and use it to help avoid PMI on any home loan that we would get and then take a larger car loan later?
* Does it make sense to take this take the job opportunity now rather than letting the government move me to Utah and have more financial flexibility with house and car, and then later *hopefully* land a job in Utah in a year or two or three? In other words, is a bird in the hand really worth more than two in the bush?

personalfinance,Advice on how to deal with a loan from my Parents,"Hello PF. I am a kiwi about to head overseas to Canada for an OE/ working holiday for a few years. I currently have a student loan that is at 50,000 NZD. The way student loans work in NZ is that if you stay in the country the IRD pays the interest so it effectively a student free loan. If you spend more than 184 days over a 12 month period overseas they stop paying interest. The interest rates are as follows


1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018	4.4%

1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017	4.8%

As to repayments I will need to make 4000 NZD repayments annually in 2 blocks of 2000 NZD at the half year marks.

My parents have offered to pay the loan for me when I head overseas and instead I owe them the money in an interest free loan. I have an Engineering Degree and 2 years work experience, job prospects are such that I should be in a position to pay back the loan over the next few years. I am hoping to find Engineering work in Canada the wage is about the same as NZ and over the past 2 years I have been able to pay off 15000 NZD of my loan and save 25000 NZD so if I manage to get a job paying my parents back should be no issue although I expect my costs to increase in Canada as I will want to do a bunch of traveling.

 I am aware of the fact that money can change relationships. My parents are in a position where this is not a huge deal of money to them and we have a good relationship. I am looking for advice as to how I could deal with the situation without the loan causing any tension in our relationship. Does anyone have any sugestions on how i could structure a loan agreement with my parents with regards to payments so this is defined how I would pay it back to try avoid any tension down the road.

If this was a private loan what sort of payment terms would be usual what would the time period be. The way student loans work is there is no payment plan or time frame you just have to pay 12% of everything you earn above 19000 pre tax",finance

personalfinance,International Assignment and Ex-Company is Claiming ~50% of Tax Return 2nd Year in a Row!,"Bit lengthy and written by a Chem Eng with little accounting experience - bear with me... 

Early 2015 I was living in Los Angeles and was 2.5 years with my ex-company. Mid-2015 I willingly relocated to PA for another role within the company, but almost immediately after moving to PA I was unwillingly sent on international assignment to the UK. I was in the UK for 10 months until March 2016 and I was secunded for taxes. I quit that company in March 2016 after my return.

My company had a 'tax equalization' program that I was forced to agree to and sign, although I was not properly briefed on what this meant (in both the legal and practical sense of briefing or training). My manager told me it would ensure I didn't experience a different level of taxation due to my assignment and I was required to allow their account (E&amp;Y) to complete my tax returns for FY2015 and FY2016.  Verbatim text regarding the Tax Equalization Policy: 

""It is the company's policy that you should not be at either a disadvantage or an advantage as a result of the different tax rates and regulations between your home and host countries. As it has been determined that your income is likely to become subject to host country taxation your pay will be administered according to the Tax Equalization Policy to ensure that you are not advantaged or disadvantaged from a tax standpoint. Your tax liability will be defined as the amount of tax that you would have paid had you remained working in your home country for the entire tax year and not gone on international assignment.

You will continue to have actual home country tax withholding deducted from your pay while on assignment. Any actual taxes due in the host country will be paid by the Company. A tax equalization settlement will be prepared by the tax service provider once your tax returns are filed to reconcile any under or over withholding of home country tax.""

In FY14, separate from an international assignment my tax return was $5493. Salary ~$80K
In FY15, the company demanded $3900 out of $5545, leaving $1645. Salary ~$125K
In FY16, the company is demanding $3009 out of $5666 leaving $2657. Salary ~$100K

The amount requested paid to the company in FY15 was very shocking considering my FY14 returns. Many of my colleagues were also concerned. I found that E&amp;Y included $1,500 as FY15 income for them doing my taxes.

Now the company is demanding I pay them $3,009 back out of a $5,666 tax return leaving me $2,657. Something about this arrangement just doesn't make sense to me as I feel like I am at a huge tax disadvantage for having completed this international assignment. I also have no confidence in the integrity of the company, and E&amp;Y accountants have declined to comment on discrepancies I see as they 'are working for the company'. 

Do any of you seasoned vets smell any foul play or see any red flags? Is it legal for a company to demand tax return money be paid to them? On the contrary, is this completely normal and I'm just flailing at the thought of having to pay them $3K for sacrificing 10 months of my life? (Not that I don't love the brits :] )",finance

A little background about me. 27yrs old, married, military 8yrs in planning on doing 20yrs for the pension, attending college. Wife is 26yrs old, travel nurse. 

Income from jobs monthly: $8,000 (low estimate)

Vehicles are paid for. 

House #1: Mortgage is $1,075, we rent it for $1,518, after the expenses. We owe $122k with an interest rate of 4.1%. Current market value is $210k+

House #2: Mortgage is $850, we rent it for $874 and $488, after the expenses. This is a single lot with a mobile home and an RV hookup. The mobile home is older, around the 70s. We owe $78k, the interest rate is 7.8% since it is a trailer. I purchased this for the large land and it already has septic and power, my goal is to pay it off before the end of 2018. I would like to rent this trailer out as long as someone will live there, then either has enough money to pay for a house to build or take a small loan to build a house. While still have the RV side to rent for the $488. 

House #3: Mortgage is $1,578, we rent it for $1,785, after the expenses. We owe $225k with an interest rate of 4.2%. Market value is $250k+.

Roth IRA has $52k with maxing out every year. It’s actively managed with a fee of 1.1% annually. I have been thinking of switching away from actively managed but would like some of your thoughts on this. I enjoy getting on my computer and checking how things are doing daily. I used to trade stock daily and found it very enjoyable. My wife just recently started her own and is maxing it out also. 

Mutual Fund has $3,500, with adding $200 a month.

TSP has $4k with about $180 a month going into it. With a smaller fee, I’ve been thinking of putting less into my Roth IRA and putting more into my TSP, which is still a Roth. 

All our insurance cost roughly $430 a month. That’s between vehicles, houses, life, ext. 

Cell phone is $150 a month. 

Gas: $500 a month

Food: $500 a month

Emergency:$30k

My short-term goal is to pay off house #2 by selling my truck which I should get around $25k and then when I re-enlist next year the bonus should be around $30k. We will be putting away around $2,500 a month to pay off the house. Then create a snowball effect and pay off house #1 within the next 5 years. I will be selling the truck and moving to another country for a few years and the wife will be going back to the states to take assignments. She is a contract nurse, which gives her the ability to take as much time off as she wishes. The total income I put is on the very very low end. 

I apologize if my wording is not correct or if I am all over the place. I would really enjoy hearing some of your ideas. I have been reading Rich Dad Investments and read a few other financial books. I would love to hear if you have any recommendations.",finance

Thank you for having me here.

I believe that ideas play an important role in shaping human history. What I want to talk about is how technology has been shaped by key ideas. In particular how certain mechanical ideas of human society got mixed up with with politics and technology.

What I want to talk about is the free technology movement. It was a movement that showed great potential promise to liberate humanity. At the heart of it was a idea that technology offered a new way to construct a radially different kind of society that never before was possible in history, this movement was influenced by the visions of early scientists who believed in the power of computer technology not just to serve large industry and military but everybody to have access to this new power.

Influenced of by the 60s counterculture, this movement went on to develop the first personal computers. But that's not the end of the story because this radical vision mutated into the idea of self-regulating systems which see human beings as object managed by computer algorithms. In this vision, the value of human ideas to transform the world was diminished into a strange kind of consensus where everybody satisfies their personal desires.

We now find ourselves in a strange static dreamworld while dark forces are returning to threaten to penetrate our reality and all of the dreams of the techno-utopiasts play the role in creating this fake virtual world in which human beings driven by desires, devoid of all sense of higher purpose become slaves to algorithms and vast computer intelligences.

What is interesting about this story is the significance it has for Bitcoin. A project which is created for the purpose of creating a decentralized peer-to-peer money that cannot be controlled by governments and central banks but which now finds itself monopolized by large mining cartels. A lack of vision to guide the project forwards and increasing irrelevance in a world facing a global breakup of power.

Lastly I want to explain my project to revitalize the free technology movement to formulate a wider vision to restore back the potential of the technology to transform human society and train the next generation of revolutionary hackers dedicated to the cause of using the technology to support the cause of freedom.

My aim here is to find sponsors, find the place for establishing our hacker Academy, to find partner organisations to develop new technology projects with and to find people ready to dedicate themselves in advancing the free technology movement. People ready to be at the forefront of writing history.

--

At the heart of this story lies a conflict between two men in 1968. One of them is good B.F. Skinner, the other is good Lewis Mumford. It was one moment when two ideas about how technology could be used to advance human society first XXX ((unintelligible)) to take hold.

There's a documentary from this time made in mid-60s called ""Towards tomorrow"". And in this documentary, it described two possible future visions for human society. In a society where old forms of authority were declining, what would be the way that we could organize masses of human beings in a future society.

One of these visions for this society was a world managed by an elite group of technocrats, a specialized elite who managed a large population of passive human beings who constantly needed to be monitored and managed to be able to to keep them happy. B.F. Skinner described a new way of controlling and ordering people. He posed the question in this age of mass democracy and individualism the old forms of coercion was simply not possible and he put forth the idea of using reward. And he described an experiment where you have a cage with a pigeon inside and the pigeon can be trained to peck symbols, buttons, and depending on which symbol they peck, they get a pellet of food. In this way, by giving the pigeons the right reward for the correct behavior, they train the pigeon as a mechanical object.

He then took this farther and he went to a mental hospital in San Bernardino in California and in the mental hospital, what they did is they gave the mental patients small reward every time they did a good behavior. With this reward, when it was a lunch time or a dinner time, the patients could sit at a nicer table. So, inside the mental hospital, they created a new ordered hierarchy from a system of reward in which people don't feel controlled but feel empowered. Skinner describes this model as a model for the future of humanity. What's really interesting about this video by Skinner is it there's something very eerily similar to what we see today in which there is a technocratic elite that has interest in politics only in managing human society to keep us happy to keep everything stable and to keep themselves rich. A lot of this was powered in the mid-80s with the fake consumer credit to reward us as a form of social management - much like the experiment with the hospital, the mental hospital.

Lewis Mumford put forward an alternative vision for a society. In this video I'm going to show you - he first criticises Skinner and then he puts forward an alternative vision where everybody in the society is a participant. Everybody is an active human being deciding their destiny.

&lt;video - Lewis Mumford&gt;
Skinner has a very ingenious way of making a system of highly compulsive organization seem as if it were very humane one. This is his great and original contribution. The old-fashioned mechanical collectives, the mega-machines as I call them, were brutal. They used punishment as a way of enforcing conformity. Skinner and the psychological school that he represents, have found much better system than punishment. They first tried it out on animals and now they are applying on human beings - reward them - make them exactly what you want them to do without the whip - but with some form of sugar-coated drug or candy which will make them think that they actually enjoying every moment of it. This is the most dangerous of all systems of compulsion that's why I regard Skinner's Walden 2 as another name for hell. And it would be the worst hell because we would not recognize we were there, we would imagine we are still in heaven.

Most of the reactions that have taken place in art including those that come on ahead of the beatniks and the hippies, have some underlying sense in the reaction itself, but the remedy is the part of the disease. The remedy in fact makes it easier for the institutions that have now the hold upon us to be even more compulsive, to be even more effective than ever before, if we don't care, if we drop out. If we lose ourselves in some insane fantasy of some kind - whether a natural fantasy of the neurotic or the chemically induced fantasy of someone who takes drugs - we lose our possibility of restoring our own autonomy of taking charge of our life because this requires greater energy, greater effort than that which is required to live through the daily life of a machine worker. We have to become fully fully activated human beings, every part of us tremendously alive and ready to take charge and this can't be done by people who are in an escape, by people who are in a form of habit of total rejection. We must know what we want - not just what we don't know.

&lt;/video&gt;

There were many forms the computer could have taken. In 1800s, the computer was proposed by Babbage. And popularized by Ada Lovelace. It was seen as a tool that would have huge social uses and that should be in the hands of many people, but when the computer was first developed during WWII - for cracking German codes for the military and for guiding ballistic missiles - computers became a very large centralized machine.

By the 80s, communities of hackers started to emerge which started to be fascinated with these huge machines - which at the time you had to get the time slice, to get the appointment to get to get some time to use the machine - they started to get jobs near these computing devices, because they wanted to know how these machines could work. They started to build their own computers in their garages, in their houses and universities - and that was the birth of the personal computers, the reason why we now have laptops and telephones.

What happened was: a lot of big companies started to come along and they started to invest a lot of capital. All of the hacker community - who up until that point had never seen money before in their life - to throw themselves at, at the proprietary industry. And whereas before the culture that had created this personal computers, this liberatory technology, really believed in power to use the technology to improve the humanity for the better, who really believed in free technology, in sharing techniques and code with each other - instead became siloed off.

But there was one guy - Richard Stallman - he was just a guy - he found this ethically wrong. If enough people got together, we could give a challenge against the proprietary industry. He made that as a proposal to the community - that it doesn't have to be this way, if we together put our energies we can build our own operating system. A lot of people at that time thought that he was crazy or that his ideas weren't feasible.

This is early video of Richard Stallman.

&lt;video - Richard Stallman&gt;

((some parts missing))

...you are at that person's mercy. You you become downtrodden and resigned. That's what happens when the blueprints to the computer program are kept secret by the organization that sells it. That's the usual way how things are done.

&lt;/video&gt;

So, in 1991, the cryptography was classified as ammunitions and Philip Zimmermann wrote the first freely available encryption software for anybody to use and he uploaded it to the Internet. The American government arrested him and he was facing a decade in prison. What Philip Zimmerman did was to print the source code of PGP - of this encryption software - which he sold internationally, which is something that in America is protected under the First Amendment. And the American government was realizing that they couldn't continue with the case, they dropped the case. And since that time, because of the action of Philip Zimmermann, software became classified as a form of speech. And cryptography became widely available. It's now reason why cryptography is available everywhere.

Also, in early 90s, Stallman has started to piece together his operating system. And by now a community a community of people has emerged around him. It was the birth of Linux - a really important piece of technology. Not just in the free technology world, but in general, in hi-tech space it place a very key role. And that was a rise of the whole bunch of movements: free software movement, hacker movement, crypto-anarchist movement. Movements were invigorated with creating a lot of new ideas and a lot of new concepts about how we could use the technology to shape the world around us. These were collective movements driven by the shared sense of purpose.

Towards the end of the 90s (the baby boomer generation), the western society became overly optimistic. Something the Jean Baudrillard called 'the dead of society' and 'obsession with desert-like forms / with the simulacrum'.

Stallman free software movement failed to capitalize on institutionalizing his movement. And what happen was what emerged was the open source movement. It was a movement that said: making this technology is not a question of freedom/ethics, it's simply when you have access to source code of a program it's more efficient, it's cheaper, it makes more quality code. I don't think that's true, but that was their argument. One of the main spokesmen was Eric Raymond who released a book called 'A cathedral and a bazaar'. In that book, Eric Raymond has described the open source development philosophy as open bazaar where everybody, dozens or hundreds of people, a wide number of people all collaborated in a horizontal manner. He coined an idea that given enough eyes all bugs are shallow. When we have a piece of source code, if there are enough people - all contributing a small amount of time and looking at the source code - then if there is a bug, that bug will be found. The idea that given a huge amount of people with a small amount of contribution of each, that we can develop projects and advance technology.

Then what happened was the biggest event in the modern western history - which was the collapse of the twin towers, the twin idols of capitalism, perfect in a reflections, reaching into the skyline of New York - which realized our deepest most hidden desires to see the destruction of this passive lifeless world. And what it represented was the return of the real (of the) dark forces - that we ignored - back to penetrate into our reality.

In early 2000s we saw a lot of optimism and momentum for change. We saw the Arab spring, we saw The occupy, we saw the orange revolutions. In the technology world, we saw a lot of advances, there was a huge amount of optimism for Linux on the desktop. Every year the people were saying: this is going be the year of the desktop. Everybody was waiting for that sudden single breakthrough. One of the major developments in technology world was the confrontation that took place between Hollywood and a Manhattan programmer called Bram Cohen. ((...)) He developed BitTorrent. The concept started with sites like Napster or Kazaa - that were centralized services that were shut down by authorities.

Cohen came up with a concept: if enough people downloading files and seeding them at the same time - then the more people that download the file the more that file will become widely distributed in the network. So, that file will become shared in a self-regulating network. It was a big success and the movie studios didn't know what to do about this, they were completely powerless in face of this technology. The idea of creating a functional self-regulating system outside of power proved itself and it's something wildly popular among technologists.

The next major development is the shutdown of the Pirate bay which led to the development of the Pirate party that at one point had double digits in elections and even entered into the EU parliament. There is huge momentum behind it. Wikipedia was also developed - the idea that given thousands and thousands of people all contributing small edits, one line at time, could build this huge knowledge resource . Around this movements started to emerge the new priests of this internet-centric decentralization technology - people like Yochai Benkler, academics who would go to conferences and sell this ideology to people.

But something strange started to emerge. Wikipedia released statistics about edits on Wikipedia. We found that it was a small group of dedicated people that wrote the majority of Wikipedia, people who really believed in the project and spent all their time writing the majority of the articles on the website. When we started to look closer at these decentralized systems, what we observed was small groups of leaders surrounded by a wider community. In BitTorent, it wasn't that everybody was seeding in the network. Most people, after they downloaded, didn't continue to run the software. In fact, it was a small group of users, who wanted to challenge Hollywood and promote BitTorrent, who would leave their software running seeding torrents.

In open source, we observed that there were small groups of dedicated developers in a project surrounded by wider community. And in fact, what Stallman has done was not just to write Linux and put that in the community, but he had written articles, he had written manifestos, he had put forward a vision and an ideology that pulled together enough people and drove this movement of hackers forwards.

So what drove these projects for freedom was not a new model or a new technique. It was a vision that pulled together enough people to realize an idea. To understand why Occupy and Arab Spring and orange revolutions and the Pirate Party and a lot of these movements had a huge of amount of will and movement - fail, it's really instructive to understand what happened to Egypt. In Egypt, huge amounts of youths started to mobilize through Facebook and they started to go to this center in Cairo to front the military dictatorship. Huge amount of people died in that struggle. And after they threw out ((?)) the military dictatorship, the youth then sat down and said: ""Okay, now what we are gonna do? What's next?"". So they started to discuss.

And into that, came a group of people, with a vision, with an ideology, that was well organized and able to pull together enough strands of the society behind them. But they could put their vision into power. And that was the Muslim Brotherhood.

And then the same youth hood - that kicked out the military dictatorship - came back to the square to ask the military dictatorship to come back and rescue them from the Islamists.

At the same time, Satoshi developed Bitcoin. I remember on Satoshi's early website he described it as a peer-to-peer form of money that cannot be controlled by central banks and governments. And it's something that attracted libertarians, cryptographers and hackers. Bitcoin is kind of a technology - free technology project - that was a little late to the party. Interestingly, it finds itself in the same place as the movements that preceded it. The fundamental problem with Bitcoin is not a problem of missing this or that technology, it's a problem of a lack of vision, a lack of how this technology is -

And it's not just about Bitcoin - it's something to do with the wider technology movement. We have to understand the global situation now. Humanity is facing a future with a huge amount of suffering. We are facing the threats from terrorism, from immigration. There's the rise of new ideological movements - ISIS just went and took a city in southern Philippines for more than a month - which is right next to Indonesia, the biggest Muslim country in the world. And in Europe the new right movement is getting very strong, organizing training camps, becoming well-organized, getting into political power and well-funded. This is the reality of our situation now.

We have to think about how this technologies that we make -, where do they situate themselves in the wider global context.

In Rojava, there is also a really important movement with the ideology of democratic confederalism which is the way forward from anarchism. And offers a really good analysis of what is the current society and what is the crisis that we're facing. And how, in that place, revolutionaries from all over the world are going to learning the methodology and ideology of this movement. It's a new emerging movement outside of any one person's control, but new forces can be harnessed. What we have to understand is that anarchist movement and the hacker movement is something deeply connected. The problem with anarchism is that it failed in it's potential to advance humanity forward, it's simply an ideology that no longer is able to work. What we have in Rojava is a libertarian revolution of 5 million people. What is democratic confederalism? It's an ideological movement that opposes the state as a mechanical worldview and sees the nature as something that is divine, that seeks to restore the balance back between internal+subjective and external+material world. The freedom comes from reaching our destiny as human beings, not simply through pleasure seeking. (Liberalism is the destruction of the free society.) And the better humanity it's not simply a happier humanity but stronger freer humanity. The crisis in the West not simply an economic crisis, but social crisis - we're facing a deep cultural issue.

All of the ideas in hacker movement - such as BitLaw, digital governance, cryptographic economy, decentralized organization, new economic models, new technical tools - unless we are able to take all of these concepts and put them into a plan, with a sense of direction, that we can put these into practice - then it's something that's going to be lost. Now, what's presenting itself is a massive opportunity for hackers to put their ideas into practice.

So, right now we are building a hacker team. There's 3 tasks we have to do: study of all the ideas and concepts in technology. From this study we have to develop a long- term plan. And thirdly, we have to devote ourselves to build the technical base of this new emerging democratic confederalism movement, we have to create revolutionary hackers dedicated to the course. If we don't, then all of the technology we are making is outside of the society, it's a toy, and what is relevant in this world is not making new products to fill the spaces in the environment around us, but using technology to shape politics that influence the world around us.

This revolution in North Syria or Rojava is the biggest opportunity in the entire history of modernity. Through this we can give direction to the hacker movement. One of our main projects is a Bitcoin project. We have a nation of 5 million people and - and - and there is a financial situation where they're under financial embargo, they use - , they don't have the financial infrastructure so they use paper money and Syrian Lira is inflating massively. Because there's embargo so you can't send money in and out. Also there is a project to create decentralized economy and there's a lot of real concrete uses for Bitcoin. And also the ideology of the revolutionary nation is in line with the vision and values of the Bitcoin.

When we decide to look at deploying Bitcoin, what we realize is that Bitcoin is not ready and there's a lot of new things that need to be developed in Bitcoin, they should make it so it's able to be deployed on a scale of 5 million people. We are assembling a project to deploy Bitcoin as the national currency of Rojava. We want to create new products in practical use on a large scale. Products that solve real problems and serve the cause of freedom.

Towards this goal, we're assembling a team of 20 hackers dedicated for two years. We're looking to establish links with companies and sponsors to make this happen. The first step is to establish a hacker's academy in Greece - to train groups of revolutionary self-sufficient hackers that we're going to deploy on projects. Our needs now: partners, sponsors, space, support. 

Our first plan is to setup exchange shops and localized wallets in Bitcoin where people come buy vouchers and use Bitcoin to create a local Bitcoin market. We have to create brochures, lots of information. Once this system gets bigger, then we also need to think of bigger financial infrastructure - so one of the things is paper wallets. At the moment, 100 thousands paper wallet cost $6000. Unfortunately the counterfeiting measures on the paper wallets aren't very well made. There needs to be a lot research done. There is a small USB device called ESP 12 which can be programmed with micro Python and C and it has on-board Wi-Fi, plus you can fit modules for radio. Through that you can create a large scale payments networks with cheap consumer devices that cost fie dollars each for people to transact bitcoins.

There is also a big market for Bitcoin because sending money between Rojava and Istanbul currently costs 5 %. Later, we also can create plastic card system where we print cards and also establish payments network using radio systems. There needs to be a lot of development and investigations in Lightning Networks and other technologies.

This is why I [want to ((?))] have a laboratory - if I take a group of people there - I can create all kinds of technology projects and a lot of concepts we've been theorizing for a long time. We can see that it works practically.


There is also the project of the Pirates to create liquid democracy - there is a system of local councils in every neighborhood which  - , a lot of these digital platforms that have been developed for many years - we can deploy them. There was also the economy being based on cooperatives - all of the ideas about economic management, about collective management of resources about using cryptography and currencies to manage cooperatives. These all things we can deploy - but what it's going to take is a group of people who's doing this research, who's going deep - not only in terms of developing new concepts - but looking back into the literature about what were - , what is the history of the movement, where we situated it and also what are the concepts and how we can apply them towards our goal.

personalfinance,60-70K Equity in Home - Want to sell and downsize to put most of that equity into a smaller older home.,"Background: My wife and I moved into our current home 4 years ago. We got the house right before the market in our area started to skyrocket. A nice starter home, built in 2003 it is about 2400sqft with a beautiful landscaped front, side and back yard. We ended up not needing all this space and it mainly collects stuff. Currently our house is probably worth around 230-240K, we bought it at 176K a few years ago. I am basing my estimates off my neighbor who sold his house last year for 225K as a base model and ours is larger, upgraded and has more land. Zillow estimates it to be 235K.

We are thinking about selling this house and buying a much older and smaller house. We were thinking something like 1500sqft and built in the 70-80's. This way it most likely wouldn't be in a subdivision and it would be on its own lot on a backroad or old style neighborhood.

We were hoping to find something around 150-160K, which in looking seems to be accurate for the area. We figured after closing cost(buy/sell) and moving we would have 40-50K remaining(cautious estimate) to put as a down payment on this house. This would get rid of the PMI which we currently pay, and also lower the cost of the mortgage significantly. Allowing us to save more money each month and over the years. 

We are not sure if this is a bad decision or a good one. On paper it seems like the right thing to do, but moving into an older home is going to have its problems as well. 

Anyone done something like this before? I am calling our real estate agent later today, but I just wanted to get a hang on other peoples experiences. 

EDIT: UPDATE 1: I just got off the phone with the mortgage company. We can refinance to get rid of the PMI. This will save us roughly $176 a month. Also a lower interest rate. The total combined savings per year at the quoted estimate was $3500. Which we will put into other investments. All around we think we might just stay here now. That is significant savings over the next 10 years.  Thanks for help and ideas peoples.

EDIT: UPDATE 2: I had a lengthy discussion with my real estate person, who is very good and has worked this area for the last 15 years. She estimates our house would sell for 245K in the current market. Which brings the total equity up to 88K. This changes things a good bit. As if I estimate closing cost and fees as 25K(selling/buying). This still leaves us with 63K cash after sell. Take 13K of that for moving or what ever and put whatever doesn't get spent into savings later. The other 50K goes directly into a down payment for a house in the 150-160K range. Talking 700-800 dollar monthly mortgage.",finance

&gt; **Wal-Mart**: The big-box retailer announced that this year it will be giving its existing employees the opportunity to work extra hours during the holiday season, rather than offering those hours to seasonal workers. ""These extra hours will help staff traditional roles like cashier and stocker, and newly created technology-empowered positions such as personal shoppers and Pickup associates,"" said Judith McKenna, Walmart's chief operating officer. Meantime, retail rival Target is bringing 100,000 temporary workers on board ahead of the holidays.

I'm going to be getting a used car in the next few days. I have pretty decent credit (755). My wife has less than stellar credit (somewhere in the low 600s). Would her cosigning, and paying on time, help her credit rating? Would it increase our interest rate for the loan?

personalfinance,Setting up my life. What standing am I good in?,"Okay so here's the break down. Can someone please advise me on what I should be doing or if I'm in the right path and what I should change. 

Also I'm happy to do the research just point me the right way! I get very confused in my google search. 

So here it is:

I am 22 years old. 
I bring home $2,000 every month after taxes. 
Each month I have expenses of around $1000. 
That's including food and a little fun too. 
I have a car loan of about $12,000,  2.99% interest at $230 a month (included in my 1000$ of expenses.) 
I have $2,000 on a credit card (Just Moved) but I have 0% interest rate for the next 17 months on it so I am paying it off.  
I have about 50,000$ in student loans and am finishing my degree online while working full time. I will graduate in a year and a half with about 80,000 in student loans altogether. Right now they are deferred. 

I would also like to save some liquid cash on the side, I only have about $1,000 in a savings account. And I really want to start a 401k or Roth IRA because I hear how smart it would be to when I am so young. 

This is a jumbled mess and I will try editing for clarity but please give me advice on where I should go from here. 

I can't really get a better job for about a year and a half.

personalfinance,Feel like I'm not saving enough outside of retirement accounts -- is my current savings rate OK?,"Hey guys, throwaway account here just because some people know my main. Currently 27 y/o &amp; make a bit over $80K/yr in a very high COL area. I'm currently maxing my 401K (+2.5% employer match) and my Roth IRA -- and the current value of retirement accounts ~$70k combined. 

My savings account holds 6 months of expenses which serves as my de-facto emergency fund ($10k), so I'm prepared if I were to lose my job. 

Now my financial question comes into play -- I keep about ~$2k in my checking account which essentially hovers at that mark (+/- a few hundred each month), as my miscellanious spending and whatnot outweighs any additional savings. Should I be saving additional cash outside of what I'm already saving? 

I do have a few short term goals coming up, such as wedding in the next 3-4years, and perhaps a house in the next 6-7. If this is the case, should I cut back on retirement savings to fund these ventures? Or simply see if I can cut into my miscellaneous spending and save more (eating out, sports, concerts, etc.)? 

Thanks for your help/advice!

personalfinance,"Divorce impending, need help with credit repair for financial stability","Please help! I left my abusive spouse and took my one child, and need to get my finances in line. I have read so much on here and other internet sources, but now my head is swimming from overload.
 During the marriage my debt was ignored so “one of us could have good credit.” As the stay at home parent initially, my spouse didn’t want their income to pay my debt (mostly acquired while married). Yes, this was a horrid idea and an extra way to exert control over me, but here we are. I am lucky that my debt isn’t overwhelming, though my credit score is horrendous. 
My short term goal is to fix my credit score so I can rent a home and get a (used) car when my current one (16yo) finally dies. ***Stable housing and reliable transportation are my primary concerns as a single parent*** Beyond that, I would like to save an emergency fund and be able to buy a home as soon as possible. I live in a moderately high rent area (one bedroom apartments for $1100ish, no utilities included), with many two bedroom, move-in ready condos and single family homes to purchase in the $80-$120,000 range. 
I want to pay these debts, but I also need money for a lawyer and want to get my credit score up as fast as possible. An increase in credit score will help me rent independently, lower my car insurance, and help me finance a reliable car when repairing this car is no longer cost effective. This year I have had to put $1000 of my savings into repairing it. It has a moderate oil leak and the beginnings of a failing transmission, currently, but I am pushing through on those by topping up the oil frequently and driving minimally. 
 

Current situation:
I live with family, and can for a bit longer, not more than 6m to a year (their imposed limit)
Bills: Room/Board to Family: $425/m, Car insurance: $101/m, Gas: $75/m, Phone: $50/m Total: $651
Current savings: $1800 
Pay: $530 after taxes, weekly  
Credit Score: ~535 via Credit Karma/Credit Sesame. I have pulled full reports, as well.

Debt: 
$15,300 NAVIENT private student loan (defaulted, Opened 2/28/11, last payment 3/1/12, date of first delinquency 10/1/11, delinquency first reported 7/1/12)
$9700 US Dept of Edu loans (defaulted, date of first delinquency 2/1/13, delinquency first reported 3/1/14)
$708 LVNV Funding (defaulted HSBC credit card, date of first delinquency 6/1/11, delinquency first reported 8/1/16) This one has a date/’ “opened” 6/17/12 AFTER DoFD, so I’m assuming that was when it was sold?
$714 Local credit company owns (defaulted medical &lt;1year old)
$199 Local credit company owns (defaulted medical &lt;1year old)
I already disputed the CC debt, in the off chance it had been sold enough times to not be documented properly. It was validated by the creditor. Yes, this is my debt, however I have limited funds and am trying to make them stretch.
I already offered a 60% payoff of the medical debt, via letter, which they refused. I am unsure if I should offer 80% next, or offer 100% and try for pay for delete.
I disputed and had removed two medical debts that legitimately weren’t mine to pay (office had a dispute with the insurance company, and I guess my insurance never paid and I wasn’t notified. I would have continued to fight it with the insurance company if I realized that). They were removed from one agency, but not the other two. I will file disputes with the other two directly and hope they are removed as easily.

Plan: 
Get federal loans into rehab. Calculators put me at $18 - $128/month for that repayment. I just call 1(800)621-3115 to start that process, from what I can tell.
Pay medical debt, attempting pay for delete
Get a secured CC through my credit union (minimum $500 to open) to build credit score
Pay CC debt??? DofD 6/1/11
Rehab Navient loan??? DofD 10/1/11
Budget for Lawyer (~$1500 to start)
SAVE SAVE SAVE (Emergency fund and hopefully enough to buy a reliable car outright instead of finance if mine lasts that long)

Questions, because I’ve read lots of conflicting information:

For the items nearing falling off my credit report (Navient loan and defaulted CC), should I wait, or pay? I read that paying will not actually raise my credit score, and it will bring the debts current, possible making my score actually worse. Is the 7y (or is it 7y+6m?) started at DofD? Will they actually just fall off, or do I need to add a few months to that timeline to request them off? I know I won’t be able to get a mortgage with any defaults, so an exact date of fall-off will help me decide if “saving” the $15,000 is worth waiting out an additional year or so for that.  It’s beyond the statute of limitations to be sued, from what I understand. 

If I choose to wait for the Navient loan to age off my credit report, and bring my score up all other ways possible (pay other outstanding debts, secured CC for positive reporting account, get federal loan into rehab, open to other ideas), should I be able to get it high enough rent an apartment/finance a used car? I am not sure if those places tend to look at the credit number only, or the whole file.  
With the money I currently have and coming in ($1800 plus ~$350 savings a week), what order should I tackle this to maximize returns? Pay all debt first to start aging the bad credit off my account? Get a secured credit card immediately and pay just the medical debt immediately and save up a few weeks to pay the old CC debt (if I shouldn’t age it off)? Save up to $XXX amount and then start paying/get a secured card so I have some funds on hand for my crappy car? 
Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some advice. This is such a stressful time already, so starting to claw myself to financial stability will take a lot of the stress off me to focus on this impending divorce and custody case.",finance
personalfinance,Should I consolidate a student loan? (CAN),"I recently applied for a 0% interest credit card that I plan on transferring my current credit card over to. I owe $4200 on my card.

I've never used a credit card to pay off a loan before so I'm uncertain if its recommended or not.

CryptoCurrency,"Central bank of Sweden is looking into adding a digital ""E-Crown"" in 2018 to reduce dependency on current payment systems.","Source in Swedish from the Central bank of Sweden (Riksbank): http://www.riksbank.se/sv/Finansiell-stabilitet/Betalningar/Behover-Sverige-en-e-krona/E-kronaprojektets-forsta-delrapport/


&amp;nbsp;


Translated to English via Google Translate: 

&amp;nbsp;

""__E-krone project's first interim report__


The Riksbank investigates whether it is possible to issue a digital supplement to cash, so-called e-kronor, and if such a complement could support the Riksbank in the task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system. This is not a unique situation; On several occasions, the state has had to consider its role in the payment market when it changed. An e-crown has the potential to counter some of the problems that may arise on a future payment market when cash use is decreasing rapidly.
An e-crown would provide the public with access to a state-guaranteed digital cash supplement, and several payment service providers could join the e-krone system. Today, the Riksbank offers only participants in RIX digital payments. By operating freely from the infrastructure used by the commercial banking system, the e-crown system could also make the payment system more robust in the event of any malfunctioning, for example, in the card payment system.

&amp;nbsp;

__Cash usage decreases__


During the 21st century, we have seen in Sweden that cash use decreased while card payments and, in recent years, Swish have become more common. The proportion of cash payments in trade has decreased from close to 40 percent in 2010 to about 15 percent in 2016. Two out of three consumers say they can handle cash and as many people use mainly cards for payments under 100 kronor. Sweden can become a society in which a cash can no longer be widely used. The development of the Swedish payment market is unique in an international perspective.

&amp;nbsp;

__The digitization trend can have undesirable effects__


The development is part of a larger digitalization trend in society and a move towards a payment service in Sweden, conducted entirely privately and concentrated on a few commercial actors, payment services and infrastructure. In the long term, this concentration may hamper competition in the market and make society vulnerable.
 
The development towards an almost cashless society also means that households have small opportunities to save and pay in risk-free central bank money and this can greatly contribute to reduced resilience in the payment system. We are also aware that there are special groups that currently do not have the ability to use digital payment solutions or simply prefer cash over other means of payment. For these groups it is important that society can offer alternatives in the same way that the Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) is responsible for ensuring that the public's needs for basic payment services are met.


In a situation of crisis or financial concern, when demand for cash is assumed to increase, even if there would be a preparedness at the Riksbank, it would take a long time to get the distribution of cash to different actors to work. In case of system malfunctions, there is a risk that there would be no quick available standalone options, such as cash today.

__A register-based e-crown that is complemented by a value-based e-crown__


A register-based and value-based e-crown is presented as two possible models for an e-crown. With a register-based e-crown, credit is stored centrally on accounts in a database, while a value-based solution is more like today's cash because the value is stored locally in an app or on a card. The assessment today is that a simple value-based solution would have a more limited development potential than a registry-based solution, but it could possibly be introduced faster. A registry based solution is considered to be more complex, but at the same time offers greater opportunities to gradually expand the model and make adjustments to future requirements. The project proposes a combination of both models, where a registry-based solution is complemented by a value-based e-crown that is primarily suitable for smaller payments offline. With the value-based solution, the e-crown becomes more accessible to groups who can not or do not want e-crown accounts and the solution can be further developed to meet the needs of specific groups for basic payment services.

&amp;nbsp;

__The technology selection needs to be investigated__


Which technique would work best for an e-crown is a question that will be investigated further within the project. Both new and more proven technology may be relevant, as well as cooperation with both authorities and private actors.

&amp;nbsp;

__Limited effects on monetary policy and financial stability__


In a preliminary analysis of the consequences of an e-krone, according to the report's concept, could have for monetary policy as well as the payment market and financial stability, no strong barriers to introducing an e-krone have been identified. We assume that the monetary policy system is adapted to a new reality. The Riksbank provides the amount of banknotes and coins that the public and the market demand""

__My own thoughts:__


Speaking as a Swede this is hardly surprising as we've been going towards an almost totally cashless society the last 10 years. About 5-6 years ago I paid with [iZettle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZettle) at a small flea market way out in the boonies (for those that don't know iZettle is an addon-device that allows you to take card payments via your iPhone via a dongle (at the time), receipts via email) and this has become fairly commonplace around the country.


&amp;nbsp;

There's still plenty unknown and I don't think that our central bank would ever make a product that could compete with the already existing cryptos. This is just some info that a country that's on the forefront of new tech (heard of Spotify or perhaps Skype?:D) have started seeing the potential of a cryptocurrency. Exciting times ahead!

personalfinance,"Sitting on some money, looking for investment advice","My wife and I sold our first home for a decent profit and were able to deposit 100k in our bank after all was said and done. We've been sitting on this money in an ally bank savings account earning around 1.2%. Our only debt at the moment is 2 car loans, each with low interest rates (2.99 and 3.5%), and our new house payment if you count that. We are both putting away 20% of our income into our 401k's (plus a 4% match from employer) each month and I have a Roth IRA that I max out each year. 

I'd like to take a chunk of the money earned from selling our house and invest it, I'm just not sure what the best way to go about this would be. I intend to meet with a financial adviser my parents use and they've really enjoyed working with to get his input as well. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"After 5 years of trying, wife is finally pregnant! In the interim, we both got pretty fed up with baby fever and became fairly financially irresponsible. Help me fix everything in the next 9 months please!!!","&gt; *Sorry about the long read; this is the most important moment in my life and I don't want to mess it up, so I wanted to make sure you have the ENTIRE story. Scroll down to the formatted text under my intro if you just want to see the numbers.*

Okay guys, I'm gonna do my absolute best here to help you help me. Obviously, I'm very much a novice when it comes to any kind of money management, but I'm a quick learner when motivated so please just be blunt and be patient with me.

So I have been poor my whole life, except for the last 5 years (I'm 35). I moved A LOT. I went to 13 different schools from kindergarten to graduation, and am on my 26th address of my life. There was a new guy beating on my mom every few years the entire way. 

What I'm trying to say is that was I born and raised in chaos, and there was not much room for anything but survival. That's where I come from and I'm pretty sure that's what I revert to when things get difficult.

Okay so boo hoo. Whatever, that's just context. 

So ten years ago I met my wife, stopped fucking around and went back to school to have a chance with her (she has since become a doctor of physical therapy), and eventually (after a couple of tries) graduated with a degree in education. 

Five years ago we got married and I got my first teaching job, and instantly I was part of a $120k/year household and had stability for the first time in my life.

Unfortunately, things didn't go to plan.

We never did have a baby, and it turned out my job was THE WORST JOB I'VE EVER HAD. I have absolutely hated it since I've been here, and I became miserable and (likely clinically) depressed. I started drinking a lot to work up the nerve to go back the next day. I started overeating and gained back half of the large amount of weight I lost. 

Meanwhile, my wife and I also both seemed to independently come to the conclusion that **""fuck it, if I can't have a baby, I'll have/do/go whatever/wherever I want!""**

We have both been spending like crazy and have saved almost nothing. She has a good $25k savings that she's had forever, but it hasn't grown.

We have some cool shit though!

Not only have I not saved anything, I've actually gotten myself into much worse debt. I borrowed an extra $30k over a few semesters of grad school that I never finished, and used it to pay off other credit cards (effectively rolling credit card debt into student debt, which sounded good when I thought it was all just gonna be forgiven in 10 years anyway).

However, here is where I should be clear about something- **I don't regret anything.**

You may or may not know how difficult infertility issues can be on a couple, but it wreaked havoc on our psyches for a while. Our sex life became an ongoing science experiment with guaranteed monthly disappointment.

Eventually she stopped telling me the results.

I watched one-by-one as every baby announcement tore my wife apart.

My wife had to look at the pain in my eyes when I couldn't help her.

We were both so hurt by each other's pain.

I came from a very poor, very chaotic home. She came from about as opposite as there could be. We were both very unhappy, *but we never left each other's side*.

**I say I don't regret anything because we SURVIVED it.** We both went off the deep end in our own ways, but stuck together and never ONCE let this pain come between us. Sometimes couples aren't that lucky, but we did it. Also, we have some cool shit and great memories to show for it.

So yes, we did do a number on our finances, and I'm definitely not PROUD of the situation we've put ourselves in, but we are alive and well and make plenty of money and ARE HAVING A BABY, so it's time to just start looking forward! 

It's obvious where we went wrong; we just want to know how to change it right now, today, in order to be ready in 9 months!

So here it is, but before we start- I'm cranking the difficulty level up to 11 with my next statement.

**I'm quitting my job.**

I understand that this may seem like the most irresponsible thing possible, and even after I explain some still won't get it, but it's happening.

My job is poisonous and is ruining my mental and physical health. I've been ""coping"" with it for years, but I can NO LONGER AFFORD to cope the way I have been. I WILL NOT bring a baby into anything resembling my childhood ""home"", and staying at a job where I'm a miserable prick who drinks and eats too much is not what's best for my family.

Getting this job and having plenty of money for the first time in my life is probably the number one factor in my getting in such dire straights to begin with, and certainly didn't help me learn anything about financial responsibility.

So I'm quitting in 30 days. I will be happier and healthier, and I can FINALLY put some real work into my freelance writing career. Because I was making so little as a teacher ($40k), there's a good chance I can replace my entire income within a year, and maybe even do better!

So I'm asking for help on how to budget all of this with just my wife's income, and then once I have an idea of how much I average freelancing full-time, I can adjust it.

Here's everything I have right now, I'll update as needed.

And also- thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

**Wife's Income:** $85k/year, but for some reason only brings home about $4,300/month. Is this normal, or should we change something?

**Wife's Student Loans:** About $85k

**My Student Loans:** About $136k (!!!)

**Mortgage Principal:** $118,222

**Estimated Home Value:** $150k-160k (almost bought a new house this summer!)

**CA Dream Vacation Credit Card Balance:** $4,600 at 0% until 9/2018

**Phones:** $135/mo (6 month avg)... this is mostly data and can be reduced greatly by just *trying*.

**Power:** $95/mo (6 month avg)

**Cable/Internet:** $165/mo (contract)

**Car Insurance:** $100/mo (paid annually)

**Mortgage:** $1,022/mo (we round it up to $1,200 every month)

**Water:** $50/mo

**Groceries:** $400/mo 

**Wife's Car:** $245/mo (lease)

**My Car:** $210/mo (lease)

**Total Gas:** $250/mo (should be greatly reduced once I quit)

**Wife's Student Loans:** $575/mo (will change with household income change)

**My Student Loans:** $390/mo (will change with household income change)

**Diapers/Supplies:** $100/mo (estimate)

**Nursing/Formula:** $200/mo (estimate)

Okay so that's everything! How much can we improve our situation in the next nine months?

personalfinance,Help get started with some financial planning.,"Hello r/personalfinance,

My after looking over some of mine and my fiance's finances I realized I needed some help getting things all squared away in a way I can easily understand and explain to her and was wondering if you fine folks might have some advice.

I bring in about 1100 dollars every other week and she gets paid about 750-950 depending on her overtime for a grand total of about 3700-4100 dollars a month. 

Water is paid through our landlord with rent for a total of $860 a month, cable and internet is $215 dollars a month, electricity is about 100-130 dollars a month and tends to be higher in the summer, and insurance is 35 dollars a month. Groceries are about 75 dollars a week and gas is on our own. 

We have some shared debt, a loan through our credit union ($3340 at 7% interest for a term of 4 years.) and an unsecured credit card through a local furniture retailer ($1040 at 0% financing for 12 months with 9 months left.) We pay $100 dollars a month on the loan and $140 a month on the card and have plans to pay this debt off within the allotted time frames. I also feel like I should mention we have about 1700 dollars in *unnecessary* expenses (read: extras she and I want but do not need and can cancel if necessary) for the wedding left to pay for. 

Our biggest problem right now is credit card debt. Luckily, I've recently come into some money to help pay down almost all of my personal debt and now only really owe my share of our shared debt. My fiance is a little bit of a different story, she has a little over $1200 dollars in credit card debt on a student card. Not entirely sure of the particulars as far as interest rate there but I was able to give her some of the money in order to pay it down from the over $2000 dollars it was. She's working herself to death to try and make payments to bring it down and I'm hoping this will take some of the burden off of her. 

Based on my calculations that leaves about 1750 a month left ""unbudgeted"" but on average we spend about 500-750 between the two of us on food, gas, and entertainment. I want to start squirreling away more money now that I'm not paying a bunch on credit cards but I'm wondering if it would be better for us to really focus hard on paying down her debt first. What would you all suggest?",finance

personalfinance,Should I notify current manager that I am interviewing for another department within my organization?,"Long story short, I work hard. I know it, my co-workers know it, my managers know it -they constantly praise me, etc.

I work public sector so I have good union protections, but unfortunately my current department has been cutting back on hirings and job promotion positions so I'm looking to jump to another department.

I SHOULD have been promoted, but they eliminated the last 3 senior positions I would have been able to be promoted to.

They also take advantage of how hard I work, for my lower position's paygrade (I'm essentially doing the work of BOTH my job level AND one of the eliminated senior positions. . . Without the higher position's pay increase).

Now I have an interview during work hours, which I can take off, no problem. . . **Should I notify them exactly why I'm taking the time off?** That their workhorse (as they've refered to me as) is potentially leaving and this will cause quite a large void in the department that is already short-staffed.

Would this be beneficial like a *""if you really want to keep me (you've told me how valuable I am), you'd better fight for me and offer me that promotion.""*. . . Or should I stay mum and just let them find out when I give notice?

I really like my current work and co-workers, it's just annoying that they keep eliminating promotional senior positions with each retirement/transfer/promotion. . .and when eliminating these positions, they just have us working more for less pay (i.e. doing the work that was typically done by the eliminated person's position) . . .

Also wondering if this would be beneficial if I turned down the other position or wasn't accepted.

Is knowing ""i'm looking elsewhere"" something I want them to know? Will that help or hurt interdepartmental promotional offers?

Will they feel scorned and spite me or get worried and lock me down with a promotion. Not worried about getting fired/let go -they can't do that. . . But they COULD make my job a living hell so that I'd want to quit.

personalfinance,"[Debt] Poor decisions were made, now I have $95k in (mostly private) student loan debt and make less than half that per year.","Hi everyone, as the title explains I made a lot of uneducated choices when going to/financing college, I like to think I have lived and learned from that. Now I'm 25 and fed up with being in debt and I'm seeking advice on how to get debt-free so I can build an emergency fund, eventually own a home, and accrue some wealth.

I owe about $95k in loans, with only about $12k being low-interest government loans. The biggest chunk of my debt is $44k to Wells Fargo at a rate of 7.99%. I currently pay the minimums on the loans rounded up to the nearest hundred dollar amount (about $20 more per loan).

Currently I make about $45k a year (before tax) working 50+ non-salary hours per week in a non-degree field. I pay $450 in rent and utilities, spend less than $200 on food, and have been reining in my hobby/entertainment expenses (working with my long distance girlfriend to further decrease these expenses).

personalfinance,Why do robo-advisors recommend such an aggressive allocation in muni-bond funds?,"[Here's a sample allocation for a low-risk, taxable Betterment portfolio.](https://imgur.com/CXa5vyP) 28.5% of the portfolio is allocated muni-bonds. [MUB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239766/ishares-national-amtfree-muni-bond-etf) (iShares National Muni Bond ETF) has an SEC yield 1.59% and a duration of 6.15 years. I'm willing to bet the majority of robo-advisor users aren't in the top tax bracket so let's plug 28% as the average marginal rate. This puts us at a [tax equivalent yield of 2.2%](https://imgur.com/a/ujYAw). There is a very marginal lift from state taxes. If you happen to live in California, [about 20% of the fund's yield is tax exempt](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimpJS29bTWAhWI6IMKHUdzBCcQFggyMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ishares.com%2Fus%2Fliterature%2Ftax-information%2F2016-ishares-tax-exempt-interest-by-state-is-20081-0117.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzD3vLz06bBtE77mGpv1lMwP8Wyw). Overall, not enough to move the needle.

Let's contrast this with a taxable fund like VCSH, the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF. VCSH has a pre-tax SEC yield of 2.11% and a duration of 2.8 years. After tax, let's ballpark the yield at 1.52% (1-28% * 2.11%). 

MUB has over twice the duration for only .68% more yield. If interest rates tick up more than expected over the next year or so, those holding MUB will take a bath. 

Credit risk is always a factor when considering investments in bonds. VCSH has about 85% of it's portfolio in A-BBB securities, with an average maturity of 3 years. Overall very secure. MUB has 70% of it's portfolio in A-AA securities with an average maturity of 5.5 years. From this standpoint, I'd say the difference in credit quality is a wash.

So...is MUB an effective investment? Should it command nearly 30% of a low risk robo-advisor portfolio? It seems like a disproportionate amount of risk for a marginal lift in yield.",finance

Store X is the original big account
Store Z is the new account opening their 3rd store on same account

How can i make the correct decision to who i should go forward with.

Store x has great credit, and buys a lot of goods from me to be considered a top 10 account, but also has a 10% discount on all orders. His store is also like a stuffed bazar gift shop look.

Store z has decent credit, buys a lot of goods from me to be considered a top 10 account, his store has a more upscale look and pays full price.

personalfinance,Should I keep my current car or upgrade to the car I want to drive?,"Information:

I'm 26 years old.

I live at home and have no desire to move out any time soon.

I have a full-time job, making $15.45 per hour as an Excel analyst (~$32k per year). Or $2.7k per month gross. I put 20% into my 401k each paycheck (they match 4%), allow the government to take 18% each paycheck in taxes (I get a portion of it back when filing) and $20 into a HSA (employer matches), so I end up with $1.65k net each month. I can obviously lower my 401k contribution in the future if need be.

I have a bachelors degree, and am currently in a part-time masters program paid for fully by my employer.

My monthly expenses are a $100 cable bill, about $80 a month in car insurance, $40 in cell phone bill, and $200 in miscellaneous (gas, grocery shopping, etc.). I usually spend about $100 a month on ""fun"" as well, although that's obviously not a required expense.

My assets include $32k in liquid cash bank accounts, $18k locked in various financial investments returning about 2.5% per year, $10k in various stocks, a $6k 401k, my car and various other less material accounts and items.

My only big additional expense coming up will be a trip to Vegas next year, which I estimate will be between $1.5k-2k.

I currently own (full-outright) a 2012 Ford Focus with 56k miles on it. I have had transmission issues last year and my mechanic told me I'll need to replace the tires and have a brake job done soon, but no mechanical issues with it this year so far.

I saw a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro SS with 50k miles on that I'm interested in. It's $15k ask, I figure I'd offer $14.5k. Hypothetically, if that was accepted, I'd be looking at about $15.5k total up front (including taxes, plate transfer fees, insurance premium increase). I'd sell my car, which should net me $5k. My parents said they'd give me $3k towards it. I'd put up $2.5k myself, and finance additional $5k (because I want to keep my liquid cash as a safety net) for two years at a 4% interest rate (I'd end up paying about $250 in interest). 

I really like the car, but the adult part of me is telling me this is a bad idea and I should just keep my boring Focus.

11) My debt is around 3k

12) If I sell the apartment, I would have a net of 200k after fees.


Now with all that in mind, I want to figure out what's best financially. Currently I feel that the monthly payments are eating me up, but I don't know if its a good idea to stay and simply look at it as a long-term investment or sell it and with the 200k, put 80k down on a 400k house, put 20k to finish the house and invest the remainder 100k.

Another option is to try and refinance the mortgage, because currently out of the $1800, only $582 is going to the principal.

Any help is welcome. Thanks!

personalfinance,Auto Loan Question To refinance or not,"Good evening PF. I was hoping someone could take a look at my car loan and give me an option on what i should do. Bought a used 2012 Jeep Liberty from a dealership back in August. Just made my first payment on it 264.10. This is a 60 month loan. Currently the total owed on the loan is 13,310 with a 6.54% interest rate. When I went to the dealership i was not planning on taking a car home that day but was just looking so I didn't have any financing lined up. I was told my credit score is 840. Im wondering if I would be able to refinance and get a lower payment or a lower interest rate. I have a application in with rategenius to see what they can do for me. Could someone point in me in the right direction on what i should do? Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Car Payment(s): Is it worth it to refinance?,"Backstory: Had a 2007 MINI Cooper, that I planned on lasting me throughout college. However, it unexpectedly pooped out on me, leaving me stranded and on the hunt for a new vehicle. Wanting something reliable, I called a friend who is a sales manager at a local dealership in my area. After talking to him and looking at my finances, I settled on a 2015 Mazda 3. Managed to get the car for around ~$13,000, as it only had 10,000 miles on it. Which is an exceptional deal. However, the lowest interest rate that I was able to obtain was 16%. It was my first time financing a car, as I payed cash for my MINI Cooper. I didn't obtain financing before this, as I assumed I would be able to obtain an interest rate in the 7-8% range.  I have a decent credit score, but I have no credit history. While I was shocked by this, I knew I could refinance in several months after I obtained a solid credit history. 

Now, after talking to several influential people in my life, I have a dilemma. I've been told several things: 
-Refinance immediately with my bank.(Car dealership didn't run my current bank, where I've been banking since I was 16. Currently 21) 
-Make on time payments for 3 months, and refinance. 
-Make on time payments for a year, and refinance. 

With this being said, has anyone had anything similar happen to them? What did you do, or what would you of done if you knew what you knew now. Any advice would be appreciated, as I'm looking to lower my monthly payments ASAP!",finance

I get that we should pay off the highest interest rate loans first but what moves, if any, should we make right now with the $10K in savings? How much should we put into loan payments and when should we start? Do we qualify for any loan forgiveness programs? Is it worth looking into refinancing options? 

-
We plan on living relatively frugally, but realistically, our expenses will go up in the next few years as we think about starting a family. Additionally, my current work does not offer a retirement savings program so ideally I'd like to start one but I don't know if it's the right time or not. However, I do have about $12K in a 401K from a previous job and I've opened a Roth IRA but haven't put any money in it yet.

Bitcoin,"What is the most ""correct"" way to use Bitcoin?","As with 79.82% of the arguments in this place, the question of whether hodlers are betraying the Holy Word of Satoshi Nakamoto because we won't actually use any of our Bitcoin to buy coffee, is too dichotomous. 

I'd suggest there's an emergent faction in this sub that seems to think BTC is being rekt because it is being hodled instead of spent on coffee. 

Of course by coffee we mean a ""casual transaction"". Chuck a few quarters on the counter, then mosey on out. Right? But the point is these hodler-haters talk as if the only two behaviours anyone here engages in are: pissing your BTC away on snacks, or never spending it never ever.

But ACTUALLY many of us evil hodlers DO spend our BTC. We just don't spend it every day and we don't spend it on trivial things. 

I don't spend BTC on very small purchases because it is a bit of a PITA right now, sure. But I do spend it on things worth a couple of hundred bucks, *because the merchant often offers a massive discount if I pay in BTC.* (I then go replace my BTC immediately with a fiat purchase on exchange.)

When I get 20% off, stacked on top of a 9% loyalty discount, on a $250 (Aussie) purchase, do I give a shit about a $4.27 tx fee? I do not! I don't even give a shit about the exchange fees for replacing the BTC! And when I am buying something online to be delivered to me, I also do not give a shit if the confirmation takes 5, 10, 40 or 90 minutes. Not that I'm saying we shouldn't try to speed the system up anyway. Just that... it IS actually usable, right now. For certain kinds of purchases.

People are referencing the white paper ""ew Satoshi said it has to be digital CASH so you have to spend it you can't hoard it greedy piggy ew"" but did they read the whole thing? Or just the Abstract?

What is literally the first sentence of the Introduction? 

&gt; Commerce on the internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties...

*Commerce on the internet*.

Does this mean ""online shopping"" or ""any transaction that utilises the network, even buying a $2 coffee with a VISA""? Well, that's the economics debate right there.

Later in the paragraph, in his criticism of the existing third-party-trust-dependent system, he says ""the cost of mediation [cuts] off the possibility of small casual transactions."" This might seem to imply that he also wanted BTC to work as nickels and dimes but... does it really suggest that? 

Does the original concept consider Bitcoin as ""walking around money""? Or does it define Bitcoin not as a solution for ALL money, but as a specific kind of money for when you want to buy stuff on the internet? Did Satoshi want to save us all from the evil Federal Reserve... or just from eBay scammers?

Personally I think BTC is whatever we want it to be, by consensus. But there are folks who want to tell me I am bad for not maintaining a constant, high-volume flow through my wallets because of ""the original vision.""

But if you are all about Satoshi's vision, you have to admit there's nothing in the white paper that says Bitcoin MUST be used for vending machines and bus fare. To me at least, it's pretty clear from the intro he is not picturing you in a coffee shop, he's picturing you on amazon.com.

I put it to you that if there is a One True Best Use of Bitcoin (as per the original vision, anyway), it is neither hodling, nor it is buying coffee and/or organic muffins. It is buying goods and services of moderate to high cost *specifically on the internet*. 

Of course, this entire position I take on the assumption people actually care about the white paper, or whether they consider the white paper a mere sketch. I must admit, I am totally ignorant in the matter of Satoshi's later pronouncements - if any. Did he later post saying ""actually guys, you are going to need to figure out a way to speed this shit up because I want to see y'all buying coffee with BTC when the timer on this cryo-pod hits zero.""

See this is what happens to religions. There's a text, a scripture, and some people are like ""no, we must only do what the words say"", and there are others who say ""but it's what the words IMPLY, not what they SAY."" And then there are other others who say ""fuck you guys, I wanna make bank.""

personalfinance,My company asked me if I was interested in moving to another country,"Hello All,

I work for a software company based out of Canada. The company develops software specifically for the hospitality industry. I work in their small satellite office in the Chicago, USA. Yesterday my boss (the VP) asked me if I would be interested in moving to their corporate office (Toronto) and form part of the team developing their European presence. The company has had some major growth the past two years and signed on a big client which has become their bread and butter.

On the surface I love this opportunity and would be able to grow professionally way more in their corporate office than I would in the small satellite office. My concerns are rooted in my financial positioning here in the USA. 

Both my wife and I work full time with no kids. I am 23 and she is 24. She has a good job and is working on her masters. Her job is currently paying for about 75%. By the time this move would happen she would be almost finished. 

Here is my financial breakdown

I earn 53,000 annually, my wife earns 41,000 (plus really good union benefits such as a pension, great tuition reimbursement, Fridays off in the summer, etc...)

We bought a condo 8 months ago for $179,000. We still owe 128,000. It’s a 15 year fixed with 3.5% interest rate. Mortgage payment is 1325.47 a month with 421.00 in HOAs. We have the option to rent it which would be ideal. It’s a 2bd 2bath that we could rent for 1700-1800 a month. 

We have 14,000 in savings, 15,000 in retirement, 33,000 in investments.

What should I be expecting from my company in terms of compensation for uprooting my life? Financially could I be hurting myself in the short term but positioning myself for better opportunities down the road? If they want me in Canada for only “X” amount of years then should I expect they cover my rent for at least the first year while my wife finds a new job and we get steady footing? Should I be renting in Canada or buying? 

I plan on waiting for them to make the first proposal of compensation and go from there. 


Edit: Wife’s masters program can be completed entirely online. 
Edit: Moving from Chicago to Toronto
Edit: More information on some details 

1. I am not sure if my wife’s tuition reimbursement has any sort of contingency on length of employment. All I know is she was eligible after one year of employment. 
2. My mortgage allows for non owner occupied after one year which will be in January of 2018. 
3. My father in law owns multiple properties and would likely assist with our current condo in terms of renting it. 
4. Up until now the company wasn’t big enough to warrant moving people around. There is no set policies on these sorts of moves. This is the first time an employee is being moved in the company.",finance

personalfinance,(Auto) Recent College Grad/3 Months into Employment Looking for a New Car (Buy/Lease),"Hey all,

I'm a 24 year old recent college graduate and I have been working as a consultant for about 3 months now. I have little to no debt besides a student loan that is around the lower $7k mark, 100% on-time payments on CC bills, and a salary that is in the upper $60k range. My credit is fluctuating due to having to stay in a hotel for 5 weeks for work and using up to 60% of my utilization to cover it, though I was reimbursed and paid it off. With that my credit rating fluctuates between 730-760.

I have a car that is a 2002 Mazda Tribute and is a V6. It has around 132,000 miles on it and ever since we got it we have had numerous problems that have caused us to sink a couple thousand dollars in repairs to keep it in service for my college years, (6 years to be exact). Among a number of issues, the one that stands out the most is the fact that in the slightest cold weather or not starting my car every couple of days when I'm traveling my engine has a hard time starting. This began to happen just over a year ago, maybe two, and has me worried for how I will make it to work during the upcoming colder months. We have had this looked at many times and replaced many things and it still has not fixed the issue. When I do have to go to the office and I'm not traveling to client sites the drive is about 20 miles each way. In either case, I have been looking at getting a new car for quite some time.

My question to you all is, should I finance a used car or finance/lease a new car? I have been eyeing a 2013-2017 model Grand Cherokee or a 2013-2017 Infiniti G37/Q50 coupe and have been filtering options by keeping it under 60k miles and LIST price of no more than $25k. The average price I have been finding is $22k and the right amount of mileage. As for financing/leasing new, I have been eyeing down the new Honda Accords as I know a lot of people who have been getting them recently and have been getting good deals and enjoying them. For all of these, I'm looking at a $1k trade-in value for my car and $3k - $4k of my own money to make a down payment. I would like to secure a monthly payment of less than $400 a month and hopefully less than 4% interest rate.

P.S. I am a 6'3"" male who has only driven SUVs as my car and would like to keep it that way if possible, coupes also offer the leg room I would like to have. I'm also a person who likes to drive and who lives far from home so having a comfortable ride is key as well.",finance

personalfinance,"Investment Advice-Whole Life,Brokerage,Roth IRA","Hi! I just graduated from college in May and I'm about 3 months into my career.  I'm looking for some advice on starting my financial portfolio and could really use some advice from someone with a little more knowledge.  I would usually go to my parents for this sort of thing but they never really have been the best with mid/long term investing.  I have been meeting with a financial adviser (Mass Mutual) who is also starting out his career (I went to high school with him).  He is being guided along the way by an older, more experienced adviser whom comes off to me as more of a salesmen than anything...  That is why I have my doubts on the whole thing.  Anyways, I initially met with them because I knew for a fact I wanted to start a Roth IRA and max it out annually.  I was also interested in doing some moderately conservative short/mid term investments through a mutual fund or something (Again, I'm not extremely educated from an investing standpoint). Along the way, the advisers have been trying to persuade me into investing into a Whole Life Insurance Plan.  I still have yet to wrap my head around the whole concept of it but basically what I see it as is an insurance policy that will get you fixed life insurance premiums and that will eventually begin to start paying out cash dividends.  My advisers imply that I will eventually be able to use these dividends (10-20 years into the future) as liquid money that I have access to.  I really just feel that they are so biased in the whole thing that they won't be completely honest about how beneficial a plan like this would actually be for me.  I was hoping to get some advice on whether or not a whole life plan with cash dividends will be a good investing vehicle for me right now.  They also suggested setting up a brokerage account right now through American Funds that I can use as a short/mid term investment fund, which I am actually leaning towards doing.  I think I would just do it through Vanguard, but I would also like some advice on that.  Other than that, they tried to talk my into some disability insurance, but I don't need any of that as I am pretty well covered through my work.  Any information would be greatly appreciated as I'm trying to establish my financial presence on a stable foundation for a successful future (Aren't we all? Haha)

FYI:

-22 single male

-$60,000 salary

-About $95,000 in student debt (I'm putting $1,000/mth towards my loans)

**EDIT $40,000 in federal student loans at a weighted avg rate of 4.42% and $54,000 private loans at a weighted avg of 6.69%**

-I rent (My rent is very cheap right now and I don't anticipate buying a home for at least 3 years, however, my rent could go up)

-My vehicle is old (2004 and 185,000 miles) so I anticipate having to buy a vehicle in the next year or two. I'd rather not have car payments.

-After all my expenses (including student loan payments), I have just above $1,000 to invest/save that goes directly to my savings account a month (458 of this will go into my Roth IRA). So that leaves me about $600/mth to save/invest.

-My work has a profit sharing plan where 15% of my salary goes into a 401k annually (They have never had a year where this didn't happen).

With my Roth IRA and 401k profit sharing plan, I feel that I will be setting myself up for a comfortable retirement (I'd be putting around $12,000 a year into retirement funds starting at age 23).  What I'm concerned about is having the money in my 30's to also live comfortably (buy a nice home, car, and provide for a family).  My concern is in tying up all my money right now while I'm young.  I want to be able to enjoy life while I can and if a whole life insurance plan won't be that beneficial (I'd probably only put $50-$100 a month into it), then I don't want to get reeled into doing that.  I guess I just have a few different options of what I can do with that extra $600 a month.  I do feel that a Vanguard will be a good investment right now if I were to put $50-$100 in it a month, then that would leave me with saving $500 a month.  That $500 a month could be used to save for a car in the near future, a down payment on a home, or could be extra cushioning for an increase in rent (which is likely).  I guess I'm just looking for some advice on whether or not a whole life insurance plan is a good idea for me specifically? Also, if going with a Vanguard brokerage account is a good start for conservative-ish investing. Would a mutual fund be more beneficial than a brokerage account?

Sorry for such a long post but I could really use some advice on some of this stuff, obviously.

I really appreciate your time for reading this and hope to get some help!

Thanks




**EDIT:** Thanks for everyone's helpful and most importantly, HONEST feedback.  Not something you see too often in the world, sadly.  I have decided not to work with Mass Mutual or an adviser at all.  I just sent my buddy a text about it (what do you even call someone that you went to high school with, got drunk with a few times, and actually know is a pretty good guy; but wouldn't consider a friend? haha) Anyways, I was just honest with him, saying I really only want to max out my Roth right now and focus on my student loan payments, meanwhile slowly dipping my feet into some short/mid term investing vehicles through vanguard or something. I probably could have given him a call about it out of respect... but hey.. I think he and I both know he was trying to screw me a little bit for his own financial benefit.. So the hell with a phone call.

I've got a lot of learning to do to plan out my portfolio but I feel a lot more comfortable now about the fact that I think I can confidently handle it on my own without an adviser.  If anyone has any good advice for a young dude trying to plan for a successful financial future, I'd be ecstatic to hear you out. Thanks again.

By the way, this was my first ever reddit post.  Never thought I ever actually would but I'm glad I did and will continue to do so! Also, maybe this thread will help out someone like me who was in a similar situation!",finance
MachineLearning,[P] Sigma – Creating a machine learning framework from scratch (Update on high school thesis advice thread),"**TLDR**: Asked this subreddit for advice in deciding on ML topic for high school thesis 2 years ago (see [original thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3jn5xf/question_what_interesting_machine_learning/)), ended up writing a machine learning framework from (almost) scratch in C#/F#. It can’t do as much as all the others, isn’t as fast or as pretty, but we still think it’s kind of cool. Here it is: our [github repo]( https://github.com/ThinkingTransistor/Sigma) and a short [UI demo](https://gfycat.com/HospitableCriminalAlpaca).
# Results

Upfront the current feature set of our framework [Sigma](https://github.com/ThinkingTransistor/Sigma), to give you an idea of what the next few paragraphs are about:

* Input, Output, Dense, Dropout, Recurrent, SoftmaxCE / SquaredDiff cost layers
* Gradient descent, Momentum, Adadelta, Adagrad optimisers
* Hooks for storing / restoring checkpoints, timekeeping, stopping (or doing other things) on certain criteria, computing and reporting runtime metrics
* Easy addition of new layers with functional automatic differentiation
* Linear and non-linear networks with arbitrarily connected constructs
* Distributed multi- and single- CPU and GPU (CUDA) backends 
* Native graphical interface where parameters can be interacted with and monitored in real-time

# 1. Introduction

This is the story of us writing a machine learning framework for our high school thesis, of what we learned and how we went about writing one from scratch. The story starts about 3 years ago: we saw a video of [MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44), a Super Mario AI that could learn to play Super Mario levels. We thought that was about the coolest thing of all time and wanted to do something at least kind of similar for our high school thesis. 

&amp;nbsp;
## 1.1 The Original Plan

Fast forward, over 2 years ago we asked for help in deciding what kind of machine learning project we could feasibly do for our senior year high school thesis (see [original thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3jn5xf/question_what_interesting_machine_learning/)). Quite ambitiously, we proposed a time investment of about 1000 hours total (as in 500 hours each over the course of 8 months) – for what project, we didn’t know yet. In that thread, we were generously met with a lot of help, advice ranged from reproducing existing papers to implementing specific things to getting to understand the material and then seeing what peaked our interest. After some consideration, we figured we would implement something along the lines of DeepMinds arcade game AI and then make it more general, figuring that would be easy for some reason. When planning our project in more detail we however quickly realised that 

1. we had no idea what we were doing and 
2. it would be a shame to do all that work from scratch and have it be so arbitrarily specific. 

&amp;nbsp;
## 1.2 Pivoting

Before doing anything very productive, we had to properly study machine learning. We figured this might take a while and allocated that part of our time to writing the theoretical part of our thesis, which conveniently overlapped. But because around that time we had to hand in an official target definition for our thesis, we set the most generic “goals” we could get away with. For reference, for a concerning number of months our project was officially named “Software framework for diverse machine learning tasks” with an even longer and even less specific subtitle. During further study and first attempts to draft the actual target definition for our project, our plans gradually shifted from a machine learning framework for playing specific types of games pivoted to an “any kind of visual input” learning framework and then finally to an “anything” machine learning framework – because why not, it seemed like an interesting challenge and we were curious to see how far we would get.

&amp;nbsp;

---
&amp;nbsp;
# 2. Research and Planning

Alright, so we've decided to write a machine learning framework. How does one create a machine learning framework? It takes many weeks to get reasonably proficient in just using a given framework, and that with proper guides, video tutorials and forums to ask for help. Creating a machine learning framework is a whole other story, with no 12 step guidelines to follow. For a considerable amount of time, we were at a loss at what we actually needed to implement – constantly encountering new and conflicting terms, definitions and not-so-obvious-“but the actual conclusion is obvious”-articles. After a little over a month we slowly got a very basic grasp of how this whole machine learning thing worked – something with functions that are approximated at certain points in steps typically using differentiation to make some metric go down – still magic, but a bit less so (until we read about CNNs, LSTMs and then GANs, each of which confused the heck out of us for some time). 

&amp;nbsp;
## 2.1 Sketching our Framework

As soon as we knew a bit about the art of machine learning we got more serious about the writing a new framework part. Because there are no guides for that, we resorted to reading the source code of established frameworks – all to us relevant parts, many times, until it made some sense. In the meantime, we had decided to use C# as our primary language – mostly because we were already very familiar with it and didn’t want to also have to learn a new language, but officially also because there were no other proper neural network frameworks for .NET. Alongside reading the source code of machine learning libraries (mainly Deeplearning4J, Brainstorm and Tensorflow) we sketched out how we wanted our own framework to be used. After some time, we felt like there was some unnecessary confusion in getting to know machine learning frameworks as an outsider and we set out to design our API to avoid that. Note that because our design makes sense to us doesn’t mean that it makes more sense than the existing ones to other people, nor do we recommend everyone wishing to use machine learning to write their own framework, just to spare their own sanity.  

Our naïve ideas on how a machine learning should look like was clearly inspired by our C#/Java based programming experience, as is evident from the code example we drafted a few weeks in:

    Sigma sigma = Sigma.Create(""minsttest"");
    GUIMonitor gui = (GUIMonitor) sigma.AddMonitor(new GUIMonitor(""Sigma GUI Demo""));
    gui.AddTabs({""Overview"", ""Data"", ""Tests""});
    
    sigma.Prepare();
    
    DataSetSource inputSource = new MultiDataSetSource(new FileSource(""mnist.inputs""), new CompressedFileSource(new FileSource(""mnist.inputs.tar.gz""), new URLSource(""http://....url...../mnist.inputs.targ.gz"")));
    DataSetSource targetSource = new MultiDataSetSource(new FileSource(""mnist.targets""), new CompressedFileSource(new FileSource(""mnist.targets.tar.gz""), new URLSource(""http://....url...../mnist.targets.targ.gz"" [, output: ""otherthandefault""]) [, compression: new TarGZUnpacker(), output: ""mnist.inputs"" , forceUpdate: false]));
    DataSet data = new DataSet(new ImageRecordReader(inputSource, {28, 28}).Extractor({ALL} =&gt; {inputs: {Extractor.BatchSize, 1, 28, 28}}).Preprocess(Normalisor()), new StringRecordReader(targetSource).Extractor({0} =&gt; {targets: {Extractor.BatchSize, 1}} [, blockSize: auto/all/1024^3]);
    
    Network network = new Network(""mynetwork"");
    network.Architecture = Input(inputShape: {28, 28}) + 2 * FullyConnected(size: 1024) + SoftmaxCE() + Loss();
    
    Trainer trainer = sigma.CreateTrainer(""mytrainer"");
    trainer.SetNetwork(network);
    trainer.SetInitialiser(new GaussianInitialiser(mean: 0.0, standardDeviation: 0.05));
    trainer.SetTrainingDataIterator(MinibatchIterator(batchSize: 50, data[""inputs""], data[""targets""]);
    trainer.SetOptimiser(new SGDOptimiser(learningRate: 0.01);
    trainer.AddActiveHook(EarlyStopper(patience: 3));
    trainer.AddActiveHook(StopAfterEpoch(epoch: 2000));
    
    gui.AccentColor[""trainer1""] = Colors.DeepOrange;
    gui.tabs[""overview""].AddSubWindow(new LineChartWindow(name: ""Error"", sources: {""*&lt;Trainer&gt;.Training.Error""}) [, x: 1, y: 0, width: 2, height: 1]);
    gui.tabs[""overview""].AddSubWindow(new LineChartWindow(name: ""Accuracy"", sources: {""*&lt;Trainer&gt;.Training.Accuracy""}));
    
    sigma.Run();
    
And skipping ahead a bit, it should be noted that the final framework is extremely similar to what we envisioned here: merely changing around a few syntax things and names, the above example from about a year ago can be used 1:1 in our current framework. The jury is still out on whether that’s a sign of really good or really bad design. Also note the python-style kwargs notation for layer constructor arguments, which was soon discarded in favour of something that actually compiles in C#. But back to the timeline.

&amp;nbsp;
## 2.2 The Sigma Architecture

After defining the code examples and sketching out the rough parts we felt a machine learning framework needed, we arrived at this general architecture for “Sigma.Core”, divided into core components (which translate almost 1:1 to namespace in our project):

* **Util**: Mostly boring, well, utility stuff, but also registries, a key part of our architecture. Because we wanted to be able to inspect and visualise everything we needed a global way to access things by identifier – a registry. Our registry is essentially a dictionary with a string key which may contain more registries. Nested registries can be resolved using registry resolvers in dot notation with some fancy wildcards and tags in angel brackets (e.g. “network.layers.*&lt;fullyconnected&gt;.weights”). 
* **Data**:	Datasets, the records that make them up in various formats, the pipeline to load, extract, prepare and cache them from disk, web, or wherever they come from and make them available as “blocks”. These blocks are parts of an extracted dataset, consist of many individual records, and are used to avoid loading all of a potentially very large dataset into memory at once. Also, data iterators, which slices larger blocks from datasets into pieces that are then fed to the model. 
* **Architecture**: Abstract definitions for machine learning models, consisting of layer “constructs”, which are lightweight placeholder layers defining what a layer will look like before its fully instantiated. These layers may be in any order and connected with however many other layers they would like. 
* **Layers**: Unfortunately named since we started out with just neural networks, but these are the individual layers of our machine learning networks – they store meta-parameters (e.g. size) and actual trainable parameters (e.g. the actual weights).
* **Math**:  Everything that has directly to do with math and low-level computations. All the automatic differentiation logic (which is very much required for doing proper machine learning) and everything that modifies our data is processed here in various backends (e.g. distributed CPU / GPU). To support calculating derivatives with respect to anything we opted for an approach with symbolic objects – essentially an object for a number or an array where the actual data was hidden (it can be fetched, but only via copies). These symbolic objects are passed around through a handler which does the actual data modification. This abstraction proved to be useful when implementing CUDA support where, due to the asynchronous execution of the CUDA stream, the raw data could not exposed to the user anyway, at least not without major performance hits (host-device synchronisation is very slow). 
* **Training**: The largest component with many subcomponents, all revolving around the actual training process. A training process is defined in a “trainer”, which specifies the following: 
  * **Initialisers**, that define how a models parameters are initialised, which can be configured with registry identifiers. For example, trainer.addInitialiser(“layers.*.biases”, new GaussianInitialiser(0.1, 0.0)); would initialise all parameters named “biases” with a Gaussian distribution of 0.1 (mean 0). 
  * **Modifiers**, that would modify parameters at runtime, for example to clip weights to a certain range. 
  * **Optimisers**, that define how a model learns (e.g. gradient descent). Because we mainly considered neural networks we only implemented gradient based optimisers, but the interface theoretically supports any kind of optimisation. 
  * **Hooks**, that “hook” into the training process at certain time steps and can do whatever you want (e.g. update visualisations, store / restore checkpoints, compute and log metrics, do something (e.g. stop) when some criteria are satisfied). 
  * **Operators**, that delegate work to workers which execute it with a certain backend computation handler according to some parameters. Notable is our differentiation of “global” and “local” processing, where global is the most recent global state. This global state is fetched by local workers that then do the actual work, publish their results to the operator which merges it back into the global scope. A global timestep event is only ejected when all local workers have submitted their work for that timestep, enabling more fine control in distributed learning, at least in theory. 
* **Sigma**: The root namespace that can create Sigma environments and trainers. An environment may contain multiple trainers, which are all run and, if specified, visualised simultaneously (which was supposed to be helpful in hyperparameter search). 
* **Monitors**: Technically outside of the core project, but still a component. These monitors can be attached to a Sigma environment and can then, well, monitor almost everything about the trainers of that environment using the aforementioned registry entries. Behaviour can be injected using commands, a special form of hooks that are only invoked once. This way monitors can be used almost independently of the core Sigma project and can be pretty much anything, like a graphical interface or a live, locally hosted website.

&amp;nbsp;
# 3. Implementation

And that’s what we implemented, step by step. We started out with me mainly working on Sigma.Core and my partner on our visualisation interface, working to a common interface for months until we could finally combine our individual parts and have it miraculously work in a live graphical interface. The specifics of implementation were very interesting and quite challenging to us, but most of the particulars are probably rather dull to read – after all, most of the time things didn’t work and when we fixed something, we moved on to the next something that didn’t.  

&amp;nbsp;
## 3.1 Low-level Data and Mathematical Processing

The very first thing we did was getting the data “ETL” (extract transform load) pipeline up and running, mainly fetching data from a variety of sources, loading them into a dataset and extracting them as blocks. I then focused on the mathematical processing part – everything that had to do with using math and calculating derivatives in our framework. I based our functional automatic differentiation, aptly named “SigmaDiff”, on an F# library for autodiff named “DiffSharp”, which I modified heavily to support n-dimensional arrays, improve performance significantly, fix a few bugs, support multiple simultaneous non-global backends, variable data types, and some more stuff that I’m forgetting. The specific details of getting that to work aren’t very interesting – a lot of glue code, refactoring and late-night bug-chasing because the backpropagation didn’t work as it should with some specific combination of operations. One memorable bug was that when remapping backend operations to my own OpenBLAS-based backend I forgot that matrix transposition did more than just change its shape – a mistake that cost me weeks in debugging efforts down the line, because things just didn’t work properly with large layers or more than 1 record per minibatch (duh). 

&amp;nbsp;
## 3.2 Performance Optimisations

Compared to all the backend work, the “middleware” of layers and optimisers was rather trivial to implement, as there are hundreds of tutorials and papers on how to create certain layers and optimisers, where I only had to map them to our own solution. Really, that part should have taken a few weeks at most, but took that much longer because we only then discovered dozens of bugs and stability issues. Skipping over a lot of uninteresting details here, it should be noted that at this point performance of the framework was quite bad. I’m talking 300ms/iteration of 100 MNIST records with just a few dense layers on a high-end computer bad. This bad performance not only slowed training but also actual development down by quite a lot, hiding a few critical bugs and never letting us test the entire framework in a real-world use case within a reasonable time. You might wonder why we didn’t just fix the performance from the get-go, but we wanted to make the actual training work first so we would have something to show for our thesis. In hindsight not the ideal choice, but it still worked out quite well and otherwise we wouldn’t have been able to demonstrate our project adequately in time for the final presentation. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.2.1 A Self-Adjusting Buffer

It took many months before we finally got around to addressing the performance issues, but there was no single fix in sight, rather a collection of hundreds of small to medium sized improvements. A major issue was the way our SigmaDiff math processor handled operations: for every operation, a copy was created for the resulting data. That added up. The copying was necessary because backwards differentiation requires all intermediate values, so we couldn’t just not copy things. We couldn’t even create all required buffers in a static way ahead of time because there was (and still is) no way to traverse the operations that will be executed – the computation graph is constructed anew every time, and we can’t completely rely on them to remain constant. To introduce a reliable way of buffering anyway, we introduced the concept of sessions: A session was meant to be a set of operations that would be repeated many times. Iterations, essentially. When a session is started we would start storing all created arrays in our own store and when an array of the same dimensions was requested in the next session we could return the one from last session, all without allocating any new memory. If more memory was required than last time, we could still allocate it, if less was used, we could discard it for the next session, rendering this neatly self-adjusting. To not overwrite data that was created within a session but was needed for the next one (e.g. parameters) we added an explicit “limbo” buffer, which was basically just a flag that could be set at runtime for a certain array that marked it as “do not reuse”. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.2.2 SIMD and Avoiding Intermediate Allocation

Other significant performance improvements were adding SIMD instructions (which enables processing of typically 8 values at the same time for CPU-bound arithmetic operations) wherever possible and reducing other memory allocation to a minimum by adding some in-place operations wherever intermediate values weren't strictly needed. For example, copying results when accumulating gradients during backpropoagation on nodes with multiple operands is unnecessary because the intermediate values aren't used. By analysing profilers to death, I eventually got the iteration time for my MNIST sample down to an acceptable 18ms in release configuration (speedup of about 17x). Incidentally, the core was now so fast that our visualiser sometimes crashed because it couldn’t keep up with all the incoming data. 

## 3.3 Monitoring with Sigma

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.3.1 The monitoring System

When developing Sigma, we not only focused on the “mathematical” backend but also implemented a feature rich monitoring system which allows any application to be built on top of Sigma (or better said Sigma.Core). Every parameter can be observed, every change hooked, every parameter managed. With this monitoring system, we built a monitor (i.e. application) that can be used to learn Sigma and machine learning in general. 

&amp;nbsp;
### 3.3.2 The WPF Monitor

Users should be able to not only use Sigma, but also **learn** with Sigma. To address this issue, we built a feature-rich application (with WPF) that allows users to interact with Sigma. plot learning graphs, manage parameters and control the AI like controlling a music player. This monitor, as every other component of Sigma, is fully customisable and extensible. All components were designed with reusability in mind, which allows users to build their own complex application on top of the default monitor. But why describe a graphical user interface? See it for yourself, here is the UI (and Sigma) in action. (Example builds of Sigma can be downloaded on GitHub).

## 3.4 CUDA Support and Finishing Touches


Only 2 months ago we started finalising and polishing our framework: adding CUDA support, fixing many stability issues and rounding off a few rough spots that annoyed us. The CUDA support part was particularly tricky as I could only use CuBLAS, not CuDNN, because our backend doesn’t, by design, understand individual layers but just raw computation graphs. A problematic side effect of the previously described session-logic was that there was no guarantee when buffers would be freed, as that was the job of the indeterministic GC. To not leak CUDA device memory I added my own bare-bones reference counter to the device memory allocator, which would be updated when buffers were created / finalised, which works surprisingly well. With CuBLAS, many custom optimised kernels and many nights of my time we achieved around 5ms/iteration for the same sample on a single GTX 1080, which we deemed acceptable for our envisioned use cases.

# 4. Conclusion

Approximately 3000 combined hours, tens of thousands of lines of code and many long nights later we are proud to finally present something we deem reasonably usable for what it is: [Sigma](https://github.com/ThinkingTransistor/Sigma), a machine learning framework that might help you understand a little bit more about machine learning. As of now, we probably won’t be adding many new features to Sigma, mainly because we’re working on a new project related to it that’s now taking up most of our available time. Even though it lacks a lot of default features (most importantly the host of default layer types other frameworks offer), we’re quite happy with how far we got with our project and hope that it’s an adequate update to our original question 2 years ago. We would be happy if some of you could check it out and give us some feedback. 

&amp;nbsp;

## 4.1 The Cost of Creating a Machine Learning Framework 

Excluding time, it’s quite cheap. Honestly, with some solid prior programming experience (so that the low-level programming part doesn't become an issue), the whole thing isn't terribly difficult and is probably something most people could do, given enough time. A lot of time. Overall, we it took us approximately: 

1. Some 600 hours of research
2. Some 2400 hours of development
3. 2 tortured souls, preferably sold to the devil in exchange for less bugs

We have long since stopped properly counting, so take these numbers with a grain of salt, but they should be in the right ballpark. 

&amp;nbsp;
  
## 4.2 Final remarks 
All in all, an undertaking like this is extremely time intensive. It was very much overkill for a high school thesis from the get-go, and we knew that, but it just kept getting more and more elaborate, essentially taking up all of our available time and then some. It was definitely worth it though, for now we have a solid understanding how things work on a lower level and, most importantly, we can say we’ve actually written a machine learning framework, which grants us additional bragging rights :)",technology
personalfinance,Mortgage Values in Relation to the Fed Releasing Assets Purchased During QE,"Fellow mortgage owners:

Please consider the reasonable warning (after the ""Soooooo...."") as drawn in the conclusion of my thesis below:

The current US economy is good. However, it may not be as good as one would assume given the present high value of mortgages. Why are mortgage values so high? One (of many) reasons is because the Federal Reserve purchased many mortgage-related assets to help stimulate the economy in reaction to the Great Recession. This was called ""Quantitative Easing."" Simple supply and demand: Quantitative Easing helped to squeeze supply. And while demand may have increased (I'd argue it hasn't, really), values rose in correlation to the decrease in supply.

The Federal Reserve stopped Quantitative Easing some time ago, but still owns the assets that it purchased. Well, they are now about to slowly release those assets (beginning as soon as December). Their argument is that demand has rebounded such that the increase in supply should have a minimal effect on mortgage values. They're probably right. But, they could be wrong. And the Federal Reserve has been wrong before.

Soooooo....

I'm just some dude, but I do follow this stuff, and all I'm asking is that you monitor the situation. If the Federal Reserve does begin to unwind its mortgage-related asset inventory and you observe an appreciable decrease in mortgage value, you may want to have a plan in place to sell high before you are under water. It's simply due diligence in financial preparation, and applying the lessons learned from 2007. Nothing major; just observe and be prepared.

Our lender has offered two different rates for the same down payment - 3.75% and 4.00%.  The 3.75% rate results in a monthly payment of $1,551 and the 4.00% rate results in a monthly payment of $1,599.  Supposedly the larger payment has PMI financed in it.

Anyways, I graduated last December and started my job the following January. Back in April or so, I started looking around to refinance the three private loans after realizing &lt; 10% isn't ideal. I applied for a few soft credit pulls from multiple places and I think one or two deceiving hard credit pulls (I didn't want to do any hard credit pulls).

personalfinance,Dentist sent bill to collections by accident. They are willing to help but how?,"So I had some dental work done in April and was told my insurance covers it and I do not have to pay any extra. Somehow a miscommunication happened and they sent a bill out... Which I never received 

They also said they they called... But had the wrong number on file....

The only reason I found out about this debt is that I called to make an appointment for a cleaning and they told me that my account was in collections! So I paid the balance immediately and then I started questioning the debt. 

The dentist himself called me later and said he was sorry and a mistake had been made and he will do what it takes to get it clarified but isn't certain what the course of action is. He is going to contact me at the end of the day with what he found so I thought I would do some research as well. 

What's the best way to get this removed from my credit history? Have the dentist office talk to the creditor? Do I need letters sent to the credit bureaus? 


Any help would be greatly appreciated! 


UPDATE 1:

To add to the story I went to get a line of credit September 6th and was offered $5,000 at 11% which I scoffed at because I have not missed a payment or been delinquent on any account for over 10 years I use my credit card for my daily purchases and pay it off every week I also have a mortgage with 35% of the home paid off. The bank never said that there was something in collections, when I applied for the aforementioned line of credit. 

 The dentist is an unbelievably skilled and compassionate person. I know that he meant no harm and it was definitely a simple mistake.  so I hold no grudges to him he actually offered to reimburse me the amount that I paid. The same dentist has never charged me for any work as I have required several extensive visits and has even offered to pay for anything that my health plan doesn't cover but assured me so far nothing was not covered

So far his office team is contacting the debt collection agency and I look forward to hearing the results",finance

personalfinance,Comparing Amount of Actual cost of Expenses to Actual Amount Saved from a Tax Write Off,"Hey Reddit I am starting as an independant contractor and have a question regarding expenses, specifically mileage.

Let's say I drive a total of 38,896 miles for business in a year and grossed a total of $100,000. For the sake of the question, let's say gas was my only expense. My vehicle gets 17 miles to the gallon and let's say gas averages to $3/gallon. 

38896 / 17 = 2288

2288 × $3 = $6864 / year spent on gas

Federal rate for mileage is 53.5 cents per mile

Deducting mileage using the federal rate for 2017 would be 38,896 x .535 = $20809.36 of tax deductible income. 

Using that, how do I calculate how much the deduction would save me in an actual dollar amount? If I made $75000 or $150000 instead what would it cost me or how would I calculate that? 

As an independant contractor I'll be paying the full self employment tax so I'm not sure if that plays a factor at all.

personalfinance,Recent grad school grads with high incomes but large student debts. Advice please!,"Hi PF -

I'm a long time lurker but first time poster. I could really use advice, but before that, here's some context.

My fiance and I are recent graduates from graduate school, both about 30 years old. 

**Income**


My salary: ~$145K annually

My additional income: ~15% bonus annually + $35K tuition reimbursement every 9 months, upto $140K

Fiance's salary: ~$150K annually

Fiance's additional income: ~15-20% bonus annually

**Retirement savings**

Mine: Have ~$30K in existing 401K. 100% employer match, max of 3% of salary.

Fiance: Nothing saved yet. 25% employer match, max of 1.5% of salary.

**Debt**

My student load debt: $200K @ 3.95% fixed. Monthly payments of $2.2K

Fiance's student loan debt: $135K @ 8.5% variable (fiance is an international citizen and can't get lower rates until she gets a green card)

No significant other debt. We pay CC's monthly and don't carry a balance.

**Expenses**

Rent + utilities: ~$3K / month (we live in an expensive major city)

Food + entertainment: ~$1K / month

Transportation: ~$100 / month (we walk to work, lyft/public transport to other places when walking isn't feasible)

**Taxes**

Our entire graduate school expenses are tax deductible. 

I have a NOL of ~$40K from 2015 and 2016 and expenses of $40K in 2017. 

Fiance has a NOL of ~$100K from 2015 and 2016 and expenses of $40K in 2017.

**Savings**

Minimal - whatever we had, we spent on graduate school.

**Credit scores**

Mine: 780-800

Fiance: 720 (again, new to the US)

**Questions:**

**Retirement** What is the best way to deal with 401Ks/retirement investing right now? I was planning on maxing out $18K in mine but only doing 6% of income in fiance's (to get max employer match) and using additional funds to pay down fiance's student loans. 


**Taxes 1** What are the rules for applying NOL carryforwards to tax returns? I have ~$75K in income this year (worked only a portion of the calendar year), so I could apply the $40K in expenses + $40K in NOL to get ~0 taxable income. But ideally I'd like to apply the $40K in NOL to next calendar year where I'm expecting a full year of income. Is that allowed?


**Taxes 2** Fiance and I are planning on getting legally married so that fiance can get the green card and lower interest rates on student debt.  Any thoughts on whether we should file jointly or file separately next year? My inclination is to file separately given the high amount of deductible expenses on both our returns, but wanted to confirm whether I'm missing something.


**Investing and saving** We were thinking of NOT investing anything and applying all monthly savings towards student loan debt, at least until fiance can get a lower interest rate. Is that wise?",finance
personalfinance,Personal Loan Rate is lower than Student Loan Rate - Should I do this?,"A few years ago I had some credit card debt which was at an interest rate of 20-something percent and that sucked. So I got a loan from Prosper that had an interest rate of around 10%, used that to pay off the credit card debt, then paid off the Prosper loan much faster. Worked like a charm and I was pleased.

In the couple years since then I've rebuilt my credit pretty well. It's 790 right now and I was looking at two of my college loans:

Loan 1:
$1,284 remaining
8.98% Interest rate

Loan 2:
$789 remaining
5.46% Interest rate

So about $2100 to go. It's not an exorbitant amount and I'm paying it off ok. But I happened to check Prosper and I can get a loan from them for $2100 for 5.31% interest.

So my question is: is there any reason not to take out the Prosper loan to pay off the college loans since the interest rate is lower than both of the college loans (significantly lower in one case)? 

It seems like a no-brainer to me to go with Prosper and I'm generally good with managing my money but I don't have a mathematical brain at all so I'd love to get some advice from people here.

I'm not really worried about any upcoming hits to my credit score either. My car is paid off. I rent and I don't plan on moving soon. I've got about $4k in savings but would love to knock off these loans so I can put the extra money toward savings. I think I can do that faster if I go with the Prosper loan, especially since the interest rate is more than 3.5% lower on the bigger loan. 

Anyway, I think that covers everything but if you have any questions, let me know and I can add more details.",finance
Forex,MISES: Questions Remain as the Fed Finally Begins to Reverse QE (Quick Analysis),"https://mises.org/library/questions-remain-fed-finally-begins-reverse-qe

Well it only took 9 years but the FED is finally winding down QE on top of raising rates. 

Will trigger another recession? 

YES and NO. This policy has effectively been a safety net, or as Peter Schiff calls them ""Training Wheels"". 

Simply put, removing QE is going to force the economy to sustain itself on its own and there is going to be a correction. Which means a weaker dollar. 

Also rising interest rates are going to happen which will trigger rising mortgage payments in ARM loans just like in 2008

http://www.themreport.com/daily-dose/01-08-2017/arm-market-share-ready-rise

And every 0.25% the Fed increases rates the more likely homes are to foreclosed. There are roughly around 5.5 million ARM Mortgages in the USA today. If 20% failed (1 million mortgages) that could mean disaster again, (easier to happen than you think, could the poorest 20% of those 5.5 million default if their mortgage went up $1000 bucks??? HELL YEAH) 

1 million mortgages multiplied by $100,000 = 1 Trillion dollars! 

It aint no small matter either. 

Not to mention that Mortgage back securities still exist, Yeah remember those? The ones that helped cause the crash? Yeah they just changed the name and nothing changed. I have been hearing a lot of commercials trying to help people get mortgages with bad credit. 

#IF THERE WAS EVER A RED FLAG SIGNAL FOR A MARKET THAT IS IT

My estimate is 6 months after the fed funds rate hits around 4% is when you will start to see big foreclosures **again**. Imagine your mortgage going up $500 to $1000 or even $2000 from origination. 

This plus the end of QE and a Federal gov that does not have a balanced budget, we can expect some craziness ahead. 

Mainly this is going to be a ""Scary"" time since many of the life support systems that were put in place in 2008/9 are slowly being turned off. 

In the end, I am bearish on the dollar from around 2019/2020 Once fully implemented. However if they stay the course and dont freak out I think the dollar will come roaring back as the economy actually stabilzes without gov intervention probably around 2021/22.

CryptoCurrency,Is anyone currently retiring on cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency earnings?,"My dream is to be able to retire on my stash. I have the following questions:

1) How do you generate continuous passive income from your holdings? Do you stake? Mine? Which coins? Sell everything and put in a traditional dividend stock? Rental property?

2) How do you liquidate large amounts of BTC quickly to make big purchases like a house, Lambo, etc.? Do you prefer spending BTC directly or converting to fiat first?

3) How much crypto (net worth) are you retiring on?

4) How do you handle taxes? Do you set aside a certain amount you think you own (fed + state cap gains taxes), or do you try to evade them?

5) How has cryptocurrency changed your life?

Many thanks to those who can answer this. I know many of you BTC/ETH millionaires are lurking here.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does it make sense to use savings to kick a handful of debt,"Hey there,

Currently my wife and I have 2 cars and 2 loans we owe on. Our credit cards are paid off usually monthly. Whatever extra we have at the end of the month, we usually divide between savings and extra debt. Wondering if it makes sense to put a bigger hole in debt using some savings.

Car 1: ~5500 - Bi weekly payments of ~130 - 0.9%
Car 2: ~24000 - Bi weekly payments of ~230 - 1.74%
Loan 1: ~34500 - Monthly payments ~450 - 6.7% 
Loan 2: ~10000 - Bi weekly payments ~190 - 9.73%

We have a few different areas where we are saving money, one of our savings accounts is a pretty basic account and has just less than 7000 in it. I was thinking this would help knock down Loan 2. Then by adding a couple of extra payments at the end of each month we'd be done with this by the end of the year and be left with 1 loan and 2 cars.

Our ultimate goal is to get a house in 2019. By that time, we should be able to recover the the loss of the savings...

Any thoughts would be appreciate!!

I recently had the good fortune of a large income increase so called the lender to inquire about reducing my 60 month loan term to a ~36 month term at a lower interest rate. Somewhat to my surprise I was flatly refused, told that it is simply policy to not refinance existing loans. Obviously the lender doesn't want to accept a lower interest rate if they don't have to, but the alternative of losing business to any of the many competitors offering convenient online lending seems worse. Is there an underwriting reason for refusing this transaction as a matter of policy? I called PenFed after hanging up with LightStream and got a 36 month refinance at 2.49% approved in about 30 minutes.",finance

Three months ago in crypto-time, or three weeks ago in real-time, the Bitcoin Barbarian was humming along. Out for a stroll outside the gate. Pocketing $5000 and new all-time highs.

Wait. What? Where did that come--   
   
   
*“--China **BANS** bitcoin!”*   
   
   
THUMP WHACK!   
   
   
Crypto got mugged. JPMorgan Chase did it. Then, just as crypto sat up to see what smacked it, the Red Dragon karate chopped it again. The “China bans bitcoin!” blow was so fast and hard to the head that we’ve already almost forgotten the “Bitcoin is a fraud!” FUD. But hang on. Time out. Go back. Rewind the news cycle a few weeks. Because that fraud news may have mattered. Because it may not have been news. It may have been an attack. Or a precursor to a bigger one. A thunderclap to a coming storm.   
   
   
How often do we see that much negative, concentrated crypto coverage in 24 hours? JPMorgan Chase CEO Jaime Dimon launched the first strike, then his Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy followed [through](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-apos-top-quant-strategist-204305164.html). But it wasn’t just JPMorgan. The mainstream media machine ran and replicated their comments, then piled on with “bubble! Bubble! **BUBBLE!**” stories from various experts. Negative narrative after negative narrative, in Fortune, Forbes, CNBC, Business Insider... The stories were broad, deep and maliciousness –- Dimon even insulted his own daughter’s intelligence.The comments felt personal and the articles almost seemed…   
   
   
Coordinated.   
   
   
I doubt it, because they appeared reactionary and weren’t nuclear. Something got under Dimon’s skin and he lashed out. But this tilted his hand and raised an interesting question; What happens if Banks **DO** launch a coordinated campaign against Bitcoin?  **Would they?**   
   
   
Maybe, if they felt threatened.   
   
   
In 1910, six politicians and bankers, including, ironically, sort of, a representative from JPMorgan, held a secret meeting at Jekyll Island, [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System). It was secret because what they were doing was contentious; changing who controlled money.   
   
   
*“The meeting and its purpose were closely guarded secrets, and participants did not admit that the meeting occurred until the [1930s](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/jekyll_island_conference).”*   
   
   
They secluded themselves for 10 days and wrote the Federal Reserve Plan, which was largely incorporated into law in 1913 as the Federal Reserve Act. This act created the Fed, Federal Reserve Notes (the standardized dollar), and America’s modern monetary [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System).   
   
   
Since then, the United States has used this system. In this, the Fed sets monetary policy and produces dollars in variable amounts at various times. Banks create more money through fractional reserve banking, and process transactions between users. It’s a closed, centralized system, because the USG, Fed and Banks control it.   
   
   
In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto released [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Like the Federal Reserve Act, this also created a currency, the bitcoin, but unlike the Federal Reserve Act, computer code sets monetary policy and miners produce bitcoin in fixed amounts at fixed times by processing peer-to-peer user [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). This is an open, decentralized system, because no central authority controls it at a central point of [failure](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/jp-morgan-ceo-wrong-bitcoin-jamie-dimon).   
   
   
The central banking system and Bitcoin are two different and inherently conflicting ways of creating, managing and processing money. When Nakamoto mined the genesis block, for example, he/she/they carved a message in it that read, *‘The Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.’* This was The Times of London’s newspaper headline on 3 January [2009](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block). The message timestamped Bitcoin’s inception, and implies that “Banks are bad, Bitcoin is better, and it’s coming after you.""   
   
   
When Nakamoto mined the genesis block, he was the only person in the world who used bitcoins, until he made the first bitcoin transaction with Hal Finley on 12 January [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin). Then, a bitcoin was worth zero and its market cap was zero. Today, eight years later, it’s worth $3700 and its market cap is $61 [billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/). JPMorgan’s market cap is $334 [billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US).   
   
   
*“Before the Fed’s creation, no central banking system in the United States lasted for more than 25 [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act).”*   
   
   
As Bitcoin grows, it competes and conflicts more and more with the central banking system(s), because both systems fight for limited users and value. As is, Bitcoin doesn’t end until it replaces or subsumes the central banking system itself, or is outcompeted and destroyed by it. Nakamoto released a virus, or antibodies killing a virus, depending on your perspective.   
   
   
Cryptocurrency experts frequently say that Bitcoin and the blockchain may be as disruptive as the internet was in the 90s. But it may be more. The internet was more innovative than disruptive, and created more companies than it killed. It was a whole *new* thing in *unexplored* space that threatened *private, apolitical* companies, while Bitcoin replaces a *pre-established* thing in *occupied* space that threatens *quasi-public, political* institutions. The USG didn’t bail out Blockbuster. Blockbuster wasn’t “too big to fail.” They failed. The USG bailed out banks for a $29 trillion dollar problem they [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008).   
   
   
Bitcoin feeds on the Fed itself.   
   
   
Given this, if Bitcoin keeps growing as conceptualized and coded, and keeps consuming Banks’ market share, they may retaliate. Nothing wants to die in the jungle. **But can they?**   
   
   
They already have lawyers, lobbyists, marketing and money. They make money. Literally. The Fed creates a dollar from thin air whenever it wants and loans it to JPMorgan and other banks, who are allowed to re-loan it until the bank has created $10 from that [$1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking). After creating $10, the banks pocket interest on it. They then hold most the money they created and loaned (via cash and debts). Where’s all your money that’s not in crypto or hard assets? They have it. Actually, they don’t. If everyone simultaneously withdrew their deposits, the banks couldn’t cover them, because most that money doesn’t exist physically. It’s debits and credits in private accounting ledgers re-loaned over itself several times. In central banking systems, banks don’t even have to have the actual money to have the money, somehow. But they can still charge you real transaction, ATM and overdraft fees on this money, to make more money. They hold your money and charge you to use it. So they make money, re-lend it to you to make more, and charge you to transact it, even though they don’t necessarily have it.   
   
   
JPMorgan said that bitcoin is a “pyramid scheme” -- compared to what, the central banking [system](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/15/jpmorgans-top-quant-strategist-echoing-ceo-compares-bitcoin-to-pyramid-scheme.html)? Side by side, which system looks more suspect; Bitcoin or the Banks? Fair question. Dimon also said that bitcoin is “just not a real thing,” but every bitcoin has hard code that exists in a ledger that anyone can check anytime anywhere in the [world](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html). Where do those nine fractional reserve dollars exist? If everyone withdrew all their bitcoin from the Bitcoin system, every bitcoin could be printed on paper with qrcodes and accounted [for](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet). If everyone withdrew all their dollars from the central banking system, the Banks couldn’t produce [them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run). A strong argument can be made that the central banking system is a fraud, in a bubble, and that bitcoin isn’t appreciating, but the dollar is depreciating.   
   
   
**When does Bitcoin get so big that Banks retaliate?**   
   
   
$5,000 a coin aggravated Dimon, and China is on the war-path. Ironically, China banning ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges may delay a coordinated attack, because it relieves pressure on the banks, and Dimon and others can point to crypto’s subsequent crash and smile smug. They’re right. They called it.  The State beat Bitcoin, and the Banks have the State. But if Bitcoin recovers (again), it’ll return stronger than ever (again), and take a bigger swipe at the ogre’s lunch.   
   
   
**How much fire-power can Banks unleash if they organize and attack?**   
   
   
They can hit crypto with PR firms, press releases and an incoming slander storm of anti-bitcoin “news,” and they can redirect their lawyers and lobbyists to seduce Congress to create regulation, and possibly pressure the IRS to enforce it. Take the recent headlines, for example, about North Korea skirting sanctions by stealing and mining [bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/north-korea-hackers-step-up-bitcoin-attacks-amid-rising-tensions). This is PR ammo for Banks. Banks can press this story into politicians and leverage it for regulations. Even if the regulations fail the stigma sticks and bitcoin has another bad-news headline; Silk Road, drugs, Mt. Gox, Wannacry, North Korea… Interestingly, the blockchain isn’t burdened with this branding, and may give Banks a graceful out to adopt and profit from crypto instead of attacking it.   
   
   
**What can crypto do to defend itself from a possible coordinated attack?**   
   
   
Cryptocurrency has the technology and truth, which speak for themselves – when heard through the FUD.  Cryptocurrency makes sense. It’s technologically better. It eliminates middlemen and optimizes process, so it’s faster and cheaper. It’s also a better store of value than deflationary money, and more liquid than gold. It eats less and leaves more for everyone else.   
   
   
Once, for example, it took the banking system two months to wire money from my bank in the United States to a bank in Mumbai so I could buy a car. Why can an ATM in Mumbai tell me my bank balance in the United States in seconds, but it takes two months to “wire” money? Because that money passed through several regional and central banks, each of which held it for “three to five working days” for some reason and charged transaction fees. Bitcoin makes the same transaction in minutes, peer-to-peer, for pennies. Banks can’t compete. It’s not even close. The old ogre has the high ground. But sitting atop a hill makes you fat, while climbing it makes you hungry, so the ogre will have to resort to censorship and propaganda.   
   
   
Bitcoin’s code also protects. Because it is decentralized, it doesn’t have significant and synchronized marketers, lawyers and lobbyists like a bank. It struggles to reach consensus and act, and can’t issue press releases or send people to Capitol Hill very well. But, it has a million nodes of light. It’s everywhere and nowhere. Where do Banks attack? Who do they sue, legislate and outspend? If Bitcoin was a centralized company, the market could have already killed it, like Digicash, but it’s not, so the ogre has to fight for the first time in 104 years without some of the weapons he uses to fight [with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash). This decentralized, diffused attack surface is part of Bitcoin’s beauty and Nakamoto’s genius. Banks, however, can still target exchanges, miners and tax dodgers.   
   
   
They can also poison people not yet using crypto, because Bitcoin has a PR problem that may get worse. Numerous people, born into the banking system, think the matrix makes sense, and still think bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme to buy drugs. The other day, for example, I mentioned bitcoin to a well-educated, well-read and highly paid professional colleague. “Bitcoin?” He replied, “I thought that was a scam?"" Try it. Ask a few laymen what they think about bitcoin.   
   
   
**In sum...** Bitcoin isn’t an esoteric sidechain anymore. It’s not (just) techie geeks trading Magic playing cards. It’s an asset class with market share and momentum that threatens big banks, big money and big power. Where did we think this train was going? The Iron Bank is a fat ogre, but it’s got the high-ground and motive and means to fight, so the Jekyll Island War may intensify and the jekylling may be violent -- a war for the creation and control of money itself.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"$35k to $71k, Trying to Figure Out Next Steps","Hello everyone,

I’ve recently accepted a job offer for a position that will pay significantly more than I currently earn. I’ll try to list a few things that I’m curious about. Here is some background about me: 
I’m 27 years old, single and no kids. Previously I was making $35k Net. With this salary, I will be making $98K gross a year, coming out to about $71K Net (I receive VA compensation, which I am including). I have 2 debts, a car loan (4.990%) that I pay $400 a month on, owe about $7k left on it. My emergency savings were depleted a few months ago, and I also have slight credit card debt (interest about 7% I believe), around $2.2k. I will pay off the credit card when I receive my first paycheck.
  
This is my first experience with the private sector. I received about a 60 page benefit summary going over the different insurances (medical, dental, vision). Currently, I still have 4 years of care left from the VA due to being a combat veteran, so I’m slightly confused on what I should be looking for. According to VA.gov “Enrollment with VA satisfies the health care law’s requirement to have health care coverage” (https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/returning_servicemembers.asp). I’m relatively healthy, so I don’t foresee needing additional coverage within the next 4 years, but I would love to hear others’ opinions, as this is all new to me. 

I have not received any info regarding investments from the company, but I’ve been told they match 401k contributions up to 3% from someone who will be a coworker. According to a sticky’d post on here, I should contribute up to the match then aggressively pay off high interest debt carrying interest rates beyond what I could reasonably get elsewhere. I don’t believe that I fall in that spectrum, so am I correct in assuming I should contribute up to the $18k max? Meanwhile, I should also invest the max $5.5k into an IRA as well? Since my emergency fund was depleted, I will steadily build that back up as well to around $10k. I would also like to buy a house since the housing market is cheap and I plan on being around for at least 5 years. Looking over the investing part, I just don’t know if that’s in the cards though.  

I like to think I’m somewhat financially responsible and on the right track, but I start to feel overwhelmed when taking in all of this information and trying to make the correct decisions in preparing for my future, while also enjoying this youth while I can. I learn more in an interactive environment such as a discussion than I do reading, so please bear with me and my ignorance. I appreciate all of you who take out time in your day to assist others in these matters. Thank you!

btc,A honeybadger is walking through the woods on an annoyingly narrow path. Suddenly three roads diverged in this yellow wood...,"It was good to finally be in a small clearing. He had grown bigger and stronger over the last few years and the path had become almost intolerably confining. He shook his fur and stretched, looking back over his shoulder at the distant smoke from the far off mining town at the base of the mountain beside the home of the beavers. Each time he looked back he was always amazed how much higher he was and how far he'd come.

But now, he saw before him a signpost with arrows identifying  three onward paths, ""Bitcoin 1mb,"" ""Bitcoin S2X,"" and ""Bitcoin Cash."" But honeybadgers cannot read of course. 

The first two paths looked very similar, nearly parallel, jutting off to the left in the general direction of the valley. One being just as narrow as the way he had come while the other had a tiny but welcome bit of elbow room. 

But both had some things he'd never seen. Beautiful red velvet ropes lined the twin paths, presumably to help ensure that the passersby would never stray off the path. There were warm beaconing neon lights, a couple empty bottles under a bush, three muddy cufflinks, a pair of knickers hung from a low twig, and many footprints from expensive soles, as though some high class people recently had a groundbreaking party. Cool! A fresh path! After several meters the paths disappeared into the brush so he could not see further.

The third path meandered onward up the mountain. It leveled off slightly but was otherwise not really remarkable or unfamiliar. There were no ropes or exotic paraphernalia. He'd merely describe it as, ""ahh! quite a bit wider"" (if he could talk), as though large diverse crowds of hikers might be along at any moment. 

This aspect was intimidating at first glance because he wasn't used to crowds, and he certainly wasn't used to having room enough to trot. But the path was quiet at the moment, looking rather unspoiled and, to date, less traveled than the others. In fact, except for the comfortable width, it was no different at all than the path that brought him here, to this signpost in the middle of nowhere, halfway up a mountain.

Suddenly immobilized with indecision, honeybadger sat down under a tree. And he thought and thought. He ran a couple numbers on his calculator watch, sharpened his compass, worried a bit, called his brother, read zerohedge with his hPhone, ran some good responsible simulations, and then it hit him- in order to determine the correct path, *he must think logically.* So he began to draw a diagram in the dirt which looked like-

I'm just kidding. Honeybadgers can't do that stuff. They don't have huge brains like you do. Fortunately, this was literally a no-brainer. He just sniffed the air distractedly and continued in the right direction without even breaking his little foraging trot. He was looking forward to lunch.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay Loans Off Aggressively or Ride a Decent Interest Rate?,"Hi all,

As the title indicates, I'm trying to decide how aggressively to pay off my student loans. Background:

* Income: ~$230,000, inclusive of bonuses

* Savings: $25,000 emergency fund

* Expenses: ~$2,600/month, exclusive of the student loan payment

* Debt: 
 * $8000 auto loan at 5-year, 3.13% fixed
 * $170,000 consolidated student loan, currently at ~6.25%, but I'm intending to refinance in the next few months, and I'm seeing 5-year fixed quotes in the range of 3.4-3.6%. That results in a payment in the ballpark of $3,000/month.

I max out my 401(k) and Roth IRA. My question is what I should do with extra money, both from paychecks and from bonuses. I see three options:

1. Use all extra money to pay off loans as quickly as possible. This is partly attractive because I don't like having six figures of debt.
2. Pay only the required amounts on my loans, taking advantage of the fairly low interest rates. So putting all extra money into my brokerage account (I invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs.) 
3. Some blend of the two.

I'd appreciate any advice this sub has!",finance

personalfinance,The banks and credit unions most recommended by commenters on PF,"A lot of people ask ""what bank should I use?"" and a small number of banks and credit unions get most of the airtime here so I wanted to compile a list of recommendations (and add it to the PF wiki for easy reference).

I also don't think there is any one bank that's ideal for everyone.  Some institutions have better interest rates.  Others offer better ATM access.  Some are difficult to join (looking at you USAA and NFCU).  Some are better for people who travel a lot.  And hopefully all of these choices have good customer service reputations.  The idea here is to give some possible options to people looking for a new bank based on the features that people mention the most often.

Is this an accurate reflection of what people recommend the most often here?

Notes:

- **If you need to deposit cash or require other in-person services, a local credit union is likely to be a better option than an online bank or credit union.**
- All institutions are open to membership in every US state.  Navy Federal and USAA have membership requirements based on military service (or being closely related to another member). Navy Federal's requirements are somewhat looser. A $10 donation to a charity may be required for some people to join Alliant.
- All listed institutions have ""Excellent"" or ""Very Good"" fees (meaning very low fees) as [rated by Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/banks-credit-unions.htm) except for Alliant which was rated as ""Good"" and Fidelity and Simple which were not rated.
- All listed institutions have no minimum initial deposit except for USAA which has a $25 minimum.
- High-Rate Savings = 1% or higher FDIC-insured savings or money market interest rate
- High-Rate Checking = 0.5% or higher FDIC-insured checking interest rate
- Methodology: I went through a bunch of popular posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/55c3dq/wells_fargo_megathread_alternative_banks_and/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6c35ne/this_is_just_a_reminder_that_bank_of_america/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/54de3n/credit_union_vs_major_bank/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35pv89/im_susan_weinstock_and_i_direct_the_consumer/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nud0h/this_is_why_i_am_a_member_of_my_local_credit_union/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ayevu/lets_talk_banks_with_which_bank_you_are_and_why/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3atug4/looking_to_switch_banks_us/), [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/54oxgz/which_bank_do_you_recommend_i_currently_have/)) and roughly tabulated the recommendations along with the main reasons why people recommend them.  I tried to be as fair as possible and at least one bank that I'm kind of ""meh"" about ended up on the list so hopefully this is relatively unbiased.
- [1] Alliant, Capital One 360, Navy Federal, and USAA all have physical branches, but not nationwide. (Fidelity and Schwab also have branches, but don't accept cash deposits at any.)
- [2] 4 out of 5 checking account types offered by NFCU include $10 or $20 ATM refunds.

P.S. For the record, I've used 3 of these institutions as my primary bank and had accounts at 3 others.  I have no complaints, switching occasionally for greater convenience.

- Note that Simple also wasn't rated by Consumer Reports.
- Note that some of these banks and credit unions do actually have some physical branches.",finance

My interest charges on a balance like this are about $160 a month (at 20.15%), and my payments (minimum) are about $220. I can't afford much more than the minimum at the moment which will apparently take 26 years (!) to pay off. I may be able to pay off $250 a month at most. 

My balance was maxed about 12 months ago, but even though I've paid it off every month and haven't spent any money at all on the card, I've made only a $500 dent in the over all balance. I can't keep spending $2400 a year and making only $500 in progress.

What can I do? How and where do I start securing a more manageable interest rate? I've called Wells Fargo (my bank) and asked them about lower interest rate card, they advised I have no ""offers on my account"" and that ""offers on accounts are added at random times and customers need to call and inquire whether or not they've had one added to their account"". This seems ridiculous to me, like I'm waiting for Zues to throw down a bolt of lightning and bring my APR to 0%.

personalfinance,Did I make a mistake getting 3 credit cards?,"Yes, I did. Is probably the answer. But here's the story.

Two years ago I had a card closed on me for being seriously delinquent. It was my only card ever, and it is now paid off. I decided to renew my credit history last month. 

I opened a 300 dollar secured card with Bank of America, who I bank with. This card is great and I paid it off in full last month. My scores increased about 70-100 points to the 650s.

I then applied for and got into a federal credit union card with a 100 dollar deposit. This was basically to make my cards graduate easier since having multiple open accounts was a requirement to past cards I was denied for.

Then I was on creditkarma and they recommended a card with credit one. This card is pretty bad, it has lots of fees and a 75 (!) Dollar annual fee. However I was pre-approved and I thought what the heck may as well. I regretted doing this but read online that closing it would damage my credit further.

So I ended up paying $475 for three cards and a $700 dollar credit line from a score of 550.. Obviously the credit one card and the credit union card are to be used only for building payment history (spending 10-30 dollars a month on them). 

I am 21 and can pay off all the cards with my income if I use them responsibly and I am organized enough to not miss payments (have gotten through 3 years of an economics degree somehow). However I feel like I'm making a mistake. 

What am I doing wrong here? What can I do in remediation?

Edit: update! So I cancelled the credit one card and it's quite likely they'll never bill me the annual fee. That was good, and since I never received the card and it was still in the application approval stage it might never show up on my credit history at all. Thanks a lot guys.",finance

3) It is expected that I and my spouse will owe IRS for 4500$ in year of 2017 for federal income tax, (NOT INCLUDING FICA). In this case, and if everything is eligible, the life learning time credit will be applied to maximum of 2000$, so we will owe to IRS for 2500$(=4500-2000)?

I imported my transaction history from Coinbase to Bitcoin Taxes, fed it all the necessary information.  Since I was paid in bitcoin, it couldn't find a matching buy, so it assumed a ""zero cost"" buy.  Surely that's an error?  Wouldn't I inherit the same cost basis as the person that actually purchased the bitcoin?

Regardless, assuming it's not, if bitcoin ever goes ""TO THE MOON"" overnight i'd be getting taxed 28% on it the moment I need to convert it for rent, utilities, etc. That's on top of 15% Self Employment Tax + 25% Income Tax.  Seems excessive no?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"My ""savings creep"" strategy to avoid lifestyle creep","This is a post that will probably only be relevant to people who are already living somewhat comfortably (no major debt, disposable income). I added it up, and I’m now saving (by my definition) almost $4000/year just with small extra/automatic payments here and there. This is on top of saving 10% of net toward retirement (employer puts in a generous contribution so I’m good there). I’ve done this gradually, so that I don’t notice these amounts coming from my paycheck/bank account. It’s helped me to hold on to more of my money while increasing my salary steadily over the last 4 years. Without this strategy I would probably be blowing through that $4k on incidentals and little luxuries. 

I had drained my savings in 2012 on major home upgrades, so had to focus on rebuilding that while also preparing for an anticipated new car purchase. I started putting $750 into monthly savings and socking away whatever 1099 income I earned from freelance work. During this time I contributed a nominal amount toward retirement because I was focused on short-term savings. Put a healthy down payment on the car, and ended up with a $333 payment over 5 years. At that point my savings still wasn’t where I wanted it to be, so I continued putting $500/month there. 

I rounded up the car payment to $350 for the first 18 months or so. Easy to do, and over the life of the loan would come to $1020, allowing me to pay it off 3 months early. I was now consistently contributing $850/month toward combined savings &amp; car purchase, where before I had been contributing $750. I crept up to saving $100 extra per month that otherwise I would have spent on whatever. 

I refinanced the house and ended up with a monthly payment of $XX14. I started rounding that up to $XX00—an additional $86 toward principal. Then I upped the car payment to $375. I started earnestly saving for retirement again, so the $500 I’d been putting into monthly savings went there. My savings was healthy by this point but I kept the monthly transfer amount set at $100, just to be putting something in. I also started paying an extra $100/month in federal tax withholding, because I often earn a fair amount of 1099 income in the last quarter of the year and then get stuck with a large tax burden to pay early the next year. 

At this point I’m saving—meaning, putting into investments, savings account, or toward known expenses rather than spending on non-necessities—over $300 month more than I was when I started. The total picture is more complicated, because I’m also paying less in interest on the house and more on principal due to the refinance, and getting the tax benefit of retirement contributions again. I cut some small expenses, like cable, and picked up some new ones, like yard service. 

I know this strategy has its limits; some will say I’m foolish for having an extra $100 withheld on taxes, when I could put that money into an interest-bearing account. But it works for me because I don’t feel any pain and it’s convenient. Everything comes directly out of my paycheck or bank account through auto payment. I'm also just averse to being in any sort of debt and prefer to pay things off even when I don't get a big financial advantage from doing so. When the car is paid off (about 6 months early) I’ll round that amount up to $400 and put it toward mortgage principal or retirement, or some combination. This will prevent me from suddenly feeling rich with extra disposable income, and keep me disciplined toward the long term.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on paying off my 30 year mortgage in 15 years,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I recently closed on my first home and have been contemplating the best method to pay off my mortgage early.

Mortgage details:

* Type: 30 Year Conventional
* Amount: ~$252,000
* Interest Rate: 2.375% fixed
* Monthly payment (interest + principal): ~$980
* Total interest paid after 30 years: **~$100,584**


Initially I was crunching the numbers to figure out what the extra payment(s) to principal would be monthly or annually to pay it off in 15 years.

For anyone curious:

**Additional monthly principal payment**

* Monthly payment amount: $1,665.53 per month ($686.12 monthly increase)
* Interest saved: $52,791.37
* Total interest paid after 15 years: **$47,793.45**


**Additional yearly principal payment**

* Annual payment amount (first of the year): $8,144.48 annually
* Interest saved: $54,123.98
* Total interest paid after 15 years: **$46,460.84**

So paying the mortgage off early via payments to principal will save me roughly 50k in interest over 15 years.

After thinking about it some more I began to wonder if I should instead take the money I would make towards the extra principal payments and invest it in index funds. Given the relatively low interest rate on my mortgage I only need to make an average return of 3% over 15 years to come out ahead.

I know past performance is no indication of future performance but the 10-year total return on SPY (for example) is well over 3%. Granted the markets have been in quite the upswing the last decade or so.

I started watching cryptocurrency starting in 2012. I watched Bitcoin jump from 8usd to 10usd, and then 12usd. I did not think of investing in Bitcoin or its ecosystem, because of its volatility and lack of merchant acceptance. I forgot about Bitcoin as quickly as I learned about it, and lived my life once again in ignorance. Bitcoin then appeared again on the radar several weeks before the Mt.Gox hacking due to the large mainstream media coverage. Over the next few weeks, I watched it skyrocket from $200 to a peak of $1300 before taking a nosedive from the hack; and once again Bitcoin left my daily thoughts as soon as it came.

And now I am back here again, this time doing actual research, reading whitepapers, and learning the functions, processes, and ecosystems of cryptocurrencies. This time, I believe will be different. This time, we have genuinely struck fear into the established systems and the fat cats in their ivory towers. They are combining their might in both power and influence via the media to attack and destroy us. In the recent weeks, they spread fear and doubt - spreading rumours like China banning all cryptocurrencies when in reality, they wanted to ban only exchanges, and Jamie Dimon with his loudest proclamation yet, that Bitcoin is a fraud. They presently have the status quo and will do everything possible to retain their position of influence and power. 

Right now, there is a war beginning, a battle between Bitcoin and the US dollar. Crypto vs fiat. Every fiat currency you switch into cryptocurrencies is a swift, decisive kick in the groin to the establishment. There are many powerful players dependent on the US dollar being the world currency, such as large federal governments, wealthy, politically influential people, and the global military-industrial-congressional complex. They have substantial influence to keep their fiat US dollar in power. Armed with decades of experience in mass persuasion, military might, and absolute control of mainstream media, the fiat players are ready to crush us, and even kill us if necessary.

Now, taking aside that none of us suffer permanent injuries, and the internet does not collapse from war, suppose that Bitcoin becomes the new global currency, how then would we feed ourselves, clothe our families, and house our loved ones? Presently, I only see two solution - the US dollar ""hard forks"" into Bitcoin, or we create our own ecosystem and economy.

The first solution is a uniform replacement of the US dollar with Bitcoin, with an arbitrarily set ratio of US dollars to Bitcoins. Life continues as normal, and now every person across the globe deals in Bitcoin instead of US dollar. You buy a house for 1BTC instead of $100,000US. However, this does not solve the problem of the bloated bureaucrat. Those who are presently influential and wealthy will still be influential and wealthy. We have not, to be topical, ""drained the swamp.""

The second solution would be to create our own ecosystem and economy. The beginning steps of this would be firstly taking control of a large land mass outside of government jurisdiction, growing food via farming and herding, and lastly operating a distribution channel that can send the aforementioned meats, grains, and vegetables from the fields into homes around the world. This solves the problem of operating truly outside of bureaucratic control, and at the same time, establishes cryptocurrency as the beginnings of a sustainable and recognised economy. Once we are able to feed ourselves independently from the present systems at hand, we can then focus on housing, clothing, and eventually establishment of our own internet, scientific research, and creative output. It is my hope that in our lifetime, we will see an end of the US world hegemony, and the creation of an independent ecosystem not reliant on an outdated sluggish government system. 

As these are my initial thoughts, I would like to pass the floor to the minds of Reddit. Please critique and offer suggestions on how might we improve this idea, and ways that we could turn this idea into action.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"Delaware approved the chain of shares to track, have an important impact","David Murdoch of the Delaware Court of Justice in the United States paid an additional $ 2.74 per share to its shareholders after privatizing Dole Foods. Shareholders' lawyers submitted a claim form and submitted claims for more than 49 million shares. The only problem is that the company has only issued $ 36.7 million in stock.

Delaware's deputy governor spoke on the dilemma:

""The problem is the unexpected results of the top-down federal solution that threatened Wall Street's paperwork crisis in the 1970s, through non-mobile stock policies, Congress and the United States The Securities and Exchange Commission used the technology of the depositary system, large bills and centralized books in the 1970s to solve the crisis, while the distributed book technology, by maintaining multiple current copies of the single and comprehensive stock ownership books, Provides a potential technical solution. ""

Delaware approved block chain

Delaware took note of the problem in early August, and the firm abandoned the inefficient centralized system and maintained the list of stockholders through the chain chain, which was supported by the government.

Block chains are able to record stock ownership and allow companies to quickly and easily find all of their current stock holders and historical records of company stock holders at any point in time. This is very useful, such as for the determination of the shareholders should not pay the dividend.

For this reason, when the Delaware law allows the use of block chains to record equity ownership, more than one million companies, including more than half of all listed companies, are able to immediately follow the chain chain to track ownership of shares.

personalfinance,"Getting married in a week, wanting some advice about combining finances (US-CA)","Hey PF,

As per the title, I'm getting married to the woman of my dreams in a week. We've talked at length about finances post-wedding, and we both want to consolidate our finances, but we're spread over so many accounts I want to know the best way to go about it.

I want some more sets of eyes on our plan and want to know what's worked for people in similar situations.

Here's our basic info:

* I'm 25, employed at a software company. Make $65,000/yr before taxes with some potential for overtime. Company offers 401(k) but doesn't match. Will probably get 4-5% raise at the end of the year.
* She's 24, worked at our alma mater for a few years but has just gone back to school to get her teaching credential. Currently takes home ~$100/week in cash from babysitting, otherwise she will not be working until spring 2019.

Here's our financial situation:
##Me
###Liquid Cash
* Checking, savings, and emergency fund account with Credit Union from my hometown in Oregon - I live in California now (mostly depleted due to paying for wedding, these are my main accounts)
* Savings account with Chase (~$1000)

###Retirement/long-term
* Brokerage account with USAA (~$750)
* Roth IRA with USAA (~$7500)
* Traditional 401(k) through work - 7% contribution going up to 9% next year (~$9000)

###Credit cards and Debt
* Credit Union Visa @ 12% with no rewards
* USAA Platinum Visa @ 10% from USAA
* Amazon Prime Rewards Visa @ 23% from Chase
* Costco Executive rewards @ 16% from Citi
* Alaska Airlines Visa Signature @ 17% from Bank of America

Never carried a balance on any of them.

* ~$18,000 in federal student loans, $350/month payment

##Her
###Liquid Cash
* Checking with Bank of the West (~$400)
* Checking and Savings with Bank of America (~$1000 but depleting quick for wedding)

###Retirement/Long-term
* none so far

###Credit Cards and Debt
* Bank of America Cash rewards (~$2000 balance)
* ~$28,000 in federal student loans (this includes the $4000 she just took out for this semester, and will go up by another $4000 by the end of her time at school) - these are deferred because she's in school now.

##Our Plan

We want to have a joint account where most of our money goes (for joint expenses, paying debt, etc) and retaining personal checking accounts for ""fun"" money. We're not sure about how to handle ""joint"" credit cards and what to do with that. Advice in this area is much appreciated. So with that objective I was thinking about doing the following:

* Close my Chase savings account
* Close Bank of the West
* Close emergency fund account at my credit union
* Cash out my stocks (we'll be barely scraping by on one income this year and I fear we will need this money to pay her credit card debt/have some liquid cash buffer)
* Make joint savings, Emergency Fund, and checking at Ally bank - this will be our primary account together
* 90% of income to joint Ally checking, 10% of income (5% each) goes into our respective ""personal"" checking accounts (mine at credit union, hers at B of A)
* Pay off her credit card ASAP
* Slowly rebuild emergency fund

Any improvements y'all could suggest? I really want to consolidate down to as few accounts/institutions as possible to simplify our financial picture as we start out as husband and wife.

personalfinance,Negotiating down the balance on some untouched debt?,"I know you can negotiate with collectors, I just have no idea *how*. I have two debts from when I was 19, didn't have insurance, and had to visit the ER. I didn't have consistent, gainful employment until about a year ago, and now that I've got a stable environment I feel ready to pay these down.

But the debt's been sitting there, untouched, for the past four years, and the accumulated interest is now roughly half of the original balance. The first one is pretty little; principle of $257, now $437 owed. The second is a bit bigger; $1,675 principle, $2,473 total.

Apart from the occasional letter, the collection agency hasn't done much in attempting to recover the debt. That might change as the statute of limitations draws closer; it's six years in my state. (Assuming, however, that the clock runs out on the debt, does it still appear on your credit report? I have never been clear on that.)

Now, if I pay it, what is the wisest way to go about it? I'm deciding between waiting until tax return season and using a lump sum to get a discount, or simply negotiating a lower amount &amp; interest rate up front for payments.

I don't know what a reasonable offer would be; I'd like to at least bring the amount down to the principle and not pay all that interest, but I don't know if that's realistic. How do you negotiate with collectors?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Curious why no one here seems to notice that the Komodo team predicted and solved many of the problems crypto faces today? Am I missing something?,"Disclosure (Long one): I hodl Komodo (obviously). My lowest purchase is $1.19 and highest is about $3. The majority of my holdings in Komodo simply come from redistributed gains from NEO, which were traded in a ~10KMD to ~1 NEO, so I've neither lost nor gained overall, but just had holdings mostly subject to cryptomarket value. I also long-term hodl: Nexus, Gnosis, Rialto, Agrello, MYST, and a few others; my mind goes blank.


Somewhere around 30-40% of my portfolio is KMD.


A word about my emotional state in this market (i.e. I'm calm): About two months ago I made the habit of harvesting my gains back to my fiat bank account, so I have almost no actual Fiat in the market. If the whole cryptomarket fails, or just my favorite coin, all I've lost is my gains, no actual hard-earned usd. This dilutes my earnings if the market goes back up, but I don't lose a minute of sleep or sit around checking my phone every fifteen minutes anymore. That last part makes it worth it. My leftover portfolio is well into the five figure range, but if it disappears, oh well!


Last piece of disclosure (I'm trying very hard to be 100% transparent here, so that we can have an honest discussion and I can learn), after I bought into the Komodo project I reached out to the team and volunteered to help, for free. They took a look at my resume and offered me some paid temporary freelance work. 


They recently paid me in full and I haven't had much time to contribute since then. I am not under contract with them. I can just sell all my earnings from them and walk away; I'm not going to, because I like Komodo and what it can do for my children's future. 


I am NOT being paid for THIS post, nor any other I have made on this account. I am doing this on my own personal time. I could be at the gym by now, but I woke up and looked at r/cryptocurrency, yet again didn't see anyone realizing what I think I've seen in Komodo, and I got distracted writing this super-long wall of text post before heading off on my day. :P


So now you know my history with Komodo.


Obviously, I'm here to talk about the upsides of Komodo, but I hope that by being fully transparent you can know that I'm not here to just promote, but rather to get a more honest look at what's going on.


It does me no good in the long run to just hear what I want to hear. I'm not after just a quick buck.


I'm anti-Federal Reserve Bank, anti-Centralized Banking System, and I want a world where currency happens on the terms of ""We The People."" 


I want any and all knowledge that can help me make a world where my children are not controlled by a small group of people in a fancy building pushing policies around, wrapping chains of student debt around our neck (of which I have one), and using an unlimited supply of money to force my children into behaviors that my children may otherwise not want to employ. 


(This is why I diversified much of my NEO into Komodo and Nexus, by the way.)


I **think** Komodo presents more solutions for our current cryptomarket's problems than any other coin, but I don't **know** that for sure.


**What I have to say/ask about Komodo:**


Over the last week we've seen a lot going on in the crypto market, and I'm sitting tight on my Komodo going, ""Yeah, Komodo's already got that handled."" And then no one else talks about it, and I go...hmm...I guess I'll just buy some more while the price is still low?


At the top of the list: China temporarily bans fiat-to-crypto exchanges and ICOs, and are now whispering rumors that they might confiscate mining equipment. There's also whispers of a People's Bank of China making its own crypto.


The Komodo team foresaw this years ago and has a **working** solution on the backend of their product.


(Yep, emphasis on the ""working"" part of it. Also, emphasis on the ""backend"" part of it, as their GUI is not far along yet; you should only use their command line client.)


(Also, the specific person on their team who foresaw all this is their lead developer, jl777. He has been in crypto for a long time and...as far as I can tell...he's unusually perceptive. You have to have a conversation with him to fully understand what I mean.)


A few weeks ago Komodo tried to tell the world about their solutions in a much-hyped announcement--they were extremely excited as it was the culmination of years of coding away in seclusion--but because they're blockchain engineering nerds, with no marketing knowledge, nor presentation skills, their livestream announcement was an abysmal failure.


It consisted of three computer guys in black t-shirts guys, standing in a dingy room, trying to explain over a bad-microphone/laptop, with foreign accents, something that almost no one could understand.


It was a failure of a presentation and most make-a-quick-buck investors just got frustrated and walked away. But there were those, like me, who kept our attention focused, sifted through the noise, and listened until we fully understood what they were actually saying.


Komodo has built-in, decentralized, zk-SNARK initial coin offerings. The team calls them ""dICOs.""


dICOs are completely anonymous and decentralized initial coin offerings: both the developer of the ICO and the purchaser can do their business in complete privacy, with no central point of control by which an authority figure (i.e. China) could stop the issuer or purchaser.


If anyone, even an innovative Chinese-citizen hiding in motherland China, wants to make a new cryptocurrency, they can do that. 


Yet again, regulation fails against decentralization.


The dICO is something entirely new, and as far as this layman crypto investor can tell, it's cool.


The Komodo team put together a blog post afterwards that more clearly explains their achievement: https://blog.komodoplatform.com/the-decentralized-ico-platform-9a3291b5cfa3


Disclosure: It was just at this point that I volunteered to help by assisting in writing this article, along with about 5 other team members. I initially offered to do it for free; they paid me anyway.


Komodo uses zk-SNARK technology, which is a term that more people should be paying attention to. 


If you do a google search for zk-SNARK, you'll find that Vitalik Buterin referenced them about a year ago as the ""holy grail"" of cryptocurrency privacy when combined with dAPPs. 


It basically means that the way the code executes there is ""zero knowledge"" (i.e. the ""zk"" in zk-SNARK) leftover in the public domain of what happens when the purchases/exchanges occur. Because there is ""zero knowledge"" leftover on the public blockchain, there is ""zero"" way of tracing user behavior.


Komodo's zk-SNARKs do the exchange part; an anonymous-user dAPP is therefore actually already possible on Komodo (I don't fully understand this part, so please correct me if I'm wrong).


(The is the same thing that NAVcoin is trying to do, but has yet to deliver a working solution.)


The way I **think** an anonymous dAPP would work is that the Komodo-related dAPPs are local to the users machines and all of the Komodo blockchain interaction happens via zk-SNARK. You might have to use TOR, a VPN, and a MAC address spoofer if you want to even have your initial connection to the blockchain undetectable, but that's just for the most paranoid of situations.


If this is true, then...isn't the fact that it's a working product a big deal? Or am I just completely off in left field? Can a bunch of other currencies do this already that I don't know about? If so, I'd like to know, seriously.


Secondly, atomic swaps.


There's a big thing right now about how Charlie Lee just did an atomic swap between Bitcoin and Litecoin.


This is super cool news and I'm glad of it.


But everyone seems to think this is a first. As far as I can tell, the Komodo successfully did this back in May, and I think ARK (with ACES) and maybe several others have done it too. ? 


Here's a demo from Komodo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBv3IIFUvk


You can scroll through their YouTube history also; they have lots of nerdy videos with a camera pointed at the thrilling sight of a command line on a computer screen.


Briefly, an Atomic Swap is a blockchain-to-blockchain exchange. You don't have to go through something like Bittrex or Coinbase to get a different crypto. You just swap for someone directly.


Komodo's behind-the-scenes team, SuperNET, developed a thing called barterDEX. It basically renders obsolete all the current exchanges. You can enter your initial fiat money through fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies (which are about to be provided by Monaize) and then swap directly for your crypto of choice on the barterDEX exchange.


Pretty much any crypto that is atomic-swap compatible will be barterDEX compatible, so you should have a larger range of currencies to buy than you would find on somewhere like Bittrex.


**Even more importantly: This removes Bitcoin as a Central Point of Control!!! This is one of the facts that I'm just scratching my head over, wondering why no one else has noticed this.**


Exchanges have created a monopoly over the KYC purchase of Bitcoin, which means that if you want to buy a crypto like MYST, you have to first buy Bitcoin, and then buy MYST.


**This one element in the market is a SCAM. It artificially inflates the price of Bitcoin.**


I have to wonder that corporations like JP Morgan and other market manipulators know this, and are forcing the current system to stay in place long enough to suck in amateur investors' hard earned savings.


Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin lovers. I love Bitcoin and, after it gets decentralized, I will buy a ton of it for my grandkiddies.


But right now, its value is over inflated due to its ability to bottleneck the rest of the cryptocurrency market.


Remove it as a bottle neck and let it stand on its own, and its true value will be revealed. (And yes, I do believe that, one day, it will be worth $1,000,000, but not right away, and certainly not by inhibiting the growth of the rest of the cryptomarket. It will happen because of Bitcoin's place in history, and it will take a long time for Bitcoin to reach that status. And the value of the dollar will also probably fall...too...)


(P.S. I'm a US citizen, so wanting my USD to fall is kind of weird, but I hate the Fed.)


Komodo's barterDEX allows you to by-pass the Bitcoin bottleneck, thus allowing newcomers to skip all the fees and volatility of the bitcoin entryway point, and go straight for what you're looking for.


So, why do I think the price hasn't risen yet?


Here's the bad news: The Komodo wallet GUI is in serious need of attention from Komodo. In talking with them, they've explained to me that decentralizing the ICO along with privacy was just so time consuming they had to make the active decision to ignore the front-end development until the back-end was working. 


They talked about it in the AMA on their r/komodoplatform recently. Because they wanted to use zk-SNARK, they have to do everything from scratch. They can't just copy/paste the Bitcoin wallet that's been around for years and years, like many others do. (Nexus, which I also hodl, did this.)


If you go to use Komodo, do not use any of the GUI products, yet. Just download their command line version. 


You can find it here: https://support.supernet.org/support/home


Just scroll down and look for your version of the command line install.


This whole Komodo thing is still very much in ""Early Adopter"" mode. If you'd rather wait until they get the front-end working and smoothed out, then give it a few months.


For me, I'm willing to take the risk and time, since if this works, it seems like a really cool product.


Anyway. I guess that's enough from me now. There's my wall of text. Please feel free to tear me apart. I'll appreciate all insights, especially if they get me closer to building a future for my children where our choices are not motivated by a Central Banking System.


I could go back and edit this wall of text down...but I want to go to the gym. :P

personalfinance,Buying a new car with large student loan,"Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys. It was pretty unrealistic to get the Teslas. Will work on aggressively paying down the student loan debt and buy an affordable car when current cars die. 

----Original post----
Hello. My wife and I are resident physicians soon to graduate residency. Currently have about 800k student loan debt combined at 7% interest via fedloans (400k each). Income right now is $100k combined but will soon be $600k combined and it would be very easy for us to add $3k-$6k per month by doing ""overtime"" and working a weekend or two extra per month. We currently rent, $1700 per month, own 2 very old reliable cars which are aging (200k miles on Mazda And 300k on Subaru). We plan on continuing to rent or purchase a cheap condo where our mortgage would be around the same, or max around $2000 per month. 

We have no other debt and no also no retirement savings. So plan is to pay off student loan over 10-15 years (Will probably refinance to around 5-6% with SoFi), start saving for retirement now. We also want to have 1-2 children down the road.  

Now, we are both tech and environmentally minded and have always wanted a Tesla. We are both in our mid 30s and while all our college friends have families/ houses / etc and are living their life, we have sacrificed the time and relationships to become physicians. We have lived frugally all our lives and want to start enjoying it a bit.  I am thinking of a Model X (100k) for now and eventually a Model S in a few years (120k). I feel like this is affordable given our new salary. 

Am I being stupid? Is this realistic? Should I put my money elsewhere and just buy a regular affordable car? Thanks.

* Legends are NOT boosted by the current banner's class and/or color boost.


* Then to top it off imagine outside of a 2x rate your chance of pulling a rare character is less than one percent:


""without the double rates, it is roughly 0.78% to get a specific legend on a regular banner""


Then to add some more to this scam they manually set rates on junk characters that have nothing to do with the current banner:


* Bandai manually sets rates for individual characters (including junk characters) - even if they do not fit the current class/color boost.


Furthermore instead of being rewarded for playing longer it seems players who play religiously and pull religiously get their rates nerfed: 

* These rates may not reflect those adjusted for high volume players.""


I understand some of you may not play this game, but I believe has game consumers, it is important to stand united against a scam and support each other no matter what games we are playing . Thank you.


Some Solutions:

* Spread this link on any subreddit with Bandai Company
* bad reviews
* Facebook link share with:


The rates on global are worse than what you try to make us believe. We've gathered data that proves that not only you're lying about the rates, but that you take a certain unknown player variable that determines what the player gets from the pulls, thus punishing active and paying players with less than less active and more casual players. Enough proof has be gathered which is strenghtening our assumption. We have to believe, until you prove us wrong by being as transparent as you're on japan, that the rates you claim to offer are simply wrong. We simply have no transparency and based on our gathered data there is no reason to believe you as a company anymore, thus we lost our faith in you as an honest company. We feel like we're taking advantage of. We as a community expect your statement. We just want to be treated with the same respect and transparency that OPTC Japan has, meaning you must display the rates of the pulls, give the same rates that OPTC Japan has and implement the legend after 3 multipulls. Untill you do not do this, I won't spend any money on this game. I won't support anti-consumer practices. refer to this link: https://redd.it/71ulgr

personalfinance,[credit] I need clarification the minimum payment clause on my new credit card. is confusi,"I recently was accepted for a new credit card through my credit union. Over the last few years I have been slowly repairing and building my credit. It has really improved. 

Now in my second phase to make my status excellent. I figured getting a card through my credit union would be the best bet because of their low interest rates. 

I've tried researching for the right answer and even used calculators to figure out what my minimum will be but the language has me stumped.

It starts off typical:  

*2% of your outstanding balance (""New Balance"") or $50.00 whichever is greater. If your outstanding balance is $50.00 or less you agree to pay your balance in full. Your total minimum payment due each month is the minimum monthly payment...* 

Now maybe I'm over thinking this and a few of the calculations certainly made my confusion worse. I read this pretty clear though. This sounds to me like if I have an outstanding balance of any amount above $50.00 I can pay it in instalments using the 2% of the outstanding balance method but that my monthly payment wouldn't ever go below $50.00. It can go higher but only when the 2% of the total outstanding balance calculates to be greater than the default minimum of $50. 

The part confusing me is: (*whichever is greater.*) 

Is this referring to: greater than the minimum monthly payment of $50.00? Or is the language stating that the formula they use to determine a monthly minimum payment changes once the outstanding balance is greater than the threshold of that which is the default formula? So if that should happen; a new minimum is then determined by whatever the sum of 2% of the outstanding total is. If that is the case, then the minimum would drop to a much lower monthly minimum. 

I hope that makes sense because my brain is now soup. *Augh!*

Am I my understanding correct? If my first assumption is correct, that sounds untypically steep. I can pay $50 a month but it defeats my purpose of what I plan on doing with the card. I want to use the card for my business expenses until I get my profit and loss spreadsheet done and then I'll apply for a business credit card. 

My plan is to charge some expenses as a way to invest in small but necessary purchases approximately $300 to $600. I purposely want to make small payments while still paying $15 to $20 over the minimum. As I get close to paying the debt off, pay the remaining off with a full payment. Afterwards, I would do it all over again. 

I don't want to make any more than 10 installments and ideally I want my target to be around 6. I realizing this hits close to $50.00 but I would have a lot more control over my target if the minimum were even $25 or better if it were the typical $15. 

In my business I have on seasons and off seasons. I can make improvements to slowly build the growth of my business during the off season, and then use the busy season to pay down my debt, which responsibly funds the growth and development, while building both my personal credit and eventually my business credit.  

If my base is $50, then to accomplish my goals, I would have to pay $85.00 to a $100. I might as well have a charge card then, if that's the case.",finance

investing,The anatomy of a bubble,"In Kindleberger’s classic, Panics, Manias and Crashes, he expands on earlier work by Minsky in Stabilizing an Unstable Economy. They found that no two bubbles are alike, but they all share a common structure. Below we’ve summarized the five key stages of market bubbles that allow you to identify them as they happen.

 
1. Displacement:
Bubbles start with a displacement, some sort of a shock to the system. A displacement could be war (usually the end of war), a major political change, deregulation, a technological innovation, a financial innovation or a shift in monetary policy. The displacement creates a new opportunity in at least one sector of the economy. One example is the widespread adoption of computers, the internet and email in the US in the 1990s, which set the stage for the dot-com bubble.
 
2. Boom:
A boom begins, especially in the favored sector, as optimism grows. There is a positive feedback loop as the price of stocks, one or more commodities, and/ or real estate increase, which then leads to greater consumption and investment, which leads to greater economic growth. Credit fuels the boom. Borrowers become more willing to take on debt and lenders are increasingly willing to make riskier loans as economic prospects improve. This expansion of credit isn’t necessarily provided by banks. The Tulip Mania in 1636 in Holland, for example, was fueled by vendor-financing from bulb sellers. However, banks have been the predominant source of credit since the 19th century. Banks can expand credit further and more rapidly than vendors could. To make matters worse, new banks are often formed in the expanding economy. This causes banks to further loosen their credit standards to avoid losing market share.
 
3. Euphoria:
A boom transforms into euphoria as “rational exuberance morphs into irrational exuberance.” There are hundreds of books documenting the endless possibilities of the economy (e.g. Japan as Number One and The East Asian Miracle in Japan in the 1980s, and Dow 40,000 in 1999). Participants extrapolate recent price increases into the future, expecting prices to continue to increase at unsustainable rates. Some, especially industry insiders, realize that there is a bubble, but many continue to participate in the market, believing they can sell to “the greater fool” before the implosion.
However, more and more euphoric outsiders begin to enter the market as media attention grows and individuals see others getting rich. As Kindleberger quoted in Manias, Panics and Crashes, “there is nothing as disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” The rush of capital causes a further increase in prices, and sound investment shifts to wild speculation. Individuals invest with the hope of short-term capital gains, and debt compounds as people borrow or trade on margin to further speculate. Money seems free. Fraud is also common at this stage, although it typically is not exposed until later.
 
4. Distress:
At some point, an event hits that causes a decline in confidence and a pause in the explosive price increase. The event could be a bankruptcy, a change in government policy, a piece of news (real or rumored), or a flow of funds from the country. The response to these events differs in bubbles because of the debt build-up. People who financed their purchases with borrowed money become distressed sellers as the income on their assets drops below their interest payments. Kindleberger noted, “The economic situation in a country after several years of bubble-like behavior resembles that of a young person on a bicycle; the rider needs to maintain forward momentum or the bike becomes unstable.” A slowing bike is actually a better metaphor than a bubble.  Sometimes panic sets in immediately, but in other cases it can take up to several years for the crisis to fully develop. In the dot-com crisis, panic happened almost immediately, while it took a few months for panic to set in during the Great Financial Crisis (see the chart below).
 
 
5. Panic:
Not everyone realizes that a crisis is unfolding at the same time. Insiders and institutional investors usually sell first. Once other market participants realize the gravity of the situation (perhaps after another major event), run-of-the-mill selling turns into outright panic as everyone tries to get out at the same time. Prices plummet and levered companies increasingly go bankrupt as they can’t meet their interest payments. The sell-off typically spreads to other sectors and other countries. As bankruptcies mount, banks can begin to fail, further drying up credit when it’s needed the most. The panic continues until a lender of last resort convinces investors that cash will be made available to meet demand, or prices fall so low that value investors start to buy back in.
Kindleberger bubble cycle

One crisis can often lead to the next bubble in the same or another country. For example, the pricking of the bubble in Japan in the early 1990s led to a surge of funds to Asia. The crisis in Asian countries in 1997 and 1998 led to funds flooding into the United States. This contributed to the dot-com bubble. Furthermore, as Kindleberger noted, The mild and short recession in 2001 after the massive implosion in U.S. stock prices resulted from the abrupt change in policy of the Federal Reserve and its rapid and aggressive move to reduce interest rates… The Fed reduced short-term interest rates to 1 percent and since the inflation rate was nearer 2 percent, real short-term interest rates were negative. One result was a boom in the housing market; house prices increased sharply in New York, Boston, Washington, and Los Angeles. Skeptics wondered whether the deflationary effects of the implosion of the stock price bubble had been largely offset by a bubble in the housing market.

Could the response to the Financial Crisis have sown the seeds to yet another bubble or bubbles? With historic lows in S&amp;P volatility, is there trouble brewing under the surface? Only time will tell, but history is a prescient guide.

personalfinance,Advice for short term investment while waiting to buy a house,"My wife and I are looking to do something with our savings account rather than leaving it with our bank making .90% APY.  With our current savings trend were planning on seriously looking to buy a house in spring of 2019. 

We currently have about $65,000 that we are looking to do something with. We recently met with a financial adviser (family friend) who was suggesting to put $15,000 in an online bank for a higher interest rate and easy accessibility if needed, and to invest $50,000 with Lord Abbett Short Duration income fund, which projects about 3.89% yield, issue being however they will take .75% of what we have invested quarterly as maintenance/for continue use of their financial services. We kind of realized we wouldn't be saving much more then if we just invested all with an online bank or a 1-2 year CD.

What are some other options we should be looking into to help us save some extra for buying a house? We feel our options (for the extra $50,000) now are either full in an online bank, a CD, or investing ourselves with vanguard.",finance

personalfinance,How to approach paying off medical debt sent to collections?,"Hi guys,

I just recently got engaged to my fiancée and in preparation for combining finances I wanted to get my credit and debt figured out beforehand. A little bit of information before I dive into the debt itself: I'm currently a student for Mech. E and Physics with about two years left. My schooling is paid for by family, and my living expenses are paid for by Federal and State grants as well as some part-time job work here and there. My fiancée is graduated and works full time as a GIS analyst and programmer with three different companies. She has a credit card that is paid off in full every month with no debt and a credit score in the high 700's. I have no other personal debt and do not use a credit card, everything I buy such as vehicles are paid off in full. 

A couple years ago I was in a streak of three accidents over two years. At the time I had given insurance involved all the information I had regarding treatment and medical expenses. It seems though they missed paying off some of my expenses as a while later I was receiving calls asking to make payments on debts related to the accidents. At first I told them that I had given insurance the necessary information to pay off these debts and to contact them if they needed money, after that I simply ignored calls and letters. I know, not the smartest choice. For the next couple years I simply kept ignoring calls and letters as I had no need credit. Now, I am trying to get my debts sorted and figured out. I did a credit check and a report through TransUnion (my first time for each). My credit report came back as 520 and my report had two debts sent to collections for $835 and $1374 respectively. Neither of these two have a collector name that I recognize from phone calls or letters. In fact, the only letters I have received are from a third collector related to an ambulance ride and they are asking for $1847. 

My question is: where do I start to fix my credit so that I don't ruin my future wife's credit? I have the opportunity to pay off these debts in full by loaning money from my family, but I don't know which debts are actively affecting me, or how to go about paying them off in an efficient matter. Do I respond to the letters I've been receiving for the collector not mentioned on my credit report? (which by the way say ""we have withheld further action based on your promise to pay. Please make a payment of $xx.xx by the due date of xx/xx/xx."" I have not spoken to them or promised to pay). How do I go about contacting the collectors who show up on my report but do not call or mail me? Any help on getting started would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Selling and Buying a house,"Hello r/Personal Finance

I was wondering if you can review my thought process of selling my house and moving to another.  The intent is to get a 3rd party point of view to see if my thought process is correct from a financial standpoint, tax standpoint, logistics standpoint, etc.
_______
**Background –**
Purchased house in 2009 located in Orange County, CA and lived in the house since purchase; totaling to 8 years.  Parents lend me $60,000 (13.73%) as part of the down payment to the $437,000 purchase price.  I’m planning on moving to a better area and seeking to sell my house for $600,000 and purchase a new house for $600,000.  I’ll be paying back my parents 13.73% of the sales proceeds.  Currently, the title is under me and my sister.
______
**Financial -**
I’m planning on selling for $600,000 and below is a breakdown of the proceeds for the next house’s down payment:	

Sales Price = $600,000
Remaining Mortgage Principle = $300,000
Selling Agent Fee (1.5%) = $9,000 *Note:  I reached out to a colleague who happens to work as an real estate agent on the side; thus the low commission fees.*
Buying Agent Fee (2.0%) = $12,000
Closing Cost (1.5%) = $9,000
Pay back Parents for initiate down payment (13.73%) = $82,400
Proceeds = $300,000 - $9000 - $12,000 - $9000 - $82,400 = $187,600
  	Target New House Price = $600,000
	Down Payment = $187,600 (31.26%)
	New Mortgage = $412,400 (68.74%)
	Monthly Mortgage = $2090 (at 4.5% interest rate)
The aforementioned is what I’m hoping what the outcome would turn out, but I was hoping r/PersonalFinance can comment on the logic on this.

•	I have some concerns about estimating closing cost.  Any input is appreciated.

•	Would I need to find my own escrow agent?

______
**Tax –**
From what I gathered, captain gain from the sale of my house can be excluded up to $250,000 if I file as single or $500,000 if I file jointly with my spouse in my return.   In addition, I have to live in the house 2 out of the 5 years.  With the example above, on paper the proceeds would be $270,000.  I’ve been living there since 2009 so that’s not a problem, but my wife lived there since we got married which is 1.5 years ago. 
*Since my wife lived in the house for 1.5 years rather than 2 out of the 5 years to avoid the captain gain tax, would this be an issue?

•	Since my wife lived in the house for 1.5 years rather than 2 out of the 5 years to avoid the captain gain tax, would this be an issue?

•	Would having my sister on the title present an issue?

•	After selling my house, is there a time frame that requires me to purchase another house to avoid tax penalties?

______
**Logistics –**
I think is the most subjective part of my concerns and I know it depends on what I want to do.  I was hoping if Reddit can share their experience on the transitional process from selling to buying.  I feel it’s a rush process to sell and all of the sudden you don’t have a roof over your head and I would start rushing to buy the next available house for sale.  A buddy of mine indicated that he stayed at his parents until they found something.  I was thinking of renting out the house I will potentially sell until I found something.  Any thoughts?
______
Overall I’m seeking from Reddit to provide their input and comment on the aforementioned logic.  I’m trying to see if I’m missing something before I make this big decision to sell.",finance

My current situation:  
I graduated in May of 2016 with an Engineering Degree. I didn't have the best grades, but did decent enough. I struggled finding a job for about 8 months after graduating. In that time I worked making around $12/hr while my wife worked as well making some cash. We have a son at home who is now 1.5 years old. In that time we had to use credit cards to help supplement some expenses (Stupid I know, but we had no choice and I figured once I landed a job I would be able to make it up). So earlier this past year I landed a job that payed me a $55,000 a year. A godsend I thought. The issue was the job rushed through employment and wanted me to move to the other side of the country. I had no idea how my expenses would add up when looking for a house, so I found a decent place to rent, figuring the nice salary would be more than enough. Well now after taxes, healthcare, dental, 401k, etc. My paychecks come out to about $1266 every 2 weeks and it just stifles any amount of savings. Plus with my student loan now coming through at $300+ a month I'm basically in the red. Any ideas would be helpful.

Currently we're supplementing income with donating plasma (Just started) but that is an extra $300 a month between the both of us. I would like to get away from this, as I don't think it's an actual solution, more of a stopgap. Also, she makes some money through a side business she's starting, but it's not consistent enough to mention at the moment (maybe an extra $50 a month). This leaves no room for savings, which I would like, maybe $100-200 a month. I'm currently using excel and just now starting the YNAB app so its easier to track on mobile. $55,000 is a decent amount of money (Middle Class), but I'm just not sure how to make it work. My student loan is an Income Driven Plan that I was hoping it would be cheaper.  
Edit:  Adding check breakdown because people seem confused by how low my take home is. Also I assumed 4 weeks a month with 2 paychecks each month. I understand this underestimates my pay by 2 paychecks (since there are 52 weeks in a year vs 48 weeks), but seeing as both months with extra paychecks are gone until next year I'm keeping this assumption.

personalfinance,"Remote working from Jamaica for a US company, questions about taxes.","So I'm trying to understand US taxes as I've taken up a remote worker position at a California based company. I work remotely from Jamaica and get paid in USD. In Jamaica we have income tax brackets of 25% for those who make 1.5M JMD (about $11.5KUSD) and 30% for those who make more than 6M JMD(about $46K USD). I'd fall into the 30% bracket. The taxes I'd usually pay in Jamaica are income tax(30%), NHT (2%), NIS(2.5%), Education Tax(2%). The taxes may seem high but my income tax is only on my taxable income which is my Gross Income - My Income Threshold ($46KUSD). So anything above that is taxed at 30%. The other taxes are on my gross income.

Jamaica also has a tax law that states if I work abroad and pay taxes in that country then I exempted from paying taxes in Jamaica, however this is only if the income tax rate in the country I work is higher or the same as Jamaica, otherwise I have to pay the difference. All In all this system isn't so bad.

The problem now is my understanding of US taxes. If I understand correctly I fall into the 25% income tax bracket in the US, this is federal tax, I understand if I pay taxes in the states this is required. But what about Social Security, Medicare and State Income Tax, do I have to pay those? I won't be traveling to the US nor am I a resident and I don't have a Social Security number. Are there any other taxes I have to pay as a non resident alien? If I have to pay all these taxes, it works out better for me to just pay tax in Jamaica. Even accounting for just income tax, my taxable income is much lower than it would be in the USA.

I'm just trying to understand the US tax system and the laws that govern it, don't want to get myself into any trouble with either government.",finance

personalfinance,Looking on advice how to feel less like I'm living paycheck to paycheck,"**Updated details**

Hello all,

I feel as if I am continually finding myself almost out of money at the end of each pay period. Almost a decade ago I was several thousand dollars in debt and have since worked to pay that off. This has caused me to become very detailed and protective of my finances. As such, I am very hesitant to have a balance on my credit cards and try my best to forecast my finances for the next two pay periods via projected transactions.

I get paid on the 1st and 15th or the day prior if those dates land on a weekend or federal holiday. My paychecks are roughly $1104 every two weeks. I receive a housing allowance that automatically transfers to my leasing agency before it hits my account. This payment also included utilities.

I am married with no kids and my wife has a part time job that pays roughly $600 a month. I try not to include her paychecks into the finances as it is inconsistent. We have used her check mostly on frivolous items or emergency spending. She plans on obtaining a full time job as soon as possible. At that point, I will start accounting her income in our monthly finances. 

As mentioned earlier, I have become incredibly detailed with my finances. I have four checking accounts and one savings account. I use my checking accounts to separate my money and ensure I don't overspend. My paychecks are deposited into my ""bills"" account. I have projected transactions for each bill and I know how much money to leave in that account. Out of that pool of money I will transfer $250 each check to my groceries checking account, $175 to my insurance checking account (like an escrow), and then transfer some money into my savings account to use in my second pay period since I have less left over money. All extra money ($831) is transferred into my ""spending"" checking account. When I pay for anything that are not bills or groceries, I use this account. *Edit:* I think this is where I'm struggling. This spending is unregulated and is used for literally anything else not listed below.

So, I guess, how do I feel as if I'm not struggling? I want to say I have a solid grasp on my finances and I don't think I'm doing terrible, but what's up with the struggle? I have considered lowering my Roth IRA contributions but I fear that'll set me back on retirement. My wife is attempting to obtain a full time job as soon as she can, but it is hard to find something stable.

personalfinance,"Roth IRA vs. student loan debt (~$40k, but I'll have $17.5k cut in 5 years through government/teaching)","I currently have about ~$40,00 in loans, and I should have $5-10,000 in savings when I graduate in May, 2018. The top $10,000 has a 6% interest rate, and the others have around 3.8-4%. There's a loan repayment plan for teachers, where it will cut off $17,500 of my loans after 5 years of teaching. I'm living with parents, so I can put away a lot into my Roth IRA and student loans each year. I'll probably be making $45-50k teaching each year.

The thing is that I have to pay my loans so that I end up with $17,500 after 5 years of working, so I have to take that $40,000 and bring it down to $14,000 or so (since it will accrue interest and creep up to $17.5k). I'm not sure if there is some deferment plan for teachers that could get me around this situation.

Basically, with my savings, should I dump $5-10k into my loans first, or into a Roth IRA? Intuitively I'm thinking I should pay off the $10,000 at 6%, then max a Roth IRA, then bring my loans down to $14k.


I read this post before making this, though: 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5h6rhm/should_i_contribute_to_my_roth_ira_or_pay_off_all/

I'm thinking though that the Math probably works out in favor of the Roth IRA in the long-term, even before paying that 10% interest loan, because of how the initial $5500 in the Roth will continue to compound yearly for 38 years for me. I care more about the long-term than the short-term effect of ""getting rid of my loans."" The psychological effects don't really apply to me.

personalfinance,We sold our house. Now what? Student loans and second residence at play.,"My husband and I recently sold the house that I had bought before we were married. With the money we got from the sale, combined with money I have in my non-retirement accounts, we have enough to pay off my student loans, but we're not sure if that's the best move in our case. 

The complicating factor is that before we were married, my husband's dad bought a condo for him to live in, with an agreement that my husband would make the mortgage payments each month and eventually buy the condo. We also have enough money to buy the condo (without taking a mortgage out) now - but we don't have enough to buy the condo outright and pay off my student loans. 

We no longer live in the city where the condo is, so we are renting it out for now. But we would like to buy it soon so that we will have the option to sell it without paying capital gains. As things stand now, my husband's dad can't sell it without paying capital gains tax since it's not his primary residence. So we'd like to put the condo in our names so we can get the benefit of selling it when we move back to the city in the near future.

What would you do in our situation? Relevant numbers are below:

* My student loans: $243k (7.375% interest rate)
* Amount to pay off condo mortgage: $171k (4.99% interest rate)

personalfinance,Should I pay off a student loan by being given a loan from a friend?,"TL;DR - I'm 23 working a full-time job, wishing to go to law school next year. I have 2 private loans and 1 loan through FAFSA that I'm paying each off monthly with no worries. My private loan A is 20k+ at an interest rate of 10.625% while Private Loan B is 7k at 10.75%. My friend offered to loan me up to 10k in a contract to pay that towards my loans at a lowered interest rate at around 5%. Does this seem reasonable? 

Forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this as I'm not too sure, and just point me in the right direction if I'm wrong.

Hey guys, I'm 23 and I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to financing in general. I'm not a big spender like some of my friends and have a decent amount in my checking account in case for emergencies or anything else that requires immediate payment. 

I work a full-time job with benefits and am paying off student loans, 2 private and 1 government. I don't have any problems of paying them off as of right now due to my full time job and I'm still able to cushion my checking account every month after the payments (still live at home). However, my concern is that I want to go to Law School which isn't chump change and I understand that I'll need to apply for scholarships or do whatever I can do to lower tuition. 

Anyways, I was talking to one of my friends one day (he's a few years older, a big time saver, and has paid off all his loans). So we were talking about interest rates on loans and what mine were:

My private loan A is 20k+ at an interest rate of 10.625% while Private Loan B is 7k at 10.75%. 

He couldn't believe what my interest rates were and what I pay monthly (feel free to do the math if you're interested). So he just spitballed the idea that he should loan me around 10k at a lower interest rate so that I could pay less overtime and he could make that money back plus more over the next few years. At first I thought he was joking and that he was considering it at the back of his mind but today he texted me that he's going to get a contract in the works if I wish to do so. 

My questions are: Would I be able to pay off my student loans this way without running into penalties? What are the risks I should look at in the long term? How would this affect my credit? Any advice? 

Like I said, I'm not too sure about these things and I'm just trying to look out for my best interest in the long run. I was going to research more into it tomorrow as I'm off work, but I figured I'd ask for some advice here for a good sense of direction.",finance
personalfinance,"How does ""additional withholding"" help or hurt someone? (U.S. taxes)","I apologize if this has been posted before, I can't do a thorough search from the app. 

I had some questions about the ""additional withholding"" line on the W-4. 

If I understand correctly this is an option to pay additional taxes out of your check to cover anything you may owe the IRS at the end of the year so you don't have a tax bill. 

How does this work though, how is it calculated? 

If you elect to take an additional $10 per check for state and an additional $5 for federal is that just $15 per check they're taking from you? Twice a month (if you're paid bi weekly) for a total of $30 per month?   

If you have a tax bill that's a $180 (that made me chuckle) after 6 months you would have had the $180 taken out in extra withholdings, what happens with the money that's taken out for the remaining 6 months if you don't change it?

personalfinance,"In debt, need a vehicle NOW","I am 23, making $1000 a month stable income and between $200-$300 unstable income (dependent on how many hours/effort I want to put in my service job) with $800 expenses.

I have been borrowing a friend's vehicle for the past year because my car was repossessed. I am not sure if that debt has cleared because the car was sold or whether it still stands, but I am going to be finding that information out Monday.

My credit score is shit, but I am currently ""debt free."" My credit cards and student loans are paid off, but I do have a $800 personal loan from a friend that I am working on paying off. 

The problem is that my friend's vehicle was totaled this week. I work 40 hours a week at a small business with four different locations, each spread about 15 minutes apart, and I've spent so much of the last year trying to get my debt paid off that I haven't even thought about trying to fix my vehicle issue.

I don't have a vehicle. My friend doesn't have a vehicle. Our roommate is helping us out this week, but I need to find an immediate solution to this problem. I've probably got one to two weeks before I'm shit out of luck. 

I've run through some options, but would like advice on them and would definitely like to hear any I missed.

1) Public transportation. There is none within a 15 minute drive/30-45 minute walk from my home. We live in the middle of nowhere. Between work, buses run every hour, but are incredibly unreliable and don't match up with my shift times. I sometimes only have 30 minutes to get from one location to the next, so being able to drive myself is the most convenient option. I also work late nights, until 11:30/1AM, and buses stop at 10, so...there's that. 

2) Uber/Lyft/Taxi. It would obviously be expensive, and I would have to cut out all fun spending and even cut into my food budget. There's always the possibility that they'll be late or not show up at all. Benefits being no having to walk through giant parking lots and the wonderful bliss of feeling just a bit pretentious. Another downside is unnecessary social interaction really wears down on me, especially if I'm working more than 40 hours a week, and holiday season for my job is coming up which means my schedule will most likely jump to 60 hours a week.

3) Beg and plead with every friend I have with a vehicle to go out of their way to pick me up and drop me off on my schedule. I obviously don't want to ruin friendships though and they have their own, often busy, lives. 

4) Get my own vehicle on financing. My credit score is LOW. Like 400-ish area kind of low. I fucked up a lot and I'm working on fixing it, but it's still low, so I'd be depending on my income to be able to finance a vehicle. I have no co-signers. I have nothing saved up right now. Whether I have to go through a bank, a sketchy used car dealership, pay off my repossessed vehicle and maybe get it back (if possible, will find out Monday), or whatever else--if they'll finance me, I may just have to do it and work my ass off to pay it off sooner than the contract ends to avoid the insane interest rate I'm sure they'll be giving me.

5) Try to get a personal loan (I don't know what a reasonable amount here would be) and buy something used on Craigslist. I might be able to get a beater of some sort. I just need something mobile, something that can get me between Points A, B, C, D, and E, something that will get me through the incredibly shitty winter we are bound to have this year in Idaho. 

Family support and another personal loan from a friend are not options. 

If I don't find a vehicle, I will have to drop shifts and that means my hours and income are going to drop drastically. I have already talked to other employees about working at just one location, but they have their own schedules and their own lives and can only do that for so long before management starts to notice and just starts cutting my hours and giving them to those other employees. I HAVE to be able to move between locations 6 days a week. 

This is what I have right now--I start a paid internship in which I'll be making more half more my current income, but that won't be until March--so I'm not worried about long term financial repercussions right now. I just need something as soon as physically possible 

What are my options? Your advice? I'll take what I can get 

Edit:

Why bicycle isn't exactly an option:

It's incredibly unsafe where I live and work, even more so with the hours I work, and not time effective to get between work locations. I have a bicycle as a backup, but it will not do for what I need it for. 

It will also be physically impossible to ride a bicycle as soon as the snow hits here.",finance

I now have a job that pays well, and recently began making loan payments. Since then, I've heard SO many contradictory opinions on the best repayment method from my friends and family, and I don't want to make a move until I know what's correct. 


If I make the minimum payment on my loans each month, it's $150 a month. $100 of that goes to the loans, $50 of it goes to interest for the 4 separate loans (interest rates of about 3-4%). I think it's silly to spend 50% of my balance each month on interest, so I put together a super intense budget to get the loans all paid off in their entirety in the next 6 months by putting every spare dollar into payments. It will be tight, but I could do it and be entirely debt free. 


When I told some friends and family about this, they insisted that I should continue to pay only the minimum as student loans ""get forgiven"" after 7 or so years. A little research tells me this doesn't seem to be true, but I wanted to check here.

personalfinance,My parents are 64 and 57. They have no retirement savings. I am 26. What can I do to start preparing?,"My dad is 64. My mom is 57.
They immigrated to the U.S. decades ago away from their war-torn country, in search for a better life for themselves and their children. Both have had difficulties with jobs due to their lack of higher education and technical skills. My dad has seen layoffs and long periods of unemployment throughout the years. My mom was a stay-at-home-mom and worked several odd jobs throughout the years, mostly under-the-table. Last year, my dad and mom grossed $34k and $24k, respectively, and are on pace to do the same this year.

My three siblings, now in our 20s, had very little growing up and were in federal assistance programs to get by. We put ourselves through college and never asked our parents for any help for any financial situation. Three of us are working full-time now while still living at home with our parents because it's the best financial situation for us at the moment, but that will eventually change as life goes on. All the while the three of us have all been giving our parents money just to keep up with the expenses from bills, etc.

My parents have:

* no retirement savings
* &lt;$1k cash/liquid savings due to the cost of living and living paycheck-to-paycheck
* ~$170k left on the mortgage, the same house for ~30 years
* two auto loans still in repayment
* little to no credit card debt (brother and I voluntarily paid thousands of their CC debt)

Fact is, they cannot live without the financial support from their children, so we will continue to support them, but I want to work on a better plan. Their retirement plan is the support they'll receive from their children — for the rest of their lives. At this point, they may have to work the rest of their life and it makes sense to do so. But that may be too big of an ask if their age/health compromises their work situation in the future. They are great folks and we love them, and I want them to retire comfortably and with dignity. I could not be the person I am today with their support and sacrifice, so I am committed to plan their retirement.

Once they retire, we want to be as prepared as possible. **What more can/should we do now?**

My siblings and I are financially literate so we will take care of our finances first (i.e. our retirement funding, paying off debts, and saving up for the future). I have been giving tens of thousands since my university days up to today to support my parents. Our family finances have improved greatly in the past few years the moment my siblings and I got full-time jobs. However, it's still burdening to balance our financial goals with our parent's retirement even though it is voluntary on our part. My brothers and I gross &lt;$60k/year each, so it's a struggle right now.

Here are some of my rough plans for my parents:

* start an IRA for my parents so they can get the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)
* work on reducing their unnecessary spending, build a better budget, keep lifestyle creep in its place
* toying with the idea that we can start a family business to remove my parents from the fatigues of manual labor where they can operate it while in retirement
* look into their Social Security accounts to see what they're able to get in retirement
* investigate their mortgage and auto loans

ethereum,A couple of ideas as alternatives to unnecessary (or worse) ICO tokens,"There has been a lot of criticism about the Raiden ICO, and one of the most legitimate points being raised is that at first glance, the token seems unnecessary for the system's functionality, and only adds complexity instead. Another issue being raised is that the ICO could lead to a big &amp; ugly pump &amp; dump due to there being so much hype around Raiden, but also there probably being no reason (as far as we know at this point)  for the token to increase in value or generate income.

Having said that, the team has every right to ask for funding. So how could it be done in this situation? Here are a couple of ideas:

1. Do an ICO, but make the tokens purely honorary. The tokens could be untransferable and have 1-to-1 correspondence to ETH, so they would forever keep track of which address contributed how many ETH. These contributor addresses would be nice targets for any token airdrops for example. Or any kinds of gifts. I imagine Raiden could get at least a couple million $ like this. Of course the token would still be pointless, but problems with regulators and adding unnecessary complexity to the system would be avoided.

2. Have untransferable tokens with 1-to-1 relation to ETH as in 1), but instead of treating the contribution as a pure donation, treat it as a loan. Then pay a percentage (maybe even 100%?) of the fees to the contributors until the loan is paid back in full (if ever). It would be in the interest of many companies, DAOs to contribute even with a zero interest rate, as many of them are relying on Raiden to some extent anyway. And the same goes for any big holders of ETH or other Ethereum tokens, as a successful Raiden could boost the value of their holdings. This method would probably get more funding than the first, but there might be a little more risk with regulators (though still not much).",cryptocurrency

The main risks as I see them are 1) default; and 2) interest rate changes within that maturity window. Correct?

But for #2, wouldn't the market already have a very good idea what the interest rate change will be, say, in a 3-4 month window. So that risk is already priced in.

It just seems like these days laddering 3-4 month bonds is a better idea than online savings.

But I'd love to be corrected.",finance

personalfinance,I'm currently paying 4.5% on a private student loan - however it's variable and the cap is 25%. Would you refinance with Sofi for 5.875% fixed?,"Also, would you pay off as much as possible before submitting the Sofi application? I think the most I'm comfortable spending is $5,000 from my savings which is a little less than half of it. The total loan is $31,000. I figure it'd be a good idea to pay that before refinancing since the interest rate is lower currently, but I also don't want to back myself into a corner too much in case sofi denies my application - I make 47,000/yr and my credit score is 772. I also plan to pay off my car which is so close at $2,000 left, 3.6% interest rate. This will help ease the burden of taking on this private loan which my parents are handing over to me now.

Feeling like it wouldn't be fair to just leave it hanging like that, I scheduled a meeting with her.

In the meeting, we discussed my issues at length, which mostly have to do with the attitude of my immediate supervisor.

I'm done with IBR now though since I ""make too much"". Should I lump all the feds together? Or continue with minimum on private and snowball the feds as I get funds.
Also, its been a year since I refinanced all my private thru common bond. Can I attempt another refi for lower rates?

personalfinance,Calculating net income after all taxes,"Having recently started new, well paying jobs, I am trying to create a spreadsheet to calculate our monthly net income so we know what we can spend each month.

My logic has been:

1/ take total gross income for us both ($770K/year)

2/ calculate total deductions: 401k, IRA, medical/dental premiums, dependent FSA, medical FSA (62K/year)

3/ Subtract the 2 for gross taxable income ($708K/year)

4/ Federal tax is ""$131,628 + 39.6% of gross over $470,700"" = $225K/year

5/ CA tax is ""$52,248 + 12.3% of gross over $537,498""  $73K/year

6/ Medicare is ""2.1% of gross salary ""= $21K/year

7/ CA SUI/SDI tax is ""0.9% of gross salary"" = $6K/year

8/ Social Security I got from internet = $14K/year

So annual net pay should be 770 - 62 - 225 - 73 - 21 - 6 - 14 = $369K/year or $15.4K per semi-monthly paycheck

The numbers don't match what I get from PayCheckCity ($13.5K per semi-monthly paycheck) - the numbers for federal tax and social security are well off for example.

personalfinance,"Too many monthly liabilities, What's the safest next step?","Throw away account so I'm not spreading my shiz in the streets

so I'm in my early 30's,  I have a mortgage, second year of owning my home,  we are due for an inspection and an attempt at refi.  We are paying PMI, owe $406k on mortgage, my portion of payment is $1650 including escrow for taxes and insurance.  House is probably worth $430-$450k based on comps and previous inspection.   My debt isn't huge,  about $15k in credit cards from buying first house and going alittle nuts the first year buying tools, yard equipt, furnishings, but all and all not too bad and very slowly paying that down (too slowly).  

  Car payment ($500/mo $18k left on loan) car is in equity, worth about $24k.  I still have student loan payments ($250/mo  $12k- left) I have back federal taxes from a business that I closed 4 years ago ($280/mo about $11k left, I also forfeit my federal returns every year, should be gone in 1-1/2 years at this rate.)    Long story short, all in all with the rest of the small things I pay for (utilities, cable, car insurance, cellphone etc.) my monthly liabilities(not including credit cards) are $3320.  I take home about 4200 a month. a chunk of that difference goes towards the 15k in credit cards, and what little is left goes into savings or normal cost of living things, (gas, food, etc.)   I only have 4,000 in savings, and am in the middle of buying an engagement ring (luckily there is a family stone, so expectations of spending around 3k on it)  

  Everything is current and I have no issues making payments on things... but obviously I'm at the limit of my current means.  I have a good job that doesn't have any immediate chances at any large pay increases for the next 3 years. 

 So my income isn't changing short of some crazy windfall which isn't coming.  So what safe and responsible steps do I take to lower my monthly liabilities.  My goal is to pay ANNNYTHING off and take that payment amount and put it on top of the next thing to pay it off sooner... and so on and so forth. 
   

Considerations:
1.hopefully re-fi the house and get out from PMI and save a few hundred a month to start paying something off.
 
2. Taking a personal loan to consolidate student loans and IRS payments together for a lower monthly payment

3. selling my car (which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because I owe on the car right financially and will need to buy another car to replace that one)

Edit:  Ok something I probably should have mentioned, I net 4200 a month, my girlfriend who I bought my house with nets about 4000.  The credit and mortgage is both of ours.  The car loan in question, student loans, and irs is mine.  she has her own car payment (which is half of what mine is) and her student loans are about 80% of what mine are.  We decided to buy a house before we spent any money on a wedding.  We live in one of the more expensive areas of the country (because we were born, raised, and work here).  

  A note on the car.  yeaaaaa.... this was my vice, this was the one thing in my life that I bought that I could have gotten something cheaper.  But I have equity in it, and my financial situation isn't a dire one. I'm not asking for advice because I'm drowning.  I have small investments that I could take out and wipe all this out if something drastic happened... these are mostly retirement investments so there is no way they are being touched short of my legs being chopped off and not being able to work or something.  What I'm trying to learn is... is there something I'm missing, an option I'm not aware of.    I realize can sell my car, and lease something at half the payment... but then my car payment is basically in perpetuity, and it saves me $250 a month.  Not that I couldn't use that, but it's currently not worth the sacrifice to me, again my loans are being paid, just trying to pay them quicker.  Luckily like I said I'm in equity and the rate on the loan is decent.  So if something happens and I need to, I know I can sell the car pretty quickly and would pocket the equity. 

I also didn't mention that I receive a 10% income bonus from work every year.  The reason I didn't mention it is that money has always just gone to investments.  I'm starting to think,  even though my interest rates aren't horrible... that I should be taking future bonus's and just putting them towards debt for the next few years.


TL;DR All monthly payments of bills equal $3320 NOT INCLUDING CREDIT PAYMENTS, I take home 4200 a month. Everything is current and in good standing.  what is a safe and reasonable way to lower liabilities, considering re-fi, and personal loans to consolidate.  any other options I'm not considering? or Opinions?

personalfinance,Best way to finish off the end of my student debt? Does it matter? 6k/35k left (US),"Hi PF, I have aggressively paid off my student loans and in 3 years am down to $6,500 from $35,000.

I have 2 loans left, both through MGL and both at 3.150%, one for $2,800 and one for $3,700. 

**Since they're the same rate, and through the same provider, does it matter how I finish them off?** MGL by default is splitting additional payments between them equally, but I feel like paying them off one at a time may be mentally more satisfying even if it doesn't make a financial difference.

At the same time, my portfolio has seen 13% returns YOY. I'm torn between killing this final debt and freeing my cashflow, versus adding to my portfolio since it's seeing better returns and the loan interest rates are so minimal.

personalfinance,Repayment vs Savings quandary with a twist!(UK),"Hello Reddit!

I have a recently changed jobs and got a bit of a pay increase, which has left me with more expendable income and options for investment. I'm really after some thoughts as to what everyone thinks would be the best priorities for my extra cash.

Quick round up of my situation: 

I am a home owner, but I only own 50% of the house, and pay rent for the rest. 

* My mortgage is a tracker at 1.5%.
* I have a personal loan at 3.4%
* I have a credit card, but it is payed off in full every month.
* I don't currently have any regular savings or ISAs setup, thought I think I can get a regular saver (~5%) 
* I have a share saver scheme at my new work which will work out pretty well, I think. It offers a minimum return is about 25% over 4 years, with increases based on stock performance. 

The obvious option would be to tally them up by the interest rates; save where saving earns more than interest on borrowing. The only issue with that is because I only own half my home, would I benefit more from trying to reduce my rent by buying more of my house?

As I see it, I have a couple of options;

1: Pay off my loan first, as it has the highest interest rate

2: Pay off my mortgage first, to free up equity to buy more house and reduce my rent.

3: Pay off nothing quicker, but start filling regular savings accounts (highest return, I guess, but the cash wouldn't be liquid.)

4: Some kind of hybrid, where I repay some and save some.

So, Reddit, what do you think?

personalfinance,Just graduated and have a decent chunk of money to put towards student loans. Should I invest for the future or pay off some of the principal?,"Hi PF!

I just graduated college and was recently hired! I have about $30,000 in loans in my name and $7,000 in my parent's name. I'll be making enough with my new job to manage my current projected payments once my grace period on the loans ends in January, and thanks to a summer job and some work time before then I'll have at least $5,000 in savings that I want to put towards student loan payments. The problem is I don't know how I can best do that.

So far, I have two ideas. I think I can:

a) Invest my $5,000 in S&amp;P 500 or something similar, and some day down the line when that 5000 has grown and equals whatever I have left on my student loans, use it to pay them off early

b) Use the $5,000 to pay off the higher interest portions of my loans, since they're broken into several smaller loans with different interest rates. This would probably mean paying off the ones in my parent's name.

Which is better? And how can I compare them? Is a combination of the two a better option? I'm just a little lost on how to make the best decision.

Also, if I really stretch my budget and plan well, I may be able to pay off the full amount in my parent's name. Would that change the answer of which is best?

personalfinance,What is the best way to finance home repairs?,"Hello!
I recently discovered that my sewer line broke &amp; am feeling quite overwhelmed with sorting out the financial situation of it. I was hoping that you all might be able to provide some insight/tips/suggestions/etc regarding the best practices for financing something like this.

**The Problem** Sewage was backing up into the basement. Got it checked out &amp; the plumber discovered that the lateral line was fully dislocated about 1-2 feet off the main sewer line. The pipe break is located about 9-12 feet below the street. I have had 5 separate investigations of the pipe to confirm that the diagnosis was accurate (including one from the sewer company that also confirmed from the main line side).

I got 12 written quotes for repairing it, most hover around the 15k range with a few outliers (only 1 below the 15k range, but it had a wrong diagnosis &amp; wouldn't have fixed the problem. A couple high bids in the 20-30k range)

Plumber was able to get the sewer to drain, but it drains into the mud at the end of the pipe &amp; not the sewer. Its likely a ticking time-bomb that I'd like to fix as soon as possible before it creates more damage. The last time it backed up, it created some mold/sanitary problems in the basement that I'm still dealing with.

**My current financial situation** I am 26 (single/live alone) with good credit (hovers around 750ish). Make 17/hr full time. I have about 2, possibly 3k in emergency fund savings (i know its low, I'm working on it). I have some debts, but manage these fine while also putting about 200 per month towards savings. i could probably put in a bit more, but already live rather frugally. I would have to do some significant lifestyle changes/cuts, which wouldn't be impossible, but I'd rather not if I can help it. I currently budget about 400-500 per month (100-125/week) on my misc expenses like groceries, gas, going out with friends, etc. This is where the cuts would need to be made (like I said, not impossible, but difficult).

**The House** I bought my house just under 2 years ago (my first house, yay!). Bought it for 55k, bank appraised it for 60k. I bought it with the assistance of a first time homebuyer grant worth 5k (the grant requires me to stay in the house for 5 years or else I have to pay it back) It is in good livable condition (well other than the sewer), but does need a bit of non-urgent work (roof is nearing the end of its useful life, could use some cosmetic upgrades like an exterior paint job, and I'd love to eventually do a new kitchen even though it isn't really necessary)

**Financial solutions I've looked at** I've been spending a lot of time looking at possible ways to pay for the repair, but haven't had much luck finding one that wouldn't cause severe financial distress. Here is what I looked at so far, I'm really hoping that I might be missing something:

1 - Not paying for it - Since its in the middle of the street &amp; so close to the main line, I've been trying every possible method to get the municipality and/or the sewer company to cover the costs to pay for it. Unfortunately, they are both holding strong that its my responsibility. Have also called my homeowners insurance agent, but he told me to not even bother submitting a claim as its sure to be denied. Have also contacted every level of government (federal, state, county, local) to see if they have any sort of grant/low interest loan programs, but unfortunately, none do.

2 – Leaving the house – In such a discouraged state, I've seriously considered just walking away from the house. Of course, that wouldn't accomplish anything &amp; would end up costing me more money than just fixing the problem. I assume it would be pretty much impossible to sell the house with the sewer issue, but haven't actually looked into that yet.

3 – General loans – Could likely get a credit card with an interest rate under 15% to pay for it, but thats incredibly expensive. I also looked into personal loans, but they're also at like 8%. As mentioned earlier, I only really have a 200/month surplus before I have to make dramatic lifestyle changes/cuts. A 15k loan over 5 years would cost approximately 300 per month.

4 – Home equity loan – Can I even get a home equity loan for 15k? I've only been paying for 2 years, and am sure that I haven't reached anywhere close to 15k in equity yet.

5 – Cutting the cost of the repair by doing it myself – I am looking into what it would take to do it myself. Most of the project costs are associated with the labor of digging the 12 foot deep hole in the middle of the street (likely by hand due to the water/gas lines being in the same trench). I'm sure I could do it myself, and would do it without hesitation if it was in my yard. Unfortunately, the municipality requires $1M in liability insurance to dig up the street &amp; I don't have any clue how to attain that.

6 – Second Job – I calculated that I can make the 15k in cash by spending 2 years working evenings &amp; weekends at minimum wage. I'm currently leaning towards this option (likely in combination with the personal loan), but really don't want to waste 2 full years of my life working 70 hours a week.. (would effectively mean working all day every day, with just enough time to complete a few household chores like cutting the grass before going to bed. I have no idea how people work those kind of hours without developing serious mental health issues)

I'm terribly sorry for the giant wall of text &amp; wanted to apologize if this wasn't exactly appropriate for the PF sub. I just feel so F&amp;$% over by the system &amp; the whole situation. Was just hoping that someone here might have some experience in dealing with situations like this &amp; be kind enough to offer their experience/tips/suggestions/etc. I guess I'm hoping that I'm missing something that would make this whole process a whole lot easier.

computers,Best Router and Modem,"I am not the best with these kind of stuff. But I want to avoid any long and complicated answers. I'm pretty much fed up with my router. So would like if you gave a straight honest answer. 

I am using a modem provided by my ips. I'm not sure what model or what it is. So I'm going to assume its a below average modem. Because I feel they can be shady and just give you a shitty modem to saves up some data. So I think getting my own would be an investment.

personalfinance,BOA HSA: pre-tax contributions without direct deposit?,"I have an HSA that I contributed to pre-tax via direct deposit at my former employer. My current employer does not offer direct deposit (because startups are awesome). I have to deposit my checks via the photo feature of BOA's app. 

I cannot deposit into the HSA from the app or any other part of online banking (because BOA is awesome). I can only ""pull"" contributions into the HSA from my checking or savings. This means I am pulling in post-tax (fed withholding) funds, canceling out the tax advantage of an HSA.

So, will the difference be tracked somehow? Will I receive a tax form at the end of the year documenting that difference... for...I don't know...a deduction? 

This is probably an easy answer, but I don't want to keep pulling in contributions until I'm sure I'm doing this the right way.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off old debt,"2 years ago, decided to get my financial house in order after dealing with reduced income from cancer treatment and diagnosis. Started out at 520 credit rating then. I got a secured visa card with 300 bucks on it and kept it up to date. Last year, qualified for a vehicle lease which I also kept current and increased the security deposit on my card to 1800 with utilization at 10-15% diligently. My car had a 1 year lease and I just qualified for a brand new car again with a substantially reduced interest rate and have a new car with same payments as previously on the lease. The caveat here is 3 small debts that went into collections that are 2.5 and 3 years old totaling 1100.00 total. My credit score is right now at 698 when it was pulled by a major bank who financed my car. Finance guy at dealership said the 3 marks on my credit score could be easily fixed with calling them up and offering 30 cents on the dollar to get them paid in full or settled??  This is all new to me but I want that 750 credit score as well as qualifying for a credit card without having to have the security attached to it. I am self employed making 80k a year now and want to get those last 3 marks cleared up. I currently sit with 25k stowed away in an emergency fund. 
I could pay them off in full but do I really have to? The 3 marks are for telephone/cable charges for those damn boxes for pvr that are over charged if you don't return them. Lost them in a move.
Finance guy said to pay them off with way less money, get them settled on my credit report and in a month or two, I wouid probably qualify for a regular credit card. My card balance is paid in full every month currently. I also get to write off the monthly payment against my income.",finance

Instead, I'm just gonna hunker down with a mixture of the Avalanche and Snowball methods and just pay them off one at a time.

personalfinance,"32K in Private Student Loan Debt, 9K in credit card debt, and more on the back burner. Suggestions for someone making 25k annually?","Using someone's throwaway because I don't browse reddit - thank you.

I have around 40k in Federal student loans that are currently on deferment. I also have 32k in private student loans that I cannot afford. 

Shortest version of my story is I followed my gf at the time to a different school, and needed to take out a loan to go. I got a private loan that we were supposed to pay off together as naive and youngish lovebirds, but she's since left the picture.

On top of that, I have about 9k in credit card debt from 3 different cards. I make roughly 25k annually, and literally just started out of college for less than a year.

I'm looking into applying for a better paying position, but that's the gist of it.

I talked to Freedom Debt Relief, and they wanted me to go (even more) default on every loan, crash my credit score even more (mid 660ish, a huge drop from 720 last year when I was paying everything on time), and essentially still pay what I pay now. So that was a no go. 

About to talk to AmOne, a personal loan company from Prosper. Basically, aside from getting a second job, getting a better one (both of which I'm looking into), how screwed am I?

Just kidding, I know I'm screwed. I just want to know what you suggest me to do. The credit cards will take time, but I know I can chip away. The 32k student loan is around 550/month, and that's a big chunk of what I make so I can't afford that, and that's my biggest headache.

They won't let me reconsolidate because I'm a cash cow, and no one else wants to lend me money because I'm a 660 credit score with a ton of debt...

Don't worry about being gentle - I'm here for truth.

btc,Can bitcoin (or some analog) really replace centralized currency?/a newbie's thoughts on the state of the crypto market,"I'm fairly new to crypto. I'd heard about bitcoin a few years ago and thought it was a good idea, but didn't buy any until this year. I actually own btc, so this isn't ""fud"", just an attempt to better understand. 

I've heard all the arguments for decentralized currency and many are compelling, but one thing that worries me about crypto generally is a sort of creeping dogmatism that decentralization is the way. I think this term ""fud"" is very telling. That ""fear, uncertainty, doubt"" is somehow roundly perceived as negative by many communities seems insane. Many of the members of these communities are ""investors"" and not tech people, i.e. people that really only understand the technology on a facile, conceptual level; anyone who knows anything about markets knows that there's no such thing as certainty. This attitude is toxic and unhelpful. 

What makes people so sure that decentralization is positive? Yes, a quick analysis of centralized monetary policy points out that money can be created out of thin air, and that inflation is always occurring. But deflation is a massive problem with btc too (though not because of decentralization), and I'm sorry, but I fail to see how BTC run world would experience anything but massive deflation. A capped money supply and more and more people looking to participate in a btc economy would result in 1 btc having more and more buying power. I won't expound on the issue (I'm not that qualified anyway), but it's pretty obvious to anyone that heavy deflation isn't a desirable. There's also the point that sometimes it's nice to have a centralized authority to fix things if stuff goes really wrong. 

I guess what I'm asking is, why is it so obvious that a crypto world is better than the one we currently have? It seems to be to have potential upsides, and potential downsides, and would be a gigantic experiment if put into practice. For me, if we can't have honest discussions about this, how do communities expect people to take them seriously?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Penalties for retiring before age 55? (Employer retirement, Louisiana)","I will have 30 years of state service in the LASERS retirement when I am 51 years old. If I retire at 51 years old, will I have a penalty?

I don't plan to take a lump sum, or DROP or an IBO retirement lump sum withdrawal.

I'm primarily interested in if my retirement will have a tax penalty if I retire at age 51 with 30 years of service. If so, how much will it be?

I've asked LASERS retirement these same questions, and have received the following canned answers:

1.    If you retire with 30 years @ age 51, you may be subject to a 10 percent federal early withdrawal penalty if you take a lump-sum payment of your unused annual and sick leave. This may also apply if you select DROP or an IBO retirement lump-sum withdrawal. LASERS encourages you to contact a tax consultant to determine if the provisions are applicable to your specific situation.

2.    Since you are a Regular Member of LASERS, and were hired on or before June 30, 2006, you become eligible for retirement upon reaching one of the following criteria:

• 30 years of service at any age

• 25 years of service at age 55

• 10 years of service at age 60

• 20 years of service at any age, actuarially reduced (Deferred Retirement Option Plan [DROP] participation and retirement with an Initial Benefit Option [IBO] are not available to members who choose this option). The actuarial reduction is based on the number of months you are away from Regular retirement eligibility. This reduction can be affected depending on whether you are in state service or out of state service at the time of your retirement.

LASERS uses a formula to calculate the basic maximum benefit for regular retirement. The retirement accrual rate for most employee groups is 2.5%.

Maximum Benefit = Final Average Compensation (FAC) x Accrual Rate x Years of Service

LASERS also offers a Pre-Retirement Education Program (PREP) that will give you all the information you need to plan for your future. We like to encourage our members to attend a PREP Workshop, this helps them begin preparations well in advance for retirement. The workshop covers eligibility requirements for retirement, purchase of service credit, the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), the Initial Benefit Option (IBO), and much more. PREP seminars are held at several different locations around Louisiana and are approximately four hours in length and usually held between 8:30 am and 12:30 pm or 12:30 pm - 4:00 pm. To register for a PREP Workshop go to our website and click on Register for a Workshop. Once you click on PREP Workshop, you can view the dates and locations that are available.

We encourage members to obtain estimates for regular retirement, DROP and IBO before making a retirement decision. You can calculate your own estimates by accessing Member Self-Service on the LASERS website at https://lasersonline.org/. You can also submit Form 05-01, Request for Retirement Benefit Estimate when you are within 18 months of eligibility for retirement.

* 5.10% fixed, 8-year term, ~$680 a month. (considering)

&amp;nbsp;


**Life Situation**: 

Recently Married (me: 34M, her: 36F)

No kids (we plan on two kids in the next 4-5 years, and are trying right now). 

Wife is stay at home right now, hated her job so she quit, but wants to switch careers after kids.

For arguments’ sake let’s assume she is stay-at-home forever even though she actually does want to work.  This will be a “worst case scenario” financially.

She’s on board with financial independence, but maybe not at the same speed I’d like.

&amp;nbsp;





**Location:**

Just moved to Boston, living slightly outside of the city. Expensive, but my career is best here.

&amp;nbsp;




**Job:**

I got my PhD in engineering, and I didn’t truly enter the workforce until 30.  Came in with about $45K in student debt, $35K was relatively high interest at 7.5%.

Now doing engineering (biomed), good job with good prospects especially in the area.

&amp;nbsp;




**Gross Salary/Wages (with bonuses)**

$120,000 this year (2017).  Job has high growth prospects, so I’m hoping (not assured) to have salary progress in the next few years jumping up about $20-$25K each year. This is typical in my job.

Should hit near $200K gross wages in 2020.

&amp;nbsp;




**FIRE Progress:**

So far, not great.  Paid off a lot of my high interest student debt earlier.

$28K in 401k

$6K in Roth IRA

$45K in savings

$3K in HSA

$10K in student debt (interest rate 3%)

No credit card debt, no car debt

In past years my savings per year have been $30-$40K.  This may fluctuate now… increased salary trend, but also have potential kids on the way.

&amp;nbsp;





**Housing:**

Currently renting at $2,000 per month for a 1BR (it’s Boston). 700 sqft.

I suppose this could be cheaper but for those of you who know Boston, you know the prices. Thinking about buying a house soon.

&amp;nbsp;




**Current expenses:**

Monthly expenses are about $2,000 per month, including everything for me and my wife (this includes “luxuries” on our end).  This also includes cable bills, utilities, gas for the car, insurance, etc.  Essentially everything that’s not rent.

Since my wife is at home, it’s mostly cooking and going out to eat maybe twice a week max.

&amp;nbsp;





**Goal:**

FIRE by age… 50-55? So 16-21 years from now?

Am I just stuck in middle-class rut forever?


&amp;nbsp;




**OUTLOOK**

I am not sure what type of advice i’m looking for, but I feel that since I’m early starting out, I can go in multiple directions.

Should I buy a house ASAP and get in on the real estate game?

Should I pay off the student debt or let it sit at a lower (3%) rate?

Wife working -- is this going to be a necessity for us to achieve our goals? Or will I be able to do this for our family on one income, albeit one that increases relatively quickly?

Are my expenses too large at $2K per month for the two of us?

personalfinance,Cashing out 410k to eradicate debt vs. living in a car to pay off debt.,"I've got $22,500 in debt. I consolidated it into a loan in an attempt to pay it down with a reduced interest rate. However, I was laid off and my new income is $15k less/year than when I set up the loan and the payment is not doable (its peer to peer so no refi). I've cut my spending as much as possible, just short of car living. I'm a single mom with a school aged child and minimum wage jobs after paying for a sitter in my area pencil out to about 0.50-1.00/hr take home pay. It's a tight market and I do not have a degree which is increasing my challenges around finding above min. wage part time work hard. So, second job is tough (although I'm looking for work I can do from home but so far that's yielded nothing).  I've got just enough in my 401k after penalties to pay off my debt completely. My new job offers 401k matching (fully vested after 5yrs). The company is profitable and growing and my position has a certain amount of security that my last job did not. Should I just cash out 401k, eradicate debt and then put the surplus and profit shares into retirement? I'm fairly confident that I will be able to move up within the company and increase my wage. I will also get regular annual cost of living increase and the amount I have to contribute will go up. My thinking is to take the pressure of debt off, live below my means and bank every cent I can into my retirement. I've tried using calculators but I'm struggling with clearly assessing the situation. My sister recommended letting the loan default and dealing with shit credit but I don't feel like that's a real viable option either.",finance

I also have a car loan which is around $10500 left owing (7.7% interest), as well as a loan through a finance company to purchase tires that has about $500 left owing (12.99% interest). My boyfriend has a credit card that has gone to collections for around $275. My credit is in the 780+ range, and I am unsure of what his is.

personalfinance,Should I let a bank go ahead and close a credit card that I don't use and don't plan to use?,"I'm in the US. I've acquired a handful of major credit cards over my lifetime. Some of them were opened to take advantage of 0% interest rates when I was trying to pay off loans many many years ago. I've often thought about closing some, but haven't done so, because I had always heard that it would hurt my credit, by ""reducing the amount of available credit"" I have. (I was advised leaving the account open and unused was the smartest thing to do.)

I have a Visa card and a Discover card that I use now almost exclusively. Visa for home expenses, Discover for personal stuff. I pay them off every month. I don't carry a balance on any credit cards.

One of the other major credit card banks has informed me that they will be closing my account since I haven't used it in a certain period of time. I was going to just let them do that, but now I'm starting to wonder... Is this a bad idea? Will it hurt my credit score or credit worthiness? Is it the same thing as if I were to close it myself? Or should I reactivate it, then close it myself?

I feel silly asking this but I hope some of you can help me understand the consequences of letting it close, reactivating to keep it open, or closing it myself.

Even if that one bank was not going to close the account due to inactivity, I have been thinking it might be smart to close some accounts, just so there's less to keep track of and less chances for fraud, with everything thats ben going on lately. Is that silly or is that a valid point? and how badly will it affect my credit? Incidentally, on the flip side, Visa has told me that if I give them my employment/salary information, they could extend my credit from time to time, which could make up for that closed account. (Not that I need more credit, but I want to keep my excellent credit score intact.)

personalfinance,20% Down vs 3% Down + 17% Lump Sum Payment,"Rather than the conventional 20% down payment, is there any reason not to pay the minimum down payment (usually 3%) and just make a initial lump sum payment of the remaining 17% within the first payment cycle.

Assuming a $200k house and a 4% interest rate, 30 year mortgage - the 20% down payment route would result in $114,991.21 in interest payments over the course of the loan.

Using the same assumptions, the 3% down payment + 17% lump sum payment route would results in $78,964.26 in interest payments over the course of the loan.

That's $36,026.95 in interest savings by simply restructuring the initial down payment.

personalfinance,A couple tricks I use to pay for expensive things.,"Hey everybody. LTL FTP.

I wanted to share a couple tricks I have used in the past few years to help pay for a few large expenses we had. Keep in mind that none of this is a trade off for having an actual emergency fund or being able to pay for it yourself. Make sure you are still saving and building up that emergency fund! This was just a risk free alternative for us. 

- Both my wife and I have gotten ICL, which is similar to lasik, only better and a bit more expensive. Each surgery cost $5k+. Rather than wiping out our Health Savings Account (HSA), we went through a loan company called Care Credit instead. They gave us a 3 year loan, zero interest, zero fees. All we had to do was pay it off on time. The doctor had to pay for the service, which he was happy to do since it enables him to do more surgeries. We then paid it off in 35 months via monthly payments out of my HSA, which was funded through my employer as pre-tax money. The key here is to make sure you pay it off before the payoff date, otherwise they will charge you the full amount of the interest (credit card interest rates!).

- Similarly, we got a new AC unit for about 8k because one of our old ones died. We could have paid it off in full from our emergency fund, but the manufacturer was offering a 3 year no interest no fee loan. We jumped on that and are paying about 250 a month.

- We did a big landscaping project and were able to get a 1 year no interest, no fee loan. This one was weird in that they never wanted monthly payments. We just had to pay the full amount before the cutoff date. I just paid each month into a high interest savings account and paid it in full 1 month ahead of the cutoff date.

- Need to buy a new computer? A lot of custom builders have zero interest zero fee loans available.

The key point here is to remember to pay it off well ahead of the cutoff date or you will be hit with all of the interest over the life of the loan. I manage the payoff schedule in excel and calculate how much I need to pay per month to pay it off 1 month ahead of time. Be wary if they try to setup a payment plan for you. It will most likely not pay off the loan in time.

The main reason we did this was due to the present value of money and the rate of inflation. Money today is worth more than money tomorrow.",finance
personalfinance,Best path for paying off student loans,"Hi /R/personal finance,

As a recent college grad, I am just seeing how much money it took to put my through school, which was funded entirely through student loans.  I know that I should have been more cognizant in planning my future before signing up for these loans, but I am now trying to put my best foot forward in paying off this debt. I have read the sidebars, have done some information and plan to pay these off rapidly.

I have 124K in student loans, 93K (4 Seperate Loans) of which are private MEFA loans with interest rates ranging from 5.39 - 7.09%, which are also variable. The loan with the highest interest rate is only 14k, which I plan to pay off in full in the next two months. the monthly payments on these alone are $750.

The remaining loans are through nelnet and are a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans. Unsubsidized are 12,000 while subsidized are 17000.  I cant seem to find what my monthly payments on the stafford loans. 

I believe that consolidating and refinancing is the best option for me right now so I can lower my interest rates and monthly payments. If i was to lower my payments, I could effectively throw more at them and not have to worry about variable interest rates. If I am to refinance, should I refinance the entirety of my debt or should I just refinance the private loans? Or should I just consolidate them somehow. Any other tips, suggestions, or resources would be much appreciated.

In an opaque banking environment, digital money can well protect against risks.

Preiss retorted that Bitcoin itself was not a source of market risk, but instead, in an opaque banking environment, digital money could well guard against risks.

Preiss said people are worried about the part of the reserve banking system, and the Fed's balance sheet size of 4.5 trillion US dollars, while the Federal Reserve in this regard refused to accept the audit, although some members of Congress Republicans have been asked. In turn, the bitcoin block chain is ""audited"" every day because it is open source. The digital currency uses the block chain technology to record every transaction that occurs so that all users can see the digital ledger.

Preiss added that the encrypted currency could also be a systemic hedge against the risk of rising asset prices. Preiss said that since January 2014, the price of Bitcoin has risen from $ 700 to $ 4,000. He also said that the rate hike for some people is a good means of hedging.

investing,US slaps 220% tarrif on Canada's Bombardier C-series jets. Yay Boeing,"Going to be an interesting morning for Bombardier.  Their biggest market just stuck it to them, their train business is in hot water.  Not even Trudeau and Theresa May campaigning for them could save them from the Trump hammer. 

I'm long Boeing for a variety of reasons.. But I don't think this affects them at all.. They don't even make an airplane that competes with the c series.  Wonder if airbus will benefit here. 




&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department slapped duties of nearly 220 percent on Canada's Bombardier C Series aircraft Tuesday in a victory for Boeing that is likely to raise tensions between the United States and its allies Canada and Britain.

&gt;Commerce ruled that Montreal-based Bombardier used unfair government subsidies to sell jets at artificially low prices in the U.S.

&gt;""The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.

&gt;Canada responded by saying it ""strongly disagrees"" with the U.S. move.

&gt;""This is clearly aimed at eliminating Bombardier's C Series aircraft from the U.S. market,"" said Chrystia Freeland, Canada's minister of foreign affairs.

&gt;Bombardier, meanwhile, called the decision ""absurd .... U.S. trade laws were never intended to be used in this manner, and Boeing is seeking to use a skewed process to stifle competition.""

&gt;In April, Boeing charged that Bombardier had received at least $3 billion in subsidies from the governments of Britain, Canada and the province of Quebec. The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer asked the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate the alleged ""predatory pricing.""

&gt;Specifically, Boeing said that Bombardier last year sold Delta Air Lines 75 CS100 aircraft for less than it cost to build them.

&gt;""Subsidies enabled Bombardier to dump its product into the U.S. market, harming aerospace workers in the United States and throughout Boeing's global supply chain,"" Boeing said Tuesday.

&gt;But Delta has said Boeing did not even make the 100-seat jets it needed.

&gt;""Boeing has no American-made product to offer because it canceled production of its only aircraft in this size range — the 717 — more than 10 years ago,"" Delta said in a statement Tuesday.

&gt;President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to get tough on trade. He has repeatedly criticized Canada, saying it unfairly blocks U.S. dairy products and subsidizes its softwood lumber industry. Trump also has threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if he can't negotiate a better version with Canada and Mexico.

&gt;Boeing's complaint against Bombardier drew a backlash even before Tuesday's decision. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened this month to stop doing business with Boeing, which is in talks to sell Canada 18 Super Hornet jet fighters. British Prime Minister Theresa May has discussed the case with Trump. Her concern: Bombardier employs more than 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland.

&gt;Connecticut Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Christopher Murphy last week wrote a letter urging U.S. government officials to ""refrain from taking action that will endanger the many jobs in Connecticut that depend upon Bombardier."" Engines for the C Series aircraft are made by Pratt &amp; Whitney, based in East Hartford, Connecticut.

&gt;Commerce's findings Tuesday aren't the end of the matter. The department is expected to announce its findings in another case against Bombardier early next month. Then the International Trade Commission — an independent federal agency that rules on trade cases — will decide early next year whether to uphold Commerce's duties.

&gt;Bombardier could appeal any sanctions to a U.S. court or to a dispute-resolution panel created under NAFTA. The Canadian government could also take the case to the World Trade Organization in Geneva.",finance

When I first started I put in 1 LTC the daily interest rate was 3.5% now it’s 4.5% so I’m guessing the demand has increased &amp; so far im getting about 7¢ an hour for basically 50$ initial investment which was the cost of 1 LTC at the time. Something also to note is depending on how you choose your conversion to receive your dividends like LTC/USD or LTC/LTC the price is basically locked in so it seems to not be affected by current market price if you select LTC/USD, so its preference if you want to receive a locked in price in USD or a changing price in LTC

1st point I wanna say is it says 147% return for 6 weeks &amp; 180% return for 9 weeks what I learned is it’s actually just 47% return &amp; 80% return on your initial investment, so please don’t get lured into this thinking you’ll more then double your money, it’ll give you a break even point when you basically make back your initial investment back within the contract period you chose it usually takes about a month &amp; then the rest of the time is the profit of 47% or 80% depending on what you chose

2nd point would be yes you can withdrawal your earnings everyday so I’m making basically the minimum withdrawal a day which is $3 so yes you can withdrawal 

3rd point is this a pyramid scheme? the basics of this is a referral program to help the initial investor to gain profits from the referees that invested &amp; are active, the initial investor would get a certain percentage from the the people that joined through their referral &amp; invested also profits they make the initial investor would get a certain percentages that bitpetite matches, currently the top 10 investors are a couple random people, 2 accounts named bitpetite &amp; 1 named coinmarketcap. So it can seem kinda sketchy as everyone knows how pyramid schemes work but still no referrals are needed it just helps 

Some might be afraid to join this but I’m a gambler so I was willing to lose some money if it ends up being legit in the long run then I just made profit which is all that matters, not the best analyst or person to explain this but hopefully I helped if you want to join go ahead I won’t post my referral but if you want it message me I’m not out to make profit I’m here to help , if this isn’t something you want it’s best to invest into something you have more faith in",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Price Is ‘Like MMM Ponzi Scheme’: Russian Economic Minister,"The head of Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development has compared Bitcoin to the infamous Ponzi scheme MMM.

Speaking at the Federation Council, Maksim Oreshkin repeated the theme of “unqualified investors” buying into cryptocurrency being “dangerous.”

“Because if you look at the dynamics of the Bitcoin price, they’re very like the price of MMM,” he said quoted by local news outlet RIA Novosti.

MMM originated in Russia in the late 1980s as the product of serial fraudster Sergey Mavrodi. Law enforcement shut the scheme down and arrested Mavrodi in 2003, but in 2011 MMM resurfaced and is now aggressively targeting consumers in Africa.

“There are very high risks here for those who are interested [in Bitcoin],” Oreshkin continued.

“It’s clear the state cannot protect these people; their actions come entirely at their own risk. I’m simply calling for everyone to be very careful with this issue.”  

The minister’s comments continue the increasingly contradictory position Russian authorities have taken on Bitcoin.

A similar offer to restrict Bitcoin to “qualified investors” came from the country’s deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev earlier this month, while central bank head Elvira Nabiullina said she was “categorically against” allowing it on the Moscow Stock Exchange.

At the same time, state-sponsored efforts to involve Russia in mining continue to gather speed as China’s supremacy seemingly becomes cause for envy.",cryptocurrency

That is a massive tax cut for AAPL.

Apple has $262,000,000,000 in cash.  About 90% of it cannot be touched without repatriation and paying the 35% US Federal tax (less tax paid in foreign countries).

But with a rate cut to 20%, most of that $260 billion can come back to the USA to be used for buyback, US investment, or a nice fat dividend.

I estimate that about 10-15% taxes has already been paid to foreign countries on that cash pile.  Thus Apple would only have to pay 5-10% tax to bring the cash back to the USA.

Just came back to school to hopefully be more gainfully employable--which is likely, because my work is interdisciplinary and timely. I was homeless and underemployed for about 5 months after a bad experience trying to survive on a retail salary in California in an abusive relationship. I'm also in recovery, about 6 months sober.

Income:

Currently, my income through my official RA position is officially $15000 / year of which I take home $920/ month, (though my plus an additional $40-100 cash most weeks through teaching music lessons, odd jobs, and tutoring, which takes between 5 and 10 hours weekly. My tuition is paid by the university.

I have no savings, and about $45 in my checking account at this moment.
 
Monthly income: $960-$1020

Expenses:

 I am only responsible for about $500 in fees each semester.

From my year underemployed after undergraduate studies, I'm roughly $3000 in debt. I don't have any student loans yet, but my credit is not good. I have one credit card, which is currently maxed out (represents about $2500 debt), and I think it would be a bad idea to open another one.

Rent is $350/month, utilities are about $200, but I'm splitting with a roommate. So I pay about $450/month towards housing. Moving in with my parents is not an option. 

I pay about $125 / month car insurance.  Car is paid off.

Thankfully my car is fuel efficient and I only buy about $50 gas/ month.

Food ( I never eat out) costs about $50-60 per week- about $200-240/ month. 

I try to pay at least $100 towards my credit card debt each month. Which leaves me at

Do y'all have any hints on how to start clawing myself out of debt? Does it make sense to take out a student loan to try to consolidate debt at a lower interest rate? Do I just wait until graduation when I can be employed at a higher rate for longer? 

Any charities you'd recommend to help me cover a $300 utility deposit I can't afford, or to reduce the cost of food?

Also, any advice about feeling less cripplingly shitty for being in this financial place?

personalfinance,How much taxes will be owed on a total distribution of inherited IRA's?,"My grandfather recently passed away, leaving me as a beneficiary (10%) of 3 IRA's. One is a SEP IRA (6,500), one is a Roth IRA (1,600), and one is a Rollover IRA (26,500). The amounts given are my percentage (10%), which totals to 34,600. I know that the ideal thing to do would be to keep the money in the accounts, however my husband and I have a large amount of credit card debt (40,000) that is mostly at very high interest rates (some as low as 13.49, but about half the debt is on cards charging 20% or more). We are not making much progress paying off the debt, as our minimum payments are currently $917 for all the cards. It seems like the best thing to do would be to withdraw everything from the 3 inherited accounts and use that money to pay off as much of the debt as we can. What I am unsure of is how to handle the taxes. The forms give an option of withholding 10% or more for federal taxes, but there is also an option to not withhold any taxes at all. I am wondering if it might be better to not withhold any taxes upfront, calculate how much will be owed when our taxes are filed next Spring, and set aside that much in a savings account to pay later on when we get our tax returns. Only I am unsure of how much to set aside. We file our taxes jointly, our combined income is around 90,000. We own a home and have a child, and we both claim 0 exemptions with 0 additional withholding. Normally we get a refund of about 2,000.

personalfinance,Structuring Medical School Debt Assuming Increase in Income When Practicing,"I am struggling with understanding the best approach for me and my SO to structure our debt assuming a large increase in income once they begin practice medicine. In particular if we should continue with the PAYE repayment option for loans or transition to REPAYE.

* Combined AGI = $120,000 until summer 2019
* Combined loan debt = $360,000 @ ~6.8% (combination of federal sub. and unsub.)
* Beginning in the summer of 2019 our anticipated income will increase to probably $350,000-$400,000/year. 

Our ultimate goal is to decrease the amount of interest by substantially beginning to pay down the loans at this time (2019) but before then what should we do to reduce it as much as possible?

Here is FSA spit out when I plugged in our numbers:

* REPAYE
Total paid = $412,321 (300 months);
1st payment = $672;
Last "" = $2405;
Amount forgiven = $312,661

* PAYE
Total paid = $282,000 (240 months);

Last "" = $1855;

personalfinance,"Student Loan repayment ""scam"" company","Early in 2016, my wife and I both got into a deal with what is, apparently, a scam company called Student Debt Relief Group (SDRG).  This was apparently one of many DBAs that a company called M&amp;T Financial Group was operating.  The service, as they offered it, was that they would prepare and submit all of the necessary documentation in order to enroll us in the lowest possible student loan repayment plan available.  They were up front with telling us that this is a process that we could do ourselves, but that they just provided the convenience of dealing with getting everything together and submitting it.

Since both my wife and I had contacted our loan servicing companies and had previously been only offered repayment plans that were far outside of our financial capabilities - the lowest I was offered from Great Lakes had been somewhere around $500 - $600/month - and SDRG was offering $100/month to Great Lakes + their $40/month fee, for me at the time it seemed a no-brainer.

I signed up, they took all of my information and enrolled me, and my monthly payment at Great Lakes was lowered to $100/month.  SDRG re-submitted all of my information last year, and since I had been given a promotion and significant pay raise that year, my monthly payment to Great Lakes did go up to $180/month, and SDRG continued to charge their $40/month fee.  Still entirely more manageable than the previous ""income-based repayment"" $500 - $600/month that I had been offered from the loan servicer in the past.  (wife did all the same, slightly different numbers)

We both received an email today from a ""temporary receiving"" firm that apparently has control of the company following a court ruling that has effectively shut them down.

So, all of that said, a few questions for anyone who knows:

* Was this really a ""scam""?  From where I sit, SDRG provided the service as advertised.  Yes, they charged me a fee to enroll me in an otherwise free federal repayment program.  However, I had never been successful at getting the same low monthly payment they did when I contacted Great Lakes in the past.

* If so, and I should not have used them, is there some secret information I should know about enrolling in the student loan income-based repayment programs?  Everything I read says that it's always 10% of your income.  At best, that's going to be somewhere in the high $300/month range, not the $180/month that I'm currently paying.  Did SDRG just submit false information on my behalf (despite what I filled out on the forms) in order to get a lower monthly rate?

I'm just a bit lost and confused about what next year will bring, when I have to re-submit my information for the repayment program.  I really can't afford a $600/month student loan payment, despite assurances from the servicer that that's a perfectly reasonable amount.  Anyone with some knowledge about student loan repayment, please chime in.",finance
personalfinance,How to get out of a car loan?,"Long story short I fucked myself and the local car dealership was more than happy to help me along. I have a *bad* history with getting cars financed, and somehow I apparently still haven't learned.

I'll spare the details, but the short version is I was in a tight spot and was on the verge of losing my job so I got a car financed. The car is only worth about 6k, they refused to sell it for less than 10k (because that's what they got me approved for), and so I signed. The monthly payments and insurance alone are affordable enough by themselves, although my interest rate is *way* high on my loan, as expected. The problem is the fucker keeps breaking, and for the past 2 months since I got it financed I've found myself damn-near-broke due to keeping up with the repairs. They've all been fairly minor repairs that I could do myself so far: only $200 here and there, but in conjunction with the doubled insurance and addition of the $350 per month payment they've completely broken the budget and then some. I'm already living off of a credit card for two weeks of this month; if a major problem comes along I'm screwed, and if the past couple months have been any indication of the car's inner-condition I should probably be expecting that.

So: I'm looking at options. I can't refinance for a lower payment because of the nearly-4k difference in the value of the car and the amount of the loan. Needless to say I'm not going to be able to sell it to anyone at that rate either, and I don't know anyone I trust (or want to screw over, for that matter) to take over payments.

I'm terrified of giving the car back because my understanding of how that works is they'll auction it and then file collections for the difference, which based on what I know about the auctions means I'm probably looking at a best-case scenario of 7-8k in collections. I had a collections account that was less than half that size 7 years ago and the bank ended up seizing nearly half of my paychecks for a year, I don't even want to think about what could happen with an account that size.

Needless to say I'm not willing to do anything illegal to fraudulently get rid of the car, I've had friends that have had their cars ""stolen"" or otherwise damaged their cars but I don't want to risk my personal safety or potentially end up in prison, that would be worse.

So what can I do here? I don't know anything about bankruptcy but I can't afford to go without a car and (subsequently) lose my job, so is that an option I should be looking at? Would it be safer than letting the bank take my car?

With enough prep time I could make sure that I can quickly obtain a car following it getting repossessed / whatever, the main reason I landed in this situation is because I had about 2 days and no cash to get on wheels last time.",finance

However, I have been thinking about using the extra money (maybe a couple thousand) to put towards a ridiculously high interest rate private loan I have.

On both, interest is not capitalizing yet (though it will when they enter repayment). On the private loan, if I used my extra $, I'd be eliminating interest and minimally decreasing the principal.

Basically, I'm in an extraordinary amount of loan debt (but with great career prospects in a couple years), and want to make the best long-term decision.",finance

That being said, I'm in the situation that I am currently in now and am hoping to get some advice in terms of what I can do. Essentially, my current home is valued at $700,000 and our mortgage is $350,000 - leaving $350,000 in equity.

At the time that I booked the new house (April 2017) my current home's value was at $875,000. So, over the course of about 6 months, my house's value has dropped approximately $175,000.

The new home is still pre development and closes in June 2018. However, the Canadian government is proposed to make a few more changes that will negatively affect the Ontario housing market.

To give you some insights, they implemented a 15-point ""fair housing plan"" in April 2017 which was spearheaded by the Foreign Buyer's Tax.

They then increased key interest rates by .25% for the first time in seven years in August.

They then raised key interest rates once again in September.

They are proposed to enforce stricter stress tests for new home buyers.

They are proposed to increase interest rates yet again.

My current options:

Sell the new home and take the hit.

Back out of my contract (not sure if this is even an option) and lose the $75,000 I have already put in (There is another $20,000 and $15,000 deposit that I have to pay still).

Sell my current home and move into new one and live EXTREMELY frugally, nearly hand to mouth to survive.

personalfinance,"Educating myself on buying a house, should I take a down payment grant?","I've lived in the Austin area for over a year and I've been looking at buying a house in the Pflugerville area. The market here has been insane the last 4 years and it only adds to my already existing desire to purchase a house.

I work and support my wife and baby girl. Currently @ 68k + ~5-10% company bonus in February. No other debt whatsoever. I'm not close to a 20% down payment, had a baby and bought a used car to update my wife's dying vehicle, so it might be a couple years before I could save up 20%. I think I'm ok with PMI, even thought would obviously rather not.

I found that we would qualify for two programs in Texas to help mid-low income families buy houses. First is a tax credit towards mortgage interest capped at $2k/year for first time home buyers only. The second is a down payment grant where I don't have to pay it back, but it increases the mortgage interest rate. These programs have a recapture tax (dependent on multiple factors) if I move within 9 years of living there. Also some restrictions on types of loans and qualified lenders. [Guidelines PDF] http://www.tsahc.org/public/upload/files/general/TSAHC_DPA_MCC__Guidelines_Lakeview_032017.pdf)

I have a lot to think about in terms of what house and when to move, but I wanted to ask for some opinions on the down payment assistance ""grant"".

Basically I can elect a 3% - 5% down payment grant which will increase the interest rate a quarter percent per one percent grant. IE: 5% grant increases the interest rate of the mortgage by 1.25%. On a 200k house the 5% grant would put $10,000 equity in my house and kick a 4% loan all the way up to 5.25% loan, adding an additional __$43,968.32__ in interest over a 30 year period!

Now that extra interest over time number is scary for me (my wife worries about it), but using my amortization calculator I find that if I put in an extra principal payment of $82.50 every month, the amount of interest saved **PLUS** the original $10k grant equals out to net ~$0.

So in my head, the more aggressively I pay down my potential mortgage, the more value I would see from the grant program, where on the other hand, if I spend the whole 30 years paying off the mortgage, I will have net -$33,968.

__Side thoughts:__

The faster I pay down my principal, the faster I get to the point where the $2k tax credit starts to diminish since it is 40% of the mortgage interest paid caped @2k.

The 5% grant gets me closer to eliminating PMI.

I haven't talked to lenders yet, I'm here mostly to seek opinions on the down payment assistance ""grant"" and it's consequences. Would you do it? Should I be more patient in my apartment and save money for my own 5% or 10% or 20% DP? Should I get into a house now as long as I plan to be here for a long time?",finance

My wife, who also very recently graduated college has some debt also. We both have jobs and we're making a combined $85,000/yr before taxes. We made some poor financial decisions during college and we're paying for them now. Between the two of us we have five credit cards with a total of $9,600. The majority of the cards have pretty low balances, but all have fairly high interest rates ranging from 10% all the way to 18%. Our credit is fairly young and our credit scores are in the 610 to 620 range. My wife and I are both 23 years old and we're just not sure what the best option to go with are.

They quickly pushed me aside and said, don't worry about it. I am wondering, do I need to contact the IRS or anything?

personalfinance,Housing Question and Advice.,"Throwaway for privacy.


I am looking for some advice or confirmation of our long-term plans from Personal Finance. Ultimately, my wife just graduated and is now working full time in her field. I also work full time but need to quit soon to finish my schooling. In the meantime, we plan on having a child and buying a house. I will provide details about income, debt, etc. bellow.


I work full time and earn $65,000 a year, after taxes/insurance/etc, I take home $3,400.00 a month. My wife also earns, $65,000.00 a year, and she takes home about $3,600.00 a month.


We do not have a lot of debt, but right now we owe the following:

$10,000.00 – One car loan. (Highest Interest)

$10,000.00 – Student Loans for the wife. (Lowest Interest)


Now here is our plan, let me know what Reddit thinks. I have about 8 months until it makes sense for me to quit my job and go to school full time. During that time, we want to save 50% of our salary which would equate to $28,800 roughly until May of 2018. With the savings we already have in place, we would have about $35,000.00. This is where the first part of the plan comes into play, we take a portion of those funds and pay off the car. Then we use about $20,000.00 as a down payment on a house. Our budget 
for a house is $280,000.00.
 

So at this point with our credit scores (760 &amp; 750) we can get a loan with a decent interest rate and would be paying about $1,100.00 to $1,200.00 a monthly for the mortgage. This is one concern, as we currently pay $650.00 a month for rent, which is low but we could comfortably pay $900.00. 


This is where I need your assistance. We are thinking about pushing back my schooling by one year so about 19-20 months to save. ($68,000 - $70,000). We would still buy a house within 8 months as we live in a sketchy neighborhood (hence the low rent) and move somewhere better. We can then continue to save after we purchase the house and in about 18 months drop another $20,000.00 or more towards the principle of the balance. This should lower the monthly payment, to make it comfortable for my wife to make payments while I finish school.


I know the second option sounds the best, but the caveat is the holding off on school for one year. I am currently in the banking industry and have a really nice job with a good salary for no education. But I am studying engineering and love math/science, so I want to move over ASAP.

personalfinance,Prepping for Mortgage / Paying Down Debt,"Here's the situation:

I plan on buying a house next September when my lease is up. I recently just got promoted, so i have some extra money to save or throw at debt. I am trying to figure out which i should do:
1. Pay off entire auto loan now, then save every month
2. Pay off auto loan at minimum and save the extra, or
3. Aggressively pay down debt and save once paid off

Here are the Details:
Savings Cash: $10,000 (i have more saved, just using a figure for simplicity)
Savings acct interest rate: 1.2%
Auto Loan Balance: $9,295
Loan rate: 2.49%

I have $1040 to pay loan/save per month
The minimum car payment is $350

I ran the numbers and i think I feel like option 2 is the best bet. It would leave me with the most cash, and only cost a little more than $200 over the life of the loan. Does this make sense? I dont know that this is clicking logically to me.

stocks,TSLA Is Dangerously Close To Falling To 325 By The End Of The Week,"If you have been following TSLA, then you know it has been free falling since an analyst downgraded the company and gave it a price target of $240. Depending on how tomorrow goes, that free fall will continue. Today, TSLA failed to regain a key support level, the pivot point at 345.71. The last major line of support for this week is right below $340. Bearish candle on the daily chart (engulfed previous day and closed near the low of the day) seem to suggest the $340 support area will not hold. Expect to see TSLA sell off as soon as it touches the 344 area in the morning (if it gets back there) and if the TSLA bulls don't step in at the 340 area, it will continue to fall. TSLA will need to clear resistance at 350 to prevent a deeper selloff.

personalfinance,"Boss has allowed me to choose how I get paid. As a financial rookie, I have no idea how to even compare the choices.","Background: I am a single, 25 year old that is a newly admitted attorney in NC. I have around 100k in debt from school and was able to land a job at a small firm with 3 other attorneys. I have been interning with this firm for the past 2 years now and the managing partner has decided to hire me on full time and oversee a new branch of the firm in a different county. We handle mostly criminal matters at the state and federal level, as well as immigration law.

The dilemma: The boss has allowed me to choose how I want to get compensated. **Option 1**: I can choose to be base salary at around $52k a year. Which is not bad for a new attorney in a small firm, but I think I am worth more for what I will be doing at this new branch, I.E. all state and criminal matters, as well as some civil work as well. However, it would likely be two to three years before we can re-negotiate the salary amount. 

**Option 2**: She will share 35% of the profits that I make at this new branch. (not the entire firm's profits). However, since we are starting out brand new in a new county, she will allow for me to have $3500 a month, for the first 6 months, plus the 35% profit sharing. Then after the 6 months, I am solely on the 35% profit but I also would share in the expenses for that branch as well.

There are no health or dental benefits, I can join in on retirement plan after 2 years where the firm will match up to 3%. The firm will pay for all license fees and malpractice insurance. 

**The future:** She also discussed putting me on a 4 year plan to make partner, as she has essentially taken me as her prodigy. This would then ensure I share 50% of all profits and losses the firm makes. 

I am leaning towards the salary, mostly because it is the safest bet. I have never had a full time job, nor ever made salary. Only odd jobs earning minimum wage all of my life. I know this isn't much information to go on regarding the profit sharing but it's all I got. 

Please, if you could help explain the risk/reward of the profit sharing, or even give me advice on the right questions I need to ask the boss to put myself in a better position to make an informative decision. I would greatly appreciate it. Also, feel free to let me know what other information or variables would be needed to assist you in making an assessment.",finance
personalfinance,Best credit improvement strategy for Mortgage Refi.,"Throw away because of personal info.

My wife and I were surprised last week and found out we’re having twins.  We're looking for ways to cut costs and refinancing our mortgage is one of them.  We currently have an FHA loan.  In two months, we will have enough equity in our home to get rid of PMI.  We will have to refinance to a conventional mortgage to get rid of PMI.  

I need some info on what is the best strategy to boost our credit scores so we can refi at the lowest rate possible.  I know that a conventional mortgage will most likely come with a higher interest rate.        

Current Loan info: 

FHA Loan - 3.25% interest

PMI – 1.5%

Effective Interest Rate – 4.75%

Principal: $246K


Our info: 

Salary 130K Gross

Savings: 11K – we don’t want to touch this because we’ll miss out on 10 weeks of her salary after the babies come.  

Her Credit: FICO 730, utilization rate of 28%

My Credit: FICO 679, utilization rate of 41%



Some questions:

1.)	Should she get another card to get her utilization rate under 20%?  I have no doubt that she could do this.  Would that effect the refi application?      

or

2.)	Should we try and equalize our credit scores by transferring debt to her credit cards (with 0% on transfers) in order to get my utilization rate down?  

Additional relevant info upon request.  Any info is appreciated.  Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Accidental delinquency on student loan payments has severely damaged my credit score,"Hey all, for a little bit of background on my situation, I’m 25 and I graduated from college about 3 years ago. While in college, My parents and I agreed that I needed to take out some student loans to pay for my schooling, and I was lucky that they said they would pay off these loans. Since graduating, they had been consistently paying, and there were no problems. At the beginning of this year, however, fedloan.org stopped sending billing notices to them in the mail and started billing them electronically (I’m not entirely sure how or why this changed). Because my parents weren’t receiving bills in the mail, they weren’t sending payment in, and for about 6 months no payment was made to the loan balance. 

We discovered this major delinquency late in August and immediately made payment. Unfortunately, this was not in time to prevent my credit from taking a huge hit, and I noticed today that it dropped 150 points (680 to 530) from last month to this month. I’m panicked and pretty nervous about the future implications of this sharp drop, so I’m asking for advice on how I can remedy this situation. Any and all input is welcome and greatly appreciated, and thank you all in advance for your help.",finance

personalfinance,I've become addictedto budgeting and it's changied around my life -long read-,"Moved in with my now fiancee at the age of 29, moved into her Brooklyn apartment. When I lived alone I would live in the moment and in Manhattan. My greatest struggle financially was just having fun especially when being single- I would spend what little money I had on dates. Hitting the age of 26/27/28 was hard, I had worked at a liquor store in midtown, made little money and was trying to start my own business (a non profit aimed at teens who lost a loved one) but I was wreckless with my money. I soon went beyond broke and moved into the projects in Woodside with a friend who had an extra room. This was a life changing moment..But it wasnt enough. I did get a new job, one that paid 8K less than my liquor store pay. I worked at a homeless shelter for teens. I worked crazy hours 6am - 5-6pm some days just to make a few extra bucks. I knew this job sucked- but it was good for my mind. It got me out of the liquor store which was mentally weighing on me as I equated my self worth with my job. - I also have a college degree- while at the homeless shelter I met my then girlfriend at a bar, we fell in love - she lived alone and I would be over nightly and soon moved in. 

I had a secret. My credit score was in the 400s and I hadn't paid my 2 credit cards or school loan in close to a year - if not more. I also went and worked at two more nonprofits - I kept wanting to make more of course - with the goal of getting a job out of the nonprofit sector to pay for more things. 

I didn't like talking about my money with her - it was something I hated because I was embarrassed- but one night we talked about how bad of shape I was in. It was felt great- She had me call called capital one and fedloan that night and got the help I needed to get on track. That was in February 2017 - it's three days from October and I haven't missed a payment yet. My credit score has grown by 190 points - lots of room to go but it feels amazing to have a handle on it. 

So a quick breakdown of what I do every pay period:

I get paid on the 15th and last day of the month. 

Here is October:
10/15
Rent 
Capital One 
JetBlue 
Fedloan 
Metro Card ($32 a week)
Spending (X amount each week)
Utilities
Spending (X amount each week)
Groceries (X amount each week)
Spotify 
Savings (usually not more than $60 a pay period)

10/31 
Rent 
Capital One
JetBlue 
Fedloan 
Metro Card 
Spending 
Electrical 
Groceries 
Gym 
Savings 
Spring 

And repeat. 
Now when I get paid directly deposit- I wake up at 6am and pay all my bills before even using the bathroom and it's the best feeling in the world. 

My take away is this - I have had more money than I expected to spend each week- when I'm broke I'm broke but I know it's at the expense of paying bills and it's only temporary.  And it's never too let to get help from companies you owe money to. 

I also work in ed tech now- I like to say I went from a liquor store to working in technology",finance

personalfinance,Girlfriend bought a new car..really got me thinking about my current car situation.,"My girlfriend yesterday purchased her first vehicle, a 2017 Toyota Camry Le from a dealership near where we live. After negotiating her interest rate to 0% and the price down to a good point, she bought the car. 
Looking at numbers and talking about cars all day really made me think about my current deal. 

I currently am financing a 2014 Kia Forte Lx with 75,000 miles on it and in 'Good' condition. 
This is my first financed vehicle and I was very stupid/got a terrible deal when I bought it used in 2015. 
I pay 13.75 percent interest on my loan which 
I still owe 12,033.77 on (added warranties and extended service contracts add about 3500 here).
Over the remaining 4 years of my loan I will pay an approx additional $4500 in interest I believe. 
I have tried to refinance and nobody will refinance my loan because the car is worth so little compared to the loan amount. 
I have called Zurich who my warranties are with and they told me I can refund the prorated amount (about 45%) of the service contracts back to the lien holder.  This would lower the loan to about $10,500
The KBB dealer trade in value is around 5,500 for my car. 

While in the finance office with my girlfriend yesterday, the finance manager joking told me if I wanted to buy a 2017 vehicle that they would also offer me 0% interest. I then asked him about it and he goes ""oh yeah, they're really trying to get rid of these 2017's, they'll almost give anyone 0%"". 
This really got me thinking. 
If I could roll the negative equity over into a new, well below invoice vehicle like a Corolla/Camry(which tend to hold resale value well for sedans), I would basically refinance my loan for 0% and get a brand new car, hopefully keeping my monthly payment the same or very close to what it is now. 
Yeah, the value of the car would be well below the loan amount when I drove it off the lot, but seeing as all my payment would go to principal and Toyotas generally have good resell, I don't think this would be an issue after a few years. 

Does what I'm thinking about doing make sense? Is there something that I may be overlooking? 
Thanks!",finance

I was sued a few years ago for an old credit card debt, was ruled against and have been paying via wage garnishment for about two years now. I know how much I've paid out from my paystubs, but I have no real way of knowing how much is left to pay. They haven't sent updates or contacted me since the judgment.

I got a copy of the original writ which lists $5,215.85, together with simple interest at 4.75% from December 15, 2014. (Is interest still accruing?) I've paid roughly $4,993 as of last week.

It also lists Cach LLC as the creditor, with all payments to be made to Federated Law Group, PLLC and has an account number listed with them (looks like a small law firm out of south Florida, they have a website with contact information, but just a placeholder page for any online payment/account information).

Credit score is low 700s

I have  about $23k of student loans (federal) and am paying  $250 a month, which is also being matched by my company. I have to pay taxes on the portion my company matches, which comes out to be $80ish if I recall correctly. So I’m practically paying $330 a month for $500 towards my student loans. Should I be paying more per month towards my loans or is $500 a good amount for now? Also my company only will match to a total of $2k a year and $10k in total.

I also have about $1300 of credit card debt and been paying anywhere between $150 to $200 a month to lower it.  It was around $2500 as of May. The rate on the card is around 18% and I don’t make any purchases with it anymore.

I am only responsible for about $500 in non-waiveable school fees each semester.

From my year underemployed after undergraduate studies, I'm roughly $3000 in debt. I don't have any student loans yet, but my credit is not good. I have one credit card, which is currently maxed out (represents about $2500 debt), and I think it would be a bad idea to open another one. Correct me if I'm wrong on this.

I pay about $125 / month car insurance. Car is paid off.

13k for car ($263 a month payment, 8.9% interest rate)

21k for Stafford student loans in my name (no required monthly payment, is in forbearance, 6.8% interest rate)

80k in parent plus loans that'll soon be in my name (paying $560 a month, 8% interest rate, should go down to 6.5% when I refinance)

Rent is $467.50 a month, electric is around $22 a month, internet $25 per month. Spending about $250 for myself on groceries a month.

I really want to do everything I can to aggressively attack my loan debt. Should I really be halting my 401(k) contribution at 7% with the 100% match? 100% investment return seems too good to pass up.

Any advice is much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Still no federal tax return 7 months later...,"Hello all! Sorry if this isn't the right spot to post this.

They received them in the beginning of February and have been processing ever since. I am moving to Oregon with my family next month and really need to get this tax refund to help finance the move. I don't know where else to turn. Anybody with any information on this matter, I'd forever be in your debt.

personalfinance,Moving from 403(b) to Roth IRA or self directed 401(k) to purchase rental property from myself.,"I am the sole owner of a recently renovated three family house in a very desirable neighborhood that is three blocks away from an Ivy League university. (Vacancy is never a concern as there is a perpetual student housing shortage.)  

&amp;nbsp;

I have been thinking about shifting money from my 403b to pay off the mortgage and dramatically improve my investment return. Before I pay a CFP for advice, I thought I would ask here. Here are the details of my finances:  

&amp;nbsp;

* 403(b) Account Balance: $225,000.00
* Rental Property Market Value: ~$600,000.00
* Gross Annual Rental Income: $56,400.00
* Mortgage Balance: $294,092.51 (174 months remaining at 4.5%)
* Yearly Property Tax: $11,927.76
* Fire and Liability Insurance Annual Premium: $2,700.00
* Annual Utilities: ~$2,500.00

&amp;nbsp;

This mortgage is my only debt, and I thought that instead of servicing a mortgage with my rental income, I could instead service my retirement account if I could find a way to pay off the mortgage with the funds that I currently have saved. I've currently got two short falls with this idea, I don't have enough in my personal savings to cover both the difference between the mortgage and my 403(b) balance and the taxes I'd owe upon converting to a Roth. I may be able to borrow that money from family, but I haven't begun asking about that option yet.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that I could rollover to a self directed 401(k) and then use the funds to invest in buying the property from myself. I believe this method would mean that I would not have to pay the taxes required to convert to a Roth IRA, but I have no idea how to go about setting up such a vehicle.  

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently 48 years old, and expect to work another 12 years.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm curious to hear what Reddit thinks about these options.  Thank you for your input.

**Current Principal Balance:** $84,623.37 

**Interest:** $203.48

**Total Current Balance:** $84,826.85

There are no other loans or debt between us. 

We plan to live there for 10 months and save $4k every month. In addition to the $40k, my company offers $12k to first time homebuyers. My fiancée and her parents also have $20k set aside for us to use towards buying a home giving us a grand total of $72k with $62k going towards the down payment and closing costs and $10k towards our emergency fund.

We live in an above average COL area where 1800sq. ft. townhouses range from $475000 to $575000 for 3bd, 3br.

personalfinance,When a 401k Loan Makes Sense,"I am 28 and in a unique situation where a 401k loan might make sense but wanted to check my logic with PF before moving forward. I am purchasing a house for 500K, if I have 100K for the down payment and have 25K in student loans @ just under 6%. My 401k has 50K and I can borrow up to 25K of it @ 4.25% with a 30 year repayment, and if I leave my current employment I can roll it into an IRA and continue to just make monthly payments to avoid the balancing coming due or getting crushed with the 10% penalty. 

How should the 100K be allocated and should I take the loan:

If I put 15% down (75K) and pay off student loans (25K) I will have PMI ($80/ month) and 25K of additional mortgage which I will pay 4.00% interest on ($83/m in interest). So this 25K has a cost of $163/month, which on 25K is effectively 7.5% interest rate annually (or 6% if I am able to itemize, which might not be the case under the new proposed tax plan).

PMI is like an interest payment, but it does not decrease with the principle balance so I will pay $83 even when I am a few months away from clearing the 22% threshold in 7-8 years. I think since the loan enables avoiding PMI it becomes worth it. Paying off student debt is also worth it because it’s a 6% guaranteed return.

My question for PF is, based solely on this fact pattern, how should the spending be prioritized:

* A)	Don’t pay student loans (Pay 20% and don’t touch 401k)
* B)	Don’t put 20% down (Pay student loans and don’t touch 401k)
* C)	Borrow from 401k, pay off loans and put 20% down

However, I still have over $6,000 left to pay off my auto loan. I'm trying to find the best option. Below are some that the wife and I have discussed.

**Option 1**
Repair the vehicle and keep driving it. The cost would be around $3000 and we could face more issues in near future.

**Option 2**
Roll auto loan into a personal loan. Get a new vehicle and try to sell the non-running vehicle on a forum or other outlet. Interest rate would definitely go up, according to the bank.

**Option 3**
Repair the vehicle and get a trade-in value, then get a new vehicle. The trade-in value would be less than the auto loan payoff amount, so we would end up having to roll this into a personal loan.

personalfinance,Investment Strategy for Retired Mother,"My mother is 62 and she is a teacher who has been medically retired for a few years. She lives off of my deceased father's federal pension which also provides her medical insurance. She gets her own SS and this year has begun collecting her teacher's pension.

She said she should have about $5000 left over to invest annually and wanted me to handle it. I was thinking of putting it in USAA's S&amp;P Index Fund. The expense ratios are:

Before Reimbursement: 0.28%
After Reimbursement: 0.25%

As of now her pension income is more than enough to cover her living expenses and she owns her house and car outright and she does not have any debt outside of a $2,000 line of credit with her credit union which will be paid off by the end of next year on regular payments.

I want to think the S&amp;P fund is a good investment for her because she stated she wants it invested for the long term. While she is medically retired her health has improved greatly in the last few years (previous doctors over prescribed her and misdiagnosed her issues) so she should hopefully live for quite a few more years.

My only hesitation is her age and whether I should play it a little more safe. She is looking for a 10-15 year horizon before she will want to touch that money which makes me think she can weather the risk of a market index fund.

But I am also over cautious and I would like to get a second opinion from other people before making a decision. Any help is appreciated!",finance

The adoption of new technologies over the last century has resembled an S-Curve. As the technology is introduced, it takes time for people to learn about it and realize its potential. Once public awareness reaches a critical mass and the technology is perfected, adoption occurs extremely rapidly, resulting in exponential growth. Finally, once everybody has adopted the technology, the curve flattens out again.

Key questions and bubble follow-up
Below is a picture of the Bitcoin market since late 2013. See how even the “massive” bubble of November/December 2013 is dwarfed by the current one?

Bitcoin November/December 2013What happens if today’s Bitcoin bubble isn’t a bubble at all, in the traditional sense? What happens if we are actually on the cusp of that massive near-vertical adoption uptake? A look back at the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble might shed some light on current circumstances.

On March 2, 2015, the NASDAQ index hit an all-time high, surging above the 5,000 mark as it finally surpassed its peak price, reached at the top of the dot-com bubble. Today, the index stands at 6,449. It took 15 years, but the markets fully recovered, eventually reaching new highs.

Likewise the Case-Shiller index of housing prices is approaching its pre-bubble heights. The index stopped at 198 in 2006 and is now back to 194. As the economy continues to improve, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise above their 2006 peak.

What’s the difference?
Why did the South Sea bubble, Mississippi bubble, and Dutch tulip mania all eventually go to zero, never to rise again? Why did Internet companies enjoy a new resurgence and eclipse past bubble levels? Why do housing prices seem to be following the same path?

More important, what does all this have to do with Bitcoin?

It’s simple. The bubbles of old were driven by hype, with nothing of value actually backing them. A tulip bulb has zero intrinsic value, and absolutely no potential to become something more. The South Sea company was backed by a worthless monopoly, since South America was under Spanish control. The Mississippi company never could exploit the wealth of the new world, because unlike Spanish territories, Louisiana had no gold or silver to export.

Internet companies like Amazon, Facebook, PayPal and the others are completely different. The Internet offers unmatched potential for growth, with world-changing consequences. Yes, things got overheated in the early 2000s, but prices recovered and the upward trajectory was renewed. Housing prices went out of control in the mid-2000s, but as the population grows, housing is always in demand. A house represents a real asset with real value that meets a real need.

Bitcoin represents a sea change in the way business is conducted on the Internet. It is the world’s first decentralized, non state controlled, truly global currency. Bitcoin is a promising monetary technology that seems more apt to follow the path of an S-Curve than that of a boom-and-bust.

Bitcoin could still be overpriced for this stage of its development. It could be in a bubble that deflates before rising again in a few years. But if Bitcoin is what I think it is, then at some point (maybe even now) we will rapidly shoot up that S-Curve to prices that are presently unimaginable.

I moved to Chicago with an ex (together at the time) 2 years ago, we broke up and I assumed his share of the rent payments (total of $1,800 per month).

I accumulated much of the debt paying for us both to move across state lines and with my rent so high, I'm barely making any dents in the principal amounts of my credit card debt. I'm very frugal with my money (now) and don't spend any more than I need to in a given month. I make roughly $3,200 after taxes per month and receive a $3,200 bonus every three months.

personalfinance,"Ready to Pay off Massive Ignored Collections Debt, but Don't Know Where to Start","Hello Personal Finance!  

Throwaway account because I’m mortified by my financial behavior.  I've searched a bit, but couldn't really find my specific situation, so thought I'd lay it all out and see if you guys had any suggestions.

I'm almost 34 and I’ve spent almost 10 years terrified of my massive school and credit card debt, stuffing unopened bills into the trash and hitting ignore on collections calls.  I essentially avoided EVERYTHING.  I haven’t paid down a single loan/credit card from back then.  Almost everything has gone to collections or been charged off, I think.  I’ve moved around a lot and some things have followed me and some things haven’t.  I still get seasons where some of the debt must have been sold to a new collections agent because the calls start rolling in from spoofed numbers.  I still ignore them.

But not anymore.  I’m finally ready to deal with it. 

The thing is, I honestly don't even know where it all stands because I've never truly tried to track it down and I just can’t remember a lot of the details from those lost years.  

Here is what I know:

- There is one loan with ECSI, which I think is a government loan for something around $10k.

- Another one from a company called ECMC for about $25k.  (These two are the only companies I hear from regularly any more.)
 
-  There are also other small collections agents that I've ignored that may be fraudulent (some company called Convergent saying I owe Paypal money from accounts I never opened).  

-  I had a private loan from Wells Fargo for about $24k that was charged off a few years ago. I’m not actually sure what that means, but I seem to remember something about claiming it on my taxes (which I am not sure I ever actually did).

- There are possibly a few other smaller credit cards/private loans out there that I can't remember and have lost any record of at this point.

I’ve read a few things about “pay for delete” and sending letters to make sure creditors agree to it, but I feel like I’m even a few steps before that.  I still don’t even know who I owe or what I really owe.

I have had a pretty good job the last few years and have managed to save about $150k, so I am prepared to wipe most of this out.  I just want to do it in the smartest way I can that allows me to fix my credit as much as possible.  Where do I start?  Is there a way to track down all of my debts in one place?  Is there a smart way to use the money I’ve saved to offer collections one smaller lump sum?  Are there other questions I should be asking?  Does anyone have a systematic approach to this type of situation?  

I feel like I’ve been running and ignoring this stuff for so long that I’ve lost a lot of valuable information along the way.  I’ve thought about hiring a debt counselor to help me walk through this, but maybe that’s a waste of money if I can figure it out on my own.

personalfinance,Confused on car-buying experience.,"Just trying to get a little more info from those with more experience/knowledge about credit/auto-purchasing/etc.

Young, no established credit and in the market for my first new vehicle. I was looking at a 2017 VW SE which after incentives and rebates came to a total of 18.5k (before taxes/fees/licensing/etc.). I also have a $1500 down payment. 

I've heard the $20 per 1k rule so I figured my payments would be somewhere in the 400s. 

The dealer claimed that the only approval they got was from a bank with a 26.1% interest rate bringing my payments up to like 600-650 and the total cost of the car up to around 27-28k. Prior to even running my credit and seeking approval the manager suggested I look for ""less car"", ""something for 10k"". There isn't a new car on the market for 10k (Versa is like 12k base model), and used cars are even more difficult to get approved for (so I've heard, co-signers are almost essential, could be misinformed). 

The whole situation was very confusing. 18k is in the low range for the price of a vehicle, you can't go much lower, like maybe 16k? But I don't feel that 2k difference would make that big of a deal? It seemed kind of fishy in a way and I was getting conflicting information from the finance guy/manager/salesman/etc. Should I expect this at the next dealer I try? Does the math add up? Sorry if this seems convoluted and I can edit if necessary but I'm just thoroughly confused about the whole thing.

personalfinance,Whole life insurance as a tax shelter?,"I got off the phone with my parents the other day and they said they are taking out a whole life insurance policy on me as part of their retirement plan. Their main focus is to have ""safe stable money"" and legally avoiding as much tax burden as possible in retirement due to Social Security and their Required Minimum Distribution. They would be able to access the cash value ""tax free"" in the event they need some extra cash. The added benefit is it transfers to me eventually and there is some additional death benefit for my children.

This raised some obvious red flags for me, but is it a normal tool used to avoid additional tax? Here are a few of my concerns (that I will be taking to their financial planner) but I wanted to see what you all thought:

1. If they are paying premiums as a lump sum to build cash value - they are locking up their own hard earned money in an un-diversified insurance policy. 
2. The cash value withdrawal (loan) would be tax free, but interest is owed from day one of withdrawal - what is the interest rate and how is it compounded?
3. The dividend earned is based on the company willing to pay it and is not guaranteed.
4. If they really need cash and take a loan from the policy and cannot repay plus interest, it reduces the policy limit and would eventually become a taxable event.

I'm just not convinced and insurance policy is a great tool for tax/investment but I just want info. For what it's worth, this is after them maxing out 401k, possible Roth, etc. I don't have information on this full retirement plan because they called me about the insurance and I focused on that. I just want to make sure their advisor isn't looking for a quick large commission on the sale.

Are there other ways to have tax protected retirement income that is also safe from market fluctuations?

investing,How leveraged are banks and the public right now?,"We have been in an artificially low interest rate environment for very long.  The S&amp;P 500 has grew significantly in the last 6-7 years.  Real estate prices have made a big comeback.  I live in Toronto, and real estate prices here are relatively crazy (although there was a dip recently).  A 550 sq ft 1-bedroom condo in Midtown/Downtown Toronto will run you about 450k CAD.  The average detached house in suburbia will run you about $1m CAD.  I know it doesn't compare to places like Manhattan, but the growth rate is completely unsustainable compared to the average Torontonian's income.

Low interest rates have released a lot of cheap money into the market.  Interest rates are slightly higher in the US than in Canada, but still very cheap by historical standards.

personalfinance,After 1 Year I Have My Credit Line Back,"So a little under a year ago (December 2016) everything that could go wrong did go wrong all in a single week. Lost my car, my phone, my wallet and my glasses all in seperate incidences. So I was stupid and didn't pay my credit cards during the few months it took me to get it all replaced [except for the car still working on that]. And then I lost my job. Well I got a new job that pays better but not by much and have been working to pay down the cresit cards back to a point that they were not restricted and over limits. As of today I jave one of two cards back to where it is usable but have no plans of using it any time soon. The other card will take another month and a half to get back to that point as the balance was higher by 1000$ but I have it budgeted to be done 3 weeks before expected. 
In the time since I lost charging privledges I have cutup both cards and will not order replacements until the balances are at 45% of the credit limits. Which is planned to be mid December this year. 
I have a baby on the way due in January so I figure the cards will be good back up once the little one is here and we work through what little savings we have while I am on unpaid maternity leave since this job doesn't offer it as paid and I do not qualify for short term disability or FMLA due to the 1 year with the company requirement.

stocks,Byron Wien: Bull Market Has 2 Years or More,"The veteran investment strategist writes that the “usual factors that warn of a bear market or recession are not evident.”

In my conversations with institutional investors I find a surprising lack of optimism about the outlook for equities. The capitalization-weighted Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 was up over 11% year-to-date, excluding dividends, on September 18. Some would argue that only a few stocks are accounting for the rise, but the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 was up over 8% year-to-date as well. Everyone is aware that the economic expansion and the bull market have continued for a long time. Equities bottomed in March of 2009 and the economy began to strengthen in June of that year, so we have been in a favorable period for investing for more than eight years.

Cycles usually do not last this long. We all know it can’t go on forever, but I believe we could continue on a positive course for both the economy and the market for several more years.

The principal reason for this conclusion is that the usual factors that warn of a bear market or recession are not evident. I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. What would really worry me would be an inverted yield curve, but there is now almost an eighty basis point spread between the two-year Treasury and the ten-year. I would also be concerned if retail investors were euphoric about equites as they were in 1999 or 2007. They are generally optimistic, but not excessively so, although earlier this year sentiment did rise to a worrisome level. Investors large and small are also leaning toward the defensive.

Hedge fund net exposure clearly shows a mood of caution: it is just under 50% now; it was mostly 55%–60% in the 2000–2008 period. Individuals are still buying bond funds even at these low yields because of their lack of confidence in the stock market. Institutions, in their desperate search for yield, have bid up the price of lower-quality bonds to the point where their spread with Treasuries is historically low. Warnings of trouble ahead, however, would usually be associated with high spreads. Maybe investors are too complacent, but not this may not be the case if the economy continues to grow.

We know that the Federal Reserve was considering an additional increase in the federal funds rate in September, but was discouraged from taking any action by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The planned shrinkage of the Federal Reserve balance sheet was probably also delayed for the same reason. The S&amp;P 500 has also shown a tendency to peak after each rate increase by the Federal Reserve and we have only begun the tightening cycle now. The hurricanes are likely to reduce third-quarter real GDP growth by at least one-half of one percent, but demand driven by rebuilding should be reflected positively in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018.

Another important warning signal is the Leading Indicator Index, which has been climbing steadily since 2016. Recent data shows the possibility of a growth slowdown but a continuation of the expansion. The slowdown, if it comes, may trigger a correction in the equity market, but the present steep slope of this indicator suggests nothing more serious than that. Based on this data, even when the Index tops out, we would still have as long as two years for the market to work its way higher before the downturn begins. Corporate earnings are still increasing and there has never been a recession while that is happening.

Strong business activity exists not only in the United States, but throughout the world: Europe should grow at close to 2% this year; so will Japan. The rates for China, and India will be close to 7%. The U.S. will benefit from continued strength in these key areas. One condition that invariably appears before a recession is an increase in cyclical spending as a percentage of GDP. This indicator has exceeded 28% before every recession going back to 1970 but is only at 24% now. Perhaps there is a secular shift in spending patterns toward non-cyclical services rather than goods that accounts for the drop, but we still should expect a pick-up in cyclical spending before the end of the cycle. Another factor dampening capital spending is that operating rates are only 77%. There is plenty of slack capacity and no great need for new plant and equipment.

The market has clearly responded favorably to the election of Donald Trump last November. Aside from his pro-growth agenda, he promised to bring a more business-friendly attitude to Washington. His failure to get any of his major initiatives passed through Congress has been a disappointment and one would think the market’s response to that would be negative. What has neutralized the lack of progress on his agenda is the better current performance of the economy itself, notwithstanding any boosts it might get from his agenda of tax reform, decreased regulation and infrastructure spending. Real growth in the U.S. is headed toward 3% and the economy seems to be gaining momentum rather than slowing down, as it usually does in the second half of a business cycle. Moreover, there is reasonable prospect of deregulation at the administrative level.

While the Trump administration appears to be off to a slow start on legislation, most investors believe that there will be a reduction in corporate taxes by the end of 2017 or early next year and other aspects of Trump’s agenda will be passed in 2018. The recent deal to lift the debt ceiling and temporarily keep the country running was viewed as an indication of Trump’s flexibility, his negotiating skill and his willingness to act in opposition to some key Republican leaders to get a necessary piece of legislation done. The question is whether his strained relationship with important members of his party will make it difficult to get other parts of his program implemented. My guess is that we will definitely see a tax cut, but probably not broad tax reform; continued deregulation, particularly in industries like energy and finance; and infrastructure spending, stimulated by rebuilding as a result of Harvey and Irma. Most of this, however, will happen next year.

The hurricanes pushed North Korea off the front pages of newspapers across the country, but the market had begun to scale back its fear of Kim Jong-Un even before the storms. There may be two reasons for that. The first is that Kim has achieved his objective of getting North Korea viewed as an important country at least militarily. He will never give up his nuclear arsenal, since he knows it will discourage any outside threats. The second is that while Kim is impetuous, unpredictable, and even homicidal, he is not, as Tom Friedman has pointed out, suicidal. He demonstrated this when he threatened to hurl an intercontinental ballistic missile at Guam and then backed off, sending the missile into the northern Pacific Ocean instead. He knows that any unprovoked attack by North Korea involving the loss of life of innocent people would cause China to abandon Kim and be met with instant and massive U.S. retaliation, endangering the North Korean population and his family’s regime. Sanctions have had an impact on his already weak economy. An increase in sanctions, particularly by China, could be devastating, but that is not likely to happen, so we will have to hope that Kim’s truculence quiets down on its own. Containment is the most likely U.S. policy. If I am right and he has achieved the respect he seeks, perhaps that will happen, although the harsh rhetoric and threats are likely to continue.

There is always the risk of a policy mistake out of Washington that negatively changes the mood of the market. The departure of Steve Bannon as the administration’s chief strategist and the arrival of John Kelly as chief of staff have been viewed positively by investors. The chance of a poorly reasoned decision on trade or foreign policy has diminished. The two potential trouble spots on trade are China and NAFTA. Trump continues to believe that China is dealing in an unfair way with the United States and he wants to change that. He must realize, however, that China is a key supplier of component parts for many items assembled in America as well as a producer of goods no longer made here. He must view the country as a trading partner and not an adversary. While he can fairly be tough on intellectual property and tariffs, he should not let the relationship become hostile. With regard to NAFTA, the agreement can be improved through modification, but scrapping it would be unwise. I believe that’s the position that Wilbur Ross, Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will take, and they are the key players here. Trump has shown a willingness to shift toward modification rather than termination in the Iran deal.

Many investors are concerned about an increase in inflation in view of the tight labor market that has resulted from the low level of unemployment and the monetary expansion that began in 2008 and continued until last year. As Milton Friedman famously said, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Friedman is no longer around to answer to his fellow economists as to why his pronouncement is no longer accurate. The combination of globalization and technology have worked together to keep inflation low. The highly respected and closely watched Phillips curve no longer has predictive value. It would argue that inflation should be moving up because of low unemployment. We had a similar circumstance in 1999 when the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates by a quarter point in spite of a lack of evidence that inflation was rising. They kept raising rates and by May of 2000 the federal funds rate was 6½%, up from 4¾% in June 1999, thereby contributing to the bear market we experienced at that time when the technology bubble burst. They are not likely to make the same mistake again.

The Bank Credit Analyst (BCA) has identified some other indicators that could provide an early warning on inflation. They include personal consumption expenditures, the producer price index for finished goods, the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Prices Paid and the Corporate Prices Paid deflator. Only the finished goods indicator looks troubling now. In that connection, BCA also has found money velocity a useful indicator of future inflation, and this looks like it could be signaling a problem at some point in the near future.

Although the hurricanes may have put the Fed on hold in terms of increasing interest rates, we will likely see some hikes next year. The current yield of intermediate-term Treasurys will also likely rise. The combination of a better economy, a rising stock market and a tighter Fed should mean a stronger dollar, but that is not how the currency has performed this year. There are, however, some benefits from the dollar’s decline. The European Central Bank is less likely to taper, American exports are attractively priced and foreign earnings of U.S. companies are worth more. I expect the dollar to remain around present levels or strengthen against the euro over the near term and not be a factor in the performance of the equity market.

Still, there are plenty of other issues to worry about. There could be a jam in the Exchange Traded Funds market as a flood of investors rush to get out of specific ETFs at the same time. There are loans outstanding made by marginal companies that would have difficulty paying principal or even interest in a business downturn. The Chinese shadow banking system has a number of non-performing loans on its balance sheet. As long as the Chinese economy is thriving, these may not be a problem but they do represent a potential risk. The U.S. economy is doing well now, but the prosperity is very unevenly distributed. Large areas of the mid-west are struggling and we all should be on the lookout for signs that the economic cycle is topping.

There is always much to worry about and the investment business requires money managers to weigh the variables and make a judgment. Based on my analysis, I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. I will, however, be watchful for changes in the conditions that brought me to that conclusion.

#9. ACE is based on a PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL of the talent management agency (TMA). Thus, the project risks are in execution, not in the technical barriers or lack of product-market fit.

#10. ACE has assembled a TOP-NOTCH ADVISORY BOARD. (Check the section ""Who We Are"" above.)

#11. ACE has already proven its business concept. We have SIGNED THE FIRST CONTRACT with an established PRO player – Veronika Kudermetova, winner of 19 international tournaments (No. 66 in WTA ranking in doubles, top 200 in singles). We are close to signing the first advertising deal for Veronika. 

#12. ACE aspires to introduce 1 BILLION TENNIS FANS to the blockchain world. Top 20 players have 172 million active fans. We put special emphasis on global PR and marketing among the non-geeky tennis fans. The message ""be part of the next Federer's success and get exclusive offers from this star"" should resonate with them.

#13. ACE targets a GIANT MARKET. The celebrity talent management industry is bigger than companies like Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, ChemChina, Tata Motors, Sanofi, Hyundai Heavy Industries, or the GDPs of countries like Serbia (EU), Bahrain, Brunei, Cyprus (EU), Malta (EU), Jamaica, Côte d'Ivoire, Bolivia etc. The project disrupts the huge incumbents’ business ($40 billion in contracts under management) and shares the created value among the community members.

#14. ACE is a GLOBAL PROJECT looking for players and sponsors WORLDWIDE (this means higher market size, higher diversity, and less dependency on local regulations).

#15. Finally, and most importantly, by utilizing ACE PRODUCT TOKENS through the ACE platform, token holders may receive access to wide range of EXCLUSIVE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS (exclusive communication with stars, one-on-one training, VIP tickets and books, business endorsements well below market price, etc.).

Blockchain allows previously impossible ways to collectively support athletes, to decentralize key processes (scouting and promotion) which lowers the costs dramatically and shifts most of the created value to the community.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"financial advice, turning in a leased car","Hello,

I was wondering if I could have some advice. I am about to turn in my current leased car for a new one (STILL LEASING). They gave me an awesome deal because they wanted to include in on their September sales. So when you turn in a leased car (which I have not done before), they do a whole look at the car and you pay to get it back to original unused shape. I will need to get the car cleaned for sure, have some minor damage on the right back passenger door from the one and only time I lent my sister my car, and a couple light scratches on the front that can be buffed out. They are giving me $500 off whatever I owe (they really wanted to close the deal). What I am wondering though is should I get my car cleaned professionally before I return it? Am I making a mistake bringing it to them and trusting them to not murder me with charges for repairs/cleaning?

edit: for me, I cannot buy right now. I have so much debt from student loans and work for a nonprofit. I don't have several thousand to drop on a car. I wish I had 4-5000 to drop on a car outright, but I do not. The deal seemed great because they didn't want any money down for it and it's a low monthly rate. Also the total cost of the car if I choose to buy at the end is lower than MSRP and around Market Value (I checked). The question I was asking was not if I should or should not lease, it was about how can I avoid being totally fucked by them with service costs

Also worth mentioning-- in retrospect, my initial lease was a mistake and I should have fought them more. If I chose to buy the car (the car I am driving now), it would cost me $24000 overall. The car I'm going to be leasing, they are charging me way less if I chose to buy at the end.",finance
Ripple,"Banks, Swift, Countries Create own Blockchain technology why it doesn't effect Xrp ripple","Every individual bank may create there own block chain, but if you are lets say Royal bank (Canada) and send Money to the US. What are there tokens worth?? Whatever they say there worth. Royal bank could make a 10 dollar coin and send to US as payment but then how does that US bank cash in on the 10 dollars. They would have to wait for royal bank US division to pay the exchange rate for it. Its Not decentralized, its would still be more susceptible from hacking. You bet if they do this hackers are going to be all over them like white on rice good luck to them on that. Plus they would be tied to the Canadian Dollar fiat. This is the opposite of every other crypto currency Bitcoin , Ethereum Xrp. They are tied to world currency not one particular country. They may use it but they will run into it being inefficient as a world currency token its much easier to back something that everyone uses. Xrp, by the time anything comes to play such as other banks using there coin. Those 3 coins will be heavy hitting with 200 Billion plus market caps they will be worth using instead of there own. 




Swift has the Same problem, they can create there own but its just like you making monopoly money if only create the value of your money it may not be generally accepted everywhere people would have to invest into there technology and trade it openly. Swift has no intention of this, they have the same as any other bank tie block chain to a particular fiat most likely European. This has the same problem as above. 




Countries that Create there own blockchain. Sure each country could create there own block chain this is absolutely  fine. It has Zero bearing on XRP... Why???? Because its just like Fiat or Money. They create destroy they have the power which is why you have things like the global financial Crisis of 2008. A value of a specific blockchain or fiat deflating and near worthless. Additionally if a country creates a digital fiat then they still have the problem of sending it to another country and it being exchanged there. 



Xrp is literally the bridge between Blockchain technology and fiat (be it gold, silver, us, canadian, yen, pound). 





The world needs something Universal sort of like the Dow Jones, This is the underpinning of shares and values of the stock market. When the Dow goes down so does everything else just like how Bitcoin effects all other Coins right now. What needs to happen is Xrp to be the underpinning of the Block chain. Once this becomes dominate it will be used to send bank to bank, country to country or through swift. You might see clients in 10 years who say I want to send x from country x to country y in fiat y, and they will specifically ask for it to be used over xrp appose to swift or bank. Why??? Because they have millions needing to be transferred and they would be each banks set of rules and regulation and ""FEES!!!!!"" for transferring that money. Xrp will still be cheap banks are greedy fuckers so are countries so is Swift. 




I truly believe along with every single other holder of Xrp that it will be the dominate world coin just like Dow jones is to Stocks. Xrp Will be the world currency without being it because it isn't also viewed as investment/trading/hedge funds. India literally wants to underpin its digital Currency with Xrp because of the collapse of there fiat not a few years ago. 



For those wondering why Swell is super important its because the guy in charge of the financial crisis of US Federal Reserve is speaking there( Think if you can underpin a global currency this could be most excellent if another crisis were to happen). The Father of the Internet, This guy help design and implement every protocol that websites use so that you can use your android or pc or mac or anything and view a web page properly be in from 1993 or 2017 and now Don Tapscott.

Now tell me he isn't thinking about those issues above. IF Banks , Swift, Countries create there own block chain we are in the same boat we are always in just difference is we use Block chain.** This is why Bitcoin was Created!!** This is why we have blockhain, this is why its decentralized this is why..... This is why we are all here today reading about each block chain and investing in it because not are we all betting that we get some fiat in the end we are also investing in something the currently transcends the current fiat problem.

personalfinance,Defaulted Private &amp; Federal Student Loans - What Now?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,I (24M) am trying to figure out if I am allocating my money properly. Salary is $65k/year.,"There's a lot of flying variables flying around my head, so I wanted to make this post to try to keep my head from spinning, and to verify with you guys/girls that my personal finance approach is sound.
 
**Overview**
 
Right now I make $65,000/yr. I'm a 24 year old male. I live alone and pay $850/month for rent. I've been in the workforce for a little over 2 years now.
 
**401k**
 
My 401k now has $18,890 in it. My company matches the first 4% dollar per dollar invested, and the following 2% is 50 cents per dollar invested. So I think that effectively equals a full match up to 5%. I've been just doing the full match, nothing more. That's because I've been putting the extra money towards student loans &amp; a Roth IRA account.
 
**Roth IRA**
 
I've only recently started a Roth IRA. I've been depositing $450/month, and right now it's at $1800. Somewhere between now and March I'm going to have to put in a little extra (about $1000 - if I deem I can handle it) so that I hit $5500 by the end of the fiscal year.
 
**Student Loans**
 
I started out with $28,000 in student loans. I graduated in May 2015, and the grace period ended in December 2015. The minimum monthly payment is $295, but I've been paying $750/month. I'm now down to $13,600 total. That is split into 5 loans:
 
* $1,211.17  with a 4.410% interest rate
* $4,398.48  with a 3.610% interest rate
* $1,691.32  with a 3.610% interest rate
* $3,950.57  with a 3.150% interest rate
* $2,745.65  with a 3.150% interest rate
 
I estimate at the end of November, the 4.410% loan will be paid off. Once that happens, I plan to reduce the monthly payments to $300/month, and take that extra $450/month and put it into my 401k.
 
**New and Improved 401k**

So with that extra $450/month going to my 401k and that being equivalent to ~$615 pre-tax, that means I'm contributing an extra $7,380/year, bringing the total to $11,280/year ($7,380 + $3,900 (original 6%)). That's 17.4% of my base salary going into my 401k.

**Health Insurance**

For health insurance, I'm still on my parents'. I have an option to switch to my company's and start an HSA, but from what I can tell, it's cheaper for me to just stay on my parents as long as I can because I don't have to pay that.

**Retirement**

After reading [this article](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) I did the math, and between my 401k and IRA, I think I'll be saving (once I switch the $450/month from student loans to 401k in November) 30% of my take home pay. So according to that chart on the website I should be good to retire in about 28 years. Does that seem right?

**Conclusion**

What do you guys/girls think? Does this make sense what I'm doing, or would you do something differently? Should I be saving more? Let me know if I left out any important info. I just always am concerned that I'm not making the most of my money, and want some verification. Thanks guys/girls.",finance
CryptoCurrency,(Long but informative) What makes Chainlink different?,"**1.** Eth and smart contracts. We all know smart contracts are revolutionary, but their use cases are limited. Smart contracts are awesome, but they are confined within the blockchain and data on the blockchain. In other words, right now smart contracts are ""you send 1 Eth and I'll send back 1000 McTokens"", and this contract is verifiable/trustworthy/amazing but its stuck within the universe of Ethereum and the data Ethereum understands.

**2.** It is possible to use external data to inform these contracts, but right now that process is centralized. This is a problem. Lets say the external data is a transaction of Dollars for ETH. So you send 300$ to bank account X, and then I send one Eth to your address. Right now you either do that through a third party (CoinBase), OTC (LocalBitcoins) or whatever else centralised system you want to use.

Knocking out that centralization, where you have to trust someone, is THE key to SmartContracts having a real world use case. But how do you get that information -- the fact that the $300 has been sent -- onto the blockchain using data that the smartcontract understands?

**3.** Oracles. Right now the answer is ""hey we can hire Oracle X to do the translation to represent this bank dollar transaction on the blockchain."" The ""oracle problem"" with this is that you are 100% TRUSTING that oracle to act prudently. That they don't tamper with the data. So we can kill Coinbase but now we have to trust the oracle instead of Coinbase .This is a HUGE problem for Banks who want to get into blockchain but have to trust a centralised oracle to translate data. This Oracle can be hacked, falsified, defrauded, really all the problems that come with centralisation.

**4.** ChainLink - this service DECENTRALISES that translation process of the Oracle. Now, the translation is honest, and you have a true/trustworthy data feed that informs the smart contract.

Multibillion dollar institutions can rely on distributed blockchain technology and know the data that informs their smart contracts is tamperproof.

---

So Thats what ChainLink does. ChainLink is the first decentralised Oracle that allows anyone to securely provide smart contracts with access to external data, off-chain payments, and really literally any other API you can dream up. Confirmation of delivery of an items (RFID, like Walton), confirmation of a wire being sent or received, interest rates from any central bank, sports scores, product/machine uptime, price of Eth/BTC in real time, weather patterns etc. Right now smart contracts are simple if/then functions where you go and manually do the if so the then comes back. Now with Oracles smart contracts can automatically confirm or deny if then statements without any human interaction. Transactional automation for agreed upon terms on steroids.

---

Anyone can now engrain off-chain data directly onto the blockchain in an actually decentralised way and use that data to directly inform smart contracts, and since the Oracle is decentralised you know the data feed is secure and you’re not concerned with tampering on the Oracle’s part. This is like a skeleton key to actualise the data on the blockchain and apply that data to real world use cases.

---

**The** biggest thing that I am yet to mention is that Chainlink are working with SWIFT on their own SWIFT Smart Oracle. Allowing smart contracts on various networks to make payments, send governance instructions, and release collateral with over 11,000 banks. 

So Chainlink is like ripple, but even better because it works WITH the current systems in place (in banking), rather than forcing adoption of a completely new system. Chainlink is even better again, because it's only use is not merely in the financial sector. 

Chainlink will be conducting a live demo at the SWIFT-organised, SIBOS conference on 16th October. (Google has plenty of sources for this, if you don't believe me).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Decent credit (~630?) but getting myself into bigger credit card debt than I can handle. Halp!,"Edit about the credit since everyone is stuck on me calling it decent: - okay, now I know that's not decent! I am and have always been poor, I'm queer and in 'punk' for lack of a better term circles. Honestly, I've not even known it to be bad because whenever my peers have talked about credit, we're talking like 400 kind of situation. I've been homeless and so have many of my peers, so I honestly thought (especially about a year ago before this newer debt) I was doing quite well. And in a way I was, I'm also Canadian living in the US, so I have only had a social security number for 8 years.

Hi! So I'm 31, and I've been a... bit dumb about finances for a little over a year now. I quit my job to go to school, got financial aid to do so. I'm not worried (right at this moment) about my financial aid debt, the problem is that I was not able to afford anything other than rent and school cost with the financial aid. So I got a 12 month no-interest credit card for everything like food, transport, and all the other shit life tosses your way. I didn't really have a plan for what I'd do once that 12 months was up. I guess I thought I'd make a bunch of money in the summer? Well, that didn't work out. 

I have been managing to make the minimum payments luckily, but I'm basically at the point right now where I'm still waiting on this next year's financial aid and I... have nothing other than credit cards to live off of (rent is covered for a couple months). 

So, I have 6-7K of credit card debt to pay off that is going to accrue interest any second (if not already started this month), and I have no way of making it appear in any real way. I'll be able to slow down the credit card purchases soon once I get financial aid, but there won't be enough to put towards that credit card debt. 

I've received offers in the mail before that basically give you loans for very minimal interest for a certain time period. Would that be a reasonable choice to make to pay off the higher interest rate active credit card debt? Then I still owe money but it's not increasing exponentially? 

My schooling will be done in a year and I feel very confident in my ability to get a decent job in the field. As for right now I feel that it's very important I focus on school and finishing, and it's a full 9-5, 5 day a week education, so room for a job is quite tight without sacrificing my education. 

Okay wall of text over, any advice would be much appreciated.",finance

This didn't sound correct to me, so I called again. This time the employee wasn't confident on the answer,so he spoke with his manager and he said that if I pull it out it will be taxed twice. I looked into this myself and it looks like if you are not of the age of 59 1/2(which I was aware of) and pull out your money, you will be charged an early Penalty tax which will look like income on your taxes which will be taxed again.

Bitcoin,"The What, Why, and Who of Segwit2X (for noobs)","Here's broadly how Segwit2X came about, since so many are asking (if I mangled or missed something it's okay, my post is secured by proof-of-pedantry and you can find the proper info in the comments):

Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit).

This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.

He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself).

The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.

Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners).

Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.

With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named ""UASF"" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with ""Segwit2X"", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.

The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit.

To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:

Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.

All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"21, decent credit, auto loan is killing me, what are my options?","I'm a 21 year old male living in the US. About a year and a half ago I made the mistake of getting a used car from a dealership without thinking far enough into the future. I was easily paying it off back when I was living with my mom but now that I'm out on my own it's really digging into my budget and I'm having trouble saving money because of it. You've heard this story before.

Here are the details:

**Car** - Used 2008 Honda CR-V LX

**Payoff** - $7,500

**Interest Rate** - 5.45%

**Length of Loan** - 48 months

**Monthly Payment** - $253

My FICO credit score is 750. (Recently up 44.) 

I've tried looking at several different banks online (PNC, Capital One, Wells Fargo, etc.) but none of them seem to want to budge on this. I've noticed most of them are looking to refinance cars that are 2009 and up, but I have no idea if there are other ways around this. 

If I could shave ~$100 off my monthly payment that would be a big help for my budget. I figure the easiest way is to extend the loan to 6 years and hopefully haggle to interest rate down given my improved credit. That being said it's proved very difficult to actually start a refinancing process with any bank. I'd also hope to be able to pay off the remaining balance within the next two years as I'm not trying to pay for this car for an additional 4 years. 

I appreciate your time and am willing to provide additional information you may need. Thanks in advance for any help you're able to provide!",finance

personalfinance,Withdrawing money from a 401K?,"Hey people of r/personalfinance, I just had a few questions on the ramifications of withdrawing money from an old employer's 401K.

First, I am aware that this is a last resort option. I am aware that this is heavily advised against. I am going through some extreme financial hardship and if I do not withdraw this $5,000 I will lose my home. I am 27 and I feel that I can rebuild this $5,000 rather quickly once I'm back on my feet. I do not qualify for a hardship withdrawal. 

I know they say the tax peanelty is harsh and I will be taxed twice, once when the finances are pulled and once at tax time it will be taxed as income. There is a 10% fee from Fidelity for withdrawing, then the 10% federal tax and my state's income tax of 5%. Then it will be taxed as income, and I am in a low tax bracket (15%.) So I'm assuming of the $5,000 I may see $3,200- $3,500 of it if I'm lucky.

Basically I'm just writing this to ask, am I correct? Is there anything I'm missing or anything else I need to know? Will I need to retain some of the funds to pay come tax season? I don't have a ""tax person"" I can seek out, really. I'm used to doing my taxes with TurboTax. Any help is appreciated.",finance
CryptoMarkets,Philly Fed Chief: Bitcoin Has Little Chance of Thwarting Monetary Policy,"Recent article from CoinDesk that I thought was kind of funny.

https://www.coindesk.com/philadelphia-fed-chief-bitcoin-yet-tested/

According to Harker, ""The paper that's in your pocket, that we call money, only has value because we believe it has value, because we believe the government stands behind it. It's all trust issues... ""And so, when cryptocurrencies and other forms of currency emerge, I think the basis of that has to be how do they create that trust?""

Prime example of someone that only considers the surface meaning of something new.  Completely misses the point that the blockchain in general is a trustless instrument.  The question is, do you trust the paper in your pocket - more importantly, do you trust the assets you hold in various financial institutions or markets such that you can liquidate them to usable currency in the case of ""bad times"".  To give a more fair analysis, though, I think blockchain technology may still carry some risks including domination of hashing power, domination of large percentage of coins, etc.  Though, I still need to understand these risks better.

He goes on to discuss that if cryptocurrencies have largely been untested - I think it's a good point - how would cryptocurrencies respond if the general market became very bearish?  The crypto market has not faced a general bear market in stocks, for example.  It will be very interesting to see how this will unfold.  However, upon liquidation of stock assets to fiat, how might people want to utilize that?  In poor economic conditions, presumably for daily necessities.  But for those that wish to/can continue to invest, how might they do it?  Emerging markets? Gold?  Possibly.  The US dollar?  I doubt it, with interest rates as low as they are.  If I had to bet, I would say that crypto market might initially decline with the overall market in coordinated fashion, but would bottom and recover much sooner than you may think.

Will consolidation or refinancing help?

personalfinance,Handling old credit card debt,"Years ago, when I was in college, I was an idiot and chose not to get a job for cash, but instead got my first credit card. This company graciously kept increasing my credit limit, and being young and stupid I took every penny available to me. The card was cancelled/deactivated by that bank years ago; and I've been paying the balance down ever since. I still owe about $4,100.

I'm really tired of paying on this balance that started accumulating over 12 years ago. I don't remember exactly when the card was cancelled, but it was at least 4-5 years ago. 

I'm aware it's debt I've accumulated and am responsible for, and I'm aware of snowballing and paying extra when I can. I know I can apply for a balance transfer credit card to move the debt - the current interest rate for this account is 7.9%. Anybody know of any other options to get this knocked down/out, or am I stuck paying on this until it's gone?

Thanks for the advice",finance
personalfinance,"I'm facing major financial hardships while attending university and am strongly considering dropping out, but I'm attending school on a Federal Pell grant that I cannot afford to pay back... What can I do?","I am a 24-year-old man attending university this semester on a combination of a 529 college fund set up by my grandparents and a $2,800 federal Pell grant. After I used up what was left of my 529 money, I still owed my school roughly $600 for the semester. At this point, the federal Pell grant kicked in and I got over $2,200 in a refund, which *absolutely* had to go to car repairs (brakes, new tires, etc.) and to pay my rent for the month.

I recently started a new job at a very high-end restaurant as a busser/food runner ($10/hour) in hopes of becoming a server to make good tips, but a few weeks after I started I was told by management that they need me to stay in the position I'm at now until ""after the holidays."" I don't have that kind of time, the rent is due and I just burned through the last of my savings to pay for that and groceries. I make roughly $1,100-1,200/month and it feels like I'm chocking to death over my finances.

My monthly expenses are as follows:

- Car payment - $200 (2010 Honda Accord, $6000 left to pay off and it burns oil)
- Car insurance - $250 (accident earlier this year, plus I live near university, which has many risky student drivers)
- Gas - $80 ($70 for gas, $10 for a quart of oil every month)
- Groceries - $150?
- Prepaid Tracfone - $20~/month to replenish data/minutes/texts
- Rent - $413

I do not have any credit card debt, and I've got a $2,600 subsidized federal loan to repay for health insurance for the school year, as it was mandatory to have. As far as I know, I've cut every expense *to the bone* and the only thing I can think to cut next is the car, but that isn't possible since I need it to get to work and I still owe money on it.  

I'm strongly considering dropping out of my state university so I can find extra work. The bills are piling up and I'm stuck working a BS $10/hour job at 25-30 hours a week. I've been looking at reputable, online universities like Arizona State University or Penn State University to finish my degree while I work full time elsewhere to take care of myself. I feel like I can't keep going to a brick and mortar school anymore because it tears me away from being able to pay my bills.

What can I do? I feel really depressed and scared and I don't know what to do next. I absolutely CANNOT afford any extra bills right now, let alone another $5,400 in school-related bills ($2,800 pell grant + 2,600 federal subsidized loan).

personalfinance,Paying my parent's PLUS loans. How do I strategize?,"I'm graduating college in May, and I expect to be making about a 40k salary for a while. I have 23k in my own student loans, and about 40k in PLUS loans that I told my parents I would pay back. Because the PLUS loans are a much higher amount and a much higher interest rate, I was initially planning on attacking those first. But now I'm thinking - would it be better to attack my federal loans first and make minimum payments on the PLUS loans? That way I could get all the debt out of my name, maybe invest some money, and pay the PLUS loans back later? I'm not really sure what to do.",finance
personalfinance,401k loan question,"So I have a question before I spend the money I just borrowed. I have a little over 10k in cc debt that I have been working at paying off with little progress over the last 2 years, due to interest rates and my salary barely covering bills I only made about 1k dent in it so far. Interest rates are between 13-23% on them. I have not used them for any new purchases in that time. I have trained myself to not touch them and stay within my budget, a lesson I am paying for now I wish I had learned earlier in life. I took a 401k loan out that will pay my balance on all my cards down to 0 at 5.2% for 3 year term. The payment out of my paycheck automatically comes out every two weeks and is still going to be about $100 check less than I was paying on the cards. I deposited the check in the bank and am waiting for it to clear.my question before I use the money to pay of those accounts is, should I do it or should I pay the loan off instead and keep trying to make a dent in it.

10k credit card debt 13-23% interest
401k loan 5.2% interest payed to myself
Only downside is no extra payments to not pay off early, either repay in full or continue on set amounts.
I appreciate any advice or thoughts one way or the other, if I pay the loan back all I will lose is the $75 fee to take it out and the few days of interest which will go into my account anyways.",finance

personalfinance,"Pension lump sum, gift tax?","Hi everyone, I just wanted to get some insight for my parents situation. 

So my parents came to the US as immigrants late in their lives (late 40s) and will be retiring in a few years. My dad is considering getting a lump sum as his pension from his state job. He is planning to give half of the sum to my mom since she will not get any retirement income aside from social security (in large part because she got my sister and I through college). 

So my question is, will giving a sum of possibly around 50K be taxed here in California or federally? They have a joint bank account but it would be better for my mom to keep it in a separate account since my dad is not good with money. 

Also, in the event in which my dad defaults on a loan and it goes to collections (he has some high usage credit cards that hopefully should be paid off before he retires), can they go after my mom? 

Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,Unexpected bonus - ideas on sheltering tax liability?,"I’ve recently come into an unexpected bonus at work. I’m wondering if PF has any suggestions on how I can best shelter my tax liability this year. 

Some details:

- The bonus is considered ‘supplemental income.’

- Gross was near $55k and the net is closer to $33k; a tax advisor told me I would likely need to pay another $5k 
come tax time.

- I’m in the 25% bracket normally (Married filing jointly), but this will bump me into 28% this year. (I understand only the eligible increase is taxed at 28%)

- My debt situation:

    - Student loans and other debt (auto, mortgage, home improvement) at reasonably low interest rates (under 5% mostly). 

    - 5k in credit card debt at about 11%, and another $8K in credit card debt at 0% (I’m on track for paying this off by 12/2018.)

I was hoping to make the unexpected money work for me rather than paying off loans, which I’m already keeping pace with. My credit score hovers around 750. From a lot of advice I see shared here, maybe that's a mistake?

As far as tax shelters go, the main option I see is to change my contributions from a roth 401k to a traditional 401k for the rest of the year. I’d try to get as close to the 18K limit for the year from those contributions - and use the bonus to supplement my take home income for the remainder of 2017.

Does anyone have any other ideas?

I was hoping I could use the money to invest in a rental property, start a small business, maybe a franchise, but I’m not sure any of those will really give me the ability to save anything on taxes this year. 


Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions.

personalfinance,"Couple expecting a baby, need two cars and are experiencing the worst luck ever.","Hi everyone, 
Thanks for reading. I just need some guidance because I'm really feeling stuck and at a standstill and don't know what to do. I feel like every choice I make just leads me back to the same spot. 

Here's the situation: 
I fell pregnant in March. Life was fine enough, we moved in with my fiances parents to save money and rented out our house. I had a steady paying job of about 40,000k a year working part time while attending my last year of university. Fiance was working at a new restaurant that had just opened as a general manager, making about 50k a year to start. It seemed hopeful. 

Then -- 
1. Flash forward a month, I lose my job. Was out of work for another month, then had to accept a job doing the same thing for about $4/less per hour and go full time instead of part time. 

2. My car breaks down completely and we are stuck with one car. All was fine because I was out of university (40 min commute) and my job was only 5 mins away from home. 

3. Flash forward two months, fiance loses his job. Restaurant owners said restaurant is not doing well and they cannot afford to pay him. He has a previous record (drug use, mostly misdemeanors) and so it has been hard for him to find a management position or any position that is worth taking. He goes to work with his dad, who only pays him a few hundred a week. 

4. My last semester at uni starts up. The same week, the one car we were sharing blows up (transmission). It has been over a month since we have had a car. We have been sharing a car between the two of us, his mom, dad, and brother. We all have very different schedules so I have had to miss a lot of my school time and been late to work repeatedly due to not having a vehicle. Our car is getting fixed, but the mechanic keeps dicking us around. We went to pick it up two days ago, but now it is making a horrible sound as though they've screwed something else up so now we are stuck waiting again. His mom wanted to start running a small kiosk and rotating through the military base exchanges that are over an hour or more away from our house. She wants my fiance to run it. We start that on October 10th. Meanwhile, I still have to get to work and school. We are hoping the car will get fixed before then but it's unlikely and even so, we are going completely opposite directions. We need a car. We have to pay to fix our current car and Our credit sucks. A series of bad luck for both of us, especially me. No one is willing to cosign for us. I wanted to try and either: 

1. Just buy a cheap car in cash. I'm looking at probably a 2004 Honda accord with 150k+ mileage for about $3000-4000. That would be all of our savings but I'll still be able to work for the next few months and recoup some. The only thing I worry about is putting that much money upfront and with our luck, having a major problem with the car down the road and having to dump more money into it. 

OR 

2. Putting down $2-3k on a car roughly about $7500. Newer car with about half the mileage of the older car I am looking at. My highest credit score is a 608 with TransUnion, so I'm looking at a very high interest rate but I can pay the car off when I get my tax return in February and still have a few grand leftover to put in savings. 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice??? Which is the better idea?",finance
personalfinance,Student loans vs investing; investment priorities,"I'm early 30s, just starting career out of graduate school (long, expensive education). Single income household with wife and 4 kids. Have $410k student loans consolidated to 4.5% in a 10yr repayment plan. Income: 400-450k. Living on much less than income, and trying to figure out the best way to use the leftover. Also have 24k in IRA as only retirement savings and an adequate emergency fund.

My question:
What is the most efficient use of disposable $?
Currently my financial priorities are:
  1) max backdoor Roth IRAs (for spouse and self) - 11k/yr
  2) max 401k - additional 6k/yr over my employer contribution maxes this out
  3) fund 529s for kids (my state offers state income tax deduction, which really only saves ~3% after you figure the increase in federal income tax d/t lower state tax)
  4) early payments on student loans
  5) eventually I plan to open a taxable brokerage account

I'm operating under the assumption that 4.5% loan rate means investing makes more sense than putting everything available toward the loans.
Do these priorities seem right? Is it reasonable to invest rather than payoff loans ASAP?",finance
