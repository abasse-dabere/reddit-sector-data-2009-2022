personalfinance,Pay off mortgage or save for investment property?,"My husband and I have 13 years left on our 15 year mortgage, no PMI, and a 3% interest rate. We can afford to meet our monthly needs including saving for retirement and other things and also pay double on the mortgage. 

Does it make more sense to pay double and thus pay our house off quicker or to save the extra money to purchase an investment property (rental) in the future?

EDIT: thanks for the feedback. Our long term goals are to be debt free and generate some passive income. I am intrigued by REITs, does anyone have experience with these? Pros and cons?",finance
personalfinance,"My company is countering after I've resigned, need advice.","Hi /r/personalfinance, could really use your advice.


I recently accepted an offer at a great company I had previously tried to get into prior to starting at my current company (about 15 months ago). For reference I'm currently at $79k and the offer was for $84k with a 10% annual bonus; I work in the medical device/consumables field in the US. There were several reasons I wanted to leave my current company: we were recently divested (1 yr ago) and sh*t has hit the fan...a ton of legacy higher ups have been replaced and we are very understaffed at the support level. Additionally, the woman that has been my interim manager is someone I don't respect at all - she is extremely manipulative, a bottleneck of all important info from leadership and has basically no experience with what I do (she works government, I work national groups) so I know I can't develop under her, shes also railroaded me at every turn to ensure she gets all the kudos and attention for our work. She may potentially end up as my boss if I hadn't resigned.


That being said....the sales director I support, who is new, is fighting tooth and nail to keep me because I'm the last person in this role and have a lot of experience/knowledge. He called me Friday after I'd left (I put in my 2 weeks on Wed) to say he'd talked to the VP of the dept and they want me to come up with what is essentially a list of my demands to stay, to try to see if they can make it happen. We had a real honest chat and I feel like he genuinely values my contributions and thoughts whereas I didn't get that from the company at large.


Heres the thing...I like my job, I like what I do and I like the people I support. My career goals are aligned to national sales and the national sales director admitted he only plans to be at the company for 2-3 years before retiring and would love to mentor me to take his role over; at a minimum it would give me additional experience for my resume that I don't have today as I know there are no guarantees in the future. The new role is a promotion with a potential for a management position in the future which is fantastic but it's more of the same thing I'm doing now versus a straight path to the career I want...I can't decide what to do let alone what I'd even come back with to my current employer.


Has anyone been through this before?? I don't want to burn bridges but I also want to consider the possibility of my ""demands"" being met. Any advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Is my math correct on the benefits of Chase's $200 Savings Account bonus versus just keeping the money in Ally?,"In order to get the $200, I have to open a savings account, deposit at least $15000 within 10 business days, and maintain a balance of at least $15000 for 90 days after the deposit.  There's also a warning that if I close the account within 6 months after opening it, Chase will deduct the bonus.  Therefore, I need to keep it open for at least 6 months.

$200 is 1.33% of $15000, so 6 months would give me an annual interest rate of 2.67% (for simplicity I'm just gonna ignore Chase's 0.01% for their savings) compared to Ally's 1.2%.  Ally's interest would be around $90 over those 6 months ($15000*1.2%/2).

24 and married about 2 years ago. Wife and I were still pretty naive on money. We'd been living in apartments and hated it and wanted to move into our own space. Admittedly quick and somewhat out of desperation, we finished out our contract at our apartment and bought our first house. We went through a mortgage broker and got our loan through Utah Housing Corp; zero-down and ~3% interest rate(I think.) I know that we have two mortgages. Soft credit check has me at about 680(young credit history is dinging me apparently.) We have comparatively little debt; Just the house, my truck, and a small personal loan- Student loans are all paid off. I make decent money and(thankfully) my wife is killer at getting everything paid on time. We do not plan to pay the house off/stay more than ~5 years.

CryptoCurrency,Why are you a fan of CryptoCurrency?,"I recently started a job as a Financial Market Consultant and found myself working with former bond/equity/swap/forex traders and some higher managment guys in a rather big retail bank.

Here and then we do talk about CryptoCurrency in general. I wanted to point out some major issues we have with most of the ""pro crypto currency"" arguments and wanted you guys to maybe clear this up to me:

Many of you guys say: We don't need central banks or interest rates. Some say: The world is XX billion in debt - to whom? Last but not least: Banks can print money out of nowhere.


1) Without central banks we would have no price stability. Just imagine that you owe 1 Bitcoin to your friend and suddenly the price skyrockets to 5.000 Bitcoin/USD from 200 Bitcoin/USD. Sweet dreams dear 'guy in debt'.

2) Interest rate are bad? Why? First: Why would you lend money/coins in first place? Second: With interest rates created by central banks your economy can get an advantage in foreign markets: Low interest rates -&gt; weak currency -&gt; your products are cheaper in foreign countries.

3) World is huge in debt - to whom? Everything that these types of articles and studys do is to sum up all debt on earth. Which is pretty easy imo. You could i.e. just some up debt of countrys. But these studies never include the assets of the the world i.e. real estates value etc.

4) Banks can print money out of the blue? No. That's just wrong. The only ones who can do this are central banks and also not out of the blue. Just when a business banks asks for the money (and they just ask if there is demand in the economy).


I think that many people hyping the CryptoCurrency  either don't understand the current monetary system or just want the price to skyrocket further because they are invested and want high returns.

Don't get me wrong. I love the idea of easy and fast money transaction even without borders, but you can't just deny basic monetary system knowledge.

personalfinance,Laid off 2 months after starting job. Lots of credit card debt. What now?,"In a crappy situation, figuring out next steps.

I started a new job in July paying $110k/year after being self-employed previously. Less than 2 months after starting the job, I was laid off due to budget issues - the supervisor I had interviewed with was let go as well.

My employer gave me a decent serverance package - 14 days notice before layoff effective date, payback on all unused vacation time (5 days), two weeks severance pay + employer pays their share of COBRA for first 90 days following unemployment.

I applied for unemployment right away and am receiving the maximum in my state ($400/week). 

Meanwhile, I owe approximately $30k in student loans (with interest rate around 6%/year) and another $40k in credit card debt (with average APR of 12%/year).

Right now I have $5k squirreled away in savings and enough cash on hand to last the month. If worst comes to worst, I have approx $15k in a 401k, and another $2k tied up in misc investments.

I'm in my late thirties, no kids, and live with my girlfriend in a major city with expensive rent. Before starting this job, I was the sole employee of a single-employee S Corporation that was having cash flow issues (in other words, I didn't have a regular paycheck) due to a rough year in my industry.

personalfinance,"Seattle home buying: Purchased Home, changed jobs, loan denial and higher interest","Hi Reddit,
  I am in a bit of a tricky situation.  My wife and I have been looking for a home for 7 months in the Seattle area.  Competitive market to say the least.  
Our Finances ad mortgage:
We were approved for a $495,000 FHA loan with 4.000% interest rate from a mortgage broker, have been underwritten to be more competitive and  we both have 750+ credit scores.  The monthly payment would be around $2,050. Through us being so fortunate, our parent have agreed to take out a Heloc so we can offer a full cash offer and be more competitive.  After a $100,000 gift from my parents, to go towards the house, we would have a loan of $350000 loan to pay them back.
Our job situation:
My wife has been working at a company for 1 year making 32K/year and I have had the same job for 5 years making 53K/year.   

The complication:
Two weeks ago, I found my dream job.  It pays 30% more ($68K/year) with benefits but its a 1-year contract.  This job renews annually but due to the nature of this job, the needs of the position are reassessed every year (standard contract).  ANYWAYS,
I finalized My new job contract on Tuesday of last week, the same day we put an offer on a house.  We won the offer on the house and my mortgage broker asked for my new contract.  Once I submitted it, he said he cant get us the loan we previously had without stipulations based on the 1-year limit of work in the contract.  Essentially denying us the money to payback our parents for the house unless we make a few changes....

The 3 choices I have (based off what the mortgage broker has presented to us):
1.) Forfeit the earnest money, lose 10K and face the embarrassment of telling people we didn't get the house after a ton of sharing
2.)have my parents on the deed and mortgage (not ideal)
3.) take out a loan but with a higher interest rate and just pay a lot more monthly.

I know this story might be confusing and I am not that articulate in explaining the situation, but will help clarify any questions asked.  Thank for the help reddit.  I am on a time crunch for sure.",finance

I'm kinda stuck with what to do. On one hand, I have about 5.5k left on a loan at 30% ($350/mo), on the other hand I have about 10k total balance spreading around in several CCs (24-29%, min pymts ranging 50-100$).  

When I first started, i used the snowball method. And now that most of the interest rates are similar, I'm stepping back and trying to reevaluate how to go about paying things down.

For now, I've been aggressively paying down loans (and already knocked down a couple over the past 2 years!). My strategy was to attack the one with the highest monthly payment (putting into consideration interest rate, of course)...

I use this method because its easier for me to handle the low min payments on cards rather than large amounts of monthly loan payments.  ...but am I doing it all wrong at this point?

Now that my credit score is climbing... i'm starting to really think about this Credit Utilization number.  So... should I be paying the cards instead of the loan?

Bitcoin,"1988 Cover of ""The Economist"": A phoenix rising from flaming US dollars with what looks like a Bitcoin in its feet, with the year 2018 stamped on it.","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-imlSH7OAamU/WNj5dJFktTI/AAAAAAAAF9E/8apXRp5ymX0q8m1-Fz373QRC2k0dCeEswCLcB/s640/theeconomist-phoenix_get_ready_for_world_currency_by_2018.jpg   
A repost no doubt, but an interesting nugget of history nonetheless.  

&gt;THIRTY years from now, Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let’s say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today’s national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.   

 
... 
  


&gt;At the beginning of 1988 this appears an outlandish prediction. Proposals for eventual monetary union proliferated five and ten years ago, but they hardly envisaged the setbacks of 1987. The governments of the big economies tried to move an inch or two towards a more managed system of exchange rates – a logical preliminary, it might seem, to radical monetary reform. For lack of co-operation in their underlying economic policies they bungled it horribly, and provoked the rise in interest rates that brought on the stock market crash of October. These events have chastened exchange-rate reformers. The market crash taught them that the pretence of policy co-operation can be worse than nothing, and that until real co-operation is feasible (i.e., until governments surrender some economic sovereignty) further attempts to peg currencies will flounder.  


 

…  


 

&gt;The new world economy  


 

&gt;The biggest change in the world economy since the early 1970’s is that flows of money have replaced trade in goods as the force that drives exchange rates. as a result of the relentless integration of the world’s financial markets, differences in national economic policies can disturb interest rates (or expectations of future interest rates) only slightly, yet still call forth huge transfers of financial assets from one country to another. These transfers swamp the flow of trade revenues in their effect on the demand and supply for different currencies, and hence in their effect on exchange rates. As telecommunications technology continues to advance, these transactions will be cheaper and faster still. With unco-ordinated economic policies, currencies can get only more volatile.  


 

…  


 

&gt;In all these ways national economic boundaries are slowly dissolving. As the trend continues, the appeal of a currency union across at least the main industrial countries will seem irresistible to everybody except foreign-exchange traders and governments. In the phoenix zone, economic adjustment to shifts in relative prices would happen smoothly and automatically, rather as it does today between different regions within large economies (a brief on pages 74-75 explains how.) The absence of all currency risk would spur trade, investment and employment.  


...  



&gt;The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF. The world inflation rate – and hence, within narrow margins, each national inflation rate- would be in its charge. Each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand, but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit. With no recourse to the inflation tax, governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today. This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case. Even in a world of more-or-less floating exchange rates, individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world.  


 ...  
   


&gt;As the next century approaches, the natural forces that are pushing the world towards economic integration will offer governments a broad choice. They can go with the flow, or they can build barricades. Preparing the way for the phoenix will mean fewer pretended agreements on policy and more real ones. It will mean allowing and then actively promoting the private-sector use of an international money alongside existing national monies. That would let people vote with their wallets for the eventual move to full currency union. The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.  


 

…  


 

&gt;The alternative – to preserve policymaking autonomy- would involve a new proliferation of truly draconian controls on trade and capital flows. This course offers governments a splendid time. They could manage exchange-rate movements, deploy monetary and fiscal policy without inhibition, and tackle the resulting bursts of inflation with prices and incomes polices. It is a growth-crippling prospect. Pencil in the phoenix for around 2018, and welcome it when it comes.",cryptocurrency

But the SIFI designation wasn't a hinderance to AIG's growth:

&gt; 

It may just be politically motivated and Prudential Life is the only remaining SiFi: 

&gt; Its de-designation on Friday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which comprises the heads of the top regulators in the country, undermines an important part of President Barack Obama’s efforts to safeguard the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; MetLife has already successfully challenged its designation in court. The AIG decision leaves...Prudential Financial as the only remaining Sifi.

personalfinance,Confused about mortgage rates and packages,"My wife and I own two homes. Home A we live in, home B is an income property. We want to refinance home A and take out about $70,000+ of equity to fund an expansion/remodeling of home B. Once finished, we plan on moving in to home B and then making home A into an income property.

Home A is valued at approximately $255,000. We owe approximately $125,000 on it which gives us about $130,000 in equity. (These numbers are rounded so let's not get too wrapped up in the LTV percentage.)

So far I've only spoken to one guy at a major online mortgage lender. Frankly, his fast-talking style and kind-of hard sell and ""I'm trying to do what's best for YOU"" pitch made me nervous. I'm wondering if what he said sounds right and would appreciate any opinions on the matter.

First, he was *insistent* on us making a ""good faith"" payment of $500 today (Sunday, October 1, 2017) in order to lock in the interest rate he was offering. He mentioned several times that interest rates are expected to go up tomorrow (Monday October 2, 2017) perhaps by 0.25% and only making that payment today would insulate us from the rate hike. I declined to sign and make the good faith payment today because I'd like to speak to at least one more lender.

He offered a loan with all the closing costs rolled into the loan. $200,000 total loan @4.375% with -0.25 points. He said that the negative points are basically the lender paying our closing costs and then recovering that cost with a slightly higher interest rate. This is intended to close the loan with no money out of pocket.

Our concern comes in with rolling all the closing costs into the loan. The way I see it, it doesn't make sense to do that because we'll end up paying much more over the long run with the higher interest rate. It seems like paying some or all of the closing costs out of pocket now (which we can do with savings if necessary) makes more sense because we'll end up paying less over the long run.

My other concern is the interest rate. It's so hard to figure out what is too high of an interest rate right now, but it seems that 4.375% is a bit higher than it should be. I see rates advertised as low as 3.75%, but I understand that they come with stipulations too.

I'm reading as much as I can about this now to try and understand it. I'm just afraid of making a foolish decision that I'll be paying for for many years. Any advice or opinions are appreciated.

personalfinance,"""Put 15 % towards retirement"" - How does pension/401k matching factor into this?","Federal employee here. Currently contributing 11 % of my pay into the TSP (401k-style federal plan), getting an additional employer contribution of 5 % (part of which is a match). Furthermore, I'm required to buy into FERS, the federal pension plan, for another 4.4% of my pay rate.

All-in-all, that means 15.4 % of my gross pay is getting siphoned off into retirement accounts, with a 16 % contribution (11%+5%) into the TSP. The FERS pension should end up being 1%~ of my high-3 pay in retirement for every year of service.

The hangup I'm having is how to compare these numbers to the /r/personalfinance goal of ""15 % to retirement"". Do I count my FERS contribution as part of that 15 %, do I count the employer match? Do I need to increase my personal TSP contribution to 15 % (so 20 % total with the employer contribution), or can I dial it back down to 10 % or even less?

I know that ideally I'd be maxing out my yearly TSP at 18,000 and an IRA at 5,500 but I'm not sure how viable that will be until I get a raise or two. I want to make sure I'm meeting the recommended minimum in the short term.",finance
personalfinance,I'm second guessing myself... can someone please help me double check my math and confirm whether or not I'm making sense here on my Sofi Refi decisions? (xpost from r/StudentLoans/),"I'm refinancing my wife's student loans with Sofi. It's about $130K total (federal loans, w/ weighted avg. current interest rate among all of them at about 6%).

Our first quote from Sofi on a $110 K student loan refinance amount on a 15 year fixed rate with Sofi is 5.5% (~$900/month). (Note, we're planning on paying off 20K first before refinancing with some savings, thus the 110K value and not 130K)

This quoted interest rate from Sofi leads me to believe that I should ONLY refinance the federal loans with Sofi that we are currently paying over 5.5% federal interest rate on. The loans that are less than 5.5% interest rate federally, we should continue paying as is, and not refinancing (for example perkins loans are 5%).

Is this correct thinking?

I’m 23 and a recent college graduate (this may). I started working my first full-time, big boy job in June. I’m salaried at $42k (in Houston, Texas)  but I’m paid 1x rate for overtime, currently averaging about 4 hours /week. 

I’m currently saving about $1000 a month after all my expenses. I’m putting 5% into my 401k (3% pre, 2% post tax). My 401k is set to automatically increase 1% every year. Company doesn’t match, but has a profit sharing program which historically is about 7-9%. I’ll also get a 2-week bonus in December. 

All that said, I’ve got $20k in the bank, mostly just sitting in a Chase savings account. I’m blessed to not have any debt. I pay off my credit card in full every month (747 credit score). 

I’m planning to to purchase a home in the next couple years once I’ve saved up a significant down payment, since I plan to stay in the area for the current foreseeable future. So, what should I be doing with all my savings? I figure at the very least I should open a savings account with a much higher interest rate than the standard chase one I’m currently using. Should I be throwing more into retirement? Maybe I should open some investment accounts and looks at some mutual funds (or CDs, etc)? I think I read here that funds can be deducted from an IRA without penalty for a first time home purchase? 

I’ve perused the sidebar and have an idea of some of my options, but wanted to get y’all’s input. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Looking to refinance my car, don't know what I'm doing","About a year and 3 months ago my fiance crashed her car, 2 days before our wedding. We had to buy a brand new car the same day for the honeymoon, and needless to say I'm pretty sure we got shafted on the interest. 

I'm going to preface this by saying I know nothing about buying anything new. My parents were incredibly cheap and never taught me how to do any of this. My wife's parents were paying off her car at the time, and so they decided they would pay as much off on this car as they had left on the last one. My car was one with 300k miles that I got for 2.5k, so we weren't going to use that to drive a couple thousand miles on a honeymoon. 

Anyway, onto the details. I don't have the *exact* numbers, but it was very close to $16,000 with a 9% interest rate, to be paid off over 72 months. It's a 2016 Ford Focus. My credit score is at 699 right now, which I'm pretty sure is not great, but decent. How do I go about looking to refinance the car? Is there any website or company to go to? I really have no idea what I'm doing here (I can't talk to her dad about it either, he's no longer in the picture).",finance

I also have a 0% intro APR credit card I got to buy furniture for my apartment which has about $4,000 of debt on it. However, my teeth are really starting to hurt me (started to crowd once my wisdom teeth came in but never stopped :c) and I really want to get Invisalign ($5,000).

My company has a credit union associated with it, which has 3% interest rate, which is really good according to my boss. I wanted to see if I could get a personal loan for Invisalign which has a pretty high average price. 

I don't know how to 
1. Apply for a loan
2. Finance a loan 
3. If I can afford a loan

I can definitely pay off that credit card, especially since my boyfriend is splitting it all with me in full when he moves in (he is lucky to living with his parents currently and just save save save). However, I am lucky enough to be (mostly) debt free and I am terrified of falling into that hole just to get my teeth fixed. 

I'm sorry if this is a stupid type of question. I don't have a strong guidance on these types of things and everything on Google about loans seems to be subjective. I don't feel comfortable talking about my finances or personal business with people IRL so I don't know where else to get a second opinion or advice on whether this is too extravagant for me to do.

personalfinance,"Received a federal award for graduate studies that exceeded the maximum funding package given by my faculty, so they asked for the difference and I paid it. Did I mess up?","Hi Personal Finance hoping you can help with this one.

As the title implies, I'm wondering if I messed up by paying my Faculty a large chunk of the federal award I received late in the academic year (2016 - 2017). 

Background: I'm a PhD student in Canada who won a federal NSERC award (post graduate doctoral ""PGS"") in 2015 which provides me with $21,000 for two years (ending this month 2017). My Faculty's ""financial support package"" (not financial aid) guarantees additional top-ups of ~$7,000 through scholarships to a total of $28,000 / year.  

Edit: NSERC awards are not financial need-based, but rather are competitive merit-based awards. 

The 'situation': Through some good luck, I was contacted by NSERC in April stating I had been bumped up to their more prestigious award (Canada graduate scholarship) for the remainder of my original PGS award (which ended this month). This award is $35,000, and so I was paid $14,000 immediately. As a struggling PhD student I can't explain how life changing this amount of money was. However, my joy was short-lived as my Faculty administration contacted me to let me know that I owed them $7,000 since the maximum a student is ""allowed"" with their funding package is $35,000. e.g. they wanted the top-up back that they gave me.

The 'mess-up'. I paid it. Now I'm wondering if I really even had to? I don't recall signing a form about financial packages, and after reading online (including this sub), it appears companies/institutions can't legally ask for overpayments on awards/scholarships to be repaid. Plus it's not really an overpayment...

Any thoughts on all this? I don't presume I could ask for that amount back?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to work 7 days a week for a year straight to pay down student debt?,"I have 140K in student debt, 70K federal, 70K private loans. I would really like to pay off the private loans in 2 years max as they are the loans that my mom has cosigned. 

I recently had to quite my job with no job lined up to move home with my mom for legitimate and unfortunate reasons. I have some temporary work that will bring in about 1K a month for now, and as soon as I settle in I am planning on looking for both a part time job on the weekend and a full time job.

I am living with my mom for at least a year, probably two, rent free so I truly have a great opportunity to just pay these loans down hard. 

Chances are I will find the part time job before the full time job so I have no idea how much I will make at my full time job (anywhere between 40K to 60K). I don't want to get a part time job and quit a month later when I find a full time job. I was going to pick a fun part time job like working at a wine bar since I have a lot of knowledge there. So I want to continue this part time job for about a year even after I get the full time job. Hopefully in that time, even if I start off at a smaller salary I can work my way up and then I won't need the weekend work to make up for the rest.

So, is this completely unreasonable? Will I be guaranteed to burn out? I literally can not handle these loans anymore emotionaly. I. WANT. THEM. GONE. But I don't want to work myself into the ground in the process.",finance
personalfinance,Taxes as an Expat? (United States),"American currently living in Vietnam - making about $15,000 a year. I send home around $400/month for savings.

I know expats are exempt from federal income up to a certain threshold (which I believe is way higher than my salary).  

So I have a few questions:

- will my income abroad and the money I withdrew both count as taxable income? If so, at about what rate? Let's say ($15,000 income abroad + $10,000 of long term capital gains tax)

- will money I send home also be counted outside of the exemption? 

- any other insight you can provide?

personalfinance,Financial Planning for couple (Late 20's/Early 30's),"I’m the “finance person” in my household — we are an engaged couple, no kids (+ none will be coming!), completely shared finances. I’m 29, she’s 32 &amp; have lived together for a little over a year; we stretched our savings pretty well to move in together and deal with the associated moving/household furnishing expenses when moving in, so started from almost-scratch beyond a $2-3K buffer in checking accounts. Since then, I think we’ve done most things right, but wanted to get some outside opinions. Background first:

Monthly income is $6088 (occasionally higher with OT). I make 57% of our household income, but work for a small company that doesn’t offer health insurance or 401K; she is a municipal employee that makes slightly less has employer-contributed health insurance, city retirement account contributions. Her job is new in the last two months, used to make less. Ending September we have $4K in savings, and our checking balance after everything is paid each month floats in the $2-3K range. 

Our monthly budgeted expenses are $4640. This includes essentials along with non-essential expenses ($200 each “discretionary” fund, restaurant/alcohol budget, coaching fees/gym membership, good coverage renters insurance, etc.). Our “barebones, strictly essential payments” budget would be closer to $3515 if we had a major financial emergency. Not included in monthly budget number is minimum $400 we put into savings, since her new job started have been doing $600. 

No CC debt, but I do have $22.5K in student loan debt (weighted average interest 6.28% across seven federal loans, one subsidized 2.11%, rest in the 5.6-6.8% range), and we have an $11.6K auto loan balance @ 2.24%, on payment schedule will be paid off in just under 4 years. Right now our main goal following the flowchart is increasing our emergency fund to ~$20K, right around the six month mark, so we are making minimum payments on those debts ($276 student loans, $269 auto payment).

With her new job, our monthly budget leaves us with another ~$800 to work with. Given our circumstances, I have a couple questions:

- Is it reasonable to budget a 6-month emergency fund in a dual-income household for both of us not having an income (the $20K mark I’ve been shooting for) or is it reasonable to lower that given the highly unlikely scenario both of us are job-less for an extended period of time?
- Should I open a retirement account and start contributing now, or wait till our emergency fund is full and all our debt is eliminated? I’m worried that won’t happen for several more years, and I’ll be starting to save for retirement too late.
- Since I don’t have an employer-contributed 401K, is an IRA my best option? I think that’s the case from reading all the retirement articles on /r/personalfinance, but it still leaves my head spinning trying to understand all the options.
- If I don’t pursue retirement savings, our other option would be to continue contributing the current $600/month to our savings/emergency fund and have a complete fund in 24 months; alongside that could use an extra $600 to snowball student loans, and still leave an extra $200/month buffer in the budget for other special expenses. This seems attractive for making significant progress in savings and lowering debt in just two years, but still leaves me nervous about retirement.

Ultimately would make a final decision with my fiancée, but right now just trying to get opinions to see if I’m missing something big.",finance

I'm like to get the vehicle into just my name somehow. i believe my credit score is too low at this point for anyone to refinance it into just my name. the vehicle has been in a couple accidents and is now worth 10-14k instead of the 22k i still owe on it. I've taken it to a couple dealerships and they havent been interested in buying it, they would only be willing to dea if i want to trade in, but again terrible credit score. I'm not sure what to do about the truck or what my options could be at this point I feel like im stuck paying for a truck that isnt mine, with no way out.

I come from a very humble background, my family has never had money of any kind, most of the time my mom was/still is in a stuggle to keep food on the table and the lights on. I never had someone teach me the importance of a budget or how to budget. i joined the military right after highschool and until getting out never felt I had much of a reason to worry about budgeting until I got out and started getting behind on bills, trying to use credit cards to catch up and slowly digging myself a deeper hole.

At this point im both intimidated by the debt I have and having little to know knowledge on how to manage my finances as an ""adult"", yet I'm also exicted that I've been fortunate enough to land a high paying job especially at a young age and hopefully will be able to get on track sometime in the near future.

There has been a lot I left out concerning my past debts that have already been paid off or settled but i think i hit on all the pertinent info., I left things out because it would make for a more lengthy and convoluted story especially about the divorce and the way the Auto-situation came along.

From my research, and talking to my mortgage company, I can do a cash out refinancing option. Since I've bought my house, it has gone up about $50k in value. I know I won't get all that when I do this, but it will increase the mortgage payment on the house by about $200. 

After looking at all my debts on paper, I could knock out about $800 a month going towards everything. Only thing that would be still around would be some of my truck (have a year left on), the house and Private student loans.

stocks,U.S. manufacturing activity hits 13-year high; construction spending up,"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-construction/u-s-manufacturing-activity-hits-13-year-high-construction-spending-up-idUSKCN1C71RJ

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity surged to a more than 13-year high in September amid strong gains in new orders and raw material prices, pointing to underlying strength in the economy even as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to dent growth in the third quarter.

The economic outlook was also bolstered by other data on Monday showing a rebound in construction spending in August. The acceleration in manufacturing activity and the accompanying increase in prices could harden expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity surged to a reading of 60.8 last month, the highest reading since May 2004, from 58.8 in August.

A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The ISM said Harvey and Irma had caused supply chain and pricing issues in the chemical products sector. There were also concerns about the disruptive impact of the storms in the food, beverage and tobacco products industries.

The hurricanes are expected to chop off as much as six-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product growth in the third quarter. Harvey, which pummeled Texas at the end of August, has undercut consumer spending and weighed on industrial production, homebuilding and home sales.

Further weakness in likely after Irma struck Florida in early September, causing widespread power cuts. Manufacturing outside the areas affected by the hurricanes remained strong in September. The ISM survey’s production sub-index rose 1.2 points to a reading of 62.2 in September.

A gauge of new orders jumped to 64.6 in September from 60.3 in August. Factories reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey’s prices paid index surging 9.5 point to 71.5, the highest reading since May 2011.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING RISES

In separate report on Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.5 percent to $1.21 trillion. July’s construction outlays were revised sharply down to show a 1.2 percent plunge instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent drop. Construction spending increased 2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis.

The government said Harvey and Irma did not appear to have impacted the construction spending data as the responses from the Texas and Florida areas affected by the storms were “not significantly lower than normal.”

In August, spending on private residential projects increased 0.4 percent, rising for a fourth straight month. Spending on nonresidential structures increased 0.5 percent, snapping two straight monthly declines.

In the wake of Harvey and Irma, nonresidential construction spending could fall in September. According to the Commerce Department, Texas and Florida accounted for 22 percent of U.S. private nonresidential construction spending in 2016.

Investment in nonresidential structures such as oil and gas wells has been slowing as the boost from recovering oil prices fizzles. Private construction projects spending increased 0.4 percent in August.

Outlays on public construction projects rebounded 0.7 percent in August after slumping 3.3 percent in July. Spending on state and local government construction projects increased 1.1 percent in August. Gains in September are likely to be curbed by the hurricanes.

Texas and Florida accounted for 15 percent of U.S. state-and -locally owned construction spending in 2016, according to the Commerce Department.

Federal government construction spending tumbled 4.7 percent to its lowest level since April 2007.",finance
personalfinance,Soon to graduate: pay off car loan or put into savings,"Hello all, I'm looking for some advice on money management. I'm currently a university senior majoring in Computer Networking and plan on graduating this spring. After paying my school bill this January, the only debt I will have is my $10k auto loan with a 3.5% interest rate. I'll be making around $600 a month until graduation.

My question is whether I should focus on paying off my loan while I have no expenses, or if I should focus on saving money before graduation. I plan on finding a job out of town and will have to move away, so I'm leaning toward saving money and just doing the monthly payment on the auto loan for now. What does everyone here think?

personalfinance,How many should my wife and I claim on our W2's?,"My wife and I landed jobs at the same exact company, making the same pay, and working the same hours. It's $12 an hour a piece with benefits. This is under the median yearly income for our state, Arkansas. 

We have your normal everyday bills from rent to utilities, as well as phone, insurance, etc. I have medical bills and student loans to pay as well. The company also matches up to 5% of your paycheck for retirement, and we plan on both putting the entire 5% into it. We are 24 and and 22, and an early start paying towards retirement sounds splendid. 

All that being said, after taxes our income should be ~$3000 a month or so IF we both claim two for our federal and state withholdings. Our bills, including student loans, are about $1700. When you throw on necessities like gas and household items, we are at about $1800 a month at the bare minimum. That leaves us with $1200 a month to save for emergencies, and for hobbies/date nights, etc, which is plenty. However, we'd like to look into possibly getting a new (used) vehicle as our vehicles are quite old and are beginning to cost more than their worth. We may also want to look into additional retirement options to add towards, but we don't know how to do that. I've read on here about Roth IRA's, but I'm pretty ignorant as to what that even is.

personalfinance,Roth IRA -- Taxed at State level on withdrawal? (and a few other questions),"Quick question I didn't see covered in my research. I know Roth IRA distributions after age 59.5 are tax/penalty free at the federal level but what about state? I am guessing not because the contributions put into the IRA were taxed at the state level prior.


This begs the question if you live in a state with high state taxes would it make sense to contribute to a Traditional IRA? Because if you stay in the same state your whole life it will be taxed the same regardless --- but if you move to a state without taxes in retirement you would have essentially skimped out on having to pay them in the original state?


Something else that has been on my mind -- if you start taking let's say 4% yearly distributions at age 65 from your Roth IRA and the remaining funds make 4% back does that essentially mean if you withdraw at conservative volumes the money will last quite a long time? Basically it will just keep replenishing itself via the market? (Assuming the market is good).


And one more question.... how do taxes work if your sole income post-retirement is through a Roth IRA? Your taxable income is essentially $0 in that case, right? Would it make sense to have both a Traditional and Roth IRA to withdraw from as the Traditional will be taxed at a very low rate? (seeing as how it would be your only taxable income).


Thanks to whoever reads this off the rails train of thought. Any advice is appreciated. Been doing a lot of research on the subject recently and haven't seen specific answers to these questions. Shout out to the PF community! Y'all are awesome.",finance
personalfinance,Furnace Replacement Puts Us Back In CC Debt,"Good evening everyone.  So I need some guidance on how to handle a situation that just came up. Earlier today I had an HVAC technician come to my home to diagnose and repair the blower in my forced air system.  The blower had died earlier in the summer, so it wasn't really necessary to get it back up and running immediately.  We were able to get by with our ceiling fans and the occasional use of some borrowed window AC's.  Well, temperatures are starting to get a bit colder at night here in New England now and I figured I'd get someone in to repair before it got uncomfortably cold.  Unfortunately while the technician had everything torn apart he found that the heat exchanger has a nasty crack and hole in it.  The recommendation is to replace the entire furnace. So what was going to be a relatively painless dip into the emergency fund has turned into a much more expensive issue.

The wife and I have been going through the debt snowball over the last year or so and have about $1000 in the emergency fund right now.  Initial suggestion from the technician is that I can expect the job to be around $5,000 to $6,000.  One of my proudest accomplishments in the past year was knocking off all of our roughly $10,000 credit card debt.  With our relatively small emergency fund, and the inability to cashflow the rest of this, what are some suggestions?  I really am not looking to get back into credit card debt after all that hard work?  Maybe a personal loan with a smaller interest rate?  Thanks for the suggestions.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I take a cheap loan now, or wait but take an expensive loan?","I'll try to elaborate further:

I want to buy an apartment when I finish school in 2 years time. My aim is to buy one that costs around 2 million DKs (320.000 dollars) because I could get an amazing apartment in that price range seeing how the market current currently is. Anyway, when buying an apartment for 2 million DK I'll get 80 % of the loan for a ""cheap"" interest rate. In Denmark you get 80 % from one supplier and the last 20 % HAS to come from another supplier. The last 20 % will have an expensive interest rate. And I want to avoid this as much as possible so as to being able to pay the 20 % up front myself so I avoid taking the expensive loan, and only rely on the cheap remaining 80 %. So for instance, if the apartment costs 2 million DK I would have to save 400.000 DK in the next years in order to avoid having to take the expensive loan.

I live in Denmark and we have the opportunity to take a cheap loan while studying. By cheap I'm referring to the interest rate only being 1 %. So before ending my studies, I could potentially loan 100.000 DK for this cheap interest rate, helping me ""save"" up to the apartment.

If I don't take that cheap loan I will eventually be forced to take the expensive interest loan from the bank when the time comes to buy the apartment. I think the expensive interest rate is around 6 %.

So, can someone explain to me what my best options are? Should I take the cheap loan while I have the chance, remembering that I will be paying 1 % interest rates for at least 1,5 years longer. Or should I just wait the 1-2 years and take the expensive interest rate when times comes.

In my head it seems logical to take the opportunity and get the loan with 1 % interest rate, making it possible for me to reach the 400.000 DKs (20 % of the value of the apartment) so I can avoid having to take the expensive bank loan when the time comes.

TL:DR Should I take a cheap loan (1 %) now while I have the opportunity, or wait out the 2 years for when I actually am going to buy the apartment but then be taking a much more expensive loan (around 6 %)",finance

The company never notified me that it was a mistake. The amount showed up on my W2 that I filed last year. I stopped working at that company for other reasons, and now have a new job. 

I just received a letter from the company, asking for repayment of this ""overpayment"". The letter says: 

&gt;Since this overpayment occurred in 2016, you are required by IRS regulations to pay NET + FEDERAL + STATES TAXES ($XXX *(the amount I was paid)* + $YYY + $ZZZ = $XYZ). You can capture your Federal deduction as a credit on your 2017 tax returns. 

&gt;If you could please remit payment in the amount of $XYZ made payable to [company].

btc,Is BTC becoming fiat in spirit....,"....and other questions. Hi folks, getting hard to tell what the overall future of BTC is, given everything that’s going on, and would love some opinions on the following as I’m sure stuff like this has been asked before. Please tell me right/wrong/why:

Going from least to most theoretical:

1)	Long-term price vs. use as a currency: The breakdown of BTC participants recently roughly came out to like 60% buy/hold, 35% transactions (trading or actual use), and sub 5% criminal activity. I’m looking for the source, I’ll post when I find it again, but the study was mentioned in a blockchain insiders podcast episode. So, it’s not unreasonable to say a lot of the onboarding is for “BTC the asset,” not “BTC the currency.” However, I think a self-fulfilling prophecy could occur, because through that adoption, more stores accept it, more users pay with it. So my first question- what happens to price at that point. Does it stay at/around the price point where “currency use” begins to take place, as the ins/outs of transactions net out at a certain demand level. And what does the gradual supply increase do to that? 

2)	Second, what happens when traders exit BTC-the-non-volatile-currency market? I’d be concerned that as BTC becomes less volatile through use, the players driving the price up through trading leave the market, BTC price plummets through exiting those positions (with the most recent news, think about GS traders leaving the market and what type of volume that means), and users leave…. and the cycle begins again? Has anyone done this longer-term price analysis? I’d imagine some examples exist in non-digital currency markets 

3)	Is BTC becoming software-fiat? The arguments for increased block size, given network demand, makes a lot of sense as far as increasing adoption of btc. However, “change the protocol through popular opinion” seems to violate a core tenet of the white paper (as I interpreted it), which was a central bank-less, self-running currency. It's inability to really change acted as the guarantee of ""value."" However, both sides of the debate seem to be led/influenced by a centralized authority of sorts (blockstream v. DCG and large miners). How is that different from the Fed changing FFR, reserve limits,  rate on excess reserves, etc. – all indirect measures to affect spending/monetary behavior w/o actually changing the monetary supply. But then, when BTC-deflation shows up down the road, and holding BTC becomes incentivized which is not great as far as it being used as intended as a currency, what is stopping popular opinion + the next DCG from leading a change of the protocol IOT increase the # of btc’s, turning it inflationary, and most definitely defeating the spirit of BTC? This makes me feel like BTC has a great future as paypal, w/o the issues of cross-border payments and w/ intense security, but a global currency answerable to no man? no.

4) Lastly, in the same vein as the ""Fidelity Mining"" article, what are the thoughts out there about the possibility of GSs, JPMs, Amazons (i.e. massive computational power  beyond anything going on in BTC today), entering mining, and how is their possible control of the currency limited/is it limited naturally, and how?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Employee healthcare plan temporarily canceled due to mistakes, employer gets weird when I ask for better explanation.","First 3 paragraphs are context: 

See updates below. Things are staring to look bad

I work for an IT company doing projects and implementations. I’ve been with the company for about 8 months after taking a two year hiatus and working at a restaurant learning how to deal with people. We’re a small company growing a lot and I’m the main project guy, main escalation for the help desk, and implement and run our vCloud data centers.  

Lately there have been a lot of problems with project scheduling that have been making it hard to live up to my professional standards. I’ll be scheduled full-time commitments for the week then constantly side tracked with “high priority” escalations since there are only a handful of people and we have a growing list of customers. It’s a powers of powers problem.

In short we’re understaffed and everyone (well, almost everyone) acknowledges something needs to change. I’ve been having a rather candid conversation with the manager who then reports to the CTO and CEO. They’re the owners.  My manager knows I’m autistic and we have very frank conversations. He has out right told me the staffing situation is not good for the company nor employees and I’m taking an unfair share of the burden. I told him I am having a hard time trusting my family’s future to this mess unless I know something is planned to fix the problems that are letting our customers down. I rely on him to help me in an NT world so in that context we were texting. 

I got notice from the insurance company that our policies had been canceled for lack of payment. Of course, I immediately contacted my employer since a deduction has been taken from my paycheck as usual.

I was told that this was an error and would be resolved in 10 days. Now, 10 days later it is not resolved so I followed up with the insurance company. They say the account was suspended in July. The rep wasn’t able to tell me if the problem is being resolved. My son’s asthma medicine is due for refills that will cost over $400 without the insurance and all I have is the CTOs word that I’ll get reimbursed by insurance later. 

So I asked my manager. I told him I was having trouble with the oficial explanation (if this has been an issue for months but was really “never an issue” why is it only being resolved after I noticed? What is being done to prevent it from happening again, etc). He seemed to agree.

Then I got a text from the main boss. See here: https://imgur.com/gallery/nXfnA

Am I wrong to question the answer I am getting? Am I being gaslighted (when someone tries to convince you that you are seeing the world wrong, there’s nothing to worry about)?

I know things are/would be hard to mend at this point. I’ll be okay.

I don’t think it’s a scam. I think it’s a situation of just because you’re great at doing IT stuff doesn’t mean you’re great at running an IT company, doing the HR, making sure you have a proper technician to customer ratio for support contracts, etc, and I don’t trust most people to admit that to themselves. 

Am I asking too much to have some clear answers?

Update: I’m on hold with Healthcare.gov. Too early to tell but the rep said if what I was told is true it would be the first time she’s come across it. She’s currently researching the issue. 

Update 2: the level 2 rep at Healthcare.gov is now consulting with a senior special services rep “because the information I am seeing is contradictory” to the explanation given.  Ok, she came back and said all should could say is to read what it says in the letter (date 9-13-2017) in my message center, the one I already read saying we were un-enrolled for non-payment of premiums.

personalfinance,New Pilot in debt 160k. Career change?,"I fell into the trap of “just do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life” So naturally I decided that I wanted to be a pilot. And not just any pilot but a Helicopter Pilot at that (it costs about 2x as much to train to be a helo pilot). Military didn’t seem right up my alley and when Wells Fargo said all I had to do was sign the line I was hooked.  

I have approximately $165,000 in student loan debt. This breaks down to about $24,000 through federal aid, $20,000 through a private loan and a few loans totaling to $120,000 from Wells Fargo. 
My parents cosigned the loans for me and I will not let them suffer for my naive mistake.

My dad just called me and told me that he received a letter that said my grace period was almost up and on December 6 I needed to make a payment of $1,400 just to Wells Fargo, and that scared the crap out of me. I don’t have any flying jobs coming up (I’m a low time pilot, pretty much the only job available to me is instructing students how to fly) currently I work for my grandpas roofing company and on a great week I make $500. 

So I’m here asking for some opinions on what you guys think my best options are and what loan forgiveness programs might be available to me. 

Stick with it:
I love flying I really do I just don’t see how it’s economically viable. As an instructor I would only maybe make 20k a year (not salary). With a 1,400 bill all of my money, and then some, would go to the loan. 
	This is all assuming I can get a job. I finished my training 3 months ago and have seen 4 job postings. The first one told me I weighed too much*, the second one never responded to me, and I just applied to the 3rd and 4th ones an hour ago.
   
*Our training helicopters don’t have a lot of power, a lot of flight schools require there instructors to be at 180 pound flight weight (flight uniform, headset, maps, sunglasses etc.), it’s taken me 3 months to go from 193 pounds to 183,  I am 6’ 5” tall with  5% body fat there’s not much more weight I can lose healthily. Once I get enough hours to move out of instruction (this should take 2-3 years depending on how busy the school is) then I can get to a more healthy weight.  

Military: Where I am already a pilot I would have a good chance getting into their program (well according to the recruiters anyway). However, this would require a six year commitment and military pilots don’t really fly that much. I know a guy who’s been in for 6 years and only has 700 hours, compared to my head instructor who’s been flying for 8 years and has 3,000 hours. If I could stick with the civilian side of things I would have enough hours to get a good job.  


Change Careers:
Honestly I don’t know what career I would choose to go into. At the very least I would like something to fall back on. I have to get a medical checkup every year and should I fail one I wouldn’t have a livelihood anymore.  
         Now that I’ve committed financial suicide all I can think about is being free from debt. If you guys have any suggestions on if I should go back to school for something else, stick with it, or go spend 100 hour workweeks in an oil field I would greatly appreciate it. 

Basic info about me: 
22 y/o
Single no dependents,
No vehicle payment 
Free Rent
Currently I work as a roofer; payed weekly varies from $200 a week to $500. With winter approaching that will drop significantly 



TLDR:
Helicopter pilot 160k in debt, current payments $1,400, jobs are scarce, and it doesn’t appear to be economically possible to live with that much in payments even if I had a job. Looking for some loan forgiveness options (if any) and advice on if I should return to school, or sell my soul to an oil field

Projecting forward I should have no problem affording a 250k house between my time remaining in and retirement even if I have trouble finding gainful employment after retiring. 
As for my college loans I am looking into the Federal Loan Forgiveness Program, but for now am on an income based repayment plan.  I am currently putting 10% into my TSP but I’m going to look at increasing that amount and possibly do catch up payments.  Once my CC debt is payed off and I increase my TSP contributions I believe I can still save approx 2k a month (more during deployments) towards down payment and renovations. 
My credit score is currently garbage (634) but I have no delinquent accounts, no late payments and only one hard inquiry.  I assume as I pay off my CC debt my score will increase and if my loans are forgiven it will easily make it above 700.
My question is am I on the right track? I’m in my 30’s, single, no kids, I just want some land in a small city I can retire on and one day take care of my parents when they are unable to take care of themselves.",finance

Forex,I attend one of the top Finance universities in the world. Ever wanted to know what we learn at such prestigious establishments? Heres my guide to fundamental analysis.,"I see so many questions relating to ""How do Hedge Fund/Investment Banks/Trading Firms trade?"". While most people on r/Forex have no idea, they like to tell people their two cents. Top funds/banks/traders do not use technical analysis as they are solely a derivative of price. They use Fundamental analysis and leading indicators such as Volume. Be warned, the following is not for the faint-hearted and requires some (albeit basic) economic understanding. However, this might demystify fundamental analysis for you. If you can understand what I'm saying here, you are doing better than 90% of most retail traders. Enjoy. 


#1.	Explain how factors that affect the demand for a currency, or the supply of a currency, affect the determination of an equilibrium exchange rate.

•	In a floating exchange rate regime, the exchange rate is determined by the demand for and supply of a currency.

•	The demand for a currency is represented by a downward-sloping demand curve. A lower exchange rate will increase the competitiveness of a country’s exports, thus attracting buyers of the local currency in order to purchase those goods, services, and financial assets.

•	The supply of a currency is represented by an upward-sloping demand curve. As the local currency appreciates, the relative cost of foreign currencies falls, thus attracting sellers of the local currencies (i.e. buyers of the foreign currency).

•	The equilibrium exchange rate is at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. In an efficient market, any other exchange rate would result in an increase in either demand or supply, thus maintaining the equilibrium exchange rate.

•	A country that maintains a linked exchange rate, crawling peg or managed float exchange rate regime, whereby the local currency is tied to another currency such as the USD, or a basket of other currencies, is effectively tied into supply and demand factors that affect the currency or the basket of currencies to which it is linked or pegged.

#2.	Understand how the major factors that influence exchange rate movements operate, particularly:


a.	Relative inflation rates

•	Of the theories advanced to explain the exchange rate, and changes in the equilibrium rate, the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory is the longest standing.

•	PPP theory contends that movements in exchange rates will ensure that the cost of identical goods and services will be equal across countries. A change in inflation represents a change in prices in a country; PPP argues that a change in relative inflation rates between countries will be offset by a change in the exchange rate.

•	Under PPP, a country with a higher inflation rate relative to another country can expect its currency to depreciate.

•	Perhaps the most critical shortcoming of PPP is that there are variables in addition to inflation that affects the value of a currency.

•	PPP calculations that apply inflation differentials between two countries can be used to determine the expected change in the exchange rate.


b.	Relative national income growth rates

•	Changes in relative national income growth rates also affect an exchange rate. For example, increased national income will typically result in increased imports and therefore an increase in the supply of the local currency on the FX markets. However, in a dynamic market, increased national income might encourage business growth, with associated local and overseas investment. This will also have an impact on demand and supply factors in the FX markets.

•	An increase in the relative rate of growth is likely to result in an increased demand for imports, which will result in a depreciation of the currency.

•	On the other hand, an increase in the growth rate may also result in an increase in foreign investment inflows, which will cause the currency to appreciate.

•	Both the above mechanisms are likely to operate, with the balance between the two changing from time to time.


c.	Relative interest rates

•	Relative interest rates also affect an exchange rate. For example, a relative increase in local interest rates will attract overseas investors; these investors will purchase the local currency and sell their own currency. Investors need to consider interest rate differentials in conjunction with forecast changes in the exchange rate. Future exchange rate changes will affect the value of future cash flows associated with international investments.

•	It is important to determine whether the change in interest rates are due to inflationary expectations, or a change in the real rate of interest.

•	If the increase in interest rates is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, a currency should depreciate. However, if the increase is due to a rise in the real rate of interest, then the currency should appreciate.


d.	Exchange rate expectations

•	In addition to the economic fundamentals, exchange rate expectations are important in determining the FX value of a currency.

•	Exchange rate expectations have a strong influence on exchange rates. Market participants analyse new information in order to try and forecast future impacts on an exchange rate. It may be possible to adopt a specific market indicator as a proxy for exchange rate expectations. For example, in Australia, the commodity price index is often used as a proxy. If sufficient participants form a view, the exchange rate will move; speculators play a large role in forming exchange rate expectations.

•	The modelling of expectations is a particularly difficult task. Theoretically, expectations should be formed on the basis of the expected values of economic fundamentals. However, the FX market often reacts to new information before the impact on the longer-term economic fundamentals is fully analysed.


e.	Central bank or government intervention

•	The actions of governments or central banks are another variable that may be important in the FX markets.

•	The monetary policy setting of a central bank will impact upon the demand and supply factors that affect an exchange rate. Also, a central bank or government may intervene in the FX markets to influence directly the level of an exchange rate by intervening in international trade flows, intervening in foreign investment flows or conducting FX transactions in the markets.

•	For example, in an attempt to increase the FX value of its currency, a central bank may sell foreign currency and buy the local currency; alternatively, to reduce the value of its currency, the central bank may buy foreign currency. Alternatively, a government may implement policies that change tariff, quota or embargo settings relating to goods and services.

#3.	Explore regression analysis as a statistical technique applied to variables that impact on an exchange rate.


•	Regression analysis is a quantitative method that measures how movements in variables impact on another variable.

•	A regression model that measures percentage changes in an exchange rate should include variables of relative inflation rates, relative national income growth, relative interest rates, government or central bank invention and exchange rate expectations.

•	The model will calculate regression coefficients that measure the responsiveness of the exchange rate to a particular variable.

•	A dummy variable may be used for variables that do not have a data set (e.g. government intervention). A value of one would be assigned to periods where intervention occurred and the value zero to non-intervention periods. An indication of periods when central bank intervention occurs may be changes in the central bank’s holding of local and foreign currency reserves.",finance
personalfinance,Are we ready to buy a house?,"My SO and I have been together over 5 years, living together since the start. We moved to the south about 3 years ago for work. Things have been going pretty well for our careers here, and we want to buy a house before we get married. We share a love of cooking, gardening, we like to game, so having a nicer space at home has always been something we've wanted. Marriage? Eh eventually, probably in a few more years, it's not a priority yet I guess.

I'm 28, he's 30. We both have professional state government jobs in our fields. I've been at my job for 3 years, was recently promoted, and currently make ~ $48k in an exempt university staff position. He works for a regional government organization and makes ~$40k. He also works in a restaurant on the weekend and makes a few thousand extra. He's been at his professional job about 2 years and is currently in the process of getting a raise because they love him there. He's been at the restaurant for 3 years.

As for finances, I think we're doing pretty OK. We currently rent a 2-bedroom apt in a nice part of town for $750/month. Earlier this year we set up a joint checking &amp; savings account with our credit union. We've each been putting $500/month into it and it currently has $6,000. By January it should have $10,000. This is apart from our normal personal checking &amp; savings accounts (I have about $3k in savings because I've been aggressively paying down loans, he has about $10k in savings).

As for debt, my SO has none. As for me, I have about $30,000 left in student loans, and about $5,000 left from financing my car with the same credit union. All of my debt has interest rates 5% or lower. We both have credit scores around 800 and never carry a balance.

As for a house, our city is fairly affordable. If we went out into the suburbs (which we don't want) we could find a nice house for less than $100k. Downtown where we prefer, we could find a modest 3 bedroom house for &lt; $200k. We have friends who've bought houses around $150k that are fairly nice. However they bought houses in areas where the schools aren't awesome for various reasons. The primo neighborhoods are more like $200-250k for the type of house we want. We don't plan to have kids until I'm in my early 30s most likely, so +/- 5 years.

I think my only concern is how much money we have set aside for home buying. I know there's FHA loans and such, but are we really ready? We've been planning to start the process in January, but are there other things we should be doing to prepare in the meantime?

Thanks for reading and any advice you may have. :)",finance

personalfinance,"New to USA, figuring finances","Long time lurker here and on PFCanada. I am new to the USA and am trying to develop a plan for my financial future. Currently 25yo. 

* CAD Assets: $55k in RRSP, $8k in HISA (2.3%), TFSA Liquidated prior to moving due to tax implications

* USA Monthly income post tax: $5200 (which is on the low end due to not including OT, which I typically get some of) 

* 3% of Pre-Tax income goes to employer matched 401k which is in an aggressive growth setup (limited options through employer)

* Monthly Expenses: Rent - $750, Loan1 ($28k CAD @ 4%) - $485, Loan2 (Student - $5k CAD @ 3% w/ tax credit) - $96, Food - ~$350, Gas - ~$150, Other spending - $600 (GF and I are long distance, this includes flights to see each other)

After all of these expenses and making my minimum loan payments, I am left with roughly $2700 if I do not work any overtime. 

SO currently in school, will have ~200k CAD of debt when complete in 2 years. Our combined income when she finishes school will be &gt;$200k. 

Current goals:

1. Increase credit. I had a CAD AMEX and my history helped me get an American AMEX as well. Trying to build credit with that. I don't have any loans or regular payments in USA (company phone, all utilities covered by roommate who I pay). I will need to increase my credit in order to achieve goal 2. 

2. Purchase a house in ~24 months, save for down payment. Right now, looking at house price of ~$500k. GF will be done school at this time and we plan to get a house together. She will have no savings but can potentially use the tail end of student loans to assist with down payment. Her interest rate is 2%-3% dependent on credit provider. 

3. Pay off loans. Loan1 first, Loan2 second.

4. Save for retirement which is sort of on the back burner until the down payment is made up. 

I will note that I have a small emergency fund saved in US and can still dip into my CAD HISA if needed. I plant to put about $2k more into my emergency fund, bringing it to $5k, then potentially using my CAD HISA to pay down CAD loans(1&amp;2). I have thought about bringing that money to USA but do not want to with current exchange rate. I have opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard but have not done much funding there yet. I want to start putting $2k/mo into my house fund and my left over put towards additional loan payments. 

Questions:

1. Where do I park the money I am saving for a down payment? I think I can put up to $5,500/yr into RothIRA - but is it worth it if I plan to withdraw in 2 yrs? I can put it in some sort of bund fund - not overly familiar with my options yet, but all my CAD investments are in index funds. 

2. How reasonable is it for us to purchase a $500k house in two years? How reasonable is a 10% down payment?
 
3. What can I do to help my credit score over the next couple of years? Are secured credit cards a good way to do this? 

4. Should I keep my CAD HISA account for my down payment or use it to pay off loans that are at a higher rate then what it's paying me?

Feel free to critique my budget as well. I just came up with it today so I am sure there will be some changes. I have been here about a month and it finally feels like I am through my moving expenses. Living near Denver, CO for reference. My income might change slightly - I am just basing that off of what I paid for taxes on my first check.",finance
investing,HYLB - High yield bonds in a long term portfolio?,"Usually for ""diversified handful of mutual fund for long term growth"" type portfolios, I often see just a single total bond fund (SCHZ is Schwab's ETF version that I hold there).  This mostly holds US Government bonds and the dividends are somewhat low yield (2.33%).  What place does a higher yield bond fund have in these types of portfolios? I am thinking maybe 50% SCHZE 50% HYLB (Deutsche X-trackers USD High Yield Corporate Bond).  This particular fund doesn't have much history but has a ~6% yield based on recent months.  Looking at the holdings these seem to be mostly shorter term bonds, which if I understand are less affected by inflation and interest rates than long term bond funds.  

Just curious as to why I don't see more people holding more corporate bond funds.",finance

Currently i'm being paid barely under the 200% poverty limit and getting the lowest tier of affordable health insurance. The minimum wage is increasing to 13$ at the end of this year of 2017, and then 15 at the end of 2018.  
  

Now my question is, I'm going to lose my affordable health insurance (right?) due to the raise of pay of literally a dollar or two. What can or should I do?  
  

My employer offers a health plan at the cost of about 250$ per month with very high deductibles and other costs. Can i expect the marketplace to have something better than that (cheaper? does anyone know their current rates for people just above the 200% poverty limit?)? Cause at any rate I feel like not taking the raise would be better. Or is there other options that I have not explored?  
  

TL;DR: I'm at the 200% federal poverty limit, raise might cause me to lose eligibilty, what should i do? Are there cheap plans in the marketplace for people just above that line? If so, can anyone tell me about how much so that I can compare my options?",finance

personalfinance,traditional 401k and IRA conversion to roth,"I'm in my 30s and have a traditional 401k with current employer (I contribute to it per paycheck, with employer match) and traditional IRA from previous employer (have not contributed to it in a while). 
I had been investing in traditional 401k because I was in high tax bracket. Over the years that has changed and now that I have 2 kids and mortgage interest deduction, I am wondering if I should be investing in roth instead. I looked at my last years return and my federal tax paid was 15%. Now I have an additional child, so I am guessing it would be lower this year.

1. Should all future paycheck contributions go to roth 401k? I do have this option.
2. Should I rollover my traditional IRA to a roth IRA?  
2.a Should I do it in increments so I don't get taxed to much this year. For example, for every 10k, I will be taxed $1500 (15%), is that correct?
3. Should I rollover my traditional 401k to roth 401k? I am not sure if this is allowed in my plan. 

If I rollover to roth, I have some questions.  

4. For the roth IRA, will I be able to withdraw converted funds without penalty? So if I convert 100k in 2017. In 2018, will I be able to withdraw 100k without penalty? I know this is a bad idea, because I lose out for retirement. But I am considering moving, and I want to buy the new house before selling the current house.  
5. For roth 401k, same question as previous.  
6. Any reason to hold off on the conversion? For instance, I found out during the IRA conversion, you effectively have a 60 day interest free loan. This can be useful in the scenario I mentioned where I buy a new house, use the rollover funds for a downpayment and then repay within 60 days after the current house is sold. 
Secondly, I am amazed that I was contributing to the traditional 401k when I was houseless and childless and saved a lot on taxes. So maybe I should be holding off even more.",finance

personalfinance,Effect of new tax bill,"I am the sole provider of a service oriented business. Talking with my CPA, and a lawyer or two over the years, led me to not incorporate.  The benefits did not outweigh the hassle, and there is no real protection of my personal assets, if I were to be successfully sued and hit with an enormous judgment.  I am in the highest tax bracket in California.  Annual income is approximately $430,000 after expenses.

From what has been proposed regarding the new tax bill before Congress, I understand the corporate taxes would be significantly reduced. When I spoke to my CPA about this, he told me that I would still not benefit from incorporating. There would be no real tax advantage. He explained this, and I understood it for approximately 30 minutes. Now I am clueless.  Also, the new bill would reduce my federal taxes, as a sole proprietor, somewhere in the neighborhood of 4-5%.

I have benefited from tax write off's for a number of years. This includes a home mortgage of $700,000 (3.5 % interest), property taxes of $8000, and state taxes of approximately $30,000 per year.  I understand there is talk of eliminating these write offs.

personalfinance,Advice on pizza delivery as a side gig,"Howdy everyone, I have read several threads on side income outside your regular job and pizza delivery came up as a common and consistent suggestion, but it also came with the criticisms of commercial insurance and auto depreciation.
 I wanted to ask for your advice on my situation.

 I have a decent job, taking home about 45K after taxes and 401K (I think I calculated I will get no tax returns which is unfortunate)
 However I have had to take a sizeable loan to pay a lawyer recently and that's just for the down payment, on top of an extra 400 a month in services for the foreseeable future. I have about 1K owed in credit cards (22% APR), and the loan is 6K at around 8.75%

 The pizza place I applied to has the most traffic in town, and they give me a lot of freedom in hours, which is one of the things that attracted me to the idea in the first place.
 I'd be making a little over $9 an hour, plus .25 per mile driven, plus tips. 
 I intend to drive only two hours per weekday during rush hour, but I don't expect making more than $10 in tip a day those days. During the weekdays I'll drive enough that I can at minimum cover the lawyer fees with just the wage alone, and the extra money will go to paying the loan. 
 
 Is there a way I can calculate the car depreciation to make sure it's worth it? 
 Would it be good to at least take advantage of football season?
 Should I work only up until I have paid the higher interest loan and laywer fees, or is it worth it to pay off my student loans faster (51K, average interest rate of about 6.25%)?

&amp;nbsp;

A while ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6q8mgg/soon_to_be_homeless_with_16k_in_savings_and_maybe/). 
Looking back, I think some parts of it were badly written. I am not proud of some of the things I wrote.

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't talk with the ""social services"" my father called. I went for a walk and to the city to run some errands... I fled. (its ok to cringe/shudder.)
my father loosely said that I have to "" get out"" or at least get a job before the new year.

&amp;nbsp;

Since back then I have 

&amp;nbsp;

 - Dressed up and gotten some proffessional photos taken for a CV. In a suit with mild makeup and eyebrows trimmed briefly.

&amp;nbsp;


 - looked over my CV

 - skimmed for jobs

I have continued to help out on the ranch. I have helped set up fences, helped with day dog-care. fed the horses, ducks, chickens, dogs. I drove my father to/from hospital for his heart surgery.

&amp;nbsp;

I also booked an appointment with the dentist to get my teeth whitened. I figured it would help. turns out; she won't whiten until I have brushed better for threee months...( a bit strange).

&amp;nbsp;

I have NOT:
Applied for a job ( even though I intended to and actually had a nice open position in mind) I did write a draft though.

&amp;nbsp;

Moved out( I mean I did technically but I very often stay home - especially since ( I think) my father needs someone to look after him ).

&amp;nbsp;

It turns out that I did get some money from the  government to live for. the amount will be reduced with 200$ If I haven't worked a total amount of 225 hours before 1st of december 2017. which is inless than two months.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a meeting with a government councellor oct. 9th. They want to talk with me about my education/career plans.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I THINK that things are better between me and my dad. but he is still..kind of..verbally abusive. like sometimes yell. and he complains when I make lunch with food from the freezer. He makes up that it was inteded for dinner even though none of us have had breakfast. its difficult to explain properly.

we talk more. and I help him plan his life. I make dinner and discuss majer home renovation plans.

But i still feel unsafe and like my career situation is nauseating. I sometimes avoid my father. because I can't remember when the last time was that he was nice. I have noticed though that it helps if I remind him to go to bed/eat.

&amp;nbsp;

I have looked at some educations. my confidence in my overall career skills is low. I do not see how I can be e guy other students want to be in a group with. its not that I don't prepare. its that I don't know how to prepare well. or I get lost in the wrong details.

I am also looking into some transportation options á la uber and ""drive - by - busses"". If I need a job or activities my transportation will likely be 1-1,5 hours every day.  I might be able to use that time to relearn french in duolingo. or other.

&amp;nbsp;

Timewise  I feel too much of my time goes with playing games on mobile and computer. 4 years ago I ditched a friend of 8 years because I wanted to stop gaming altogether. I haven't been able to stop completely. Though I *did* get rid of a steam account with 20 games .

&amp;nbsp;


Overall I am discontent. But the situation feels calmer. I am reminded of the cartoon [this is fine](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6439857/20130109.0.png).

&amp;nbsp;

Even if I start a temporary sub-par job. What if I fail to show up? historically in group projects I have been alienated a few times. I am too serious or slow or I am the only guys in the group.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


*Legally*

&amp;nbsp;

 I am looking into the possibility of succession. My father did sell stocks three times for money and he never had a job since mom died. eh just sits and watches old westerns or takes care of his hobby-garden. its also weird like some times he lets himself get convinced to buy the brand-newest Iphone (coming from a sony ericsson Elm), but  refuses to spend money to repair the ventilator in the bathroom. I don't like slingng mud, but i still feel that my father owes me money from my mothers stocks. which might still be a valid case, according to some lawyers. I have printed copies of the ""statement of the estate""; the drat of my mothers will; and my grandfathers will stating that the summerhouse is my mothers. though only in case of divorse. Which did not happen.

&amp;nbsp;


I hope this update was just. I would really appreciate your input even if it is critical.

Thank you for your time.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage lender wants to refinance for lower rate and will cover closing costs/fees? Is there a catch?,"As the title says, my mortgage lender has actively reached out to me to refinance my condo. I have a pretty high interest rate right now ~4.5% and he's offering closer to ~4.0% and has verbally said will cover any closing costs/fees meaning it's free to save a couple hundred a month. 

I'm just wondering why would they do something like this? Is there a catch or anything I'm overlooking as a first-time buyer? 

Thanks in advance for the help and insight.",finance
personalfinance,Best approach for defaulted Federal student loans?,"I turned 30 earlier this year and decided it was time to stop living like I was going to be 22 forever and get my house in order. Largely thanks to advice here I've: 1) established a modest emergency fund, 2) gotten a secured card and 6 months later an unsecured card, 3) raised my Credit Karma score from low 400s to 597, and 4) started contributing to a retirement account. Now it's time to address the elephant I've been ignoring, $18k in defaulted Federal student loans from when I was younger, dumber and broke-er. The total is spread over 5 or 6 different loans, smallest is about $1k, largest $5k, all about 7-8 years old. Fortunately, I haven't had any wage garnishments yet.

The way I see it, I've got three options for taking this down, and I'm curious about which one is best:

Option 1: Rehab the loans. As I understand it (which is admittedly not very well), that happens by making 10 monthly payments of a ""manageable amount agreed upon by both parties"" and after that the loans are removed from default status and then I just make payments each month until they're paid off.

Option 2: Pay each individual loan in full as I have the money to. Like, tomorrow I could pay the smallest and then the next, etc.

Option 3: Pay the $18k in one lump sum. I could realistically save enough to do that in about 5 months.

So, which one is better? I think I'd prefer to do Option 3, to just get it over and done with, but I'm wondering if 1) it might be better for my credit, long term, to have the loans rehabbed to good standing and establish good payment history, and 2) with respect to the time value of money I'm maybe better off contributing more to the retirement account and paying the loans in payments. The interest rates were like about 5% on half of them (subsidized) and 8ish% on the un-subsidized half. I assume those interest rates would be the same when rehabbed, but I don't know. Option 2 would also be nice I guess, to get the feeling of satisfaction from taking an immediate action, but I worry that doing that might make them realize they've overlooked garnishing my wages and start that ball rolling.

So, what's the best course of action?",finance

personalfinance,Economics of HDHP+HSA vs. Standard Health Plan,"Open enrollment time has come at my company, and I'm debating for the first time switching to our HDHP plan with HSA from our standard EPO plan.  

HDHP plan is $190/month and regular plan is $230/month - my contributions.

I'm 35 and in good health - also a high earner and in the highest federal &amp; state tax brackets, so off-setting anything (such as HSA contributions) is appealing to me.  As is the notion of triple tax-advantaged savings year over year in said HSA.

What is giving me some uncertainty is the relatively high cost of the HDHP - I'm only saving $40/month for a $3k deductible/$6k OOP max.  

I'd be able to fund the HSA fully from payroll on day 1 - so that's not an issue, but curious as to what others would do in my shoes.  Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to Auto Refinance with New Credit?,"In July 2015 I bought my first car; 2013 Hyundai Elantra GLS, asked my boyfriend if he would cosign for me. He didn't want to, so I asked my parents. After doing all the paperwork, my rate was 10.54%. Everyone; including my boyfriend who is a car enthusiast, said it was a good deal. 
Signed the docs and left with 12k in debt for a car valued 9k at the time. I do treat my car well, giving it synthetic oil and almost monthly car washes. It's currently at 102k+ miles.

I did get a credit card near the end of that year. My credit card age is 1.4 years, with a 740+ credit score.

Right now I'm trying to refinance because my auto loan is with Wells Fargo and they charge the 10.54% along with 3.50 of daily interest. Me paying this off in less then 60 months will not happen.

I have applied at Desert Schools Federal and Chase bank and see if they will accept and they both have denied me. I do ask why, but they always say new credit. From my records and after doing the background checks, they should see I make payments before the due date or on time. 

After the 2 years of trying to pay for my car, it only went down to 11k. 

My current payment is $240, and if I get the interest rate below 4% without daily interest, I would be more then happy, but I don't know any banks that would accept my situation. 

Unless I ask my boyfriend again to use his credit score?

I'm currently strapped for cash, because of my company giving me less then 20 hours for work and also paying for college. Refinancing would benefit me a lot right now and I don't want to lose my car and damage my credit. 

I want to pay it off faster.",finance
btc,Is segwit2x the REAL Banker takeover?,"DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG. 

Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:

http://dcg.co/who-we-are/

Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting: 

**Glenn Hutchins**: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, **currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.**

**Barry Silbert**: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)

And then there's the ""Board Advisor,"" 

**Lawrence H. Summers:** 

""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.  

**It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?** 

So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo. 

(BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.) 

""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/

So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:

**""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**

Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions

So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. **What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already?** 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value? 

Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time? 

It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem. 

Also worth noting these two things, pointed out by /u/Adrian-x: 

1. MasterCard made this statement before investing in DCG and Blockstream. (Very evident at 2:50 - enemy of digital cash watch the whole thing.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2mofrhw58 


2. Blockstream is part of the DCG portfolio and the day after the the NYA Barry personal thanked Adam Back for his assistance in putting the agreement together. https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/867706595102388224


**So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.** 
 
So, to recap:

- DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank. 

- The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.

- The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable. 

- Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then **literally** gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 


**EDIT: Let's not forget that Blockstream is also beholden to the same investors, DCG.**

**VIEWPOINT:**

Addressing uncertainties in decommissioning cost estimates

Historical experience of estimating decommissioning costs has not been particularly satisfactory. In response to this, the process of decommissioning cost estimation is evolving, writes Simon Carroll.

The general trend is towards showing greater levels of detail in estimates and more explicit representation of the uncertainties that may bear on project cost. In this context, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency have published new guidance on addressing uncertainties in nuclear decommissioning cost estimates.

The technical ability to decommission nuclear facilities shut down after normal operation is well demonstrated. Issues of current concern include the ability to accurately calculate and demonstrate the validity of decommissioning cost estimates and the development of tools for improving project delivery. Driving these developments is a need to give greater confidence that funding will be sufficient and to enhance managers' ability to control costs during decommissioning projects.

I'll try to provide as much info as possible without going overboard. I am breaking this down into a Background section, Current debts, Current bills, and Goals.

**Background**
  &amp;nbsp;  

---

- 28 years old, work in IT (Systems Engineering Associate) in north New Jersey = $$$ COL. No certifications, but Bachelors degree in CIS and Navy veteran. Unmarried, no kids or dependents.
  &amp;nbsp;  
- I intern'ed for a company in a Helpdesk position during college for $15/hr for 2.5 yrs. Got my degree and got hired onto the Server team.
  &amp;nbsp;  
- I now make $45k a year, salary but eligible for overtime (doesn't happen too often). Company basically said ""we'll pay you $45k or you can leave."" Like an idiot I didn't look into any other opportunities. 
  &amp;nbsp;  
- I get $408 a month for disability from the military. So total take home after taxes is about $3,260 and bills equaling $2,700 = $560 left.
  &amp;nbsp;  
- I contribute the max 6% to my 401k which is matched 75 cents on the dollar, and I'll be fully vested in February of 2019. That 401k has about $9,000 in it last time I checked a month or two ago.
  &amp;nbsp;   
- I have $1,250 saved in an emergency/moving fund (more on that later, &amp; I know it's not nearly enough)
  &amp;nbsp;  
- I don't have any student loans from my Bachelors degree, but I've been very reckless with finances over the past 8 years: basically saving nothing and racking up crazy CC debt. I'll save you the long story; I've accepted my mistakes and am paying for it, literally. I am ready to get my life and finances together.

  &amp;nbsp;  
- Save up to move out of this God-forsaken state by August 2019. I'm thinking $7k ?
  &amp;nbsp;  
- In order to do the above, get VCP and MCSE certified (this will enable me to find a new job, boosting my salary by 40-50%)
  &amp;nbsp;  
- Establish a 6-month Emergency Fund
  &amp;nbsp;  
- Be completely out of debt by October 2022 (5 years)
  &amp;nbsp;  
- Buy a house in 5 years. I can use a VA loan (no down-payment required, but I think it's still smart to do one?)

investing,Really Basic Question on Bonds,"By way of background, my investing has been almost exclusively in stocks and stock funds, not bonds. But now that I'm getting older, I need to look more into putting money into bonds. I know that the bond market is pretty lousy right now, but that will change in time.

So, the question. Basic theory is that bond investors are hurt when interest rates rise, since the next round of bond issues carry higher rates. But how am I hurt because some new bond, which I may not be interested in, has a higher rate? Sure, I would have liked the better deal, but I don't see how that impacts my current investment. I'll still get paid what I'm owed. And when you buy a stock, it might go down in price a day later and you could have bought it more cheaply. That stuff happens.

personalfinance,Paying off debt. Please advise.,"I am roughly $20,000 in debt. I have $5,000 to throw at it right now but am wondering what would be the best strategy.
Debt breakdown:

Car Loan $3,399 - monthly payment of $350 - interest rate 3.99%

Credit Card number 1 $2,850 - interest rate 16.9%

Credit Card number 2 $14,178 - interest rate 14.9%

Credit Card number 3 $3,300 - interest rate 26.99%

What should I pay off or where should I allocate the $5,000?
I am leaning towards paying off my vehicle immediately and putting the rest towards one of the credit cards. But I am not sure if that is the best way to go about it. I know that mathematically I should focus on high interest debt first so should I pay off most of credit cards 1 and 3?

edit: Thank you all for the quick and great responses! I'll be getting rid of Credit Card 3 first, then putting the rest towards Credit Card 1 - then essentially snowballing the minimums from those two into Credit Card 2. Vehicle will be paid off by spring and then I'll roll that monthly amount into Credit Card 2 as well. Thank you for helping me think this through and formulating a game plan. You guys are outstanding!",finance

personalfinance,"eviction pending, working three jobs, trying to make amends for when I was younger","so to start, Im a chef, I have had a reasonable salary. Got my first chef job running a small kitchen. 


now first off in the title ""make amends from when I was younger I was one of the many and many lucky few who got a super high intrest rate credit card and a massive hospital bill a few other dings but those are the majors and I and still sitting low on my score, with zero family around for assistance or to even co-sign

Most recently I was the executive chef of a large hotel chain which I will choice to remain unnamed because there is file for unemployment with them still.


They let me go because my job was about an hour commute and had to take a few personal days. so they fired me, I know this is wrongful termination, and also opened a case with unemployment. 


unemployment usually takes a week maybe 2, now mind you during this time I was not just sitting back waiting to start collecting checks, My father raised me you get what you earn.


So while waiting for unemployment to make a choice I dropped off my resume to every place in town, from taxi service to janitorial to supermarkets walmarts,,,etc. it is not a large town ( right around 11,000 people) every call back was "" I'm sorry we are not currently hiring"" and my favorite and most often response was"" with this resume why would you want to work here"" even after explaining they would still find it almost comical a chef who ran his first kitchen at 21 wanted to bag groceries



my next stop on the tour was surrounding towns because I havea  bike, most surrounding towns are even smaller. Same resounding replies to all my inquires.


Fast forward a few months, still n job( still looking actively) borrow step mothers car for an errand, there are three cars in a row mine being the second, just as it was getting dark. I see the first driver is not going to stop for these women so I modertly lower speed and as soon as I come to a complete stop I'm rear-ended by the 19 yr girl who was texting and not paying attention.


now to make this clear, Im not one for lawsuits, again I believe you get what you earn and you earn your worth. needless to say my worth has been felling pretty low this past month. I'm now in the process of eviction, which I know can take some time.


I finally got 3 pizza shops ( yes, 3 pizza shops in a town of 11k with about 5 more that didn't hire me) to hire me but all are paying under minimum wage and under the table.


but this is the only sub I could think to post this is for help. any ways to come up with about $1500, I know I am living in a dream land thinking I can, I have resorted to food stamps and federal and state help. I just want this sorted myself. I know I'm rambling at this point I apologize I just wanted to get the full story out there and ask for any help tips tricks. man if only I had been that one reddditor who became a millionaire haha.

Lastly I will speak to my finances, I was never good with money, ever since my first job it burned a whole in my pocket, around the age of 25 I looked up my credit score and saw how horrendous it was and began checking off the boxes next to the name of each of the collection agencies. and began having a bit of saving for some thing like this were to happen

I then had a death in the family, the life insurance barely covered one bouquet if flowers, so one cousin and I basically split it all. and has left me with not much


speaking of I'm not asking for hand outs and I am not starting a kick starter, just guidance and possibly assistance


Thanks for reading reddit

But when his advisor asked Little Bro why he hadn't paid his first installment, he told him it wasn't there, and he found that it wasn't updated on their end. Long story short is that Little Bro now has a few payments that are past due, because he didn't know about them. He's been filling out loan apps like crazy, but he needs a cosigner.

CryptoCurrency,"Why Chainlink is different and not a ""shitcoin""","1. Eth and smartcontracts. We all know smartcontracts are revolutionary, but their use cases are limited. Smartcontracts are awesome, but they are confined within the blockchain and data on the blockchain. In otherwords, right now smartcontracts are ""you send 1 eth and I'll send back 1000 McTokens"", and this contract is verifiable/trustless/amazing but its stuck within the universe of Ethereum and the data Ethereum understands

2. It is possible to use external data to inform these contracts, but right now that process is centralized. This is a problem. Lets say the external data is a transaction of Dollars for ETH. So you send $300 to bank account X, and then I send one Eth to your address. Right now you either do that through a third party (CoinBase), OTC (LocalBitcoins) or whatever else centrlized system you want to use. 

Knocking out that centralization, where you have to trust someone, is THE key to SmartContracts having a real world use case. But how do you get that information -- the fact that the $300 has been sent -- onto the blockchain using data that the smartcontract understands? 

3. Oracles. Right now the answer is ""hey we can hire Oracle X to do the translation to represent this bank dollar transaction on the blockchain."" The ""oracle problem"" with this is that you are 100% TRUSTING that oracle to act prudently. That they don't tamper with the data. So we can kill coinbase but now we have to trust the oracle instead of coinbase .This is a HUGE problem for Banks who want to get into blockchain but have to trust a centralized oracle to translate data. This Oracle can be hacked, falsified, defrauded, really all the problems that come with cenralization.

4. ChainLink - this service DECENTRALIZES that translation process of the Oracle. Now, the translation is trustless, and you have a trustless data feed that informs the trustless smart contract. 

Multibillion dollar institutions can rely on distributed blockchain technology and know the data that informs their smart contracts is tamperproof.

So Thats what ChainLink does. ChainLink is the first decentralized Oracle that allows anyone to securely provide smart contracts with access to external data, off-chain payments, and really literally any other API you can dream up. Confirmation of delivery of an items (RFID, like Walton), confirmation of a wire being sent or received, interest rates from any central bank, sports scores, product/machine uptime, price of Eth/BTC in real time, weather patterns etc. Right now smart contracts are simple if/then functions where you go and manually do the if so the then comes back. Now with Oracles smartcontracts can automatically confirm or deny if then statements without any human interaction. Transactional automation for agreed upon terms on steroids. 

Anyone can now engrain off-chain data directly onto the blockchain in an actually decentralized way and use that data to directly inform trustless smart contracts, and since the Oracle is decentralized you know the data feed is secure and you’re not concerned with tampering on the Oracle’s part. This is like a skeleton key to actualize the data on the blockchain and apply that data to real world use cases.

programming,How to Dual boot Fedora 26 and Windows 10,,technology
Bitcoin,Taking the Coursera Financial Markets course the introduction is 100% pro bitcoin but not directly saying so :),"Just read the transcript and see what is says about unelected central bankers etc.

Just like we talk about the weather almost every day, those who follow financial markets constantly talk about interest rates. An interest rate signals the price of money. For borrowers, it is the cost of having money and influences what money can buy. For lenders, it is the reward for investing and influences how money can be saved. But as we will learn in this segment, interest rates can also do a lot more. 
0:41
Central bankers who oversee a nation's commercial banking system, and other senior policy makers take the lead, because they have the power to change interest rates. This in turn, sets up the economic conditions, that can enable politicians, businesses, and civic leaders to do their part. 
1:00
In this sense, interest rates can profoundly effect our economic well being. 
1:06
Central bankers not only supervise the banking system and money supply, but are independent of elected politicians. They have almost stayed in the background until former chairmen of the US Federal Reserve system Alan Greenspan. He came along, and he was considered a savior following the dot come crash of 2000, which he famously labeled as a period of irrational exuberance. But Mr. Greenspan's policy decisions were also blamed for much more serious sub-prime mortgage crash of 2007. And we'll talk more about these crashes later. But the subprime crash and the resulting global financial crisis did reveal just how interconnected stock, real estate, bonds, and commodity markets are and how globalized they have become. 
1:53
According to Mohamaed El-Erian, the ex-CEO of PIMCO, one the world's largest bond investment firms, central bankers are quote the only game in town unquote. Which is the title of his book, an excellent resource that you can find the link to in this course's curation corner. In this book, El-Elrian explains that the current problem for the developed world is slow or no economic growth. What central bankers are now expected to fix by setting interest rates. So when the major central banks of the world including the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the People's Bank of China, change what's called the bank rate, the rate which affects the banking system. All other interest rates and several financial markets get affected. It's a domino effect. The recent actions of central bankers are just unprecedented. 
2:53
The feds referring to the American central bank have made over 600 cuts to the interest rate since 2008. Central bankers are in the public eye even though most would rather not be, so they that they can ensure their independence from the government. And for the layperson, they are unelected bankers who are directly affecting the pocket books of their countries citizens, which some might find troubling. The point is often linked to the question of inequality, which asks why economic benefits are concentrated with the few. A recurring theme in finance for everyone, even though the question of wealth distribution should really be taken up by politicians responsible for fiscal policy. 
3:36
Regardless, thinking about interest rates gives us a chance to look into all of these very important connections. Here, it's easy to see that over the past two decades, interest rates have been cut to almost zero. 
3:51
This might explain why central bankers feel cornered. They're damned if they change interest rates, and they're damned if they don't. Increasing rates means money becomes more expensive. So everyone spends less, which is almost certain to trigger an economic recession in countries with a sluggish or fragile economy. 
4:12
Also, governments who have borrowed too much really gets squeezed when rates rise. For example, the U.S government already pays more interest on it's national debt than for the combined total that it pays for it's food assistance program, higher eduction, unemployment benefits, and pollution control. 
4:34
The Congressional Budget Office calculates that if interest rates move up by about two and a half percent in the next four years, the annual debt payments will double and explode to more than 840 billion US dollars. This will further squeeze a lot of existing programs or force even more borrowing. 
4:54
But decreasing rates any further makes them negative, which central bankers have little experience with. Negative rates turn everything we've learned about time value of money upside-down. For example, negative rates imply that banks would return less than what is deposited, which can clearly hurt them, as they signal disincentives to save. 
5:16
Insurance and pension companies would no longer have products to sell, even though these will always be required in a well-functioning marketplace. 
5:25
Negative rates also encourage hoarding cash, which takes money out of the system and puts the brakes on economic growth. 
5:33
So let's step back for a second to understand how all of this works. 
5:38
Policy makers reduce interest rates, assuming that we will spend more and invest most in bonds and stocks. Governments follow suit by reducing rates on their bonds. Which attracts more buyers and subsequently drives bond prices up. 
5:55
The result is a cycle of decreasing interest rates to encourage people to invest more in increasingly expensive bonds. 
6:04
Today, about one third of government debt worldwide is trading at negative interest rates. Low rates also get investors to buy riskier products like stocks, so that they can make a better return on their investments. 
6:18
Like with bonds, demand increases stock prices, but not because companies have become more productive. These conditions set up both the stock and bond markets to crash, because prices are a result of money flows rather than based on intrinsic value, something we discuss at length later to explore Corrections and crashes. For consumers, low interest rates makes money cheaper. So if you need a vehicle, a home, or an education. Your payments become more affordable which boost's the economy. But not all consumers experiences are equal. Interest rates differ for different people, and for many, it's easy to get stuck with too much debt too quickly. 
7:03
Generally, debt has always been a temptation. And has been associated with greed, sin, and poor morals. If you have maxed out on your credit card, or are unable to pay your loans, you no longer end up in a debtors prison, which were abolished in the 19th century. But, it becomes very hard to erase a record of bankruptcy or raise money for that matter. 
7:26
For millions of Europeans and Americans that thought they had affordable student consumer or home loans, changes in the interest rate caused unimaginable distress in 2007. 
7:37
But on the flip side, for those who are setting up a fund to care for a family member, or an education fund to invest in, low interest rates affect you just as well. 
7:49
According to Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the largest money management firm in the world, if you're 35-years old, you have to save more than three times as much to make the same retirement income if long term interest rated decrease from five to two percent. 
8:06
The magic of compounding that we discussed in the decisions course comes to a crawl when interest rates are low. And in most developed economies, aging populations don't have enough for retirement. And low returns make the problem just extremely worse. Today's very low interest rates are having just that effect. When cheap money becomes the norm, investors increase savings rather than spend more to make up for the loss in future value. As we have mentioned, with negative interest rates you can also expect people to hoard more money. Including companies who will move money to look for more productive uses. This is reflected in the velocity of money, the rate money changes hands from one transaction to another. 
8:53
Velocity is a very good measure of money's impact on the entire economy. For example, suppose you spend twenty dollars for a haircut, yhe barber then purchases $20 of hair products. The gross domestic product is now $40. This GDP would increase to $480 annually, if you went for a haircut every month. So the velocity of $20 had a multiple of 24, but only parties were involved. Now you can imagine what happens when there is a chain reaction of transactions triggered by the frequency of how much, and how many times we spend money. 
9:36
From this chart, we can look back and see that during the past two decades of low interest rates, velocity has continued to steadily decrease and is now at its lowest point. 
9:47
The lower velocity explains deflation or price decreases, which cause a contraction or slow down of economic activity. 
9:58
Note that deflation, which is the opposite of inflation means that money can buy more in the future. In other words, since the risk free rate of interest has two component, the real and the inflation component, then replacing inflation with deflation by partly explained negative interest rates even though there is a positive real interest rate component built within 
10:23
to summarize low interest rates are not a panacea. They have been overused by central bankers to cure low growth, which is now having massive unintended side effects. Especially, considering negative interest rates. 
10:39
We will explore interest rates further in the next video to help us understand more about how they connect with risk. And how the connect with value, so that we can plan to protect our assets and take advantage of financial markets that are expected to increase in volatility in the future.",cryptocurrency

&gt; I trust it ends the narrative that we should not use laws to protect ourselves or Bitcoin.

We don't need to wait anymore, certainly not until they do a real damage to the Bitcoin structure or decentralization, we have now enough documented evidence of malicious intent and fraud. We will give an ultimatum and a one week grace period to give a chance to drop out before a company/individual is listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. It is time we organize properly, like they did, and defend against this ridiculous and malicious take-over attempt.

This is an actual Trojan Horse and we are welcoming in with our complacency by saying: ""Bitcoin has survived all past attacks, honeybadger don't care"", don't forget that 'honeybadger' is all of us, united. This attack is not like the others, this one has the backing of the most powerful companies in the space plus most of the miners.

They want to succeed were the banker's special forces led by Blythe Masters failed to infiltrate and highjack Bitcoin since she was well known by many people and could not run incognito. 

Now they are doing it from the inside, including the purchase of weak-morals developers like Garzik, Hearn and Andersen, as well as entrepreneurs like Ver, Voorhees, Jihan and Pair (maybe even Armstrong). 

Stop underestimating these people, they are very smart and have very deep pockets (hundreds of billions of printed to infinity fiat deep).

Here is a list of the people who should not be trusted at all and many of them will probably be listed as defendants: Gavin Andersen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, John Mcaffe, Craig Wright, Barry Silbert, Larry Summers, Blythe Masters, Stephen Pair, Erik Voorhees, Vinny Lingham and Brian Armstrong.

By now, they should be considered as enemies of Bitcoin and decentralization. Their credibility, reputation, and businesses will be run into the ground by no other than their own greed, selfishness and seek for more power and control, unless they come out publicly against S2X/NYA. 

We, the people/users/nodes, and the hardworking and honest Core developers are the honeybadger: WE ARE BITCOIN. This is not FUD, Bitcoin will survive, there is no way to put it back into Pandora's Box, but we need to be conscious that we can easily avoid any damage if we remain united. Let's swarm the S2X/NYA beast and show it the real power of Decentralization. Exciting times we are living... this will be fun!

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/743qb8/is_segwit2x_the_real_banker_takeover/

&gt; DCG (digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG. 
&gt; 
&gt; Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:
&gt; 
&gt; http://dcg.co/who-we-are/
&gt; 
&gt; Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting: 
&gt; 
&gt; **Glenn Hutchins**: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, **currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Barry Silbert**: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)
&gt; 
&gt; And then there's the ""Board Advisor,"" 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lawrence H. Summers:** 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.  
&gt; 
&gt; **It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?** 
&gt; 
&gt; So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo. 
&gt; 
&gt; (BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.) 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/
&gt; 
&gt; So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:
&gt; 
&gt; **""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions
&gt; 
&gt; So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. **What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already?** 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value? 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time? 
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; **So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.** 
&gt;  
&gt; So, to recap:
&gt; 
&gt; - DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank. 
&gt; 
&gt; - The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.
&gt; 
&gt; - The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then **literally** gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Did we just spend so much time fighting and bickering with core that we totally missed the REAL takeover of Bitcoin, happening right before our eyes, by the likes of currently serving Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board Members?**",cryptocurrency

I struggle with fiscal responsibility and often spend money on things that I really can't afford. The balance on the two CC is something that I think about often but never seem to make a meaningful dent in paying it down.",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a personal loan to pay off credit card debt or do something else?,"Okay, so I'm 26 years old. I have credit card debt - I'd need around $3,400 to pay it off. I was thinking of getting a personal loan so I can just pay off the debt and get a better interest rate. Because these interest rates are killing me. Should I go for the personal loan? If so, what's the best interest rate I could get? If not, what should I do instead? What are my other options?

Here's some information so you understand my personal situation.

Transunion Credit Score: 665
Credit Age: 2 years, 1 mo
Card Utilization: 57%
Payments on Time: 100%

My credit card interest rates:
Chevron: 26%
JC Penney: 27%
Discover: 22%
Citi: 0% until January 2018, which then rises to 22%
CareCredit: 26%

I know these rates are all very high. I started these cards in college when I was extremely poor (making less than 12k per year).

I have 1 collections account on my Equifax report. I have disputed it multiple times, only to be rejected - even though the account is not mine. I contacted the company and they said they contacted Equifax and told them to remove it, but it is still on my report as of yesterday. I have submitted another dispute along with a request for official documentation from the company proving I am not liable for it (this is important because Discover said I'd be denied for a personal loan due to this collections).

TLDR: How should I pay off my credit card debt? The high interest rates are killing me and making it feel impossible.",finance

I am a 23M living in MI, I have a SO (23F) who is also on board with any plans. 

I graduated in August 2017 with a BSME and am now working for an OEM making $35/hr as a contractor, SO graduated in May 2017 and is working part-time at a hospital making $27138/yr.

Currently I have:

$24,546.07 in Student Debt, with a monthly $61.22 interest payment(~3% interest).

Discover IT card, $4800 limit, paid off every week/2 weeks(~10% utilization)

Car loan - $2,222.48, I was paying monthly but I've since switched to paying more, and more often(1.99% interest ). 

750 - Credit Score (currently under a 90 day Fraud Alert after Equifax leak)

Credit Union Checking Account  ~ $600


SO Currently has:

~$65,000 in Student Debt, average interest rate ~ 7%.

Fifth Third Credit Card -  $2500 limit, paid off every month(~25% utilization)

Car Lease  - $250/mo until Sept 2020. 

Negligible amount in savings, Similar credit I assume.

We currently are living with our (respective) parents, who lovingly and wonderfully have housed us and paid for us these college years. They have both accepted the following expenses on our behalf:

* Car insurance 
* Cell Phone
* Food, Housing, and general expenses with living

All of this is until we get married. We currently plan on getting married in Nov 2019. Once again, VERY kindly, her parents have offered $20,000 towards our wedding. My parents have not made a dollar amount available, but have made a commitment to help. 

Moving forward my plan is as follows(probably good to note I get paid weekly): 

Gross weekly paycheck -  $1398.40

$18000 401k maximum contribution/52 weeks = $346.15 pre tax contribution

Currently claiming 0 on taxes, so full amount is taken out (I have calculated this to be a 30% tax rate)

$1398.40-$346.15 = $1052.24 *.7 =$736.57/week

I will be making $500 weekly student loan payments so 

$736.57-$500= $236.57 lets round it out and assume gas is $36.57 so I have $200/ week to save for a ring.


By my calculations I should have my debt paid off in about a year. After that I will use the $500/week (or some smaller amount) to save for the wedding or contribute to SO's loans. 

SO (again for reference is making $27138/yr) is using the bi-weekly check as follows:

$27318/26weeks = $1043.76 Gross take home 

8% 401k contribution = $960.27 Gross

I believe she also is claiming 0 on taxes so again assume 30%(I know its over but bear with me) $960.27*.7=$672.18 every two weeks.

$672.18-$125(half of car payment)=$547.18

Assuming 2 checks a month she will be paying $1000/mo into her loans, accompanied by $800/mo from her parents(again until we are married)

By my calculations, if i put my $500/week into hers after I am done with mine, We should be able to pay them off by Jan 2020.

So, /r/personalfinance, thats my plan for now. Please critique it until it hurts. Now, for my questions.

* What is a good time to start a joint(ayy lmao) bank account together?

* What is a good bank to start it at ? How do I determine which bank will be better? I have had good experience with my credit union but something national and more widely recognized would be nice. 

* Same question for me, I have my auto loan at the CU, but want to switch after it is paid off. I will be keeping the account open, but what is a good bank for myself to start banking at (Chase looks promising)?

* With my above average credit, should I apply for a higher tier credit card? Which one if so? I always imagined having one card with a high limit to pay everything on (always paying on time) and gathering miles to use on vacations (essentially free!) Same for SO, should she ?

* Is my plan too aggressive? Should I slow down the payments and keep cash in hand because interest rates are low? 

* Should SO look into debt consolidation for a lower interest rate? Should we combine hers and mine to make payments easier even though my interest rates are relatively low? 

*Finally after all this is over, how should I begin to make the most of my money? 

I am seeing a trusted CFP later today to begin a 5 year plan moving forward, but what is your recommendation on maximizing my pay or investing moving down the road? I'm all ears for all options.

personalfinance,question regarding claiming unreimbursed medical expenses on taxes,"Hello all!

First of all, thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read this/respond and help me out! :)

I have two questions regarding the claiming of unreimbursed medical expenses on my taxes.  I know that only the amount over 7.5% is eligible but I believe we will meet that depending on how the answers to these questions go.

**Here is some background for my first question:**

I am an employee of an LLC that is owned by my dad. We have been told by our accountant that, because I am next of kin to the owner, I am not eligible to participate in Section 125/Cafeteria plans and as such I am not eligible to pre-tax my health/dental/vision insurance premiums.  Up until 2017, I was paying my employee portion of these insurances post-tax and the amount of these premiums was included in my taxable income.

Beginning in 2017, our accountant stated that since I am treated as an owner in that I cannot participate in Section 125/Cafeteria plans that I can also be treated as an owner and have the cost of my insurance premiums reimbursed to me, again, all post-tax.  So now my paychecks look like this:

* Salary Payment: $1000
* Insurance Reimbursement: $500

* Insurance Reimbursement $-500
* Fed Witholding/Taxes: -$275

* Net Pay: $725

*So, my first question is,* can I claim the cost of the insurance premiums as 'unreimbursed medical expenses' since I am paying taxes on them as if it was additional taxable income?

**Background for question two:**

Our first born was born 12 weeks pre-mature this year weighing in at less than 1200 grams. The hospital social worker told us that because of prematurity/birthweight, they were eligible for SSI/Medicaid benefits only while they were in the hospital.

SSI paid us out one lump some payment totaling less than $1,000.  We have also given out her medicaid number to the providers who billed us during our child's NICU stay, we are waiting for them to finish processing.

*My second question is,* will we owe taxes on the SSI lump sum/medicaid payments? If we do owe taxes on the medicaid payments, can we claim them as unreimbursed medical expenses?",finance

personalfinance,4.5% Guaranteed Annuity -- How to use?,"Hey everyone. I'm a 24 YO and just discovered that my grandmother who passed last year willed me an annuity. Now there's not much in it (about 6.5k), however it is *guaranteed* an interest rate of 4.5%, compounded daily. It's not through a traditional insurance company, but through a non-profit, member-owned org. The annuity only exists because it was purchased so long ago and is guaranteed, but these kind of things are no longer offered.

Now, my question is: how should I use it? I just maxed out my contribution to my IRA for the first year (through wisebanyan but planning a switch to vanguard). But should this annuity be my priority going forward since it's guaranteed? Should I have the IRA and the annuity and just split my retirement contributions?

Maxing 401k, both RIRAs and 1 HSA.  Also putting about 10%+ of my salary into taxable (from selling ESPP)

My plan had been to retire at 55. But now after reading some stuff here, and inspiration from reading MrMoneyMustashche / RootOfGood / madfientist I think I can retire much earlier. 

I want to focus on paying less taxes and saving more.  I'm paying a lot of taxes right now, so probably focusing on tax deferment would be wise for me right now. 

My options, as I see them, are:

* post-tax contributions to 401k. My company has a great 401k funds options and also access to the open market.  I can contribute a lot more money into this account (past the 18k limit) after tax and then convert it to roth 401k.  This does not help my tax liability right now and locks the money away for a while. (don't necessarily want to do 72(t)) 
* 529 plan.  I think I like this one the least. I only have 1 child right now, It doesn't reduce federal tax liability, and I don't know how easy it will be to use the funds
* taxable account. I feel good with the amount of money I am already putting into a taxable account. At retirement I should have enough money between this and the deposits into the two IRAs, I should be able to last the 5 years to set up a 401k &gt; IRA  conversion ladder. 
* Solo 401k or Simple IRA for my wife's business. My wife is a sole proprietor with a pretty variable income (20k-40k/yr for now).  We file the business income on our joint tax return. I don't know much about these plans, I have been researching some but I can't really tell which would be best.  This is the best option it seems for additional pretax dollars and reducing federal tax liability.   Would appreciate advice from someone in a similar situation who has done this. 

Edit:
Bonus question for anyone coming late to this:  Is roth IRA wise if I am trying to be a frugal FI/RE?  Should I defer tax to reduce my liability and hope to roll it over at a lower tax rate later?  I know I save effectively less in tax-advantaged accounts this way, but for years when I know i won't max my tax advantaged accounts, is traditional IRA smarter?",finance
personalfinance,"[MA, USA] Buying A House W/ Mom &amp; GF - Seeking Tax &amp; Legal Advice","My mother, my girlfriend, and I are currently in the process of preparing to buy a home together, and I'm here to ask about potential legal &amp; tax pitfalls with the hopes of avoiding careless mistakes.


My mother is 63 years old, and owns her home outright, which she purchased more than 20 years ago. We have spent about $20K from a HELOC preparing her home for sale, and as of today she is under contract with a listing agent who intends to list the home for $430K. If we obtain this price, my mother should net about $380K after paying the listing agent, closing costs, and paying off the HELOC.


Other than this, my mother has no significant cash assets. She owns her car, works two part-time jobs, and receives $350/wk and health insurance as part of an alimony settlement. Last year her AGI was about $35K, which over the past several years has been a comfortable income for her. Part of our goal in buying a home together is to help her stabilize her expenses so that as she moves into a stage of life where she has a fixed income, her finances are predictable and easy for her to manage. She has a 401k with a value of about $280K, which I ""manage"" for her by keeping it in a target date fund at Fidelity - this is a result of her divorce settlement and she does not contribute any additional funds to this. I project that this fund combined with her social security will not quite be enough to sustain her throughout the remainder of her life if she retires in the next couple of years, but I am prepared to support her as necessary - which I am hoping will be easier if she is my in-law neighbor.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for just shy of three years and have been living together for just over one year. I am 32 and she is 28. We intend to become engaged in spring 2018, purchase the home together in late summer of 2018, and begin planning for a wedding after we move in. We have no children. We both work in finance and our combined AGIs this year will probably be in the range of about $210K. Although we maintain separate finances for now, we have full disclosure of our financial activities and share a financial planning spreadsheet which we review frequently. When we apply for a mortgage in the spring of 2018, we will have two outstanding debts: about $10K left on my auto loan, and about $80K in her student loan debt which she recently consolidated and refinanced to obtain a lower interest rate. We have no other debts. Together we have about $25K in cash which we have been saving both to demonstrate our ability to save money to our mortgage lender, and to facilitate paying closing costs &amp; possibly purchase points during closing. We also both maximize our employer 401k contributions, even though I got started a little bit later than she did. My credit score hovers in the 730 range for now but is improving, my girlfriend's credit score is in the 770 range, and my mother's credit score is in the 830 range.


Overall, I believe we are in good shape financially, although we aren't immune to occasional setbacks...like exceeding our monthly ""dining out"" budget!


Our original plan has been to take the $380K that my mother nets from the sale of her home and have her use $300K of that as a down payment on a home worth approximately $700K. We would all then take out a mortgage together and my girlfriend and I will pay the $400K mortgage on our own, with my mother living rent free but retaining an equity stake in the home at a proportion equal to her contribution - in this case she would retain a 3/7ths stake in the home.

My questions aren't really about affordability or the prudence of purchasing a home with my mother and my not-yet-fiance, although I'm happy to hear that feedback. My questions are really more about feasibility and tax implications.

1.  Is it feasible to purchase a home with a 3-party mortgage?
2.  Is it possible to structure a legal agreement that allows my mother to retain her equity stake in the home, to guard her from loss in a worst-case scenario?
3.  Are there tax implications that would be disadvantageous in this kind of scenario? For example, who would end up claiming the mortgage interest tax break if we opted to itemize?
4.  Would it be smarter / cleaner to have my mother gift me the $300K as a one-time tax-free gift and write her a promissory note to repay in the event of a worst-case scenario?

Are there any obvious pitfalls I'm clearly not considering here?

personalfinance,"Bought a house, budget is changing. Is my goal to pay off student loans early too aggressive for my situation?","My living situation has changed this year and I’m revising my budget. My previous financial goal was to purchase a house, which I did in August. My next financial goal is to pay off my student debt. I bought a house before paying off student loans because I needed to stabilize my housing costs ASAP as I live in a popular suburb in Metro Detroit with a serious shortage of affordable rentals and rapidly rising housing costs — I wanted to stay in an area I love at a price I could afford.

My financial picture: 

I am a household of one. I take home $2,700/month after taxes and 401k and HSA contributions. This is the amount that the budgets below are based on. I receive a bonus of 5% of my salary each spring that I keep in a separate checking account for vacations/Christmas gifts/extra treats through the year. I have my federal withholding set at 0 allowances. I know the goal is to not have a sizable return, but I’m holding off on adjusting my allowances until next year. Any tax return I receive this year will be added to my emergency fund. 

I contribute 15% to a 401k (11% plus 4% employer match). 
My employer offers a cash balance pension plan that they fund at 13% of my salary.

I have an inherited IRA totaling $240,000 with mandatory distributions based on my life expectancy. The mandatory disbursement amount is around $4,000 at the moment — I have been taking out more than that and fully funding a Roth IRA. When the mandatory disbursement exceeds what I can put into a Roth IRA I will save the money elsewhere. I took $20,000 from the fund this year to purchase my house, but that was hard for me to do, and I will not take any more money from this fund for lifestyle reasons.
My next goal is to tackle my student loan debt ($38,000). I have a healthy emergency fund ($13,000 in a money market and another $5,000 in checking as a buffer), but I also want to save for my next vehicle and eventual housing repairs.
I own a 2008 Subaru Forester with 130,000 miles and the dream is to drive it to 250,000. I don’t have a cell phone bill because I’m on a family plan and my mom pays for my line in exchange for a few small favors and errands, a mutually-beneficial arrangement I will keep until my Mom changes her mind. 

Old budget (stayed on this budget for 2.5 years, so pretty tried and true for my previous situation):
Rent: $800 (Included heat, water, trash, internet. The rent would have increased by $200 in 2018 if I chose to stay)

Electric: $50 average

Food: $200 (includes eating out and household goods like tp, paper towel)

Fun: $200 (movies out, happy hour with friends, clothes, non-essentials)

Car maintenance and fuel: $200 (this category varies because I do visit family across the state a few times per year, but this is the overall average of all non-insurance car expenses.)

Car Insurance: $130 (Michigan is a really fun state to insure your car in, guys. That goes double for SE Michigan. Perfect driving record, 10-year-old car, but I insist on keeping full coverage on the darn thing. This is non-negotiable. My dad helped me buy this car brand new when I graduated college. He died two years ago and having this car and protecting it as well as I can are important to me for reasons I struggle to articulate.)

Student loan: $500 (Minimum payment is $486. 10-year repayment plan at 6%, not quite two years into repayment)

Netflix/Amazon Prime/Subscription boxes: $50

Health/Medical: $50 (I put $2,000/year into an HSA for medical expenses. This category is for little things I don’t want to use the HSA card for — OTC meds, vitamins, etc. as well as stuff like toothpaste. Currently the HSA balance is about $4,000)

Savings: $500 (Previously earmarked for down payment and emergency fund)

New Budget:

Mortgage: $527 (15-year fixed mortgage at 3.25% — I put 50% down and opted out of escrow, $75,000 financed)

Utilities: $250? Unknown as of yet. 

Property taxes and insurance (no escrow): $300

Internet: $40 (locked in rate for two years, cheapest available in my area)

Food: $200 

Fun: $200 

Car maintenance and fuel: $200 

Car Insurance: $130 

Student loan: $700 

Netflix/Amazon Prime/Subscription boxes: $50

Health/Medical: $50 

So, as you can tell, with the increase in housing costs and with putting an extra $200 monthly toward my student loan, I will not have room in the budget for savings for my next car or large home repair costs. I’m hoping that I’m overestimating the utilities, but I just don’t know. If things get tight I’ll cancel the subscription boxes, start using my HSA to pay for all of my health costs and if that’s just not enough I’ll consider backing down to the minimum loan payment, but it’s a major goal of mine to pay it off early. 

If I continue to pay $500/month toward student loans I’ll have them paid off in 8.5 years. Bumping the payment up to $700 shaves nearly two years off the payment time and saves me more than $3,000 in interest. Basically, my thinking is that if I can make my car last another 5 years, then I will easily be able to afford the next one without straining my budget. Barring an accident, this seems realistic to me — I’ve taken extremely good care of this vehicle and most people assume it’s only 3-5 years old. For small home repairs, I’ve got lots of handy family, and the home is currently rock solid. It has recently remodeled kitchen and baths, the roof is less than 10 years old, and I’ve already gotten some electrical work upgraded, the plumbing and gas lines replaced, furnace and a/c serviced, a new water heater installed, and the lawn regraded. I’m hoping that being proactive about these things will save me a few headaches down the road, but there are simply things I can’t control or predict.

My question is, is it okay to put all my extra $ into the student loans knowing that if I have to replace my car or address a major home repair in the next few years that I will have to deplete my emergency fund to do it? Is there something I’m forgetting to budget for? I was so excited to buy this house and have been very strict with myself for the last several years in order to get a mortgage and house I was comfortable with, but am I now living a little too close to the edge of my money?",finance
personalfinance,[HELP] Have an opportunity to refinance my home. I want to ask the experts to make sure I make the right choice please.,"Hello everyone, and thanks for taking the time to help me out!

I live in the Bay Area and currently own a home, 30 year mortgage. I have the opportunity to refinance my home down to a 15 year mortgage instead. It would add about $700 to my monthly minimum but lower my interest rate. 

Here's some information about my loan and what it could be (also a tl;dr):

- Currently I have a 30 year mortgage, interest rate is 3.25%. I currently have around $334,000 left on my mortgage and my monthly minimum payment is $2160. I currently pay about $500 extra a month.

- I can refinance to a 15 year mortgage, interest would go down to 2.74% and would increase my payments by about $700. However, closing costs etc would add $7000 to my principal amount.

Would refinancing and getting a lower rate justify the $7000 that would be added to my mortgage? Can someone please help me with the math? I want to be better educated on these types of things, I generally just refer to my parents for knowledge but I feel like it's time for me to figure it out myself!!

Thanks so much everyone!",finance
gaming,Help me pick some games for my father,"So my father is the one who got me in to video games, but for the past 15 years or so he has been playing the same games over and over.

personalfinance,I have 20k in a dormant 401k account. I have 14k in credit card debt and owe 8k on my vehicle. What should be done?,"So I quit my previous job which had a 401k matching plan. My new job does not (offers a stock plan instead). I have almost exactly 20k in my 401k account. I estimate I'd take home about 13k after taxes. I am not currently contributing to it, as I am putting 15% towards my companies stock plan instead which has a much higher return rate right now.

I have 12k in credit card debt on a card with a 0% APR offer until February 2018.

I have 2k in credit card debt on my regular spending card with a 22.99% APR.

I owe just under 8k on my 2014 Honda Civic that I plan on keeping for a long time. My interest rate on that is .99%.

I'm just unsure of what to do with this 401k account. I wish Fidelity would allow me to use it as a stock portfolio, but even that would trigger the taxes for early withdraw. But I know I won't be contributing to it for a long time, if ever, because my company's stock purchase plan is such a better ROI. 

Thoughts? My initial thought was pay off my highest interest card and my car, as they are the only two accounts that have interest. But then that leaves me with not much money left and a large chunk of debt that I will have to pay off over the next year, albeit interest free, but out of my normal income. But I could use the amount I pay towards my car as is ($415/mo) and would pay off $6225 of my $12k card alone in the next 15 months.",finance

personalfinance,How can I get lenders to count my self-employment income to give me the damn loan?!,"Some people don't succeed in life, and I've come to peace that I'm one of those people. I'm fine with that. But, things have been going better for me as of late, and it's time to replace my car.

I'm 33, and make about $1,000 a month at my part-time job (San Diego, USA). I have caught a few breaks recently; namely a great deal on a room at $450/mo, and even better, self-employment income in the form of app-based delivery driving.

It's not Uber or Lyft, but it's close: Postmates, Grubhub, etc. It's food delivery. Specifically, my car's not suitable for passenger use. I wouldn't pay to take a ride in it either. Fortunately, these app services allow me to be something akin to being a freelance pizza driver, and it's done great things for me. I'll even say it's saved my life. 

Now, my aforementioned car wouldn't last forever, so I had been saving to get a new one. Moreover, I'm single and live rather leanly with a great rent for the area; and I'm also debt free. No college loans, etc. and the old car's been paid off. Because of this, I've been building credit by living off my credit card and paying in full every month; as of today, Experian has me at an 819 FICO score and over 800 for the past three months.

So, I've been shopping for loans before looking for the car, starting about a month or so ago. Namely, credit unions in the area. The routine has become the same: application looks great with my $1600/mo and $450 rent (I was asking to finance $5,000-*8,500, with $1,500 down). 

""Can you provide pay stubs?"" Sure, I present my pay stubs, covering 1k of the 1600. 

""What about the rest?"" Well, here's my 1099s for the one app I drove for the last 2 years at about $300 a month, I added another app 6 months ago that has doubled my income. No 1099s available yet.

""You're declined.""

I've heard variations of the reasons why, but some lenders won't even look at my 1099s. One even demanded *entire tax returns* for the last two years. I tried to get an explanation as to why the 1099s weren't enough, and I was told that these didn't count as proof of income....they're fucking 1099s from the businesses that paid me for my work!

In another case, I was asked if I took deductions on my 1099 income. Sure I did, the standard mileage deduction is very generous. But because taking a deduction supposedly makes the income not count, I'm now declined.

One even got rather far, and I picked out a car last week, signed for it, put the down payment down and drove it off the lot. I was told that I needed to report to the credit union in question to open a small account (trivial, but expected). Upon appearing we went through the same rigamarole: your paystub doesn't cover all of your income and all of your other income doesn't count. 

In fact, that's where we're at now. I got this word from the credit union today, and I'm going to call the dealer tonight to see what I can do about this. The car I thought I bought's in the driveway. The old one's stashed at my parent's house, and I'm quite glad it hasn't sold yet.

Anyway, the question is the title. I have credit, I have income, and I have documents to prove it. How do I get lenders to count my income as income and give me the loan I otherwise qualify for? 

EDIT: Fortunately, this may end well. I've called the dealer as mentioned above, and he seems confident that he can sell the contract to another lender. A higher interest rate may occur, but I should be okay with that.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay debt, invest, both?","Hey there,

Long time lurker, fist time poster.  Looking for thoughts and strategies on some investment/financial next steps. Here's my situation:

Income:
Recently turned 36, have a stable F/T job bringing in about $120k-$135k base+bonus annually.  Partnered but not married and don't plan on having kids.

Assets: 
I've gone through and have done the following: creating an emergency cash fund (saved about 2 years worth of expenses @ ~$85k; not sure why, but I've always got it in my head to save for 2 years), maxing out ROTH IRA ($21k, with all of invested in several ETFs), and will have hit the max contribution limit for my company 401k by the end of year ($125k).  I've also some Mutual Funds ($31k) across 2 of brokerages and some individual stocks ($4.5k) in another one of the investment accounts.  I'm currently in the process of consolidating several brokerage accounts so that at least these assets all live in one place.

Debts:
I've also a mortgage (18 years left with @ $265k, of which I pay half the mortgage) and car loan (splurged a bit so I have a $58k balance over 6 years, but currently making enough extra payments to get it paid in 5), and some have about $13k in CC debt (for a roof for the house I'm paying off in installments through 0% balance transfer CC offers). *Edit  Both house and auto have interest rates in the low to mid 3% range.

Dilemma:
Now that I've hit the milestones of cash saved, and maxed out retirement accounts, I'm a little stuck on where to go next because the cash I've contributed towards Cash Emergency Savings and ROTH are freed up (about an extra $1k a month)   Pay off debt such as the car/house/cc?  Shove it all into the market?  Balance between the debt and market?  Pull out cash from the 2 year cushion and pay off CC and rebuild that reserve (and then what after?)

Looking for some thoughts on what the logical next step is.

Thanks guys!",finance
personalfinance,Should I stick out an overly stressful job to get vested in the CalPERS system?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 30 year old working at a CalPERS eligible institution.  Our vesting period is 5 years and right now I'm at 3.2 years of service.  I've contributed about $15,000 to the system.

I'm on an academic cycle at the moment, so with each August, I feel ""locked in"" to the system for our students.  

At this point, I feel pretty stressed out by my job -- I'm a manager that works several positions of a department that is understaffed and  that has a lot of expectations.  I also commute an hour each way to my job.  Comparable city-level positions have salaries about 20K above mine.

My original plan was to leave in December 2018 - I think I can make it to then.  By then, I'll be less than a year from vesting.  My partner is trying to convince me to stay until December 2019 to be fully vested in the system.  I'm not sure if I can last.  I'm also not sure how worthwhile being vested in the system is.

I also don't plane to work in the state system for too long, so I would just be vested at 5 years - no more service beyond that.  

Any advice welcome!",finance
personalfinance,Paying off student loan...,"Hello I have about $26k in federal student loan debt at 5.875% interest through Great Lakes borrowing.  I have been making pretty minimal payments on it up until now as I paid off other loans.  Right now I can make about $1500 payments each month to get this paid off.

Would it make sense to get this refinanced somewhere else to get a lower interest rate?  I have seen some advertisement with like SoFi claiming 2-3% interest rates.",finance
personalfinance,Does refinancing make sense?,"This is more of a general question but I can provide details if it helps to do so.

I have payments for a mortgage, student loans, and car as well as the regular monthlies. 

My question is, is there any advantage to refinancing my auto loan (about 7% apr) if it's affordable and I anticipate paying it off early? I know a lower interest rate reduces what I'll pay overall, but with only 18mo or so left to pay, I don't know if it's worth refinancing. I also have student loans (about 5k at 3.4% interest and just under that at 6.8%) that will be paid in full ahead of schedule, is there anything to be gained by refinancing?

personalfinance,"My 19yr old sis got pressured into impulse-buying a car by her Mom, and now she's having trouble being able to afford to live outside of her abusive household. Please help.","**Backstory:**  
My sister got herself into a bit of trouble, and I'm hoping you can help. My sister is trying to escape her abusive home, and our messed up family. I could go into depth about the fucked up shit in my family, but I'm worried about them somehow finding this and it getting bad for us. The more important take away from this is that Sis **cannot** live at home, or with any family. She has lived in 3 different apartments, trying to live on her own since 18, but she hasn't mastered solo stability yet (she's 18, so I get it). After the last one I had her move in with me rather than stay with her parents (we share a Dad). I live in a large top 10 city that has affordable rents, she's more likely to get a job out here, and I have a few survival life skills she was never taught, so I'm hoping she can pick some of this up and find a more stable way to live outside of them.  
.  
**That brings me to my questions:**  
We've worked out her finances into an clear budget, we've detailed a few contingency plans, discussed therapy being a priority, and gotten most of her life out from under her parents thumbs. The one thing I can't figure out is *what* the freaking hell we do to fix her car situation. Her Mom took her to a dealership and kinda told her she needed to pick something out because she couldn't borrow her car anymore, and then pressured her for it to look a certain level of niceness (because that matters at 18?), and then didn't even haggle the price. My god, you guys.  
.  
**The numbers:**  
The car: 2017 Hyundai Accent (Value Edition)  
Price paid: 19,600  
Loan term: 73 month  
Interest rate: 13.77  
Paid interest: 1,439  
Paid principal: 985  
Car payment: 403/month  
Insurance: 364  
.  
Car MSRP was only 17,300 (she over payed). Within the past 4 months of her having it she has driven 17k miles, there was a hail storm, and her friend rear-ended a luxury car in her car. Front end paint is chipped and the car is very mildly dented from hail. She didn't report the hail because her insurance has already gone up to $364 over the fender bender (we've already priced other policies). Car is now valued **GOOD** on KBB, worth $7,200 trade-in or $10,300 privately sold. That can't be right though, right? The car still looks impeccably new, you have to bend over to eye-level out with the surface of the car to see the hail dents. The paint chipping in the front is very minor.  
.  
**Is there anything this child can do to lower her car costs, and be able to live on her own?** Before we knew it was this bad we were going to downsize and trade her car in, but now I'm not even sure that's possible/smart. What do people do in these situations? Can she sell it back to the dealership? Can she sell it back without buying a car from them? There's so much I don't know in this respect.  
.  
Having a car is required in this city, as well as the only thing that makes her feel safe (she can always run if she has a car). She can't stay in my one bedroom 600sq/ft apartment forever (cramped), and the longer she stays the more likely *her* cat is to get thrown out of my Dads house. **[EDIT: He's apparently already done that now, but kitty came back crying, so I'm now trying to find a foster home for her cat.]** Simply put, the car is her safety, the cat is her love. I just need to find a way to get her in her own space with a mode of transport. I know there will be some tough love here, but please remember she's been given little to no life skills from her parents and the ones they did bestow upon her are actually quite regressive, but in sum she is doing her very best to run from her abusers. I'm doing my best to help her. Any kind advice you can give will be beyond appreciated. I tried to search Reddit, but I'm new myself and couldn't find what I was looking for, so if it's already been asked please forgive me.  
.  
TLDR  
Abused sister underwater in a car loan, and trying to figure out how to afford living on her own.

[2nd EDIT: Just looking at her loan docs, and apparently **her mom** is listed as ""owner"", and she is listed as ""co-owner""? That seems backwards, right? Is co-owner the same as co-signer?]  
[3rd EDIT: Oh god. She used the money our grandma left her for school **to put down** on this thing. $1500. This is.... this is so bad. Financed $19,600, with cash that comes to 21,100 for a $14k car that's going to end up costing her 30K after financing.

personalfinance,"Loan forgiveness, investing (maybe), feeling overwhelmed about all this college debt","Here's my info:
Age:18
Major: Childhood (PreK-4) and Special Education
Cash Available: $5000
Debt so far: $5500
Anticipated debt upon graduation: $50,000

Question: Since I will be a teacher, and according to federal student aid, I think i will be eligible for [teacher loan forgivenss](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher) and since special education is considered a highly-qualified field, it will knock off about $17,500 of my student loans after five years.

On top of this, it seems that i will qualify for [public service loan forgivenss](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) which will completely eliminate my loans after making on-time payments for 10 years.

As I understand it, I have to make payments on my loans while I teach to qualify for both of these programs, and I cannot qualify for both at the same time. So, if I understand it correctly, I teach for 5 years at a Title I school and get the $17,500 off of my loans, then I have to start the payments for 10 years to qualify for loan forgiveness. 

If I understand this correctly, to get the most out of the programs, it seems that common advice is to get on an income-driven repayment plan while i am qualifying for these programs. The total time I will spend in these programs is 15 years, which means my loans will be paid off sometime around when I am 37.

Do I have this figured out right? The resources at my college are not very helpful. I know common sense says to take the money I have and just start repaying loans, but I was thinking maybe it would be better if I held onto the money and perhaps invested it somewhere until I needed to start paying (after graduation) and start making the minimum monthly payment for those loans then. If that is the case, should I just invest most of my money in the meantime and let it grow to help pay with loans instead of letting it sit in a savings account? If you got this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read this. It is also just overwhelming to me. 

TL;DR: Should I start paying off my loans right now, or invest the money and let it grow? I will qualify for loan forgiveness programs, but only after I have taught for 5 years will $17500 come off, and after 15 will the remaining balance come off. Would it make more sense to wait until I have to start paying and pay the monthly minimums or should I start paying off now?",finance

personalfinance,Could use some advice for massive credit card/student loan debt please.,"Help with LOTS of Credit Card debt and Student Loans


I really really want to reduce my credit card debt, it's been quite substantial the past few years, almost $50K on 7 cards! Student Loans have about $37K all on private student loans, I want to focus on reducing the credit cards first since they are much higher interest rates.  I'm age 33, been working a steady job for about 10 years now and working on a master's program (thankfully work is paying for this 100%)


I discovered this subreddit and did some reading, I amassed all my debts, expenses, and incoming onto an excel chart


Here is a summary:

Credit Card | Balance | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment
---------|----------|----------|----------
AMEX | $4535 | 19.24% | $175
Chase | $4800 | 16.99% | $116
Citi 1 | $4700 | 12.99% | $100
Citi 2 | $10300 | 23.24% | $330 
Discover 1 | $1450 | 23.99% | $50
Discover 2 | $7700 | 20.99% | $160
PNC | $13440 | 16.99% | $340




Student Loan | Balance | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment
---------|----------|----------|----------
SL1 | $1480 | 4.62% | Deferred until 12/31/18
SL2 | $1650 | 4.62% | Deferred until 12/31/18
SL3 | $7100 | 6.73% | $80
SL4 | $6500 | 7.48% | $70
SL5 | $4100 | 5.48% | $50
SL6 | $16000 | 5.83% | $170


I own a house, and rent out the fullbasement, and with that included my monthly takehome income is ~$3800/mo.

Attached are my expenses, i could probably trim this down $100-200/month.  I have already cut down expenses A LOT since a year ago.. No more Netflix, not even cable TV anymore, cellphone went from $65/mo to $20/mo cricket plan.  We only go out to eat if we have gift cards or for special Groupon/Restaurant.com promos.

Expense | Monthly Cost
------------|-------------
Mortgage | $920
Dental | $14
HSA Account | $10
Life Insurance | $3.50
Credit Cards | $1270
Student Loans | $370
Phone | $20
Utilities | $200
Groceries | $150
Car Insurance | $78
Motorcycle Ins | $36
AAA | $10
Cable Internet | $65
Entertainment | $100
Gas | $40
**Sum** | **$3303.50**


At this point I'm thinking my best choice would be to go to my local credit union to see if they'd allow me to consolidate the credit cards into a something with a bit lower interest.. I know they won't give the best rates but anything would be better than some of these that are 25%  or higher.


I have about $5K in my checking account, $1700 in an HSA Account, and $71,000 in my 401K that I'd prefer not to touch if at all possible as I already took a loan on it when I bought my house for the downpayment..  My credit score is about 700, but I've tried to apply for BT cards but always rejected due to my amount of debt and utilization rate on the cards.  I have NEVER had a late payment on either the cards, student loans, nor mortgage.  I don't have a car/bike payment as those are paid off.  I do have about $10K worth of goods I could sell off and plan on selling too for some immediate impact.


Please advise me in turning around this debt.. thank you very much.

personalfinance,$0 down vs down payment,"I have heard the argument before that you should put at little down as possible on a vehicle... even multi millionaires getting car loans instead of buying outright (Floyd Maywether excluded).  The argument is that if the interest rate on the car is lower than your return on investments you shouldn't have your money locked up in the car.

So... my question is whether these rates are comparable directly?
  Meaning... if I know I have an investment guaranteed to return 3.5% and I purchase a vehicle at 3.5% ... Will I end up with the same amount of money at the end of my term regardless of how much I put down, 0%, 20%, 50%, 100%?... does the math all just  cancel out and I end up at the same place at the end of my term?

personalfinance,Deferment on school loans,"Hi Reddit fam! 

Before I begin, just wanted to go ahead and apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors as I am typing on my phone!

Anyways, so I recently just got a letter from my school loan provider saying they have granted me forbearance. I previously went to a expensive private school and decided to take a year off to figure out what I wanted to do. I recently just started school at my local community college. 

So as for my loans, I have three loans totaling about 9,451.19. I have been paying my loans off for about a year now. I have two unsubsidized loans and one subsidized, they all have a 4.6% interest rate. In the letter they said that the government would take care of the interest on that loan during the deferment period. However, on the unsubsidized I am responsible for the interest. Even though it would be nice to take a break from having to pay my loans, I think I should still continue to pay for my loans (I pay 102 a month) my mother said I should take advantage of this time so I can save my money but I would prefer to be debt free once I finish school. 

I'm open to any kinds of advice! Thanks so much!",finance
btc,Bitcoin Monetary Policy,"Bitcoin has a monetary policy. Always had, and always will. According to current policy, 12.5 new bitcoins are issued on each block. New currency issuance is expected to eventually taper off to zero in a hundred years or so, but that's still a policy.

Bitcoin's monetary policy is not set by a wise AI in the cloud, as some “code-is-law” fanatics seem to believe. It is governed by code, but it was set by Satoshi Nakamoto, who did not specialize in economics. It appears he simply made an educated guess as to what a reasonable monetary policy might be to encourage cryptocurrency adoption. That policy was defined far into the future and published in open code, making the policy more stable and transparent than what we get from central banks.

Stability and transparency have value, without which bitcoin could probably never have gathered the trust and acceptance it has today. But having extreme stability in monetary policy means that it can't respond to current economic conditions. Economic booms and busts aren't going to go away just because the central banks are out of the picture. And if economic volatility can't be absorbed by monetary policy, it'll show up in the exchange rate. Even if bitcoin was the only world currency, you would still see volatility in the price of everything as people switch back and forth from hoarding commodities to hoarding bitcoin.

Maybe you think fractional reserve banking is the problem, and once we get rid of that everything will be stable. In that case, I have bad news for you: cryptocurrency is permissionless. You can't stop a bartender from opening a tab for her customers, issuing tokens representing bitcoins that neither party actually owns. She can then sell those tokens to a collection agency, and you can imagine larger systems than that. Even if you don't accept those tokens yourself, others will allow their fungibility with bitcoin, and you cannot isolate yourself from their impact on the money supply. The value of your hard currency will fluctuate depending on how many tokens other people are creating.

Many people have been drawn to cryptocurrency because they value policy stability more than currency stability. That's often based on an arrogant belief that they'll somehow be able to predict the future better than most, and therefore profit from any currency fluctuations as long as the monetary policy stays predictable. The dramatic rise in cryptocurrency value has done a lot to fuel unrealistic overconfidence in these people. It's ridiculously easy to fool yourself into thinking you're a genius trader when you're actually just riding a raging bull market.

Blockstream have pushed policy stability to an extreme by arguing that blocksize is an essential part of the monetary policy, and therefore inviolable. That ideological purism is going to result in dramatic exchange rate volatility as adoption (an economic condition) jackhammers against an indestructible blocksize limit. (ultrastable monetary policy) Sooner or later, reality always finds a way of asserting itself.

The more flexible minds have begun to entertain changes in policy, not just in blocksize, but also with the addition of the EDA. The Bitcoin Cash EDA is genuinely a change to Satoshi Nakamoto's monetary policy. It was meant to keep roughly the same schedule of currency issuance per unit time, but since the policy is actually coded in terms of blocks and hash rate, the practical implementation has been imperfect. Many people are now contemplating another change to Bitcoin Cash EDA monetary policy to – guess what – *stabilize the value of the currency*.

This is a healthy direction. It's the only way that any cryptocurrency can ever mature to widespread acceptance. A usable currency needs to be stable. Most merchants are currently working around bitcoin's volatility by continuing to price their goods in fiat and doing spot conversions to crypto. In other words, they're using crypto as *a settlement layer*. If you want a genuine currency where goods and wages are priced in crypto, the value will eventually need to stabilize. That will only happen once miners are willing to negotiate monetary policies that respond to economic conditions.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"20% raise offered with a large sign on bonus from a new company, help me decide what the best way to manage my new finances","I am 26 years old, and been with the current company for 2.5 years. Started at 56k and worked my way up to 67k. I have just accepted an offer for a 20% raise, 80k at a new company. This is already a large jump in compensation for me, so I am really excited about my future earnings and opportunities with this new company. In addition, I was able to negotiate a sign on bonus of 10k; partly due to my current company's profit-sharing bonus not being vested until the 3 year mark. I did not want to wait until then as this new company seems like a great fit.



I am currently unsure of what to do with the bonus, here are my current finances.

* $1350/month for rent/utilities

* $750/month for student loans (7k left, ~3.2% interest rate)

* $60/month for car insurance (car is paid off (2005 model so kind of old))

* 26k in my 401k ((current company does not match) 15% of my paycheck goes into here, already maxed my Roth IRA (accidentally overpaid by about $500, what can I do about this?), rest goes into my traditional IRA)

* 15k in savings account

* 1k saved for house down payment



The obvious thing would be to pay off my student loans, but I currently do not want to pay that off yet (for reasons I can't explain). Please ignore that. Should I put the money into my retirement?

 It looks like RGS is the best deal, though their loan package has a higher interest rate-- I'll likely get a HELOC after the 12 or 18-month period and ay off the loan in full.

This is a summary of my different loans separated by the different servicers.  The first three have a grace period of 6 months and the last has a grace period of 9 months (I graduated at the end of May).  I plan to not pay any towards my Perkins loan for the next 6 months since it's not accruing interest and I don't have any minimum payments on it yet.  The rest of my federal loans are unsubsidized and subsidized stafford loans with an okay interest rate.  I am planning on just paying the minimum payment on those for now because I am not too worried about that interest getting out of hand and I believe it's not a bad thing to carry some low(ish) interest debt (Correct me if I'm wrong).

Then there are the two private loans in my mom and dads names.  Pretty high rates and have already been accruing a good amount of interest.  I plan to pay as much of those a month that I can, particularly focusing a little more on my dad's.  Probably about 500 to my dads and 400 to my moms.  I have very recently been looking into capitalization and that scared me a little bit, but I'm not sure I fully understand it and how it could affect my loans.  I'm not exactly sure when my interest would capitalize on these private loans or even how to find that information out.

I have also come across some options on choosing to apply my payments as refunds or just payments.  I'm not exactly sure what's meant by that or how it could affect my payments.  Then it asks me to choose which loans my excess payments go towards.. I assume I should just choose the higher interest loans.

I'm just getting a bit overwhelmed by a lot of it and hoping to get some advice from someone with a little more experience with student loans.  My rates are pretty high.. Should I consider consolidation?

investing,Over 55s warned over wine investment scams,"One in four over 55s in the UK have fallen victim to investment scams, with wine and diamonds among the most popular vehicles for fraudsters, says the country's Financial Conduct Authority.

Officials have launched a campaign to warn older adults in the UK about the dangers of alternative investments and to be sceptical about unsolicited phone calls to their homes.

Forty percent of those surveyed by YouGov reported a sharp rise in unsolicited calls – known as cold calling – about prospective investments, said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

YouGov spoke to 2,301 UK residents over 55 years old.

And low interest rates in the UK have persuaded more people to seek alternative ways to invest their savings, according to the FCA. Wine, diamonds and land were three areas where people have been caught out most often, it said.

When done legitimately, wine can provide an additional revenue source to investors, particular given the strong price rises seen on some of the rarest wines and top estates in the past 15 years.

But, UK authorities have also exposed several wine investment scams in recent years.

One Insolvency Service investigation last year found that a 94-year-old person had paid more than £30,000 to a wine investment company that had no wine. Jonathan Piper, director of the company, which was called Embassy Wine UK Ltd, was subsequently banned from being a company director in the UK for 11 years.

Mark Steward, director of enforcement at the FCA, said this week, ‘You don’t need to be gullible to lose money to a scam or fraud. Fraudsters target financially sophisticated people too, who often don’t like to ask what might sound like silly or basic questions.

‘If you are contacted out of the blue about an investment opportunity that sounds too good to be true then it probably is.’",finance

personalfinance,Employer not paying me accordingly,"Hello everybody
My situation is elaborate.

I recently accepted a scholarship/job offer half across the world, which among other miscellaneous things, involves mainly teaching private one on one lessons at an academy. 

Basically the offer was to get paid for my work, and that they would provide me a room, basic  health insurance, and  the money necessary just for public transportation.

I got here a month ago and they started booking students with me quickly. The demand for teachers in this subject is high here and they get a lot of clients. They are a little understaffed considering the amount , actually. But they charge the students expensively enough. The building is more than nice and it's in an expensive neighborhood.

In just a week time, I ended up with between 35 and 40 hours of work a week, working from morning till night particularly Saturdays and Sundays.

The thing is before I came they had sent me a letter explaining the entire deal and it mentioned it would be 25-30 hours a week. It had also a detailed chart explaining the payment for the 25 hour situation, in which (after deducting payment of rent, insurance and transportation) the final monthly amount of 694 pounds was to be recieved by me. This letter they made me print and sign and send back to them. But of course it was no legal contract of any sort.

When I saw what I work I wasn't worried. I know how to work hard and I naturally assumed it would mean more money even.

Well payday arrived and they gave me 644 😶.
I brought up the subject with my boss and he said that actually they had re analysed the scholarship terms so that the next guy that came after me would get 644 as the flat number. But that I was right and that I should be getting 694. Of course that was hardly my point. 694 was for 25 hours work. I'm working more than 40% that amount. The letter states specifically that the number could vary at first but should remain fixed and permanent once the 25 hour weekly quota is achieved.

Long story short is that when I pointed all of this up to him, he said it was some sort of error in redaction in the letter and that also the idea of this deal is to have a fixed salary regardless of the amount of hours I work (which sounds ridiculous). I said that I understand the error but that they brought me here with those terms and that was what I agreed to. I also said that it makes no difference to me what they plan to do with the next person they hire.

He said he will have a chat with his father (the administrator) and see that I get 50 extra pounds. I said that of course it wasn't enough. He said he would have that talk and see.

The problem is that they treat me warmly and fairly besides all this. I live with another teacher who's been here longer and we (bosses and employees) are all friends and they even come home to dinner and we celebrated each others' birthdays, we are not a big number. They gave me a day off when I asked for one. All this makes me more reluctant to stand a firm ground and actually complain in a heated discussion manner. I don't know if I wanna compromise the warm work and living atmosphere I have, and I'm not sure if a potential raise compensates the loss of that comfortability.

I pretty much know that he's gonna come and offer me like 800 pounds a month, which is an improvement but continues to be nearly not enough of what was promised. I don't really know how to react to that probable offer.

I know I have leverage, so that's not a problem. If I were to resign they would be in serious trouble because of the volume of students I was handling. But that would accomplish nothing for me and i don't like ultimatums.

Sorry that I made it long l!

personalfinance,"23 year old looking for advice on student loans, no guidance from parent","So, I graduated a little over a year ago with about 18k in loans. I was fortunate enough to find a job that paid incredibly well and I've been paying off my debt rather quickly.

One loan was from the actual university and that was a 2k loan that I paid off and the account is closed.

The rest was taken on by Fedloan. I've paid off about 5k in the last year and I'm at around 11k. So I've probably paid around 7k this year in total between the loans. 

I was living at home with my parents so I had very few expenses this year. It was dependent by month but I always paid at least 250 a month. Other months I would pay 350 or 600 really dependent on my pay. The plan with Fedloan is 150 a month for 10 years.

I moved out about two months ago so money is a bit tighter and I'm on a budget. The area I live in is quite pricy. My boyfriend and I split everything. So, the max I can contribute is 350 a month. 

I have some savings, a 401k through work and paid benefits and transportation. My only expenses are living. My question is should I continue to pay the 350 and struggle for a bit until I get to law school. Or should I go back to the original plan and pay 150 a month and put the reminder into savings/investments?

Details: 23M, USA DC metropolitan area
Job: software developer @$64k/yr ($3200/mth after tax and deductions)
Job details: 1 yr of work, mostly doing full-stack web app devops as a govt contractor
Raises/promotions: one 4% pay bump after 6 months, currently in the process of an in-level promotion (no position change but a promotion-level pay raise of 5%), with the expectation of getting another 4% raise and a 5% promotion (to lvl 2SE) by the same time next year.  After this it would be less frequent due to increased experience requirements for higher up positions.  The above salary includes only the first 4% pay bump.

Assets: $2k in Roth 401k (8% w/ 50% match for 12% total which is the max they will match), $1k in company stock (5% employee purchase discount, likely to move with economy), $8k in various cryptocurrencies, growing from a one year initial investment of $2k both thru investing and trading, and a car worth $8k (less than what I owe)
Total: $20k

I also manage ~$10k of funds people have given to me, taking 5% of profits (letting them know it could all be lost in a day of course)

Debt: $37k school loans at a weighted average rate of 7%, $12k in credit card debt @18%, $11k car loan at 8%, $3k personal school loan @ 11%
Total: $63k

Expenses: $900/month rent and utilities, $500/month combined car payment and insurance, minimum payments on debt, the expenses of living

The credit card debt is from school as well so I've been working on paying that down as it has the highest interest, but I only net $200-$500 a month and my first 6 months of working that was going to people I owed money to.  I have gotten letters from companies saying they'll consolidate CC debt and negotiate for a lower total amount; do those companies actually work or is it just a bullshit scam?

In terms of the cryptocurrency, it's ROI is way better than any of the interest rates.  I've been making money pretty consistently, but it's a very risky, volatile and unpredictable market.  I once lost 60% of my holding due to an exchange fluke.  

How do taxes on cryptocurrency work?  Do I have to pay taxes on everything I convert to USD  or only on my profit?  Will I not have to pay taxes on what I withdraw if it's less than what I put in?  Do I have to pay taxes on cryptocurrency I use to buy things directly?  Are there any laws/regulations I should be aware of here?

Comparing my debt to the cryptocurrency, my ROI so far has been far larger than any of my interest rates.  However it carries inherent risk and I assume must be taxed before I can use it to pay something like debt.  Taking this into account, should I still use my net income to pay my credit card down or invest a proportion of it into my crypto fund?

Thank you kindly for any advice!

Edit: also in terms of jobs, I'm fairly confident I could get a new job and get a 10-20% pay increase but there's always the associated costs of moving/adjusting.  Also I like my job and my co-workers so theres the risk I could move and it'll be shitty when it wasn't before.  At what point does it become worth it to move?

personalfinance,Student loan debt,"Hey all this is my first post here. I am a little lost but I am trying my best in my situation and figured I should see if I can get some advice on what I am doing and if I should be doing something else. I am a 23 yr old male living alone, I moved from NJ to NC for work. 

So I am the 1st in my family to go to college for 4 years and get a bachelor's degree. I was around 175k in debt after college in loans. 

I was unemployed and my payments were coming in June of this year. I started looking for help, mainly forgiveness but I didn't qualify for any of the programs. So I kinda figured I was screwed. When one day in late May I got a phone call from Student Debt Doctor(SDD) . A representative there explained that they were waving their qualification requirements because our president was removing the program in 2018. I was excited, I was finally getting help. I listened to the rep and had him help me with my loans. Now my loans in my name are around 28k while the loans in my mom's name are around 150k. So SDD explained that they can help me reduce my total debt by 100k through their assistance and moving me to a new loan servicer. So I paid SDD upfront around $1300 and started paying them for a monthly insurance service of $35 and account so $70/month. 

Originally when I spoke to SDD my mom and I were both unemployed. So the insurance plan we were paying for was a 1year lock out of payment even if we were to get jobs we wouldn't have to pay. However since my father had a job my mother's account had a monthly payment of $600 starting in September of this year. 

Fast forward 3 months, I paid for SDD at the end of May/beginning of June. Come September I called my new loan servicer, Fed Loans and was inquiring why my account said I owed $0 for my mom when only my account should be at $0 and my mom's should be at $600. The rep from Fed Loans explained the information they had on file and I said oh I think SDD gave you the wrong information. They had no idea who or what SDD was and they said the information I had on file was a lie it could be a federal offense. The said that SDD sounds like a 3rd party scam and that I should call my bank, block them and report the issue to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). So I did just that, called my bank cancelled my card and issued a new one. Opened a case for a refund with my bank which is still being investigated a month later. And I called and opened a case with the FTC about SDD. 

So fast forward again to today. My refund claim with my bank is still going on. They had me call SDD even though Fed Loans and the FTC advised me not to, I wanted my $1500 back from SDD. The new rep I spoke to at SDD gave me a whole new story of what they do and that the 1st rep I spoke to explained it wrong and she apologized for him! She explained that I was put on forbearance which I had no idea what that was until I called the FTC back and had the rep there explain to me. So with the forbearance over 3 months my total loan debt increase to over 200k. I didn't know this was happening and SDD didn't explain this would happen. So the FTC has all this information and there is an open case about it and that was as much as they could tell me. Also my bank wanted me to request a refund from SDD and the rep I spoke to said only her manager can do so and that all their managers had left for the day at 5pm when I called at 455pm and didn't ask about a refund until around 505pm. The rep said a manager will call me back tomorrow and it never happened. I explained this to the FTC and the rep there said they would always tell me oh the managers all just left or all the managers aren't in today just so that I never actually got anywhere with them. 

Fed Loans had my parents remake their account details and monthly payments should start for their account next month, somewhere around $1200 a month. While my account will remain at $0 a month until February of 2018 when I am reevaluated. I have started a job a month ago making around $1800 month. I am going to be losing money each month and have around $5k to my name. 

So my main reason for posting this here is because I had no help in this matter and was kind of just listening to my contacts on what to do. I don't know if SDD is a scam, they seem real but my other federal services say they're a scam. I owe an enormous amount of money in student loans and I am just looking for any advice. Did I do things right? Is there something else I can be doing? 

I haven't checked my Fed Loans account details yet to confirm the payment amount or start for my mom's account. The $1200 stated was a rough guess from the rep I spoke to after I told them my parents joint income. I also never called SDD back to hear anything about the managers again. A couple days ago my monthly payment to SDD was due and since I cancelled my card they sent me a couple emails and called me a couple times requesting that something urgent happened with my account and that I need to call them asap. I have been ignoring them per the advice of the FTC and Fed Loans.",finance

The 200k loan includes a prepayment reward if paid off in 48 months. (Up to 2% of total loan) so rebate would be 4K if we upped payments to pay off within 48 months.  Upping the payment would stretch us very thin, if we didn't tap into saving. Not allowing much room for increased housing payment/ purchasing.

Dilemma is not buying home immediately/ missing out on current interest rates, mortgage interest deduction, etc. Versus peace of mind of killing the loans asap, and the 4K bonus.

Trump tax plan appears to negatively affect home ownership equation in my area also, proposing ridding of state income and property tax deductions. If it goes through as is I could see home value dropping also.

personalfinance,Clearing debt from credit history,"Hi there,

Apparently I have a ~450$ debt which went unpaid ~4 years ago. I found this out as I am planning to buy a home and I am getting my finances in order ahead of time and I have gone through some pre-approval steps in which I see my credit history.

I am happy to pay the $450, or even a bit more to get it off my history and potentially lower my interest rate on the home due to a better credit score. Other than this my credit is great.

Funny thing is I had no idea about this debt until now. It says ""medical"" but nothing else. I suspect it may be from an allergy doctor I went to a while ago but honestly I am not sure.

What should I do from here? I see 4 options:

1) call allergy place and see if it was with them. If so, see if I can pay them directly in return for them taking the mark off my credit  
2) call the collector (who has one yelp review claiming they were a huge pain to work with) and see what I can work out with them. Use a burner number so they cannot hassle me if the conversation goes awry.  
3) dispute the debt with the 3 agencies and see what happens  
4) do nothing and take a ding on my credit history. 
  
Please let me know which of these options seem most reasonable, or if there are other better options. I read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections but wasn't sure where to go from there.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,So I bought 2 new cars for cheap.,"So I bought 2 new cars for very cheap. 12,500 a piece. I'm going to college and using the 9/11 gi bill I get back roughly 1600 a month, and about 3,000 per semester for Pell Grant. 

I work a part time job that covers all my bills very easily. My wife works full time and covers her share of the bills. 

We have a 401k with a tad over 10,000$ in it and a savings account with about 1200$ in it.

We are effectively able to not worry about car payments for new cars and pay them off in 2 years if we do this.

&amp;nbsp;


Cardano is a highly secure blockchain written in Haskell. It allows formal verification of code, and easy extensibility through a layered architecture. Cardano’s technology is built from peer-reviewed research at some of the world’s foremost universities. 

After more than two years of planning and development, we're delighted to announce that the Cardano blockchain was publicly launched on the 29th September 2017. Cardano's Ada token was then made available for trading on the 1st October at  [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-ADA) exchange.
 

On this subreddit you can learn more about the project, understand its great potential and engage in the worldwide Cardano community!

#**What is Cardano?**


Cardano is a security focused blockchain that harnesses the latest research and engineering insights to build a platform suitable for the highest value applications. 

Built on a foundation of peer-reviewed research created through partnerships with the world’s foremost universities, Cardano aims to create a platform for decentralised applications and smart contracts that can be processed with a technique called formal verification. 

This allows logical proof of the correctness of code and smart contracts, for those applications where value is high and security is paramount. Cardano combines this with an innovative layered approach that separates accounting of value from all other smart contract and computation activity. 

This means functionality can be added to smart contract capabilities without changing the protocol responsible for the cryptocurrency.


#The Team

Cardano is made up of three companies who each have distinct roles in the project.

&amp;nbsp;


1. [**Cardano Foundation**](https://cardanofoundation.org/): A Swiss non-profit and guardian of the Cardano ecosystem and community. It aims to proactively work with governments and regulatory bodies, as well as forming strategic partnerships with enterprises and other open-source projects to further global adoption of the technology.

2. [**IOHK**](https://iohk.io/): A world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to three billion people that don’t have them. The group is contracted to design, build, and maintain the Cardano platform until 2020.

3. [**Emurgo**](http://emurgo.io/): a company formed to integrate, develop and support businesses who want to utilise Cardano's decentralised blockchain.

#**What is unique about the project?**

Cardano is the first blockchain project to be built on peer reviewed academic research. 

This level of scrutiny of the underlying technology is an industry first. Further to this, Cardano is unique in that it’s written in the Haskell coding language. 

Haskell is considered to be one of the most secure programming languages, minimizing the number of errors and adding extremely robust security to the platform. This includes use of a technique called formal verification, which allows mathematical proof of the correctness of code.

Cardano is also designed to operate in regulated industries whilst protecting individual privacy. Applications built on Cardano can be individually customised to meet regulator requirements, but individuals can protect their privacy by choosing whether they want to enter regulated domains.


#How can I get Ada?

Right now the only exchange that Cardano has partnered with is Bittrex.com. More exchange partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks and months. Bittrex currently only offers a Bitcoin to Ada trading pair, but others will be added soon. You can sign up to Bittrex [here](https://bittrex.com/account/Register).

#How do I send/receive Ada?


You'll want to start by getting a wallet.
Cardano's development partner IOHK has built the [Daedalus wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io), allowing users to securely store their Ada. It will eventually support many different cryptocurrencies.

#**The Whitepapers**
Cardano has a very strong academic heritage and is the [first](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/23/at-crypto-2017-blockchain-presentations-focus-on-proofs-not-concepts/#78fec49b7b70) cryptocurrency to have one of its academic papers accepted at Crypto 2017, the leading cryptography conference. IOHK have research centres or partnerships with many of the top global academic institutions including the [University of Edinburgh](http://uk.businessinsider.com/iohk-sponsors-blockchain-research-lab-at-the-university-of-edinburgh-tokyo-tech-2017-2) and the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2017/037573.html). 

On the Cardano Hub website, there are two sections within the Whitepapers tab:

1.  [**Philosophy**](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/philosophy/): Confusingly most cryptocurrency projects call this their whitepaper, using the word in a non-academic sense. Here you can learn where the project has come from, and what its goals are. It explains how Cardano embraces the latest academic and engineering insights to build a highly secure Haskell blockchain.
2. [**Academic Papers**](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/academic-papers/): This section hosts the peer-reviewed research papers that are behind Cardano's technology, including the first provably secure PoS protocol [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#XJ6MHFXX).


#**Monetary Policy**

* Total Max Supply: 45,000,000,000 ADA
* Total Ada distributed in Pre-Sale: 25,927,070,538 ADA


An amount equal to 20% of Ada vouchers sold during the Sale period, or  5,185,414,107 Ada vouchers were generated and distributed to three entities of the Cardano ecosystem that are part of the Technical and Business Development pool: IOHK, Emurgo and Cardano Foundation.

Together with the Ada sold, this brings the supply of allocated tokens to 31,112,483,745 ADA.

More details can be read in the Cardano [monetary policy](https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/monetary-policy/) document.


#The Code &amp; Technical Documentation
The entire Cardano blockchain is completely open source software and is available to see on [Github](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/). There is also extensive technical documentation produced by IOHK which can be viewed [here](https://cardanodocs.com).

#The Roadmap
The Cardano roadmap is due to be released imminently and will be published [here](https://cardanoroadmap.com).



#**Pre-Sale**

The pre-launch token sale of Ada ran from September 2015 to January 2017 was undertaken over 4 different tranches. During the sale the average price paid for 1 Ada was $0.0024 USD and 94.8% of Ada voucher holders who participated in the sale are Japanese. The audit report summary carried out by Cardano Foundation is available [here](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/audit-report-summary/), and the genesis block distribution may be seen [here](https://www.cardanohub.org/en/genesis-block-distribution/).

#Mining and Staking

We are currently in the [bootstrap era](https://cardanodocs.com/timeline/bootstrap/) during which IOHK and Cardano Foundation trusted nodes are currently operating the network. We will then move into the [reward era](https://cardanodocs.com/timeline/reward/) for which details will be released very soon and updated here.

personalfinance,Would you pay off 2 car loans in this situation,"Hi /r/PersonalFinance,  

Here is the situation, story aside, for the next 30 months I will be getting ~1500 month on top of my salary how would you handle it.  

Currently the household income is around 100k. We have no credit card debt, no student loans, no medical bills. The only money we owe is on two car loans.  

However we all know car loans are depreciating assets. The car loans are both due around the same time Oct '22. There are 121 payments left because the payments are made biweekly. Here is the breakdown of the money if we paid it on schedule.  

# of Payments x Payment = Total  
Current Balance  
Total - Current Loan Balance = Interest Paid Over Time  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Car 1 Total | 121 x $209 = $25, 289  
Current Loan Balance = $22,985  
$25,289 - $22,985 = $2,304  
  
Car 2 | 121 x $120 = $14,520  
Current Loan Balance = $ 13,098  
$14,520 - $13,098 = $1,422  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Total Interest Over Time  
$2,304 + $1,422 = $3726  
  
vs.  
  
Paying off the loans early   
$1500 / 2 = $750  
  
Car 1 Monthly Payment = $420   
Car 2 Monthly Payment = $140  
  
Car 1  
$420 + $750 = $1170  
$25,289 / $1170 = 21 Months or 44 payments  
  
Car 2  
$140 + $750 = $890  
$14,520 / $890 = 16 months or 32 payments.  

The issue is after committing 21 months out of 30 on the car loans leaves us with (9 months of benefit x 1500 = $13,500)  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Long story short what is more worth?  
  
30 months vs 9 months  
  
Also! Please let us know if our calculations or thought process is wrong.   
 
Edit: As you all pointed out i forgot to add interest rates -___- 
Car 1 Interest Rate - 3.74%
Car 2 Interest Rate - 4.34%

Our goal if we saved the money would be to save it until we had 8 months of expenses in emergency fund, then save the rest of the benefit  so that we can build our cash in hand bucket.",finance

investing,What is your opinion on gold?,"Just looking at the market given that the expected rate hike that (despite the reduced rate hike speed) is still making several very large asset managers nervous enough regarding equities that theyve publicly stated so at this point, there might be a considerable bid that remains in gold. Some people have stated basically the rate hike is nearly playing with fire.


* If you asked the market broadly would people say theres a gold standard for risk off? I doubt theres literally anybody who wouldnt have gold as a safe haven asset at least in their top 3.


* Where do you go regarding a safe haven should the feds balance sheet reduction have unintended consequences?


* Where do you go if theres any type of geopolitical uncertainty/instability?


* North Korea?


* Where do you go if there are systemic risk type scenarios?


Sure nothing might happen but its still one of those things where it appears you are just going to want gold as a part of the portfolio  at least just in case.

* Is it easier or harder to manage a long portfolio of gold in any of those scenarios logistically as compared to suddenly trying to buy?


* Lets say the rate hike is delayed for some reason, that is still (typically) lower dollar long gold.


There are ways to put that on a gold position without much risk and basically if I'm looking at an asset that has several possible positions pretty easily 3:1, or more reward:risk and a reasonable fundamentals explanation for that behavior with some statistics to back all of that up.


Btw do you think President Trump likes [gold](https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6816689/trump_tower.0.jpg)? Like it or not at the moment hes President.


I'm not exactly a gold bug and have had decidedly bearish opinions on gold at specific moments (most of which turned out to be reasonably accurate humbly). I'm just finding it rather difficult to find any specific scenario that is extremely bearish gold at the moment. Whats your opinion?


So does this make sense and what is your opinion?",finance

personalfinance,loan tax - little trick my wife and I are using to pay off our loans faster and be more careful with spending decisions,"My wife and I started charging ourselves a 'loan tax' of 5 percent on every purchase we make. At the end of each month we take the taxes for the month and make an extra payment towards our loan with the highest interest rate. 

Once the loans are all paid off, we're planning to start charging a 'retirement tax' and put the money towards investments. It's not necessarily a whole lot of money but every little bit helps, and there's a little bit of a mindset shift associated as well.

I also set up a Tasker task that pulls transactions from text alerts I receive from my credit cards for any transaction, calculates 5 percent, and creates a transaction to YNAB. Automating the whole process makes it much easier to follow through.

Even though we already make extra payments on our debts this is helping us pay off our loans even faster. I hope that this helps someone else do the same.",finance
personalfinance,Question about Car Loan and if I should sell and get cheaper vehicle,"Hi All,
About a year ago I was in a bit of a bind when my previous vehicle's transmission died unexpectedly. 

I was in a rush to replace the vehicle as it would have been really difficult to get to work and such without it (admittedly I think I would have made a different decision now, but that is why I know it was a mistake). I went into the dealership with a specific monthly price point in mind and when they showed me a 2013 Kia Soul that met those monthly payments, I was ecstatic. I thought it over a bit and decided to go for it. 

Flash forward to now, I have been helping my boyfriend hunt for a car, and just out of curiosity I decided to look into my car loan details. To my dismay, I actually had a 72-month loan (before I get ripped to shreds I realize that this was totally my fault, and I should have known this from the get go before signing anything. It was my first time having to deal with purchasing a vehicle on my own and was honestly lost).

personalfinance,"Help me invest my $20,000 wedding fund.","I am preparing for a wedding that is coming up in about 6 months. Currently, my fiance and I have $20,000 reserved for this purpose.

She is not fully convinced, but I've been considering taking this money and, rather than put it in savings for that time period, putting this into a basic investment account and buying ETFs or mutual funds. 

My thinking is there's a good chance it will grow more than the 1% interest rate we'd normally get. I know this is risky, but it's something I already do with my freelance income and have had some success with. Every freelance paycheck I get I put aside 25% for the taxes I'll inevitably pay on it, but I buy ETFs with it with the hope that, by the time taxes are due, I've made a little money off it.

I should add that our financial situation is such that we have enough saved already that we could afford to lose this a little if it doesn't work out, and I have a strong support network with my family so I'm more able to take on this risk.

I'm interested to hear other thoughts on this and whether it is ill advised. I'd also like to hear suggestions on what to invest in if we did go this route.",finance

personalfinance,Paid tradeline (car loan) fell off credit report 5 years too soon. Why did this happen and how can I fix it?,"I've googled this and searched for it here too, but all I can find are questions about how to get negative accounts removed earlier than the 7-year standard reporting period.

I had a car loan through a local credit union. I paid that car loan off in 2012 after never missing a payment. Around this same time I went back to University and fell behind on other bills, which landed me in a terrible bad-credit hole I'm still digging myself out of. (It's going well though - i see the light at the end of the tunnel.) 

Every car loan I've ever had has been paid in full, on time, every time. They're gleaming green squares of ""good credit"" on my otherwise disappointing credit reports. I just got a notification that this particular tradeline ""dropped off"" my report today. It was paid off in 2012. From what I understand, tradelines stay on reports for 7 years, and tradelines in good standing can stay on there for 10 years. This should report for another 5 years and I'm feeling quite miffed about it. I only got 5 years of good history out of it, when I should have had 10. 

*(It would be different if my accounts with bad history were removed after only 5 years, then I wouldn't feel like I've been cheated.)*

Has this happened to anyone else? I feel like need every positive tradeline possible showing on my report to contrast the negative ones. Can I just ask for the credit union to continue to report it for the remainder of the ten years? Am I just being stupid?",finance
investing,Anybody notice anything different this week?,"This week, the Fed was to start ""unwinding"" its TBill and MBS holdings, by NOT rolling over the first $10Bn that matured in October.  Let's assume:

* That $85Bn mature each month -- same as what they were purchasing at the end of QE.
* That maturities are ""fairly uniformly"" distributed each week of the month (each day of the week, probably less so)
* And therefore, that $10Bn is about half of what would mature in a typical week.

Bitcoin,Segwit2x: Everyone that loves bitcoin should be mining here's why.,"A) Freak scenario (but very possible) china bans everything bitcoin including mining. The hashing power will drop substantially that bitcoin will become useless for several weeks, the price will crash, etc...     
     
B) Some people want to split bitcoin again(segwit 2x) taking with them again significant hashing power with similar outcome to A.     
     
If everyone mined a bit, even with older tech, so long you break even on electricity costs or for that matter, mining less than the cost of power(assuming bitcoins price will rise in the future and that’s when you recover) you are essentially adding another (voting) voice for where you have the power to dictate the future of bitcoin through democracy. You are already voting by the wallets you use, exchanges you use, nodes you run, and now you would be adding another vote by the mining pool you support.     
     
People are already thinking 'how much voting power can I have if they mine at say 300 gigahashes/second'? That would be equivalent to saying on any vote(federal election?) what difference will my little voice do. Answer: a lot.     
     
The point is if millions of people started to mine with micro hashing power it all adds up and equates to very significant hashing power (actually making bitcoin more secure at the same time) 300 gh/sec x 1 million. WE now have much more ammunition in the fight over bitcoins path, whether it be new bitcoin improvement proposals or hashing power support. You see now what my point is.     
     
So instead of being afraid of the future for bitcoin, put your hashing where your mouth is and add that very crucial and important voice to steer bitcoin into the direction you see is best. Bitcoin is a community project and should be voiced by the community no matter how big or small the mouth is, it all adds up.

personalfinance,Buying new to me car to save money? (Details inside),"Let me preface this with saying this came up because I really want a new car. Cars are a big part of my life and this legitimately sounds like a decent idea.

So right now I own two cars. 

I own a high performance sports car (2003 Mitsubishi Evo) that I built and put wayyy to much money into in high school which now at this point I don't have plans to ever sell. But in the 4 years I have had it (sophomore in college now) I have refinanced it once so I still have about 5k left on it. My monthy payment is $275, my interest rate is 1.9%. This car is strictly summers only, living in Montana that makes it pretty much April-September before it gets stuck in the garage at absolute max, but because I still owe on it I am forced to have full coverage on it all year around which is about $200 a month because I am so young. 

My other car is a 2007 Subaru Legacy that I daily. I own it outright and I pay about $75 a month on liability for it a month I think? 

My idea is to sell my Subaru to pay off my Evo, and put the evo in my garage with zero insurance. Then get a new loan on a new car and only carry insurance on that car. 

I could then put insurance on my Evo in the core of the summer when I am home (May-August) if I wanted it.

Right now I pay almost $600 on cars per month. 

If I got a new car, even if I got a nicer car ($10,000 or so, this is absolutely the max I would want to pay) my monthly payment would be $200 or so for 4 years with a 3% interest rate. Even if full coverage on this thing was $150-$200 I would save $100-$200 a month on car expenses. 

Now obviously I would be spending more in the long run but while I am in college that extra monthly cash would be extremely helpful and then when I am out of college I can focus on paying off debt with an engineering salary.

I would like to also explain that right now I have a savings account with about 3 months of income in it, but could make it last probably 5 if I was really strict.

tl;dr sell daily, pay off summer car so I don't carry insurance, buy new car and only have insurance there. Overall, smaller monthly cost (by quite a bit)",finance
cardano,Thank You,"Over two years ago IOHK joined a movement to build a truly unique collection of technology that married the best engineering principles with the dreams of scientists in far removed universities. It was a tremendously ambitious and complex project to grasp. 

Tens of millions of dollars would need to be gathered, long term roadmaps developed, research institutions established and properly managed as well as numerous entities staffed. In short, it was an insane project to attempt. Yet we attempted it. 

Now two years later, there are well over a hundred people working full time on the Cardano project, three research centers drafting peer reviewed whitepapers, a legion of haskell developers pushing the limits of the language and three well capitalized entities with a mandate and funding to build Cardano until 2020. 

It’s equally unbelievable and humbling to see how far we have gone in such a short time. Cardano is literally evolving computer science from semantics based compilation to entirely new cryptographic protocols to formal verification of code. Cardano also managed to build an amazing community over 10,000 strong in a slow and methodical way. 

We launched the mainnet recently with very little fanfare and marketing. Rather it seems to be a small stop on a much longer and more elegant journey. While its certainly a challenging sojourn, I’m confident that we have come to know it and the have developed the endurance to survive. 

In reflection, I’ve been to over 30 countries since we started. I’ve met thousands of people ranging from the bizarre to the saintly with a few notorious ones littered in between. The most remarkable thing so far has been experiencing the near unlimited excitement and youth regardless of where I went. 

The world really does seem like it’s ready for a new financial system. It’s hard to say if Cardano can get us there, yet we aren’t alone anymore. There’s now an army of some of the best throughout the world on this journey. Leaderless, inspired and brilliant, it’s an honor to be among them. I never believed I could be part of something like this movement. 

Thank you all for being part of Cardano. Thank you for your patience when we have fallen. Thank you for your support and kind words. Thank you for your dreams. Now let’s get back to the road ahead. I’ve come to know this place for the first time.",cryptocurrency

1. Minimum payments ($352) would get rid of the debt in around 60 months. It would also allow me to fully fund my Roth ($5500) and save an additional $3600 annually. 

2. My budget would allow for maximum payments of $1,100 per month and would get rid of the debt in 19 months. However I would not be contributing to my Roth or any additional savings.

3. A hybrid of the two options above. Say 57% debt payment ($630) 43% savings ($470). This would get rid of the debt in 33 months and still allow me to fully fund my Roth annually, with no additional savings.

Bitcoin,Is Segwit2x the real banker takeover?,"DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG.

Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:

http://dcg.co/who-we-are/

Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting:

Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Barry Silbert: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)

And then there's the ""Board Advisor,""

Lawrence H. Summers:

""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.

It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?

So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo.

(BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.)

""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/

So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:

""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""

Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions

So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already? 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value?

Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time?

It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem.

Also worth noting these two things, pointed out by /u/Adrian-x:

MasterCard made this statement before investing in DCG and Blockstream. (Very evident at 2:50 - enemy of digital cash watch the whole thing.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2mofrhw58

Blockstream is part of the DCG portfolio and the day after the the NYA Barry personal thanked Adam Back for his assistant in putting the agreement together. https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/867706595102388224

So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.

So, to recap:

DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank.

The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.

The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable.

Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then literally gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Did we just spend so much time fighting and bickering with core that we totally missed the REAL takeover of Bitcoin, happening right before our eyes, by the likes of currently serving Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board Members?

In my opinion, this really points to the cash fork being the real Bitcoin.

EDIT: I should clarify that it is not the 2x part only that I see as the takeover. I think somewhere my wording indicated I thought a block size increase part was bad, but that's not what I meant. Segwit2x is the trick that was used to get segwit on the chain, IMO, but the 2x part seems like the nail in the coffin, taking control of the protocol from Core, giving it right to bankers.

EDIT: Let's not forget that Blockstream is also beholden to the same investors, DCG.

personalfinance,"I've saved the majority of my income for almost two years, what should I do with it and other questions.","I am 24, and have saved up almost 100,000 in cash. I'm kinda paranoid about screwing something up moneywise, which is why I've put off investing it up to this point. I've looked at the sidebar topics and those have been helpful, but I still have some questions.

---

I recieved some inheritance when my grandfather passed away, which was mostly used to pay for my college. After graduation I got a job making $64,000 salary. I lived with my parents for about a year and a half while working, so I had almost no expenses for that time, which is where the bulk of my savings came from. A few months ago I moved out into an apartment with two friends, so now my savings rate will be slower. I fully own my car.


This is roughly my current budget. Post tax and retirement plan, I'm currently taking home about 3,400 a month. I'm spending about :

$460 rent

$15 internet

$50 electricity

$15 water

$40 phone plan

$40 gas

$250 food

$200-300 on various merchandise/entertainment

$60 auto insurance (my share still on parents plan)

(still on parents plan for health insurance)


Which leaves me currently saving about 2200 a month. Right now I plan to keep at least $20,000 in savings as an emegency fund.

---

I guess what I'm saving up most for is a home, but for right now I'm really happy where I am in the apartment with friends. Personally I would be happy in this current situation for several years, but obviously I can't know what all the future will bring for me and my roommates. I could see possible futures where I would be wanting to purchase a home sometime within the next few years. My biggest question is where should I be investing with this goal in mind. I've heard that CD's are good for short-medium term safe investments. Should I invest mainly in those? Should I get something else or go for some kind of mixed strategy? I believe I've heard before of longer term plans that allow you to borrow against yourself for home purchases, do those exist? The sidebar recommends getting an IRA so would that be a good place to start?

My work's retirement plan is run through Alight. The matching at my job maxes out at if I contribute 5% to the Before-Tax 401(k), they will match 4%. I am currently contributing 5% to the Before-Tax 401(k) and also 5% to the Roth 401(k) plans. I can also choose to invest in an After-Tax plan, but I am not right now. It currently reports the value of my investments at about $16,000. I've heard several good things about Roth plans, which is why I chose to invest in it along with the before tax plan, but I don't know if thats correct or not. Does it make sense to invest additonal amounts through my work savings account, or should I get an account somewhere else? Should I increase or decrease either of these percents? Is the after-tax plan worth thinking about?


For the work plan I have my Investment Strategy Elections set to 20% Fixed Income, 30% Large Cap Growth Index Fund, 40% Mid Cap U.S. Equity, and 10% Company Stock. I can also choose to invest in the Bond Index Fund, Balanced Index Fund, Large Cap Equity Index Fund, Large Cap Value Index Fund, Small Cap Equity Fund, or the International Equity Fund. Do these choices make any sense? I pretty much picked them through guesswork.

Until a few months ago I had all my cash in BB&amp;T until I learned there were much better options out there online. I moved about $70,000 into a Discover bank online account for now. I've been thinking about if I should be switching away from BB&amp;T entirely. I don't particularly feel very strongly about totally abandoning Brick-and-Mortar banks, aside from the interest rate BB&amp;T has treated me well enough and I like having them available for ATMs and if I need anything like a cashier's check or money order. Feel free to try to convince me to switch to another physical bank or an online one. But please dont recommend me anything where I need to make a certain number of transactions or other requirements to avoid fees, I can't trust myself to remember to keep up with those. One particular thing that does concern me though is cyber security, it would be nice to keep my money somewhere where it and my information will be safe.

I pulled my free credit report from http://www.annualcreditreport.com/ and everything on it is correct. The only credit card I have is a Discover it card, the one designed for students with no annual fee and 1% cash back. I put almost all of my purchases on it. I've had it for about a year and a half now. I have it set to autopay the full amount every month, never been late or paid any interest. Mint says my credit score is 700.


I've seen several places tell me that having more credit cards/ loans will improve my score. Should I try to get a new credit card? How many cards is a good amount to have a good score? I know applying for too many too quickly can hurt your score. I shop often at Amazon, should I apply for their card? I would like to have more than just the Discover card, since not 100% of places accept it.",finance
personalfinance,Finances coming out of college,"I'm a senior in college about to graduate with my Physics degree in May. I intend to apply for the Air Force Officer Training School to work with the Air Force as a Physicist. Pay will be roughly 32k a year, which is untaxed to the best of my knowledge. Housing and meals are provided on the base, so the majority of that is essentially disposable income. My goal at the moment is to begin paying back on student loans, at a rate of roughly 5k a year. I intend to put 15k up in savings per year so that I come out of the Military with 60k. That leaves me about 12k a year to pay towards whatever else I want. I intend to get a good computer built during the first year, maybe totaling around $3k. 9k then has to cover whenever I decide to splurge, the cost of a car, and the day-to-day costs of living. 

I have a few questions - first, is this a tenable financial plan? It's rough at the moment, rounding everything to the nearest thousand, because I don't have exact numbers. The cost of a computer, for instance, varies based on when I can build it. The cost of my loans I could have a concrete amount, but $5k is a good enough estimate for now since everything else is so rough. I'm mainly just unsure if there's anything else I should be trying to keep in mind going into this that I've neglected.

Second, does it negatively affect my credit if I decide to pay off my student loans early? Is the only benefit to doing so stopping the interest? For reference, the majority of my loans are Federal loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized, though I have some loans from Sallimae as well.

Third, when it comes to financing a car, I saw a recent LPT suggesting I got to a bank or credit union to finance the car instead of the dealership, which prompted me to realize I have no clue what I'm doing here, since I hadn't even thought of that. My goal is to buy a new car with a decent life expectancy and MPG (no clue what yet). My credit isn't bad - 709 as of August - and I'll have a finished degree by then. Any idea what to expect on an interest rate? Any suggestions on where to be looking for better loans? Or negotiating car prices? Honestly, while we're at it, car suggestions are welcome too.",finance
investing,"Are bailouts keeping interest rates lower than they should be considering current equity prices, unemployment rates, ect...?","I keep reading stories about hedge funders, private equity firms, etc,, buying distressed bonds and then suing, or even confiscating property from the bond issuers. There are also stories of government rules requiring municipalities to make good on coupon payments, etc... and then we have the US government that comes in to bail out various industries in distress to prevent systemic down stream contagion. 

When I was a kid I don't remember hearing much of any of this stuff. My family used to tell me that bonds were still risky, and that one day you get coupon payments and the next they might stop due to that company/govt entity going under. I recall hearing the only sure thing in the bond market is treasury payments. Now there are lots of other bonds considered sure things. 

With that being said, could this phenomenon be impacting bond prices/interest rates? And would we actually benefit if some bonds were allowed to become worthless to accurately price in risk for the entire market?",finance

B2X (S2X/NYA) is nothing more than an open attack on Bitcoin, not an ""upgrade"" as they want to sell it. This attack has no 'consensus', at all. It was ""agreed"" by a bunch of miners and corporations behind closed doors, with no community nor developers support.
Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the B2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin community is totally against this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

&gt; 
&gt; 
DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG. 

Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:

http://dcg.co/who-we-are/

Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting: 

**Glenn Hutchins**: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, **currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.**

**Barry Silbert**: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)

And then there's the ""Board Advisor,"" 

**Lawrence H. Summers:** 

""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

**Blythe Masters:**

Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the International Advisory Board of Santander Group, and Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters

Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.  

**It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?** 

So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo. 

(BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.) 

""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/

So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:

**""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**

Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions

So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. **What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already?** 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value? 

Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time? 

It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem. 

Also worth noting these two things, pointed out by /u/Adrian-x: 

1. MasterCard made this statement before investing in DCG and Blockstream. (Very evident at 2:50 - enemy of digital cash watch the whole thing.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2mofrhw58 


2. Blockstream is part of the DCG portfolio and the day after the the NYA Barry personal thanked Adam Back for his assistant in putting the agreement together. https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/867706595102388224


**So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.** 
 
So, to recap:

- DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank. 

- The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.

- The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable. 

- Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then **literally** gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 


**Did we just spend so much time fighting and bickering with core that we totally missed the REAL takeover of Bitcoin, happening right before our eyes, by the likes of currently serving Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board Members?**

And before you dismiss all those hard and documented facts as just a 'conspiracy theory', think about this:

Of course, who thought that the ones holding the centralized financial power today (famous for back-door shady plots to consolidate even more power and control), would sit on their hands and let Bitcoin just stroll in and easily take that power away from them?


So, it is not a crazy conspiracy theory, but more like the logical and expected thing to happen. Don't let it happen.

personalfinance,[Housing] US Mortgage question,"I am in the market for a home. As this sub suggests I will be putting down a sizable down payment. Aiming for anywhere between 25 to 35%. However, I will still need a mortgage to pay for the home.

The home is new construction: only 45% of the building is complete.

I have read articles [here](https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2014/06/questions_to_ask_when_buying_a_new_development) and [here](https://www.newhomesource.com/guide/articles/how-to-finance-a-condo) that indicate that it is possible to get a mortgage on new construction.

Assuming I get approval for the mortgage, when does the first mortgage payment become due? Reading between the lines of the articles above, it seems as though a bank would be wary or unwilling to lend money for something that's not built. That makes total sense; the reason interest rates on mortgages are lower than interest rates on credit card debt is collateral. (Well...that and _Marquette Nat'l Bank v. The First Omaha Bank of Nebraska_). But the flip side is also true: I (as the borrower) can't be expected to make payments on something that doesn't exist. 

So let's say the date of construction completion will be 2020. 

If I secure a mortgage now at a historical interest rate low, that first payment should be due in 2020 when there is an actual deed in which the bank can take a lien on. Is that right? Or am I crazy person?",finance

On the side I do some freelancing and that takes care of all of my expenses and provides me my spending money. 

I live with my parents so I have no rent to pay. I work close enough to home to come home to eat so I don't have very many dining expenses. 
I drive a 2013 Honda Civic that I pay $250.00 a month for. I still owe about 11,000 on the car(6.49% interest rate on a 18k loan). Insurance is bundled in with my parents so I don't have to pay insurance. 

In an emergency my parents would function as my emergency fund if things got really dire. However, although I'm new to the position, the job is pretty stable since I was personally brought in by the owner of the company. The company does offer benefits such as Medical and Dental but like above, it turned out to be cheaper to be bundled into my parent's plans. The company doesn't offer a 401k with a match though. 

I've been coming to this subreddit for about a month now just reading and gathering some information. Opened up a Mint account and started tracking everything a little closer. I also opened up an Ally Roth account, however I haven't deposited anything yet, I'm thinking of switching to a Vanguard Mutual fund since people recommend that quite often. 

Once I put the $5,500.00 into the Roth IRA account, I'll still be making $3,600.00 a month that I don't spend. Not entirely sure what to do with the extra money. 
I like the idea of saving for retirement. I also like the idea of being entrepreneurial and investing in some sort of small business, something that will generate some additional income. 
I'm just not sure what the best route is.

personalfinance,Travel insurance won't pay my fill US medical bills-- what to do?,"TL:DR I incurred about $50k in emergency medical bills in the US. My European travel insurance has paid $15k and says that's all they will pay. Providers are chasing my family and me for remainder of the bills. What do I do next?

(Trying to obscure some details so Big Insurance can't track me down)

I'm an American living in Europe for several years. My family is still in the US. When I was visiting, I had to have emergency surgery. I have fully paid up travel insurance (taken out in the country I live in) which specifically covers up to $1m in US medical treatment. I phoned before going to ER, described symptoms, they said go for it, it would be covered, send them the bills.

I tried to avoid giving my family address, but ER needed ID and they took it from my drivers licence. I gave ER and hospital my European address and full details of travel insurance.

Several months later, my family starts getting medical bills in dribs and drabs. $5k for imagining, $10k for anesthaeology, and so on. All different providers, no overall bill for surgery. I sent them to travel insurance, they said they were ""processing."" Start to get chased for nonpayment, I phone providers and say it's with insurance, they note it on the account and take it out of ""past due."" I chase travel insurance.

Repeat over a few months and several providers. I finally get one big statement from hospital group saying overall bill is about $50k, and $15k has been paid, so I owe the remaining $35k. I sent this to the travel insurance company, and they say they're paying. They costed the procedure based on Congressional Budget Office figures, added 50% to those, and paid. In their minds, they have paid ""reasonable"" claims. They wrote to the hospital saying:

""Please also note that the insurer substantially disputes the debt and that any debt established to be due will be paid by the insurer not the policyholder... should you or your client choose to bring a claim against the policyholder, it will be vigorously defended by us at our cost.""

They also told me:
""It would, in our view, be a clear breach of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for [the hospital to persue your family] and you would be able to report them to the Federal Trade Commission... we have discharged the debt but dispute the amount billed.""

But my family and I are still getting past due statements. I'm worried this could ruin my really good credit score in the US (want the option to move back in future), that it could hurt family at my permanent address, that I genuinely owe the money. Insurance reassures me  that providers will eventually back down, but I'm not convinced (seeing so many people go bankrupt from medical expenses tells me that they won't).

What do I do? If I raided my retirement account, I could probably just about pay this, if that's what's necessary. But it's frustrating because I paid for insurance to avoid doing just that, and intentionally got a policy that included a big chunk of US medical, just in case. 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!",finance
personalfinance,Best way to structure student loan payments? Help?,"28M, Finished grad school in May, I make ~$60,000, after taxes, bills, and other expenses I can contribute ~$2000 per month toward all 4 of my loans.

My question, is can I structure the payments differently to make advantage of their interest rates somehow?

Otherwise I was just going to pay $500 per each loan evenly. Given this payment method I could pay off my loans in 32 months/ 2.6 years.

personalfinance,Question on Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans and their grace period,"I graduated in May 2017 with my undergraduate degree.  I will be attending a three year graduate program beginning in  June 2018.  I took out 19,000 (interest rates ranging from 3.6%-4.6%) in Direct Subsized Stafford Loans for undergraduate, which are in an interest free 6 month grace period until November 2017.  

From reading online it's my understanding that I am only alloted one grace period for this type of loan, so when I am no longer at least a half time student for 180 days my loans will no longer be in their grace period.  Is this correct?

If that is correct, would it be possible/prudent for me to try to enroll in an online university full time right around the 180 day mark, then withdraw however quickly I need to to get a full refund from the online university?

That may all be more hassle than it is worth, even if it is an actual loophole.",finance

financialindependence,"Federal employee, unhappy with job. Stick it out for the pension or quit?","Hi all, a bit new to the FIRE community but currently assessing my options regarding whether I should stick out my current line of work for the stellar public-sector retirement benefits (which would help my FIRE plans immensely).


Right now I'm an engineer with the federal government - more specifically, with the State Department. I'm also in the Foreign Service, which means I'm fortunate enough to be covered under FSPS. Basically this means that if I stick around until I turn 50, I'll get a full pension (~34% of my high-3, which would probably be ~$50k/year in today's dollars) + retiree health benefits (+ SS supplemental, although I'm assuming that'll go away soon).


Sounds great, right? The problem is that I think I'm burning out on the Foreign Service lifestyle. Part of that is the frequent moves which have started to go from exciting to exhausting (you're changing jobs AND moving every couple of years), not to mention the lack of support for spousal careers. I've managed to mitigate this by staying state-side (DC area) for the past few years, but I won't be able to do that forever - I'm allotted six years max before I have to either move overseas again or quit. My current assignment is probably not helping - I'm traveling internationally 50%+, usually on very short notice. It's lucrative (I get tons of overtime) but it's also tiring and very hard to get other things in my life done when I'm on the road that much.


My original escape plan was to just find a regular non-Foreign Service federal job; I would have to switch to FERS which bumps my retirement eligibility out several years but would otherwise allow me to keep my existing benefits. Unfortunately I've been trying this route for over a year now with no luck. As those who have worked in the Federal Government are probably aware, USAJobs is pretty much just a black hole, and there's not really a shortcut around it (I'm also excepted service, which makes things harder - no competitive status to lean on). The current administration has not helped either - federal opportunities (including internal hires) have seriously dried up since January. 


Any thoughts? My family has suggested sticking it out a bit longer, maybe till the next administration if I can find a way to do it. I've considered going the contractor route, I could probably get a match or very slight bump on salary but would lose a lot else (that sweet pension obviously, but I also lose job stability + all the other fed benefits). I know money's not everything, but that pension is a lot of cash to walk away from.


FWIW I've been in 7 years so I still have 13 years till I'm eligible to retire. Also my wife and I are DINKs in our late 30s, no debt other than a mortgage, currently have ~$250k in retirement savings between the two of us (we were a bit behind on 401k savings, but are now maxing out our accounts). The wife is on board with FIRE, although we're not looking to retire super-early (50s most likely - I'm more interested in the FI side of FIRE).",finance

personalfinance,How to avoid 401k early withdrawal pitfalls?,"Some background available in the weekday help thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/73snd4/weekday_help_thread_for_the_week_of_october_02/dnvj368/

Hi everyone, I see a lot of threads regarding 401k early withdrawals and need help with this topic personally.

I'm 30 with wife and two small children, recently suffered a stroke. I ended up having to leave my well paying stressful job. Due to physical and cognivitive short term impairments while going through rehab I find myself only able to work part time making significantly less money. I need to cover at least 6 months of our rent while I work on getting back to somewhat normal. I have a 401k from a previous employer I rediscovered with roughly $42k sitting in it.
All advice is always don't touch this, it isn't a piggy bank! But alas I don't see many options right now. There's the 10% penalty. What I need to know is if I withdraw this money, how will it hurt me in tax season? Can withdrawing it actually put me in a worse debt with the IRS come tax season? I need $6k to cover the next few months rent before I can begin working full time again. Federal tax rate is 25%, state (IL) is 5%. 

I realized through fidelity the minimum withholding is set to 20% but can be adjusted. What would I need to adjust it to to avoid getting in a terrible situation come tax season?

I need to pull this money by tomorrow, I've put this off for a few weeks out of fear.

If more specifics are needed, I'd be happy to divulge.
Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Heads-up: Equifax free credit report for initial fraud alert includes arbitration clause (but you can opt out within 30 days),"I went to get my free credit report from Equifax after placing an initial fraud alert a few weeks back.  After scrolling through the endless user agreement, I noticed that it once again includes a binding arbitration clause with an opt-out option. Make sure you opt out! (Note: this may be moot if the new CFPB rule against mandatory arbitration stands, but better safe than sorry!)

It also says that if you've opted out before, you don't need to do so again, but there aren't any specifics on under what conditions.

Here's the relevant text:

35.	AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION PROVIDES THAT EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR THAT REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND MAY LIMIT YOUR RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL. IT FURTHER PROVIDES THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT, NOR WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BRING ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE PART OF ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE.

Binding Arbitration. Either You or Equifax may, without the other’s consent, elect mandatory, binding arbitration of any Claim (as defined below) raised by either You or Equifax against the other. As used in this arbitration provision, the term ""Claim"" or ""Claims"" means any claim, dispute, or controversy between You and Us regarding any aspect of Your relationship with Equifax, including but not limited to any Claim arising from these Terms of Use or arising from Your use of the Products or this Site or any information You receive from Us, whether based on contract, statute, common law, regulation, ordinance, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory regardless of what remedy is sought. Additionally, for purposes of this arbitration provision ""Equifax"" or ""Us"" will include Equifax's Suppliers, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, and any third party providing products, services, or benefits in connection with a Product provided to You. The term ""Claim"" shall have the broadest possible construction. If You or We elect arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted as an individual arbitration. Neither You nor We consent or agree to any arbitration on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed with arbitration on a class or representative basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. This arbitration provision applies to and includes any Claims made and remedies sought as part of any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action. By consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed. As an exception to the arbitration provision, You retain the right to pursue in small claims court any Claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceed on an individual basis. 

**Right to Opt-Out of this Arbitration Provision.  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE YOURSELF. Opting out of the arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Equifax or the delivery of Products to You by Equifax. In order to exclude Yourself from the arbitration provision, You must notify Equifax in writing within 30 days of the date that You first accept these Terms of Use on the Site (for Products purchased from Equifax on the Site). If You purchased Your Product other than on the Site, and thus these Terms of Use were mailed, emailed or otherwise delivered to You, then You must notify Equifax in writing within 30 days of the date that You receive the Terms of Use. You may opt-out by writing to Equifax Consumer Services LLC, Attn.: Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 105496, Atlanta, GA 30348. Your written notification to Equifax must include Your name, address, and Equifax User ID, as well as a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Equifax through arbitration. If You have previously notified Equifax that You wish to opt-out of arbitration, You are not required to do so again. Any opt-out received after the opt-out deadline set forth above will not be valid and You must pursue your Claim in arbitration or small claims court.**

Initiation of Arbitration. The party filing a Claim in arbitration must select either the National Arbitration Forum (""NAF"") or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") to administer the arbitration. The arbitration organization that is selected will apply its rules, codes, or procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is filed, unless any portion of those rules, codes, or procedures is inconsistent with any specific terms of this arbitration provision or these Terms of Use, in which case the terms of this arbitration provision and these Terms of Use will govern. These rules and procedures may limit the amount of discovery available to You or Us. Rules and forms may be obtained from and any Claims filed with, either: (1) National Arbitration Forum, P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55405, www.arb-forum.com (2) American Arbitration Association, 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, New York 10017, www.adr.org Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, including the applicable statute of limitations, and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator will have the power to award to a party any damages provided for under applicable law, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. This agreement to arbitrate involves interstate commerce and is made pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-16 (the ""FAA""). Any claim or dispute as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision's restrictions on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or class wide arbitration shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator, and shall be brought only in a United States District Court located in Atlanta, Georgia, or in any court within the Georgia State or Superior Court System located in Fulton County, Georgia. 

Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. In the event You file a Claim in arbitration in accordance with these provisions, We will advance all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs if You ask that We do so, in writing, prior to the commencement of the arbitration. The payment of any such fees will be made directly by Us to the arbitration administrator selected by You pursuant to this arbitration provision. Such requests should be mailed to Equifax Consumer Services LLC, Attn: Request for Payment of Arbitration Filing Fees, P.O. Box 105496, Atlanta, GA 30348. If Equifax prevails in the arbitration, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to require that You reimburse Equifax for the fees and costs advanced, but only to the extent such fees and costs would be recoverable in a judicial action. If You prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Us, then You will not be required to reimburse Us for any fees you paid to the arbitration organization in connection with the arbitration. You are responsible for all other fees and costs You incur in the arbitration, including attorney's fees and expert witness fees, except that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party; (i) based on applicable law; (ii) under the rules of the arbitration administrator; or (iii) if the arbitrator rules in Your favor and the arbitrator expressly determines that there is a good reason for requiring Us to pay those fees and costs.  

Continuation. This arbitration provision shall survive: (i) the termination or changes in the Terms of Use or the relationship between You and Us, including but not limited to the purchase of a new or additional Product by You; and (ii) the termination or changes in Our providing any Product(s) to You.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for suggestions to secure my family’s financial future. (~$100K to allocate, earning ~$50K/yr after taxes)","Edit: TL;DR - wall of text explaining my current finances, also asking if it’s the right time to enter the housing market (and how I might protect myself if I do so). I’m very cash-heavy and looking for ideas to diversify and grow into retirement, while ensuring my wife and kid are taken care of as well.

I realize there are many different options for how to save and plan for retirement. I think I’ll be just fine, but I also recognize that I have a lot of room for improvement. More than my own personal security, I want to provide as much as possible for my wife and child, both of whom I expect to outlive me by many years.

Now, I would never share this kind of detail with someone who knows who I am irl, hence the throwaway. As far as non-immediate family and acquaintances know, I’m living paycheck to paycheck, and I’d like to keep it that way.

Some background information about me:

I’m 35 years old, serving on active duty in the US military, and I’ve been in for a little over 12 years. I’ll be eligible to retire in about 8 years, and a rough conservative estimate is that I’ll receive about $2,000/month retirement pay starting in my early-mid 40s. The plan is to continue working after I separate until, well... until I’m ready to stop. Who knows when I’ll feel too old to work? 55? 65? 85???

The idea is to have the financial freedom to “officially” retire when I’m ready to so, no sooner and no later. 

I’m married and I have one kiddo.

The wife makes a pretty decent paycheck atm, but she’ll soon be looking for work when we relocate to our next assignment. She has about $15K saved up right now.

I transferred my Post-911 GI bill to the kid to help offset the cost of college, and because Uncle Sam already so generously paid for my own education while I’ve been on active duty. It would be a waste to use the Bill for myself. Still, I’d like to set aside at least enough to match it or fill the gap up to a Doctorate (just in case the kid wants to pursue that level of education- no pressure lol). The GI Bill should cover a substantial part of the first 3 years, beginning sometime around the year 2030, but I could potentially be paying as much as half of the cost of a 4-year degree, and likely most of any education beyond that. Student loans aren’t all bad, but if I can put my kid through college without having to take out a loan, that would be fantastic.

So here’s where my finances sit right now:

I’ve calculated my compensations for the next year, and a conservative post-taxes estimate is that I’ll bring home about $50K. I don’t expect that figure to change whole lot over the next 4 years at least. I’m sure my wife will find gainful employment again after we move, but I don’t have enough information to forecast what her earnings will be, so I’ll simply leave it out for now.

I’ve done a lot of research into the cost of living at our next assignment, and I keep pretty solid records of spending. Based on our current expenses, and a conservative adjustment accounting fo the location change. I expect to reliably save an average of $1,800 per month out of my paycheck. That’s about a 40% decrease in annual savings compared to the last 2 years, during which time I received some special pay and a bonus.

My family budget plan for 2018 allows for about $29K in expenses total, which sounds tight for 2 adults and a child (and it is tight), but I also know it’s easily doable. I’ll adjust that target as we settle into the new place over the next several months, and go from there.

Whatever the wife is able to earn after we move, can go straight to the bottom line. I hesitate to forecast my capital gains from investments based on past performance, because it really has been an exceptional few years. Besides, I have yet to ever withdraw from my brokerage account. All dividends and gains from closing positions has gone right back into the pot.

Investments:

I have $46K in my brokerage account. Roughly 50/50 cash and stocks (individual stocks and ETFs/ETNs etc). Here’s my current portfolio if anyone cares: MO, AAPL, WFC, AMD, BND, IAU, WMT, ARNC, SPY, XIV- roughly equal parts for all of those. They’re a mixture of speculative short-term and div-yielding long-term holds. The half I have sitting in cash is so I can quickly sell calls/average-down/BTFD whenever the next market correction/crash/recession comes. I’m adding about $1K/month to this account via automatic deposit, which I typically split between cost-price-averaging into my longs, and into my cash reserve. I balance my holdings mostly by adding to underperforming positions when I expect a rebound, and not by selling stock unless I’ve held the shares for more than a year. I also try to keep my cash balance roughly equal to the market value of my stocks for the reasons mentioned above (and so I can act if I see an opportunity for a nice swing trade).

I have a little over $20K in an interest-earning checking/debit account. This is where the majority of my paycheck lands, and it’s where the majority of my bills come out.

I have $15K in USD hard cash. That’s more than I need, to be sure. It’s mostly leftovers from when I sold one car and bought another. I’ll eventually deposit it into a bank I suppose lol.

I also have $11K in another checking account which I feed through a credit card, paying the balance off monthly. I’ve been using the credit card to buy gas and pay for other travel expenses. I don’t need a cc to do that, but it’s an easy way to build up my credit score and it helps whenever I need to rent a car or something.

Then there’s the $6K sitting in a credit union Roth IRA I opened and sort of forgot about. It barely earns interest at all and I can’t for the life of me figure out how to use it.

I own exactly *1* BTC I bought on a whim this summer. It’s hard for me to watch, because it moves around so much in value. Worth about $4.5K today. Other assets I can think of off the top of my head:

~ $4K in physical gold/silver. I guess it’s my hedge against society collapse or whatever lol. I have one of those 50g combi-bars that can be broken into smaller ingots and then a bunch of 1oz silver coins.

~ $2K in various foreign currencies, mostly Sterling. This was left over from when I spent some time in the UK pre-brexit vote. I’m sort of bag-holding it until I can exchange it back to USD for less of a loss.

On top of that, I have exactly zero debt. If I were forced to liquidate all of my assets not mentioned above, I’m confident I could come up with another ~ $40K (That’s if you figure a &gt;50% emergency sale depreciation... I have 4 cars, 3 of which would be considered collector’s items and about another $15K in Snap-on tools + all the other random shit I own)

I realize my money allocations don’t make a lot of sense right now, but I’m an aggressive saver and the cash tends to pile up quickly. That’s a nice problem to have I guess.

One concern I have, is seeing my un-invested money take a big hit from inflation. I’m also a little worried about my bullish stock portfolio, but my plan is to build/hold it for another 15 years or so, and then slowly increase my exposure to bonds as I get into my 40s and 50s. Assuming I can stick to my long-term investing strategy, I’m hoping to be able to ride out any major correction or recession.

A major goal of mine is to buy a house. Thanks to the military lifestyle living overseas and frequent relocations though, I haven’t really been in a position to do so. Soon I’ll be moving to a stateside base, but looking at the housing market there, I’m frankly scared to buy right now. Houses in the local area have nearly doubled in just a few years, and I’d rather not spend the next 2 decades upside down in a mortgage if things suddenly take a turn for the worse. The valuations just don’t make sense to me compared with the rental market, and I suspect many of the land owners are deeply indebted in a market that feels pretty hot imo.

So there you have it. My personal finances in a nutshell. Not that I’m in financial trouble or anything, but I would love to hear any suggestions or pointers you smarties might have to offer.

I suppose some specific questions might include:

- How would you rate my stock portfolio and strategy? Are there any big glaring red flags? Am I being too aggressive by having nearly 20% of my net worth invested in those symbols? Am I not being aggressive enough?

- Am I being overly paranoid about entering today’s housing market? If not, what are some ways I can hedge against a market value decline without literally shorting the market and getting slammed with fees and commissions. Aside from a potential drawdown in property values, should I be more concerned with rising interest rates? How much might one type of loss cancel the other out? Should I buy now to get a better interest rate, or wait for a “dip” that might not come for a very long time?

To recap my holdings:

- brokerage
$24K invested
$22K dry powder

- liquid
$67K

- metals/BTC/forex
$10K

- personal property
$40K

- home equity
$0

- debt

- annual net income 
$50K

- projected monthly savings

personalfinance,"i got suckered by a loan shark, interest rate too high. advice please","about 5 months ago i was having an emergency and out of desperation i took out a loan of 2,600 from loanme.com

it was also a time where there was a potential that in the next couple months i would have a breakthrough on a project and but even so i thought that breakthrough or not i wouldn't have a problem paying off the loan. 

well, the breakthrough didn't happen and other things did, i didn't ended up not making enough money to pay off the loan and instead have been making monthly
payments but the interest rate is 135%, 
my balance just keeps on rising.

i've already paid about 1,700 since 5 months ago and my balance is basically higher than the loan i got. 

i'm a struggling self employed 24 year old. my parent is unable to help and no siblings, i rent the cheapest room i can find in my city. i've always lived in a sort of bubble trying my best to get through hoping one of my projects pan out but this debt is stressing so much i barely have any mind left these days. 

every 1st of the month they take the money from my bank account and if i don't have any money, they try to take it anyways, then i get charged overdraft fees from my bank and from them because their charge gets denied unless i put in the money right away

im not aware of any resources available or good ideas to deal with this, so i really appreciate the good will of anyone here willing to lend me some wisdom and knowledge",finance

gaming,Star Wars Battlefront 2 P2W (Long post),"Hi all

I just wanted to talk about BF2's P2W system. So, Battlefront 2 is using micro transaction star cards. Each character, reinforcement and ship has it's own loadouts. As of the beta, each character has 3 Star Card slots that can be utilised. The last two slots must be unlocked through leveling up the class.

However - classes level up based on how many cards you have, and how many you craft. This means, buying crates means you level up your class quicker, so you unlock star card slots quicker.

But hey, that doesn't mean the star cards are gonna affect game play, does it? Wrong. Lets take some examples.

Boba Fett:
Using crafting parts obtained from lootboxes, the star card 'Intense Barrage' can be crafted for 40 points. This will level up Boba by 1 level for the lowest tier. This now means I have access to a Star Card that makes Boba Fett shoot rockets at a 30% faster speed.

Imagine I had opened many lootboxes, crafted my way up to Tier 4 or had outirght found that card in a box. I now have up to 70 PERCENT faster rocket firing. That is an advantage accelerated by purchasing boxes. EA call this 'Accelerated Rewards'. This IS P2W.

This star card system applies to all classes in BF2. Meaning, this has a knock on effect in all aspects of the game. 

This SHOULD NOT be in a AAA title, costing £54.99 on Origin for the standard edition of the game. And you might say, 'yeah, but there's no paid DLC, they need to monotize the game for the free DLC.' 

If they really need to do this after selling a game to you at full price, then it should be purely cosmetic. No game play altering effects. I'm talking about:

Legion markings (501st, 212th, etc.)
Decorative changes to infantry (Tally markings for clones, visors, accessories like bandoleers and pauldrons.)
Skins for HEROES

DICE, Criterion and Motive have really built a fun game by the looks of the Beta.
We need to raise our voices on this shit. At the moment the Gaming Industry is taking advantage of gamers. Using scummy tactics to maximise their profits, and I for one am fed up with being treated like this.",technology
personalfinance,"29F working FT on $83K salary, student loan living in expensive, sunny Sydney","Hi there!

First off, love this subreddit and think it's awesome that so many people are willing to provide helpful tips to people who are struggling financially or are just looking for some direction on how to manage their expenses. 


I'm hoping I could get some guidance on how to manage my finances and wipe out my credit card debt, as it's causing quite a bit of stress in the background. 


I live in Sydney which is one of the world's most expensive cities for rent, and although I have a decent salary it doesn't translate to much due to the high cost of living.


Here are my vital stats:

**INCOME:**

* Salary of $83,000 before tax. 
I pay around 30% tax which includes my university loan repayment. Weekly salary is $1100 after tax.


**WHAT I OWE/REPAY:**

* University loan - currently at around $26,547
* Credit Card debt - $8,000, interest rate of 13% P/A
* Rent - $290 P/W
* Phone - $32.50 P/W (locked into contract until Apr 18)
* Gas/Water/Internet - $50 P/W
* Public transport - $45 P/W (on average)
* Private health insurance - $22 P/W (thinking of canning this, not getting much value at all.)



My issue is, when I pay off my credit card in huge chunks, I usually end up coming short at the end of the month and have to pay for things with my credit card anyway. Additionally, groceries in Sydney are really expensive (as are bills!)



As a single woman cooking for herself, going out to buy beans + rice and cereal to eat for 3 meals might amount to the same cost as eating out at a cheap restaurant (and save me the meal prep time.) Alcohol here also isn't cheap and everything is highly taxed.

I really want to scrap this $8k of credit card debt ASAP because I'd like to be able to save and possibly make a career change. In my industry it's high stress with long hours and I'd love to work in a career which is focussed on helping others instead of working for demanding clients on banner advertising. I feel trapped and would love to plan for the future, but feel I can't make any movements until I get my finances in order. I've applied for other credit cards with balance transfer offers, but I'm always rejected. I've done a credit check and my credit score is 'Good' (which is average).

If anyone could provide some help, or even share their experiences about how they managed to escape from debt would be greatly appreciated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"An Open Letter to the Neo team, Da Hongfei and City of Zion","Hi everyone! Before we begin, this is a long post and I will like to thank everyone who is gracious enough to spend their time and effort in reading. I am writing an open letter to the Neo team, Neo CEO Da Hongfei and the Neo Community team City of Zion in the hopes that they can consider a burning idea that came up in my mind.


Firstly, to introduce myself, I am a huge fan of Neo (hence the nickname). I came to know about Antshares earlier this June and has been following the coin ever since. I believe that Neo has huge potential in bettering people’s lives. However, I also think that the technology is currently some distance away from being able to do that. In the cryptocurrency world where days and weeks feel like months and years, I believe that speed is of the essence and that coins with a first mover advantage in their respective fields will have a distinct advantage over the rest of their competition.


As such, I believe that at status quo, Ethereum, instead of Neo, is poised to become a world leader in terms of smart contracts. Already, they are coming up with the Metropolis and Byzantium updates to their system, and it is not difficult to see that they will continue to upgrade themselves as time goes. With the backing of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/members/)(EEA), the trajectory of their growth looks to outpace that of Neo. The debate on whether both Ethereum and Neo can co-exist in this space is one that we will save for another day. Instead, what I am about to propose is, in my opinion, a possible strategic collaboration that will quicken the pace of Neo, expand its resources and put them on equal footing with Ethereum.


As we all know, Neo is working towards the vision of a Smart Economy, where Digital Assets meet Digital Identities and Smart Contracts. Taken from the [Neo website](https://neo.org):

&gt; “In this new Smart Economy, a paradigm shift from the “Internet of Information” to an “Internet of Value” is taking place. This will allow for seamless integration of the traditional economy and digital economy, facilitating the free flow of all assets. Exchange of value and economic activities are provided in a trustless mode. The rules, policies, and organizations of traditional society will be rightfully transparent and fair. This is an “Internet of Order” and the ultimate goal of Neo Smart Economy.”

It’s a compelling vision. However, the downside that I foresee is that the goal, being a very tall order, will take a long time to achieve, in which case by then Neo may be displaced by new ideas or technologies. Progress as a lone wolf is tough and lonely. However, progress as a group will bring about much more efficiency through delegation, specialization and leverage. This brings about my next point: Partnerships.


As far as I know, Neo already has several partnerships ongoing / underway: Bancor, Coindash, Agrello, Elastos and Red Pulse, which only just very recently concluded a [hugely successful ICO](https://neonewstoday.com/general/red-pulse-successfully-reach-ico-target/) (also having the honour of being the first ICO hosted on the Neo blockchain). However, I believe many will agree with me that these partnerships do not even come close to the level of the EEA of Ethereum. This is where I want to introduce a very interesting blockchain project that I have come across recently: [ChainLink.](https://link.smartcontract.com/)

The ChainLink Network is a fully decentralised blockchain middleware that provides Smart Contracts with data, bank payments and access to APIs (Application Programming Interface). I am unable to explain their tech very well, so for the more gifted, tech savvy redditors, please feel free to add or correct anything that I have to say. As far as I understand, ChainLink is trying to solve the problem where Smart Contracts are unable to connect with key external resources like off-chain data and APIs. These external resources are information and data that we currently receive in our everyday lives, for example, weather forecasts, traffic conditions or even football match results.


So let’s say there is a Smart Contract deployed on the Neo blockchain to, for example, retract your clothes hangers when it rains. In order to execute correctly, it will require external data in the form of the weather forecast in the local area. Instead of coming up with ways to do it all on their own on the Neo blockchain, developers can instead choose to employ ChainLink to access this external data, saving time and effort, as well as using much more reliable information than they will be able to source on their own. Currently, from their website, people are able to create [ChainLinks](https://create.smartcontract.com/#/choose) on Ethereum, Town Crier and Bitcoin.


So, why will ChainLink want to work with Neo if they are already working with the Ethereum blockchain? Unfortunately, I am not affiliated to ChainLink in any way, and this will not be a question that I will be able to answer. All I am proposing is for Neo / Da Hongfei to look into a possible partnership, in which I have no concrete answers for. However, I do know of possible reasons in which the different organisations might want to come and work together with each other.


Firstly, take a look at this: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/911244079660359680


This was Vitalik dissing ChainLink openly on twitter. Now, if my company runs Oracle networks and someone high profile comes out to purposefully non-endorse my product and say that my company is not even worth $32m (implied meaning), I will be pretty pissed off. I don’t know about you, but last I checked CEOs are humans.


Secondly, ChainLink is a fairly new ICO and it will do well to form strong partnerships with other relevant parties, and Neo’s position as a frontrunner in China as well as its reputation (for good or for bad) as China’s Ethereum will definitely shore up its credibility to prospective partners and investors.


Thirdly, from the ChainLink website, you can see that they are proud to be working with SWIFT on their own SWIFT Smart Oracle. Why is this important? SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) has long held a monopoly for interbank payments, but its position is starting to get threatened by newcomer Ripple (XRP). In fact, SWIFT is holding its annual SIBOS conference on the 16-19th of October later this month, and Ripple has decided to gatecrash the party by holding its own conference called [SWELL](https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/ripple-establishes-swell-conference-to-compete-with-sibos/), on the 16-18th of October. It is common knowledge that Ripple seems to have superior technology versus SWIFT, and if SWIFT wants to maintain its power and position, it will definitely need to start getting into the blockchain arena. Take a look for yourself, the [SIBOS program list](https://www.sibos.com/conference/conference-programme) consists of an item in which SmartContract.com (ChainLink) will be presenting a live demo of a Proof of Concept.


Now, whats in it for Neo? If Neo manages to get into close collaboration with ChainLink, it will have access to technology that speeds up its game exponentially. By outsourcing the channel that receives external, off-chain, real time data, they will be able to focus their time, energy and money on other strategic areas. SWIFT works with over 11,000 banks, and in the event that ChainLink becomes a partner of SWIFT, Neo becoming a partner with ChainLink will indirectly make them partners of SWIFT as well. Now, let me remind you what Neo is [up against](https://entethalliance.org/members/).


In summary, a Neo – ChainLink – SWIFT partnership will be a win / win / win situation for all parties involved. It tilts the balance of Neo vs ETH, as well as SWIFT vs Ripple. In case you are wondering why SWIFT will want to partner up with blockchain companies that are a fraction of its own size, look up Ripple’s SWELL conference and you will see that former US Federal Reserve System chairman Ben Bernanke, as well as the freaking inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners are both going to be there as keynote speakers. They need blockchain just as much as blockchain needs partnerships and resources. I like to think of Neo’s Smart Contracts as cars while ChainLink serves as the road for the cars. Imagine driving cars without roads, will we still want to travel around in cars? You get the point.


Please upvote this thread, comment and share this post as much as you can. All I want is for Neo / Da Hongfei / City of Zion to just consider the possibilities of collaboration with ChainLink. I am very excited for the world moving forward, and I just hope to make a small contribution to the world by casting this little seed of possibility in the great minds of the leading thinkers of blockchain.


TLDR – Upvote this thread and spread the love and get Da Hongfei to notice this post &lt;3",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"23(M) Car was repossessed, now I need to know if, I’m my situation, I should file for bankruptcy?","Thanks for reading this. 


December 2015 I bought a brand new 2016 Mazda 3 Sport with a 70 month term at a 12.3% interest rate. My payments were 450 a month. At the time I was excited to have a functional car as I had just upgraded from a beater. I had no credit history at the time, so my girlfriend offered to co-sign for me. I know, multiple personal finance felonies have already been committed, but keep reading please. Somehow, at 21 I was able to keep up with these insane payments and my equally expensive full coverage car insurance.  Fast forward to February 2017, my girlfriend quits her job due to conflicts with her boss for not being able to take time off as she requested. That’s a different story. Anyway, I work in the service industry so I decide to work more hours to cover the gap. It didn’t work out as planned and I haven’t paid a car payment since May 2017. I tried to focus our apartment rent and other vital bills. Another lapse in judgement, I know.

Well, I recently found a second job that pays considerably more and so now I work two jobs, and my girlfriend also recently found a job and has now started working there. With my two jobs combined I take home around 3500-4000, monthly, depending on hours and tips. With our expenses and everything I still think that I would be able, now, to keep up with my car payments. 

Well I finally have enough money to start paying my late car payments, but when I try to I am told that my account is frozen and that my car is in repo status. That night my car is repossessed.

To reinstate my loan my fee is around 3,300.  Side note, I also lapsed my car insurance during this time and my creditor purchased insurance and added that to my loan. That policy was also around 3,000. This money is now due in 8 days. And well, I don’t have that much money.

I tried to apply for a personal loan to cover my reinstatement fee plus some additional for the storage fees I would be charged by the repo guys. I was denied credit at two separate banks/credit unions. With a score like mine I didn’t think I would get approved anyway. 

Now I am in a situation where I am trying to decide if I need to file for bankruptcy. I never should have signed that loan in hindsight but here I am. If I do manage to come up with the fee to reinstate my loan then I’m still paying for a car that I can’t afford unless the conditions are right, but if I file for bankruptcy I don’t really know what it’ll do to my credit and my girlfriends credit. 



I’ve seen other posts similar to mine and there is a constant tone of “well what did you expect was gonna happen, you dummy?”

I had that discussion with my family and now I just want to know what the best course of action for me should be. 

I’m considering asking friends and family to loan me money to reinstate. I’m considering a deal with my family to lend me another car for free, but it doesn’t really solve the issue of what to do with my current loan. I’m considering getting with a financial advisor to file bankruptcy. I just want to do what’s best for myself and my girlfriend because I want her to be affected the least amount as possible.

personalfinance,How to prioritize mortgage debt on rental property?,"Someone please help me get my head around this particular question. I have a variety of debts, the highest interest of which are a mortgage on a second rented property at 5.0% and student loans at 3.7%. The obvious knee-jerk strategy is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first, however because the interest on the rental property is basically a deductible business expense, paying down the mortgage produces a ""return"" in the form of taxable personal income on my schedule E, which is taxed at my marginal rate of give or take 45%. so in my mind return of paying off this mortgage with post-tax earnings and then being taxed again on the rental income generated by reducing the interest on the loan is really more like a return of 2.6%. At that assumed rate, this would prioritize the debt below my primary residence mortgage and auto loans. Is there some really obvious way that I'm thinking about this wrong, or is my reasoning basically correct and I should throw money at my student loans first? Side notes, I have a more than ample emergency fund and all tax advantaged everything possible for me is maxed out. As an added twist I will almost certainly pay AMT which makes this calculation more complicated. Thanks in advance for advice.",finance

This one time lump sum was put on a Direct Express debit card which makes me very nervous.","FYI, I am using a throwaway to ask my question. I am probably providing too much information but it explains why opening a new bank account may not be easy or prudent at the moment.

I do not currently have a bank account. My Credit Union account was locked over a year ago even though I was still paying off my credit card on time. I remember getting a letter from the bank saying that a lien (?) or something similar, had been placed against my account. The best that I could figure is that it was for a year of back taxes that I owed before my house was foreclosed. That is the last that I heard about it. No letters from a lawyer or my local or state gov't arrived.

Fast forward a year and I am awarded monthly SSDI payments and back pay, all on a debit card.

I went to talk to someone at a new bank and they scared the crap out of me. They tell me that the Fed Gov't can swoop in at anytime and just remove my money from a bank account if I owe $$ on Fed Student Loans (I do) AND (???) from my debit card. 

What I have done in the last month:

1) Started the [Total and Permanent Discharge process for my student loans](https://www.disabilitydischarge.com/tpd-101) which is supposed to freeze any collections attempts for 3 months. If you are not approved all bets are off after 3 months.

2) Called my old credit union who said that they have no idea what I am talking about when I bring up the lien. They said that I had stopped paying my credit card **which I contend is not true**. Anyway, a collection agency now owns the CC debt so they don't care. 

3) I searched my county government website for court cases/back taxes in my name and there is nothing. Zilch.

Any advice as to how I should safeguard my money? Get it off the debit card and put it where? There are many articles in the NYT and elsewhere saying that the Fed Gov't is not honoring their promise to not garnish student loan/SSI/SSDI payments.

personalfinance,"Very high debt, but good income and payment history. Where can I get a personal loan to lower interest rate?","Hello, my partner and I have quite a bit of debt - much of which is credit card debt - and the high interest rates are killing our ability to pay it off. 

Shared:
$26,500 in credit card debt

Me:
$3,000 in additional credit card debt
$11,000 in student loan debt

Her:
$15,000 in additional credit card debt
$45,000 in student loan debt

According to CreditKarma, my score is 638 (TransUnion) or 636 (Equifax). I have a 98% payment history and 80% credit usage. Her score is 607 (both TransUnion and Equifax), with a 100% payment history and 69% credit usage.

Obviously this large amount of debt is bad, but we do have a combined household income of about $110,000 and can make all minimum payments (a total of $1,309/mo for the credit cards) along with an extra $500 or so. (We live in the Chicago area and cost of living is high.) The problem is the high balances combine with high credit card interest rates so that the extra money we're putting towards paying off debt barely goes beyond just covering interest.

My question for you, reddit, is what options may exist for loans with lower interest rates that we could transfer some (or all?) of our credit card debt to. I should also mention that we do not own a home, but with our income and good payment history I think this is a win/win situation for anyone willing to give us a loan. But, I also know most organizations these days basically just have an algorithm that looks at the debt level and automatically makes a decision.

So, any advice? (But please leave your shaming comments to yourself - it's not like we don't know having this much debt is bad.)",finance

financialindependence,25M UK - Need advice on how much to invest,"I’m 25 single male and live in a LCOL area of the UK (one of the large Northern cities) on a salary of £42,200 (c. $55.7k). I contribute 8% of my salary into a pension which work then match with an additional 12.4%. This means each month I am contributing to a tax deferred pension account (similar to 401k) c£710 (20% of my salary - £8.5k per year).

I also have an investment property in another city approximately an hour away where I used to live until I moved for a new job. After tax, mortgage costs, and setting aside money for repairs I earn about £200 profit net per month from this. I have c£30-40k of equity in it and am not looking to sell.

Combining this with my salary means I receive approximately £2,600 net of tax a month of which I save £1,300. When you include my pension contributions it totals £2k per month.

I have approximately £20k in cash and £10.5k in stocks in my pension (in vanguard trackers atm). I have such a large level of cash because until a few months ago I was planning on buying a second property in the city I just moved to. However I am no longer sure I wish to stay here long term – for example in c. 15months I am contemplating transferring my job back to my old city and moving back into my flat (this will be possible – I moved city to start a specialist area however once in it is quite easy to transfer back to my old city in the same role).

Unfortunately due to recent UK tax changes, buying a second property in my current city is not necessarily a good idea because converting it to another BTL (if I decided to leave in 15 months) would not be that profitable.

Therefore I have decided that in 15 months I will either:

1) Move back to my old city. It has slightly better exit opportunities for my career and I own an amazing flat that I love there

2) Decide to stay in my current city and at that point buy a house here and potentially sell my flat 


Therefore I am trying to decide what to do with both the £20k of cash I have AND the £1.3k in after tax pay that I am saving each month. Here I have a few questions I would like some help on:

1) Bearing in mind that I have a 50/50 chance of staying in 15 months, would you invest the money or store in cash to potentially use as a deposit? 

2) If I invest in the stock market, would you make use of the ‘Lifetime ISA’? This is a UK government savings scheme with an annual limit of £4k contributions. The benefit of this is the government would top up my contributions by a further 25% (so a total of £5k) and it is a tax sheltered meaning I pay no tax on any gains or income. The main issue with this is I can’t access the funds until age 60. This concerns me as it means I will be saving c. 33% of my income into accounts I can’t access until age 55/60 (700pcm of pre-tax income into the pension and £333 (toped up to £420 by the Gov) into the “LISA”). This would leave c£1k a month (c. 38% of my post tax salary) to either save in cash or invest in a separate tax sheltered investment account that I could withdraw the money from at any time

3) Do I pay down any of my mortgage? Currently it is on an interest only BTL loan with an interest rate of 2.16% (so c. 1.6% after tax). I wouldn’t normally do this but considering stock markets are at an all-time high I feel a bit of diversity (say paying it down £200 pm) in my investments would help

4) What would you guys do with my £20k cash? Currently it is sat in various current accounts earning about 1% interest across the whole balance on average.

I currently would like to retire at around age 50. In my career and company I could one day become Partner at my firm and earn serious money, however it is more likely I will get stuck at director age 35-40 with no realistic partner opportunity available to me. If this occurs I would like to have enough money that I could walk away from the job to either contract or go into industry as an FD. However I am also aware that when I have kids my attitude to work may change so who knows - I may retire far younger than 50.

financialindependence,"Where to hold bonds, from a FIRE perspective","The question of where to hold bonds comes up a lot. At first I agreed with Bogleheads' [tax-efficient fund placement article](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) that they go in tax-advantaged accounts without much question. Then I saw the [""bonds go in taxable"" article](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/asset-location-bonds-go-in-taxable/) from White Coat Investor. However, their calculations are not really appropriate from a FIRE perspective, so I decided to run my own numbers. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxO1NRPW6y550pIhxKhJXVPruJnBdDHwwPKhYliAHJNKoKOa_GB4DONYRG9SukjGAU5ZEVlJl-Zabc/pubhtml) is a Google Sheet I've put together.

Assumptions:

* We have $100k of tax-advantaged space and $100k of taxable space, and we want to start with a 75:25 stocks:bonds asset allocation and never rebalance.
* Stocks will return 2% per year in dividends and 8% per year in appreciation, while bonds will return 3% per year in dividends and 0% per year in appreciation (i.e. interest rates will stay the same).
* We're in the 25% federal income tax bracket now, so we use that tax rate for bond dividends and a 15% rate for stock dividends (assuming 100% qualified).
* In retirement, we'll manage our withdrawals and capital gains so we don't pay any tax.
* No state income tax throughout.

First let's look at the [total \(taxable + tax-advantaged\) balance over time](https://i.imgur.com/4NPWLsK.png). The edge for the 'bonds in tax-advantaged' strategy grows to about a third of a percent over the first 7 years, then recedes over the next 7-8 years. From then on, bonds in taxable does better, up to slightly over a percent advantage after 25 years. But overall, not a significant difference.

When we also consider the [taxable and tax-advantaged balances](https://i.imgur.com/U4CDMGq.png), it becomes a more complex question. The 'bonds in taxable' strategy provides a steadily growing edge for the tax-advantaged balance. But the taxable balance obviously grows quickly when it holds stocks. Since there isn't much difference in total balance (especially until you get 20+ years in), I think the main question becomes, would you rather have a large taxable balance or a large tax-advantaged balance? Early in your career having a lot of tax-advantaged space is wonderful, but once you're looking to FIRE you want quick access to the money.

It might also depend on if it's pre-tax or Roth. Roth earnings are difficult to access before traditional retirement age, while pre-tax money can be converted to Roth and accessed in 5 years. However, you have to make sure you have 5 years of living expenses in your taxable to make this work, which would be more challenging if you hold bonds there. In either case, I would say more money in taxable is preferable when you're ready to FIRE at a relatively young age. **So my tentative conclusion would be, for people looking to FIRE, the conventional wisdom of bonds in tax-advantaged accounts holds.**

I'd be interested to hear any feedback on this analysis. Any mistakes I made or assumptions that invalidate my conclusions? Is my logic that you'd rather have a larger taxable balance when you're about to FIRE incorrect? Has anybody done a similar analysis and want to share their results?

EDIT: Just updated the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxO1NRPW6y550pIhxKhJXVPruJnBdDHwwPKhYliAHJNKoKOa_GB4DONYRG9SukjGAU5ZEVlJl-Zabc/pubhtml) based on feedback received. Changed the bond dividend yield to the long-term historical average of 5% and switched taxable bonds to tax-exempt, with a 4% dividend yield (just a guess on my part; if somebody has a more accurate number please let me know) and a 0% tax rate. Overall these changes don't affect my conclusion that the 'bonds in tax-advantaged' strategy is superior for FIRE.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans going fine but want to consolidate for better rate - suggestions?,"Wife and I (early 30's) have a total student loan debt of $9,300 at a weighted average rate of 5.34% and 2.3 years to go.

# 1. How hungry are you?

Denny's Corporation operates a franchised full-service restaurant chain. The Denny's brand consisted of 1,733 franchised, licensed and Company-operated restaurants around the world, including 1,610 restaurants in the United States and 123 international locations. 

1,564 of its restaurants were franchised or licensed and 169 were Company-operated. Franchisees pay circa 4% of sales to Denny's as a fee, and about 300 of the 1500 franchisees let / sublet from Denny's. Also, they've been locating new restaurants at Pilot J and Kwik ""travel centers"". *trivia: Buffett's BRKA just agreed to acquire Pilot J.*

## Recent financials 

Given the mix of owned / franchised restaurants the top line can be a little lumpy, as each time they buy a franchisee the top line jumps. Why? They get 100% of the revenue (and costs) instead of just 4% of the revenue. For a ""better"" metric, we need to look at ""same-stores sales"" to see what the core business is doing. In 2016 it grew 1%. Not great, eh?

The bottom line is a more useful metric. 2016A took a hit with a pension settlement eating into profits, and on an adjusted basis the company did circa $0.55 in earnings. 

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $488m | $463m | $472m | $491m | $507m| $530m | $546m|
|EPS | $0.23 | $0.26 | $0.37 | $0.42 | $0.25| $0.56 | $0.62|

So the outlook for 2017 is almost no growth in cash flow. And at the recent results they talked about generating approximately $55m of free cashflow this year.

Strangely, Denny's doesn't pay a dividend. They've been around for over 60 years, and profitable a long time. But no dividends. Instead they've ramped debt in recent years by doing share buybacks. And now the company has $263m of net debt equal to 2.7x operating profit. So it's approaching a level that makes me uncomfortable. Plus their debt agreement restrict them from going much higher, so exception cash returns look like they may be a thing of the past.

# 2. Prefer to eat elsewhere?

The stock market menu is as diverse as the food, and Denny's looks like one of the smaller offerings... though if it owned all it's restaurants it would be $2.8bn of sales, not $0.5bn. Similarly, the mix of owned / franchised restaurants inflates the margin, as their gross margin on owned is 18% and on franchises is 71%.

So, it's hard to say if one biz is better than the other on an operational basis.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Denny's Corporation | $519M | 18% | N/A
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. | $1,023M | 12% | 13%
Bob Evans Farms Inc | $418M | 16% | 10%
Buffalo Wild Wings | $2,023M | 13% | 16%
Cheesecake Factory Inc | $2,296M | 12% | 23%
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. | $2,926M | 14% | 38%
DineEquity Inc | $622M | 36% | 32%
Brinker International, Inc. | $3,151M | 14% | N/A

Sonic Corporation | $516M | 30% | N/A
Texas Roadhouse Inc | $2,100M | 12% | 16%
Shake Shack Inc | $316M | 16% | 10%

And if we turn to valuation, I'm struck by the bunching in the 20s for most of the stocks. Though there are some outliers, Shake Shake on the high side $DIN and $EAT on the low side.

Net net, 23x earnings and a 6% free cash flow yield for a business that's seeing no growth at the bottom line and no growth at the top line, seems generous.

TXRH.O | $3,559M | 26x | 18% | 2% | 8%
SHAK.K | $1,240M | 66x | 23% | 0% | 5%

Though here's a different way to look at it. They bought 10 of their high performing franchisee's in 2016 for $13m. So that is less an 1x sales. If we value their 170 owned restaurants at 1x sales, the 300 leased at 0.5x sales and the remaining 1300 at 0.25x sales then take away the debt, we'd get to $800m of value. That's not far from the current $877m value of the business, and that's before we talk about control premiums.

# 3. Wall Street re(starant)view

The Wall Street consensus view is _Buy_, from the 4 brokers that cover the stock, they put a target price of just $14 on the stock. That's just 6% up on today's price.

In fact the stocks up 14% in the last three months, even though the earnings forecasts are down slightly. So the valuation's up substantially, despite no significant driver, and the stock missing earnings forecasts in both 1st and 2nd quarter.

Sure they have a _hilarious_ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DennysDiner) campaign underway. But there's been a brutal hurricane season, if you'd not noticed, and that may impact the overall restaurant market.

And if you are technically minded...that ramp is on low volumes, with the RSI &amp; BB Bands indicating that it's over bought. Though no doubt there are other technicals that say it's about to ramp higher (e.g. 50 day MA v 200)!

# 4. A taste for Denny's

Whether I like the food and format, is irrelevant. There's little growth, no sign of margin improvement, and they've ramped the buybacks so far. On top of that, I'm hardly happy to see the CEO say on the recent 2Q earnings call:

&gt; As we noted during our last earnings call, we expect the challenges currently facing the restaurant industry to persist for the foreseeable future. 

And from the 1st quarter earnings call:

&gt; Following a challenging wrap up to 2016, the first quarter of 2017 proved to be another volatile one for the restaurant industry. We believe this reflected a number of forces at play, including intense promotional activity within the industry, as commodity deflation persisted, the continued gap between grocery and restaurant pricing, the influence of a retail slowdown on dining out occasions, and federal income tax refund delays among others.

So, no, I don't have a taste for $DENN. You?

personalfinance,Prioritizing rental mortgage versus student loan debt,"Didn't get much traction on this late last night so reposting for daytime. I have a variety of debts, the largest and highest interest of which are a mortgage on a second rented property at 5.0% and student loans at 3.7%. The obvious knee-jerk strategy is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first, however because the interest on the rental property is basically a deductible business expense, paying down the mortgage produces a ""return"" in the form of taxable personal income on my schedule E, which is taxed at my marginal rate of give or take 45%. So, in my mind return of paying off this mortgage with post-tax earnings and then being taxed again on the rental income generated by reducing the interest on the loan is really more like a return of 2.6%. At that assumed rate, this would prioritize the debt below my primary residence mortgage and auto loans. Is there some really obvious way that I'm thinking about this wrong, or is my reasoning basically correct and I should throw money at my student loans first? Side notes, I have a more than ample emergency fund and all tax advantaged everything possible for me is maxed out. As an added twist I will almost certainly pay AMT which makes this calculation more complicated. Thanks in advance for advice.",finance

personalfinance,[Investing] Help with understanding Ally bank CDs,"Hi pf!  I'm thinking of moving some money into Ally Bank to take advantage of their interest rates.  I have around 25k I won't need for awhile, outside of my other savings/emergency funds (however, I'm looking to potentially invest in real estate in a year or two, so I don't want to put it somewhere too risky).  

I was thinking of just opening a savings account, but then I saw the CD options and that seems like a better fit since I don't need to touch it for a bit.

I was looking at [current CD rates](https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/?INTCMPID=HP_NAV2_RATES) and was a little confused about the options.  It seems like the ""no penalty"" option intuitively should have the worst rates (since its no penalty!) but for a &gt;=25k deposit, it seems like it has the best rate for the offered time period of 11 months-- same rate as a 2 year ""raise your rate"", and better rate than the 12 month ""high yield"".  And, it seems like there aren't any additional fees for the no penalty option compared to others.

It seems clear putting 25k in the 11 month no penalty is the best option for me (on Ally.) but I'm suspicious because ""no penalty"" seems too good to be true.  I'm wondering- am I interpreting this right? Does anyone have experience with these CD options, and is there something I'm missing?

personalfinance,Buying house in Denver (hot housing market) vs Paying of student loans and renting forever?,"My husband and I (and baby and dog) recently moved to the Denver area for my husband's new job. He works in a very competitive field where you don't get much say in where you wind up if you want to work in a full time permanent position-- it's all about where the openings are in a given year and if you are lucky enough to get an offer from one of them. So, we jumped at the chance to move to a fun metro area when he got the offer here and considered ourselves fortunate. At the time we were living on the east coast and didn't have a clue about just how hot Denver was until we started looking at rentals. 

We are now paying about $1,500 in rent for a livable, but somewhat shoddy ""garden"" apartment in Littleton, so we thought we might as well be paying that amount to a mortgage instead. But then we started looking at houses (2-4 bed, 1.75-2 bath)... We can realistically afford to spend up to 375K (but &lt;350K would be better) and everything we've seen in that price range has for the most part been tiny and in need of medium or major overhauls or in a not that great of an area and ultimately still not that nice (we are looking for an area with at least some walkability and/or ideally proximity to a train line, and a few trees would be cool too). In other words, nothing we are ready to make an investment in. We are totally willing to buy a duplex, condo or townhouse to get more for our money, but I also worry that the resale of those will be trickier if we are in fact buying in a housing bubble.

So, now we are thinking what if we just use our down payment money to pay off most or all of our student loans (which are about 50K with interest rates ranging 4.5-6.5%). We don't have any other debt and we'd still have substantial emergency funds leftover. We would then be debt free and could put more money to a nicer rental, could get to know the area better, have mobility, and wouldn't be strapped into a potential money pit. It would take us minimally 5 years to build another sizable down payment so we'd be committing to being renters for the near future, but the hope is that the housing market will stabilize sometime in the next few years. I read one model that predicted a peak in 2019 and then prices would start to fall. 

We are leaning towards staying renters since we really don't want to make a commitment to a house we don't love or at least really like, but worry that housing and rental prices will just keep going up indefinitely.  To further complicate things, we know that Denver is putting in a bid for Amazon HQ2 and the NY Times editorialized that it should win... Presumably if it did that would put rentals and housing costs through the roof and we would bitterly regret not buying when we had the chance.

Other than the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision, the minutes are considered the most influential of the committee s releases. This document details the various subjects discussed by the committee members at their recent meeting and could provide insight into the Fed s future monetary policy.

**UK Prelim GDP** - October 25th, 2017


Released quarterly, the Prelim Report is the first of three reports regarding the UK s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Followed by the second estimate and final estimate, each released a month apart, this report gives the first insight into the current state of the UK s economy. The prelim report is considered the most influential of the three, as it is the first to be released.

**Bank of Canada Rate Statement**- October 25th, 2017


Released 8 times per year, this interest rate decision carries great significance for the Canadian economy. It affects Canadian firms, indices and the Canadian dollar.

**European Central Bank Minimum Bid Rate** - October 26th, 2017


This rate decision serves as a key method for the European Central Bank to enforce its monetary policies. The decision is followed by a press conference with ECB President Mario Draghi and has the potential to impact the Euro and leading European indices such as the DAX and CAC.

**US Advance GDP** - October 27th, 2017

This is the first of three quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reports – Advance, Preliminary and Final. The Advance report is considered to have the highest impact of the three since it is the earliest indication of the performance of the US economy over the past quarter.

**Bank of Japan Interest Rates** - October 31st, 2017


Released 8 times per year, this rate decision has the potential to impact both Japanese companies and the Japanese Yen. Subsequently, volatility is often experienced in Japan s Nikkei index around the time of the announcement, as well as other leading indices in Asia.",finance
personalfinance,Not being paid for two months due to employer not deducting taxes,"I just started my job in September, and we get paid once a month, on the last business day of the month. 

Each of the new starting employees would receive a bonus with the first paycheck in September, but I asked for mine to be given in August (a month early). I received the bonus at the end of August, as promised, and I was surprised to see that no taxes were taken out of it. However, I didn't worry much about it since I assumed I would just have to pay the difference come tax season. (My reasoning: I had a part-time job before where I mistakenly didn't pay full federal tax for a year, so I paid for it during tax time.) That was a mistake on my part, but my company did not give me any other instructions. I spent almost all of the bonus paying moving costs and some debt I had from this summer.

On the last week of September, a few days before we would get our first paycheck, I was pulled into the office by our financial person (who I believe is highly qualified and trustworthy as a former accounting partner). They showed me the spreadsheet and told me that I would not be receiving a paycheck for the month of September because my employer needed to take money out of my take-home September salary to pay the taxes from the August bonus. On top of that, they also need to take out a few hundred dollars from my October paycheck to fully cover the difference. 

The bonus was 43% more than my gross monthly pay, and the math certainly works out. 

I have no problem paying the taxes on the bonus, but I just did not expect to be hit with this so soon and to have no pay for two months, plus another deduction in October.

I'm not looking to confront my employer about this because I don't want to cause trouble at my small company, and it doesn't put me in any dire financial situation. I just want to know if this is acceptable and how to protect myself in the future. I know that employers can withhold future pay, even below minimum wage, to compensate for over-payment, but I don't know how taxes come into play here. All the resources I've seen only talk about over-payment in terms of hourly/overtime pay, while I am salaried.",finance
personalfinance,"[Financial Planning] Seeking some advice to give to my sister. Shes 20, still in school, and just found out shes pregnant (Keeping) Trying to come up with some advice on Financial Planning and potential programs she can enroll in.","Hey Guys,

I couldnt find a thread similiar to this one, granted, I did not look to hard.

I just found out my little sister is pregnant. The circumstances of the entire situation arent important, however, she is extremely out of her depth and I would like to start the conversation now regarding planning for what is to come in a few months. 

The key point is, she will be keeping the baby. So, with that, I think she should begin planning right now.

Some key variables - 

* Shes still in school - education major - 20 years old

* Father does not have his GED and works as an assistant manager for a restaurant. 

* Income will be an issue. 

* He rents, she lives with him. 

* She is still in school, and needs to survive 1.5 years before graduation.

 
I am not privy to the exact financial situation they are in, but, building a budget is going to be the first thing I am going to try and attack. 

So - I guess if anyone who has done this recently (not this situation) or has any insight into financial planning needs for a low income new child household, I would appreciate it.

*  Are there any federal or private programs I could point her to that offer financial cushioning.

* I believe she will need to take advantage of federal loans to stay in school, but other than the stafford loan program, I do not know of any interest friendly loans or programs she could take advantage of

* In tackling a budget - what advice can you offer regarding priority items or expected costs of living with a kid.

* New parents, what tips and tricks do you have to save money on essential supplies (diapers, food, equipment)

* Anything I might be missing.


Seriously guys, if you do have advice and take the time to write it out, thank you so much. I promise you the information will be invaluable and you guys are amazing. 

If I fail to respond in a timely matter, I am at work and will get back to you.

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Debt (Consolidate/Refinance/Leave as is?),"My current private student loans that I received by cosigning with my father in college:

$16,623.75 at 8.74% Monthly Payment: $188.76

$17,803.28 at 8.74% Monthly Payment: $176.26

$15,513.21 at 8.99% Monthly Payment: $166.71

I really regret having to use private student loans but to justify: my parents make a lot of money and I could not qualify for a lot of federal loans so I maxed those out and had to use private to pay the rest of my college expenses.  The federal loans I'm not worried about as I will continue to pay the minimum until forgiven in 10 years as I work in public service. The interest rate on these bad boys suck majorly and I'm starting to try to get my finances in order so I was hoping there is some way I can get the interest rate down while maintaining a similar monthly payment.

**A little background:** I'm 25 years old. My wife and I just married a year and a half ago. Both of our credit scores are 720+, we have a mortgage (around $160K), no credit card debt, about $16K left on our truck, and I have about $12k on federal loans. That is the extent of our debt. When cosigning with my father for these private loans, my father's credit score I'm sure was not very good and I was 18 years old so I'm sure I didn't have much of a credit score either.

**My question:** Would it be beneficial for me to refinance or consolidate these loans under my wife and I or just continue to do our best to chip away at these loans a little bit at a time?

I'm very new at all of this so be gentle and if there is any more information you need from me please don't hesitate to ask.",finance

personalfinance,"ETFs: what is the ""catch""? Am I missing something?","Last year, my bank (in an EU country) set the interest rate of savings accounts to 0%, and there are even banks with a negative interest. I've been wanting to look into investing for a while now, but this was the last straw to finally go and do it.

So looking around, I've read about different kinds of investments, one of which are ETFs. And somehow, to me, they look kind of ""magical"" (well, some of them). And I don't understand why.

So for example, looking at an ETF which tracks the S&amp;P 500 index, I can see that in the past its value has risen by 17% over the past year, roughly 18% in 2016, and about 77% over the last 5 years (which if I'm correct corresponds to about 12% per year on average). And this just seems ridiculously high. If I understood everything correctly, if I had bought 10k of ETFs 5 years ago, they would now be worth about 17.7k.

This is just one example. There are a few others as well which seem really stable. Of course, there are also those which fluctuate a lot.

And from my research, I've typically seen that lower risk investments will gravitate more towards 5%-10% growth per year. Investing in the stock market yourself could net much higher, but it's a lot more work and a lot riskier. A lot of companies' stock fluctuate wildly all the time, so it's not a case of ""set it and forget it"".

So, after all my research, I feel like I'm missing something. That there is some sort of a catch to these stable, growing ETFs that I'm overlooking. And I want to be completely sure of that before I dump a few thousand euros on these, thinking that they're low risk.

The only thing I can see from past performance, taking this S&amp;P 500 index tracking ETF as an example again, is that it tanked hard in 2008 (no surprise) and it took over 5 years to recover to the same value. But keeping tabs on it, it should be quite possible to tell when such a trend sets in and sell, and then wait until the upwards trend comes again (or, play it safe and invest elsewhere with lower risk at that point). Of course, historical data is no guarantee for the future, but since the entire economy tanked at that time, this particular ETF was not the only victim.",finance

personalfinance,Need to pay back a 401k loan due to a job change. What's my best option?,"My wife and I bought a house 2 years ago, with our financial situation at the time we weren’t able to save up the 20% so I ended up taking a first time home buyers distribution from my IRA and she took a loan from her 401k. Recently she switched jobs so it’s time to decide what to do with the 401k loan that we’re forced to pay back within the next 90 days. Our options are to pay it back with cash and incur no penalty, pay it back through the balance of the 401k and pay taxes on it this year plus a 10% penalty, or to open an IRA with cash that equals the amount of the loan balance.

Obviously everyone’s reaction is going to be to take the road with no penalties and just pay it off with cash. Unfortunately since moving into the house I’ve only been able to build up to 3 months of bills as an emergency fund and paying off this loan would bring us closer to 1 month which scares me. On the other hand it scares my wife to pay the taxes and 10% fee when we have the cash to pay it off. Normally we get a pretty sizable tax return so we shouldn’t owe money back to Federal when it comes tax time, it will just be a reduced return.

Should we take the hit to our savings to pay this off with no penalty or take the hit on our tax return and pay the 10% penalty and keep building towards 6 months emergency fund?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for some advice on my plan for some CC Debt removal,"Hi PF.

I'm looking for some advice on my plan for some CC Debt removal.  For the most part my Credit is pretty good.  It's been fluctuating (through CreditKarma scores) between 700 and 775 (mainly due to my CC Debt), and when I was approved for my new vehicle loan back in April it was a 769 in the actual credit report.

### Background
Back in January I took a new job in a new location, and had to sell my house.  The house selling did not go as fast as planned and I ended up paying both a mortgage and rent for many months, which hurt.  Then I had to put $5k into escrow to close due to not being able to get a septic inspection done due to the amount of rain we received.  The inspection just passed, and $4,500 or so of that came back to me.  We also had our wedding back in May, and so we are finally recovering financially from all of that.

### Current Situation
So now I was able to replenish _some_ of our savings back to $1,000, and paid back some debts I had to other people.  Today I made a $3,100 payment onto my credit card, which has a current balance of $8,400, so the new balance will be approximately $5,300 once that clears.

We currently have about $400/paycheck (bi-weekly) that I am trying to put into savings, with some of that being diverted into the CC Debt.

### The plan
So I was thinking about opening a Blue Cash Everyday card through Amex.  It currently is offering a 15 month 0% APR on balance transfers and purchases, with 3% Cash back for groceries (we have two toddlers), 2% for gas, and 1% for everything else.

The idea that I have is to transfer the complete balance of the card I have open now into the new Amex card, and then we use that for as many purchases as we can while trying to divert as much as possible into paying off the existing debt.  The reason I want to use it for as many purchases as possible is to try to capitalize on that 1-3% cash back offer, and pay that into the balance.  

My current CC has an 11% interest rate on it, so by doing the balance transfer with 15 months no interest I can pay that extra ($90 now, but $60 after this payment clears) of interest back into the debt instead of just throwing that away.  

I don't know what the limit will be on the new card, but the APR says it is variable from 13-26%.

I am also expecting ""up to 10% of my yearly salary of $80k"" in a bonus.  I'm not ""planning"" for it, but I am expecting it to be anywhere between 6-8%, realistically, which I would use to probably neutralize this debt completely next Mar-April.

### The real question
So pretty much I'm wondering if I have any gaping flaws in my plan, for example how I think balance transfers work or anything like that, or if this plan is absolute shit.  It sounds good to me in theory, but I'm fundamentally biased because I think I'm smaht and whatnot.

I also want to add that I do assume that if I don't have the entire balance paid off by 15 months I think it works like a Store CC with special financing where you probably get the entire interest balance added on as one lump sum, so I will either be transferring balance somewhere else or getting destroyed by that interest sum.

personalfinance,In less than a year I'm headed to Germany from US - young with low earning potential (academia/humanities) but decent assets (22k),"TL;DR - I’m graduating from college soon with my BA, and am headed to Germany to continue my studies with a masters and (hopefully) a PhD next fall. I’m planning on spending at least 5-7 years there, and am not sure if I’ll ever return to the US. I don’t know how to manage my savings if I go abroad. Do the taxes on my stocks change, or if I stay abroad until retirement, would I have to pay taxes on my Roth IRA? How do I hit that trifecta of accessibility, stability, and earning potential in a different while in a country than my assets? A student visa in Germany will allow me to work only small portions of the year (but then I have the benefit of accessing public healthcare). But if I get academic funding from German agencies, what does that mean for my taxes? And what about American agencies?

---

I’ve worked 2-3 jobs since I can remember, and have always been a fairly minimal spender. I’ve also been raised by an attorney and a stock broker, so not only did I get the benefit of not having to cover my own necessary costs in high school (e.g. never had to pay for my own haircuts or toiletries, but was expected to pay if I went out with my friends), but I also definitely had the privilege of exposure to financial planning. I already have a Roth IRA and contributed my max in 2016 (it was less than the 5k threshold, but my formal paycheck-giving job earned me less than 5k that year) and am trying to max it out this year too. I work a lot of informal side jobs, so I definitely make more than that, but it’s all in cash. All in all, I have a net worth of around $22k - but I consider the money untouchable because of my anxiety about future job/financial security.

Even though I like planning and have been managing my money well, I struggle with keeping budgets straight each month, which stresses me out when I remember I won’t have a parental safety net for much longer. It makes it complicated for me when some income is taxable paycheck, some is tuition stipend based, and some is cash from side jobs. 

My current college scholarship includes a stipend towards room and board, which I then portion off to cover my costs. It thankfully does cover most of everything, but I do drive a loaner car from my parents which they pay for (I just handle gas), and my parents agreed to pay for my groceries each month. My costs are super low still - I spend most my time researching or hanging out with friends at home. I cook for myself, and I cut my own hair. My largest expenses outside of utilities/rent are my dog (avgs out to $50/month) and my tattoos (probably around $1k/year if I were to overestimate the average?). 

I have two separate banks (both internet institutions because yay super high interest rates and no fees), one for savings (but I have a credit card and a small CD through the same company) and one for checking. Do I have to switch? Where do I switch to, so I can access my money in Europe without fees? (Like, I REALLY don’t want to give up my awesome interest rates. Seriously - my 12 month CD is 1.35%, my savings account is 1.2%, and my checking is 0.2%. My cash back reward on my credit card increases by 10% each month because it goes into the savings account owned by the same company, *and then* it gets 1.2% interest once it’s there. I know financial institutions are the devil but I do prefer devils that pay higher interest and that aren’t Wells Fargo)

I want to continue prioritizing saving - I’m kinda a leanFIRE type. But I also am operating under the expectation I will be a relatively low-earner with high preventative/mental healthcare costs, and a doggy ‘dependent'. Long term, I do plan on fostering teens &amp; kids and adopting a few (whether in Germany or in the states), don’t plan on owning property outside of maybe an income property, don’t plan on owning a car for the next fifteen years, but would have very high irregular costs every few years (moving/plane tickets), and would hopefully always have a dog around. Germans also love insurance, so I’m not sure what monthly costs I would have in addition to health but I know they’d be a good portion of my income.",finance

personalfinance,REALLY need a better car. Debating between financing and leasing. Opinions?,"BACKGROUND: I have bought two used cars in my life, one when I was 18, a 2001 Honda CR-V for $1500, and one when I was 19, a 2000 VW Beetle for $2000 (both I paid for in cash.)  The Honda was ok, but did give me some trouble and is now at 250,000 miles and is about to need some serious maintenance.  The Beetle I have now however, is a POS.  It has less than 160,000 miles, has left me stranded 3 times, and has cost me $$$ in repairs and at this point I can't take it anymore. Especially because I am now in nursing school and I can't afford to miss class because my car won't work.  I'm also having to drive further to clinical sites and I get so much anxiety driving on highways and through sketchier areas of town because I'm so worried my car is going to give out on me again.  So, I've decided I'm not going the shit heap route again, I want to get something better, that is RELIABLE, economical, and will not let me down.  

QUESTION:  I have decided between either a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Fit.  Both are cute, and are known for their bulletproof reliability.  So, the two options I'm looking at are:
1) Lease.  Put $1,000 down on either a 2017 Corolla or Fit, and pay $189/month or $139/month respectively.  The pros are that I would have a brand new, reliable car that I absolutely don't have to worry about maintenance costs for, I can turn it in after a few years, and it is the cheapest and has no interest.  Cons are obviously that I'd have no equity and wouldn't actually own it.  And if I happen to scratch/dent/fuck anything up, I'll have to pay when I turn it in. Conversely, my other option is

2) Finance.  My credit score is in the 580's because I'm 21 and have a very limited credit history (even though what I do have is good) and it seems the best interest rate I'm going to get is 17.5%.  I'm looking at paying around $220 a month for a 2008 Fit with 53K miles, or $240 a month for a 2010 Corolla S with 87K miles. Each include a $1,000 down payment and are 72 month financing.  This option seems good to me because I'd actually own the car and have equity in it.  I'd have something to my name down the road.  However, the interest rate is frightening.  

I work part time and make about $12,000/year before taxes.  I also have a side hustle that brings in a little extra cash, maybe an average of $75/month (though I'm looking to expand on that.) I have about $200 worth of bills each month, but that's all.

Based on all of this, what is the better option for me? I think that I am responsible with my money and would not miss a payment no matter what.  I have no one to cosign with.  Any words of wisdom from anyone, or someone who has been down this road before, are very appreciated.",finance

Figure 1 – Comparative Analysis

Our speculation is that an entity at Bittrex made a monumental mistake. Comparative analysis, completed by Syndicate.Enrique, shows that only an entity/group with a massive (nearly complete) diversification of alt-coins would have been able to create a uniform sell off, within the exchange, in the same time frame, for the same percentages.

Bittrex: Whenever fees are assessed from Bittrex, they aren’t transferred away from Bittrex, and are more than likely not swapped to different coins (BTC or other) unilaterally when the fees are acquired. At some point, Bittrex needs to be convert these fees into BTC – should they be motivated to stack their BTC bags. Considering this, it’s probable – though still speculative – this crash was an attempt to automate offsetting their load. The result, Bittrex dumped their bags too quickly, all at the same time. Typically, shielding this kind of activity would be the aim, using a much longer time frame to avoid creating market panic, and also to keep prying eyes like ours from being able to dissect the market manipulation performed against investors.

 

We would like to give Bittrex the benefit of the doubt, but this is way too much of a coincidence. No other exchange has experienced these patterns in their assets. Cryptocurrencies that were NOT listed on Bittrex were not affected in the same way. Every other exchange we looked at, Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, GDAX, Coss, Cryptopia, Yobit – all experienced patterns that were indicative of market reaction stemming from a single source of flash sell-down: Bittrex.

Who else has a portfolio of alt-currencies so diversified that they could sell off volume in uniform succession in a limited time frame?

Argument: People are moving alts to BTC

This is also false. Though it is true, it didn’t happen at the scale that matches with the volumes moved from alts to BTC across any other exchange. This wasn’t a market-wide movement like we saw with BIP91 activity between June and July.

Argument: It’s just whales

If it were just whales, you wouldn’t have seen this level of diversification and havoc in every page of Bittrex. This pattern is everywhere, from page 1, through page 7. This pattern doesn’t show up on any other exchange in this fashion. Whales don’t buy LGD, come on…

He wasn't fired for misconduct or anything, the VP in charge of his department quit last week, which caused the company to want to make big changes in his dpt, and they told him they do not think he has the skill-set for their new vision. They're offering him 2 weeks severance and paying out his PTO.

They also offered to, instead of severance, give him an intensive 2 week training period on the skills they think he needs to stay, and at the end they will evaluate whether he has the skills they need. Right now he thinks this is bogus and that they'll just fire him at the end anyways. Should he pursue this option at all?

personalfinance,Need advice with student loans.,"Hello, 

My students loans are coming due soon. They are both federal loans through Great Lakes, but one is under my name alone (15K) and another under my old man's (52K). 

I am trying to figure out my best options. The 15K begins payments in December and the 52K in November. on the 15K it's set to $106 payment plan, but I plan to overpay. 

For some reason the 52K won't allow me to lower the payment from 600 a month, but i'm talking with them.

Some background: I got my first salaried job out of college and make about 61K a year + overtime + performance based bonus each quarter. My expenses are minimal since i'm privileged enough to live at home for about another year or two. I have about 6K in savings, and no credit debt. 

Should I tackle the highest first and make minimal payments on the smaller one? Should I use my savings to get a huge dent in? Should I consolidate? 

My plan is to over pay as much as possible and to put any overtime/bonus pay 100% into my loans. I want to try and not fall behind and be smart about this, and still attempt to save money for housing down the line. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you!",finance

economy,Is Now the Time to Buy Bank Stocks?,"The financials and small cap stocks have started to make new all-time highs once again. XLF, the SPDR financial sector ETF, has made new highs since its peak in 2007. Because of this, our newsletter portfolios are going to add more exposure to the sector. The Russell 2000 is also reaching new highs, but this is likely because of the correlation the index has to the financial sector. Currently the correlation sits at a 0.96 out of 1.00, and it generally stays above 0.50.

The correlation to financials is not a coincidence. First, the financial sector has the highest weighting in the index. Another reason is that the companies in the index, small cap stocks, often rely on financial relationships with the banks within the sector. It is often seen that the economy is as strong as its banks. In order for small cap stocks to do monetary transactions, they need to rely on America’s financial institutions. If they need financing or a line of credit, they go to a bank. Remember that correlation does not mean causation. Banks also rely on the smaller companies for revenue as well.



So, why are these two segments of the market making new highs?

Hope In Congress

The small cap stocks are likely making new highs because of political hopes. Since the Trump Administration released its tax plan, the markets are hoping that congress will be able to get tax reform done. It was a major promise of the Trump campaign, and it could really help the economy, but there are many investors that are waiting to see if anything will get passed before investing their cash. Since healthcare reform has failed to make any strides towards “repeal and replace”, and an infrastructure bill has not been passed, some investors caution that tax reform may be facing the same hurdles. If tax reform can get done, we may see stocks move up quickly, especially the small caps and financials.

Interest Rates

The rise of the 10-year treasury note means that the financial companies can charge more to lend capital to individuals and companies. Mortgages, business loans, even credit cards become more profitable as the 10-year treasury moves up.

The interest rate for borrowing capital is determined first by the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is usually the rate an investor can receive on a T-Bill (Treasury Bill). Interest is then added on to the borrower, based on the amount of risk the lender is taking. They will consider risks such as the amount of money borrowed, the time it takes to be paid back, and the borrower’s credit score.

While the T-Bill is not completely risk free, it is considered risk-free because it is backed by the US government. Because the government can print money as it pleases, it is very hard to see a reason why it would not pay back its debt. The only reasons could be because congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and the government defaults on its obligations, or if the US government disappears. Of course, no one is expecting the US government to disappear anytime soon. Since defaulting is political suicide and highly irrational it is not likely the government will fail to make its payments either. The ramifications would be so large, and hurt the world economy, that it makes no sense to default.

Unfortunately though, today the debt ceiling is used as a political weapon. In fact, because politics have made it hard on borrowers, credit rating agencies in 2011 downgraded the US from an “outstanding” borrower to an “excellent” borrower. This affects more than the US government though. Because the government needs to pay more interest, the risk-free rate has risen, making borrowers pay more as well.

Why Are Interest Rates Rising?

Interest rates change for two reasons. The first is that the Federal Reserve can influence the treasury yields, causing the risk-free rate to change, thus changing the rates on other forms of borrowing. Secondly, bonds are traded just like stocks, but bond prices move inverse to interest rates. What does this mean? If an investor wants to buy a stock, they pay up to purchase it, and sell down to sell it. To buy a bond, the buyer pays a lower interest rate, raising the price of the bond, making it more enticing for the seller to sell. If an investor wants to sell a bond they must raise the rate to lower the price of the bond, in order to entice buyers.

The Federal Reserve

The Fed has been raising rates on a path to normalization. After the financial crisis, the Fed needed to keep interest rates near zero. They did this because the economy was on the brink of a depression and it needed as much help as possible. In fact, they did more than just keep the Federal Funds rates low, they also started a program called quantitative easing (QE). This was a bond buying program which gave bonds and the bond market added demand, thus raising the money supply and lowering interest rates. Now, the Fed feels the economy is strong enough to withstand a more normal monetary policy, and they are slowly moving rates back up. First, they began to move rates up by raising the federal funds rate, which is one of their major monetary policy tools. It is the interest rate that banks charge other banks to lend cash overnight. The federal reserve raises this rate, and it in turn raises every other type of interest rate in the US financial markets.

In September, the Fed announced that it would begin to lower its balance sheet. The balance sheet is the amount of assets and liabilities the federal reserve has, and it rose to more than $4 trillion after the series of QE programs they ran. For a comparison, the Federal Reserve balance sheet was around $800 billion prior to QE. As they slowly start to lower their bond repurchases, they are inevitably creating more supply of bonds and less supply of money. This in turn, causes interest rates to move up.

The Bond Market

The bond market is also causing rates to rise because there is less demand for bonds. US Treasuries are bought and sold around the world. This is because they are still seen as the safest of the haven assets, and because they had a positive yield in a world of negative yields. However, as the international and emerging markets have started to grow again, haven assets are becoming less desirable. This adds supply to the market and raises interest rates as well. Take a look at the price action of the 10-year treasury yield: 

The 10-year rose quickly after the election of Trump, but as his policies have yet to take place, they began to move back down. If the 10-year yield can make it past the 24 mark, interest rates may continue to rise until it reaches 26.

Conclusion

It seems the financial sector and small cap stocks are poised to start growing once again. The correlation between these assets is not a mystery. Both asset classes rely on a strong economy,and each other to be profitable. The proposed tax reform plans should also help both asset classes because of the effects it would have on the economy, and their balance sheets. A strong economy means a strong consumer. This should drive more sales, and more revenue. Also helping the financial sector is the rise of interest rates. As they increase, financial firms will bring in more revenue, and it will begin to normalize the economy.

personalfinance,Got a preapproved student loan refinancing offer in the mail the other day. Wondering if it's too good to be true.,"So, title speaks for itself. Here are a couple things I can add:

It's from a service provider named SofiRefi. 

They advertise an interest rate between 2.86-7.13% (which is better than some of my loans, to be honest).

They ""preapproved"" my father for refinancing my student loans, but when I went to look further into it, I had to fill everything in (like my address and student current student loan debt, etc.). They didn't have my loan info. The offer wasn't even in my name.

My current loans total around $42,000, I live abroad but I send home a range between $300 and $500 a month to pay off the loans. My interest rates vary between a variable 6% all the way up to non variable 10%. 

I've been wanting to keep my loans together in one place for a while now. Currently I'm juggling between three different providers and can't even remember my sign in info for some of them. Is Sofi sending my feelers abuzz for a reason? Or am I just being silly?",finance

personalfinance,How does financing a phone affect a credit score?,"I just got a new phone, and I decided to finance it based on the 0% interest, so I can focus on the high interest rate student loans first, regardless of the cash back I could have gotten if I had used my credit card. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

But then I received an email from Credit Karma about how I just had an inquiry on my credit, and that it may marginally affect my score. On top of that, I was approved for $2200 in credit with the phone company's financing service (in this case, Synchrony), with $1100* charged for the phone and preferred care plan. 

How does all of this affect my credit score? Is the financing service basically a line of credit, and will it affect my credit usage? Or is it more like a student loan, where as long as I'm making the payments, it'll only marginally affect my score?

I just got approved for an Amex card, so I can maximize my cash back on groceries (3% on up to $6000 annually), plus get the $150 welcome bonus, which is super easy to get. So the total amount of available credit will increase significantly, but the amount I use (in $) will remain the same. Overall, if the phone financing is included, my usage still won't ever exceed 16%. So, the phone being financed shouldn't really affect me all that much...right?

*I know I know, its a ridiculous amount...but it's the friggin Pixel 2 XL, guys :P if it's any good, I'm not planning on getting a new phone for perhaps 3 years. Plus, it's pretty much the amount you'd spend on any flagship model nowadays.",finance
personalfinance,"I will receive $400,000 when my mom passes away. Is getting an advance on inheritance worth it?","My mom is a recently retired school teacher and chose a pension option in which she takes less money each year, so her beneficiaries will receive a lump sum of $800,000 when she passes away. My sister and I are listed as beneficiaries so I will receive a lump sum of $400,000 when she passes. 

I am 25 years old and a high school teacher in New York who currently makes $55,000 a year. I have $20,000 saved in the bank and am saving for a down payment on a house (I live with my parents). 

Some questions I have: 
1.	When my mom passes, will that money be added to my income and taxed by New York. I believe that the federal government won’t tax any inheritance if it is less than $5,400,000.
2.	Would it be smart to look into getting an advance through some sort of inheritance loan? 
3.	What would the interest on such a loan be? 

Ideally, I would like to get an advance in order to buy a house now to start a family. I also believe my mom would rather see her retirement money spent now so she could enjoy it with my family then just knowing I will receive it one day. I believe that I would receive something around $270,000 after NYS income tax. In my mind, I would take $200,000 now to buy a house and pay the lender the $270,000 when the time comes. 

Any help is truly appreciated and please ask any clarifying questions you have. Thank you!

Edit 1: My mom does not have access to that money now. She had the option to take roughly $70,000 a year for the remainder of her life or $56,000 and a lump sum payment of $800,000 which would go to her beneficiaries. She chose the latter option. 

Additionally, my mom is in her early 60s, but she has heart problems and smokes 2 packs a day.  Although I love her, It would be out of the ordinary for her to live another 20 years. That is why she chose option 2. I would like her to see her money go to use now. I don't see her changing the beneficiaries. I know that that is a possibility, but I have great relationship with my mom and sister. I was assuming that if I were to receive a loan for the $200,000, my mom would have to sign some sort of legal document indicating that I will remain a beneficiary.",finance

* I'm in my mid-30s and make upper $80k yearly.
* I have ~$3K remaining in student loans at a 2.8% interest rate.
* I max out my 401K contributions ($18K yearly) and my employer offers 50% matching on the first 6% of my contributions
* I max out Roth IRA contributions ($5500 yearly).
* I have 6 month emergency fund set aside in a savings account at a 1.3% interest rate.
* Monthly bills include credit cards (I pay in full every month), mobile, internet, transportation pass, piano lessons
* I do not own a house
* I do not own a car at the moment (i have been taking public transportation the past year, but have been thinking about picking up a used car).


so my big question is - WHAT WOULD YOU DO 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc?

* focus on paying off my student loans as soon as possible?
* save for a house?
* invest money into index funds? i have been reading more about financial independence, so the idea of saving more aggressively and then investing in index funds is appealing. Index funds i am considering are: Vanguard 500 Index (VFINX), Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSMX), Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX), Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index (VGTSX)

All the rates above include the .25% discount for ETF. I've shopped around and these are by far the best rates I've been offered. My question is, over the life of these loans, would it better/smarter to take the risk with the variable interest or play it safe with the fixed rate.

personalfinance,Seeking advice about extended unemployment (Oregon),"I am a 51-year-old software engineer living in Portland, OR, who has been unemployed since April. I’ve been collecting unemployment since May. My former employer gave me a good severance package that included 3 months of pay and 3 months of COBRA reimbursement. I also had several weeks of vacation time accrued for which I was paid.

Due to the advice of r/personalfinance, I completed an Emergency Fund last year. I was also able to save a semester’s worth of tuition in a 529 account for my youngest son who just graduated from high school this spring. I also started a separate savings account to handle “irregular expenses” including tuition for my oldest son who is a senior in college this year.

At the start of unemployment, I had the following assets:

- Emergency fund: 25k
- Other savings: 23.5k (after severance &amp; final pay deposit)
- 529: $12.5k
- Checking: 11.4k
- 401k: 143k

Current balances are as follows:

- Emergency fund: 8k
- Other savings: 5k
- 529: 2.5k
- Checking: 10k
- 401k: 150k

I owe approximately $5500 in tuition for the fall semester for my two sons. Fixed monthly expenses are 5-6k, more than half of which can’t be reduced (mortgage, utilities, insurance). 

Unemployment is about $2400/month. COBRA has been $1500/month since August but we will be on my wife’s insurance after this month. She only makes minimum wage and doesn’t quite work full-time so she mostly just covers groceries and, now, health insurance. We keep separate bank accounts (more great advice from r/personalfinance) and I give her an allowance every month to supplement her income.

If I’m not able to find a job, my unemployment eligibility will end in November and my savings will likely be depleted by the end of the year. Tuition payments of about 5k/month will begin again in January. Although I’m pretty sure we can get private student loans for both boys if needed - we went that route a few years when my oldest started college - I would rather not because those loans are unsubsidized and the interest rates aren't very good. I have better prospects outside of Portland but those markets (like the Bay Area) have a much higher cost of living than I enjoy now. And I would rather not move.

I have concluded that, should it become necessary, I can start withdrawing from my 401k in order to stay afloat. I’m well aware that I’m already woefully short on retirement savings. I’m also aware that I would have to pay about half of any withdrawal in penalties and taxes to the government.

What other options do I have?

Edit: I wanted to clarify monthly expenses. Here's what they are roughly:

- $1800 mortgage
- $232 wireless (4 phones)
- $65 internet
- $450 car insurance (sons are 21 and under)
- $250-350 utilities
- $75 entertainment (mostly streaming services)
- $1000 for wife's allowance (this will be increased because of insurance change)
- $1500 for COBRA (ends after this month)
- $400 personal allowance (mostly when I buy groceries or we eat out on the weekend)
- $300 allowance combined for the kids (all expenses they have at college)",finance
personalfinance,Questions about taking equity out of a house...??,"So I am 42 years old and only have about 1K in debt (besides the mortgage). I bought my house about 9 years ago with a 30 year mortgage at a 4.25% interest rate.

personalfinance,How should I prioritize my debts for payoff?,"I have a few debts that I'd like to start paying extra towards (approximately $1000 per month) to pay off, but I'm not 100% sure which one I should start paying first to save the max amount of money in the long run. I'll list it in the order that I think I should go, but if you would do otherwise please let me know, and why.

(1) PMI - Current monthly payment of $97.85 with 46 more payments scheduled until this requirement is met. Current payoff amount to get rid of PMI is $7159.90. I'm considering paying this in a lump sum from my savings (approximately 17k - which is around 4-5 months pay for emergency fund and another 6k for emergency home/car expenses) once I am eligible to pay off the PMI in December (by that time the payoff amount should be around $6500).

(2) Student Loan - Monthly Payment (flat): $251.77, Payoff Amount: $16,003.90, Rate: 2.625%, # of remaining payments: 99

(3) Car Loan - Monthly Payment (flat): $285, Payoff Amount: $15,935.76, Rate: 2.74%, # of remaining payments: 60

Overall even though the car loan has a higher interest rate I think this makes sense since the student loan has more remaining payments left, therefore I'd save more in the long run by paying the student loan first.

I imagine this way is not ideal to people in this sub and you will probably tell me just wait and save up the money to buy it entirely off contract but alas please just give me advice on my hypothetical question (just curious how credit cards work exactly).

I have never used a credit card and not paid off the full amount each month so this is why I’m asking this question as I’m not entirely sure how it works. But hypothetically if I bought an iPhone that cost a $1000 and paid it off over let’s say 6 months with about $200 payment a month, the interest would be about $50 total over 6 months with a CC interest rate of 19.99% according to a CC interest rate calculator I used. Will my credit score go down if I do it this way? I have a good score of about 740 last I checked and don’t want to jeopardize this too much. I just can’t justify signing a 2 year contract to buy an iPhone at half price but then my cell phone bill goes up by 2.5x but I honestly can’t stomach spending $1k in one transaction out of my bank account to a phone. Paying it off over 6 months (or potentially less) with only paying $50 seems totally worth it to me. Tell me why I’m wrong if I am. Thanks!",finance

i accepted this answer for a few days, but at this point and several phone calls later I am now 13 days ""delinquent"" although it is not my fault and they can still see the payment I submitted but it still has not been processed and I just get the same answer. They do state that my payment will show as being paid on the 20th once it finally does go through and that my student loans do not get reported to the credit bureau until they hit 90 days late... I hope they do not plan to drag this out that long.

I opened a Charles Schawb brokerage account and put money into their S&amp;P 500 Index Fund via a mutual fund which is funded automatically on the 5th and 20th through an automatic buy order.

**Question 1:** My mutual fund is not part of a retirement fund, what are the tax implementations of this or should I have placed it into a retirement account then purchased the MF? Is there something better I should be doing with this money? My current game plan is to let this build until I have enough to open a MF at Vanguard (10 k or so).

**Question 2** What is next for me? Now that I appear to on the right path or at least I am doing something with my money. What else should I be doing? I feel as though the sky is the limit at this point. I'm in my mid-30's without a family, this has given me the ability to really focus my money where I want/ need it to be.

Someone who works with us on all facets of money, not just investments.

I've only worked with one financial advisor years ago, but that was more for investments, and it didn't turn out well.

When I asked my advisor if I could exercise some options and buy a new SUV off the lot for my wife, he was like ""Sure! If you feel good about your company!""   I quit my job, started my own business which failed, and then I learned the hard lesson about amt tax, and had to sell stock at a low to pay it, and ultimately kept selling and selling stock just to stay afloat until I could figure out how to replace my old income. 

I digress, but that kinda disappointed me because I think I should have been told NO, BE SMART! SELL IT AND DIVERSIFY NOW. LET'S DISCUSS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE SOMEDAY. 

Anyway, I made dumb decisions, and probably have continued to quietly make dumb mistakes over the years. 

So Reddit, is there such a thing as someone with wisdom across a breadth of financial topics whose job it is to get in my personal business with me and my wife with the everyday stuff as well as the long term stuff?

personalfinance,Judgment/Collection 2012 - HELP!,"First off I live in Texas and you don't need to tell me how dumb I was because I'm well aware. I co-signed for an apartment with my ex boyfriend back in 2012 and he lived there maybe a month or two and then skipped out on the rent. I checked my credit report recently and realized that the apartment complex has now put the debt $3,300 and also a judgment of $799 which also has a compound interest rate at about 4% annually. 

I want to settle this debt but I am trying to figure out the best way to go about it. My concern is that if I call them then they will be able to try to take my car which is completely paid off and fairly new. The debt is with ProCollect which I have read some posts about and they sound absolutely terrifying but I'm wondering if anyone has had experience paying off old apartment judgments with success? Would settling this debt and getting the judgment somehow satisfied be an option? Should I bring an attorney into the matter and not contact them at all? 

Has anyone had success with calling on 5 year old collections with a judgment and offering a 50% settlement offer? Any advice is much appreciated....",finance
datascience,Relevant Experience without Graduate Degree,"Currently, I'm about to graduate with a double major in Math and Economics (course equivalent to a master's in Econ.) Unfortunately, they won't let me transfer that into a graduate program, so I'd have to start all over for a master's. 

I'm a non traditional student and am adverse to graduate school at this point.

How hard would it be to find work in data science doing statistical modeling if I had relevant experience? Right now I'm competitive for a research position at a Federal Reserve branch, and, if hired, would gain significant research experience in econometrics (time series analysis, linear regression, linear probability, etc) with large data sets using Python, C++, SQL, and a few other languages. I would argue that I would, in fact, already be doing data science, but the job is meant to be a stepping stone for PhD programs, and only a two year contract.

personalfinance,Treading Water. Looking for honest outside analysis and thoughts!,"**Warning!**... This probably turn into a wall of text.

Alright, I'm getting increasingly stressed out with my wife and I's current financial situation. I am hoping that when I have my review this week and the coming raise along with it, we will get a little more breathing room and be able to pay down more on our debts, but of course those are famous last words. 

I am just looking for some honest advice from an outside eye with our actual scenario rather than reading cookie cutter plans online.

I have been around this sub, /r/FinancialPlanning, /r/financialindependence for a while and try to read all I can and soak up information for now and to use in the future with investments. However, right now and for the past year or two I've been in a slump.

My logistics job currently is steady though not really something I enjoy, but I can't take a risk finding something else financially, and I do like the people I work with, especially my boss and head of the company. It is smaller and family owned with a large potential for expansion in another venture in the field we already are in starting in November(possible large expansion come first of the year as well). 

My wife is a recent college graduate(2016) and is a music teacher. I was living in central PA while she was finishing school and moved to NJ to be closer to where she was able to get a teaching job just outside of NYC while I went from a ~35min/30mi commute each way, to switching warehouses I work out of and now having a 75min/74mi commute each way driving from NJ to PA every day.

I will copy an example of the budget I have set up below, but in addition to that we both have Mint accounts and within the last couple months added each others accounts so we can get a more full financial picture with our budgets and incomes.

My take home normally is about $3800/mo and hers is $2900/mo. Provided my review goes as planned my take home should increase to $4700/mo, but that isn't seen yet so isn't factored in currently. All that sounds great except with out budgeted income of $6580/mo, our bills total $6350 currently according to Mint.

My rent in PA was $550/mo for a small 1bd apartment, in order to find anything worth living in close to the main highway for our commute, we are currently paying $2380/mo in rent for a 2bd apartment which we are in until next July after we renewed our lease this past August. We signed an 11mo lease vs 12mo because we likely will move next summer and with the school years schedule for my wife a move in August wouldn't work well.

I had built up some cc debt after I moved from home in Maine after graduation, to PA. That amounted to ~$7,000 which I had consolidated onto a Barclay Card with 0% interest for balance transfer, and was paying regularly. I had also gotten a Chase Sapphire Preferred to build up points towards traveling for our honeymoon which was this past July. In addition to paying my consolidation payment, I was successfully paying off the CSP in full monthly until we moved in to this new apartment last August of '17. Between moving expenses, a few smaller purchases here and there getting settled in, and a little from our wedding expenses I wasn't able to cover in cash(most of which we did save for over the 7-8mo preceding the wedding) the card stopped being paid off monthly, ballooned up to 6 figures.

Current debts are as follows:

Mine: 

-Federal Student Loans: ~45k split between Subsidized and Unsubsidized.(This was income based repayment until Jan '16 when I switched to extended graduated repayment, so there is an end in sight even at minimums.)
-Car loan: Current payoff quote $14,015.94. Payment is ~300/mo at 4.74%. 72mo loan started in Jan '16. 20 payments made, 52 to go.

-PayPal Credit: $1,526 currently interest free.

-Barclay Consolidation Transfer: $6,592.49 20-25%.

-Chase Amazon Rewards: $1,391.58 20-25%.

-CSP: $14,596.11 20-25%(I cant put my hand on the interest rate current for these)

-BestBuy CC: $1,579.84 20-25%.

Hers:
-Car: Just purchased to replace old beater. This payment is starting November and is $400/mo.
-No other debts. Her college was paid for, has a $300 line cc from her home bank, and is an authorized user on my CSP. No other accounts of her own, just what I have added her to of mine.

We currently have about $3500 in leftover wedding money in a savings account, and should have several hundred leftover at the end of the month in checking as far as cash on hand goes. 

I had a 720 credit score when we moved into this apartment in August of '16, but our usage is now at ~88% and my score has dropped to ~650 from carrying all the debt. Hers is around or a little over 700 we found when she applied for her car loan which was lower than her FICO shows, but not bad for the history or lack thereof that she has. I have not missed a payment and all accounts are in good standing. My downfalls are usage and my length of time established is not quite excellent as the oldest is still just over 3-4 years only.

Here is what I have for our October budget below.

I have seriously looked into cutting cable down as we barely use it, but the options for just internet are limited. Still something I’m looking into further. The cell phone bill should go down as well with finally getting a work phone tomorrow which should allow me to cut my current personal family plan down since most of my data usage is for work and will be on that phone. 

As far as gas, that is from my 150mi/day commute and my wife drives 80mi herself and gets poorer mileage driving with the NYC traffic. We also in the fall work longer with my increased workload getting closer to the holidays and she has marching band until 10 most of the week so we order out probably twice a week which should realistically be once or not at all, but with our schedules I’m not sure that will change as we already barely have time to cook one food to last 3 nights with something like macaroni or burritos to fill in the other ‘non take out’ nights. 

I am genuinely looking for opinions on the situation and how best we should move forward to tackle this effectively. Thank you for any ideas you guys can offer.

personalfinance,Tax Questions after being unemployed for 6 months and now a 1099 Employee,"Hey all,   
Somewhat complicated situation here but I will attempt to explain as concisely as possible. Extremely appreciative of any advice.    
  
January 5th of this year, I was laid off from my job, I began collecting unemployment at $450/week ($1800/month), but my expenses were pretty high ($900 rent, $400 car/insurance, $400 student loans, without even getting into food, etc.) so I started to acquire credit card debt to pay my bills while trying to find a job. It ended up taking me 8 months to find a job, the last two with no unemployment because it had run out.    
  
All in all, I ran up to about $14k in credit card debt.  
Fortunately, in August, I landed a great job that has me on pace to make around $100k (it's commission so hard to guess exactly, but this past week I made $2200, the week prior was $1700, etc). The only downside is that this job is 1099 until I get converted to full time in January.  
  
**Here is my question** - I currently have not been setting aside any money from my salary or bonuses for tax purposes like you should with a 1099 job, and instead have been putting every extra penny into my credit card debt - so far I am down about 6.5k, with 7.5k left to go.  
  
I am aware that I am going to get slammed with a large tax bill for this, but is it still the smarter move to continue this strategy until I am debt free? My line of thinking is that since the interest rate is 22%+, I should handle that first, then try to save some money for my tax burden later.  
I also did not have any income tax taken out of unemployment, but from what I understand the percentage of income tax I owe on that is relatively low.  
  
If anyone could help me out here and tell me if my strategy is a good one, or if I am making a mistake and should start setting aside money for my taxes right away, I would really appreciate it.  
  
Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"I've read that driving for uber and others (amazon flex, postmates, etc.) is a bad deal, could someone help me crunch the numbers on it?","So I'm really strongly considering driving for amazon flex because it's the only type of work that fits into my schedule right now. 

Here's what I know, it would be really appreciated if someone could help me fill in the gaps or let me know if I'm wrong.

As a 1099 contractor, I'll be paying a flat 15% of all income to payroll taxes. This leaves me with about $15 or every $18/hr that amazon flex pays. Considering I probably wont be making more than $10k/yr, and that I'll be deducting gas and mileage from my taxes, my federal tax liability should be pretty low, if not zero. 

I currently drive a toyota corolla with 130k miles on it. I do my own maintenance. Oil change every 3k miles costs me $30 and an hour or so of my time. Other minor maintenance like air filter, fluids, brakes don't cost much. I don't expect my car to need any kind of major maintenance in the near future based on how reliable corollas are. 

My car gets about 30 MPG, gas costs about $2.60/gallon where I live. From what I've been reading, Amazon Flex delivery routes or ""blocks"" are usually are only about 20 miles. Throw in another 20 miles (generously) to get to the warehouse, etc. and I'm spending less than $5 in gas. I don't care about depreciation because my car isn't worth much and I'm going to buy a new one in about a year when I graduate from school and start my career anyway. 

So, assuming I do a 3 hour ""block"" which pays a flat rate of $54, I'll be paying $5 in gas, $8 in taxes, and call it $10 for depreciation and other maintenance (which I think is high, but that's a conservative estimate). So that's $31 in my pocket for 3 hours or work, or about $10/hr. I'd be more than happy to make that much right now, and it would only be short term (like 8 months max). 

So, what do you think?",finance

I got a letter in the mail that I had personal interest rates as low as 2% variable, 3% fixed. I've been through this before, but decided to see if I could get a lower rate anyway. I went to the link on the Citizen's bank website, which was under my name, a personalized account number, jumped through the rest of the personal info hoops, and ended up with a 5 year fixed refinance rate of 3.5% or so. 


Great! It's better than my current rate of 4.375% and I'm aware it includes autopay which is fine. I go to apply, give all my info, and my new rate is.... 8% for 5 years fixed with a possible drop to 5.8% with autopay and loyalty.


Seriously, what the hell? I have a stable job in a STEM field, making decent money, and have a credit score over 800. Only debt is a car (above water) and my student loans (less than 1 year gross income).


I assume there's no way I can beat my current loan of 4.375% for 5 years (3 remaining) on a remaining balance of about $52k, but this is just some shady shit.


Thought I'd vent.


P.S. If it matters, I'm currently and still plan to overpay my loan to be done in less than 3 years, I just want as much money to go to principle as possible. Right now I'm around $200 interest per payment, the less interest the happier I am.",finance

My thoughts drifted towards what I stood to lose if this were to happen. It's my opinion that the latter stages of the business cycle are are coming, so it's more a question of when than if.


Then I started thinking about redistributing my assets. ""I need to prepare for the onslaught,"" I thought. I thought that maybe I should be contrarian and buy more bonds with the profits I've made from equities. 


Then when I was looking at my balances it hit me. My asset allocation has changed drastically since I first started investing 4 years ago (yes, I'm and novice). My allocation to bonds had fallen 50%, from 30 to 15%. 


Why? In the longest running bull market in history, it seemed pretty stupid to be putting 30% in bonds. Im sure many here will agree. My equities have been doing so well, naturally I want to keep up that allocation and perhaps buy more (which I have). Pair this with the animosity towards bonds in this *projected* rising interest rate environment and you have the perfect storm, in my case, for asset allocation creep.


That's my anecdote. I'm sure there are many here who have fallen into a similar pattern. Initially I wrote ""fallen victim to,"" but realized no one has fallen victim yet. The market hasn't peaked. It won't be until the tides change when we realize we have fallen victim to the trend and the times.


Maybe you disagree? Maybe I've got it wrong. All I want is discussion. What do you think? Will the 100% equity portfolios truly be enjoying their ostensible advantage over persons with bonds? Has your assets allocation changed? Am I blowing smoke up my own ass?


Bottom line is I believe this is a concept that is not discussed nearly enough on this forum. Let's change that.

personalfinance,No credit score. Been stupid with student loan debt. I have questions.,"Please bear with me; I'm sort of scared and I may ramble. Thanks in advance for reading.

I have finally, at 36 years old, decided to actually deal with my money situation. I know I should not have waited so long, and it fills me with crippling anxiety daily.

My situation: I went to college on a series of scholarships and federal loans.  I could not get a job in my field until several months after graduation, and having an on-campus job I had to give up after graduation, being rurally isolated, and being plain ragged stupid meant I was making no money for six months.

Obviously, student loans came calling for repayment immediately. I was very stupid and scared, and didn't pay them -- not that I had anything to pay them with.  Even when I started working in a low-pay entry level position, I could barely pay rent.

Wage garnishment followed for several years, of course.  I went through a lot of phone calls that terrified me, a few settlements, etc.  

In all this, I have never had a credit card. My last loan was an auto loan in 2008, from my local-yokel bank that I've had accounts with since I was a kid (meaning they probably didn't even check my credit). I discharged the loan years ago.

But still the specter of student loans was there. It's been 13 years since graduation, and I realize how utterly dumb I've been. First step was admitting it. The next step was facing up to the credit score, which I was sure would be abysmal. But it's like that nagging pain in your chest -- just because you don't go to the doctor to get it checked, it doesn't mean there isn't a problem. 

So I checked it...and it doesn't exist. I have no credit score.  

All the bills I pay (on time, always) are in my husband's name.  I'm not even listed on our mortgage because I was so afraid my debt would put the house in jeopardy.

So, questions:

Shouldn't I have a score -- even a super terrible one?  Why or why not?

My debts have been sold off, fractioned, etc. since graduation. How do I track down what I still might owe? I can't pay it if I don't figure out where it is.  I don't get bills anymore, but occasionally I get collection calls, which I check into before paying off.

If I start building credit now (through one of the very well-explained options in the sidebar, thank you so much) is it going to cause a problem? 

Thanks forever from the bottom of my heart for your help.  It's a small relief to be starting this. It'll be an intense relief to fix it.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking guidance on tracking student loans,"Good afternoon ya'll, to start out with, thanks for the help.

Here's my situation-

I recently graduated college with a lot of student debt. Thankfully my family is rather well off and my father offered to pay off most of my loans so I can pay him back at a lower, fixed interest rate over 10 years. I'm a finance major so I understand which of my loans to have him pay off, ect. but what I don't know how to do is track this loan with my father.

Is there a good website out there that enables me to set up a loan so my dad and I can view my progress on paying off his loan to me. I want to be able to track the principal decreasing and when payments are due, ect. 

Thanks for the help",finance
personalfinance,Salary is increasing 4x. How can I prepare?,"I am young, single, and debt-free. I have always earned below the federal poverty line. I am currently accepting a position with a 45-50k salary (I haven't finished negotiating).

If I avoid lifestyle creep, I will have tens of thousands leftover. What should I know ahead of time going into this situation? I hope to put most of my income into investing, saving, and retirement accounts.
I know to use my employer's retirement matching and other tax-exempt accounts. I currently have a personal IRA I can max out.

personalfinance,"I received an email notifying me that a payment was processed and received using my SSN via Pay1040.com, but I did not make the payment. What should I do?","I received an email from Pay1040.com stating the following:

*Thank you for using Pay1040’s Online Payment Service at www.pay1040.com. This email confirms that your federal tax payment was received and processed by PAY1040 on 10/8/2017 8:22 AM CT. The IRS will use this date as the effective date of your payment. Typically, it takes the IRS 5 to 7 business days to post this payment to your account. Your confirmation number is 4841123. If you would like a paper receipt, please visit www.pay1040.com and select the Payment Verification option located under Taxpayer Tools at the top of the page.*

I verified the site was legitimate, navigated to the website and called their support number. The associate on the phone informed me that a payment was posted using a Mastercard, a card which I do not have. Further, I was informed that the SSN, email, phone number and address associated with the payment all match mine.

I have already frozen my credit with all three bureaus following the Equifax breach. I am not due a refund this year and still owe approximately $10,000 for FY2016, so it does not seem like my tax refund is in jeopardy. Is that line of thinking correct?

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans,"Highly considering refinancing a portion of my student loans.  I have parent plus loans of about 60k at weighted interest of 6.7%, 28k in stafford loans at 4.14%, and 13k in perkins at 5%.  I'm really just considering refinancing the the parent plus loans.  I believe it will get me a slightly better rate, allowing me to contribute more towards the principal, faster. It will also get the debt out of my parents name which would make me feel better. I would then probably just make minimums on my perkins and stafford, maybe even doing an extended plan on them to put more towards the refinanced parent plus loans.

What do you guys think about this plan?  What downsides do you potentially see here or with refinancing student loans in general.

I'm aware that I lose some of the federal benefits of paying off student loans but I don't really see much of a downfall.  I have really good credit for my age at about 770 and I'm a civil engineer so I don't anticipate any issues with job security.",finance

The company I'll be working with offers a 50% match up to the federal limit, and I plan on fully contributing 18k every year once I start.

personalfinance,Re-financing Multiple Types of Loans at Once,"I am wondering if I can re-finance multiple types of loans at the same time.

I have an auto-loan at ~7.3% interest with outstanding balance remaining. I also have about 5 private student loans (these are the main reason I am trying to re-finance and consolidate). Yes, I was financially stupid at age 17, my mother was my co-signer and has horribly credit, giving me terrible rates (we're talking, 9.5, 10.5, *11.5%*). Nevermind the fact that we are involved in each other's lives zero percent anymore (kind of unimportant but I don't like having her on anything of mine).

If I am able to receive a re-financing offer, could I, in theory, include both loan-type balances in my ""desired re-finance amount""?

I would then have all of my loans consolidated in one-lump sum payment. I'm not necessarily trying to lower my monthly payment since I don't want to extend my time being in debt, I just want to simplify everything. Dealing with 6 different payments each month gets annoying, and my interest rates are *bad* (my auto loan is my lowest rate).

Re-financing is a smart choice for me. I have found an offering of rates between 5.25% and 5.5%, much better than all of my other rates. Not as low as I would have hoped, but I will take what I can get.

Also, if this is a good idea for me to do, I am wondering how the lien works on my car's title? If I pay off the loan with re-finance funds, do I then get the title? In this instance, should I have to sell the car or anything, I could just sell it and apply the funds to the now-single-consolidated loan (probably taking a loss of some money, but whatever). At least then I would have the title and be able to sell it with the title in-hand.

Thoughts? Is this sort of thing allowed?",finance

personalfinance,How to best pay off debt and avoid homelessness?,"Backstory: Trying to keep a long story short, my financial issues started in college. I was going to Pace in NYC and my tuition ($50k per year) was being paid in about 50% scholarship 50% financial aid. A few months into my 3rd year my enrollment was dropped because my finances couldn't be verified so I lost all my financial aid. This was because my parents hadn't filed their taxes for the previous year, because they were/are going through a divorce. My mom has never worked but always was the one who made sure my dad (self employed) paid his taxes. After exhausting many many options to fix this I ended up leaving Pace, and moving back home to Long Island. At this point I had $30k in student loans from Pace and owed them $5k for dorming part of the semester. I started working a minimum wage job, trying to pay off the $5k I owed Pace for dorming and applied to state schools nearby. I knew I would need my Pace transcripts to transfer to a new school, and you can't get your official transcripts released when you owe a school money, but I also knew that Pace has horribly disorganized administrative offices so I sent in the transcript request anyway and Pace made a mistake and sent my official transcripts. (So grateful for this mistake) So I started at Farmingdale State College asap, took 75% of my classes online, worked a lot to pay as much of the tuition as possible, and I graduated in 2015, a year later than I would have graduated from Pace. Once I was a student again my loans were put on hold but I wasn't able to pay off the Pace dorming bill so that ended up going to collections with 33% fees added. So when I graduated in May 2015 I owed collections $4K, I owed Farmingdale $9k, and I owed Fedloan about $30k. I got a job right away in NYC making $35k a year, and paid off the debt collectors as soon as possible. Unfortunately I decided to listen to some really bad advice, which was that Farmingdale wasn't going to hunt me down for that $9k for years, because I graduated so they assume I'll eventually pay it. So I forgot about that bill and started trying to save up to move out of my home on long island, to be closer to work. I also got a credit card to help fix my credit score, well a few credit cards. Then a few months ago I got a letter saying that I had 4 months to pay farmingdale the $9k in full, or it was going to the debt collectors. I really didn't want to deal with debt collectors again so I paid them all of my savings and pretty much all of my income for the last 4 months. I was able to get them completely paid 2 weeks ago, but in the process racked up a lot of credit card debt.  Also, this week my parents told me that no one has paid mortgage on the house in years, and they're now selling it and planning to put it up for sale in a few weeks. My dads planning on getting an apartment somewhere on Long Island that I can stay in until I can afford my own apartment, but I already spend 3+ hours a day commuting and his apartment will probably be even longer of a commute so I'm not sure what I'm going to do. **(end of back story)**





My questions now are what is the best way to pay back my debt, and how do I begin to plan on saving for an apartment at some point? 





I'm in the REPAYE student loan forgiveness program, which means my fed loan payments are 10% of my discretionary income per month, for 20 years. And then at the end of that 20 years the balance gets ""forgiven"" but I need to pay taxes on the amount forgiven. Right now I pay $160 a month for that, but the balance of that loan keeps going up because I'm paying less than the monthly interest, its at about $40k. I also just applied for a NY state program called ""get on your feet"" that I should get accepted for, and that will make my payments for me for 2 years. I also have  a private student loan I pay $40 a month towards. Below is a breakdown of all my debt:




Federal Student Loans: 



Balance: $25k Min Payment: $100 Interest: 6.55%



Balance: $3.7k Min Payment: $15 Interest: 4.25%



Balance: $10.5k Min Payment: $43 Interest: 3.15%



Private Student Loan: 



Balance: $1.7k Min Payment: $40 Interest: 5%




**Total Balance: $41k Total Monthly Payment $198**




Credit Cards:



Capital1 Quick Silver1: $1.2k Min Payment: $25 APR: 24%



Chase United MileagePlus: $1.9k Min Payment: $25 APR: 24%



Chase Sapphire Pref: $3.7k Min Payment: $25 APR: 24%



Chase Freedom Unlimit: $500 Min Payment: $25 APR: 0% 




**Total Credit Card Debt: $7.3k** Min monthly payments $100




My expenses are: $350 a month for the rail road to get to work, and somewhere between $80 and $115 a month for the subway because I need to take it every morning but dont always need to take it at night. Working in manhattan food is pretty expensive, when I'm trying to be stingey I still end up spending at least $200 a month on food and groceries. I'm also in a long distance relationship that costs me $40 to $80 a month in transportation which I can not really cut back on for the sake of my mental health. 




Total Monthly expenses: about $800 a month




**Take home pay: $2,040 per month**, plus $0-$300 in overtime pay (I work overtime any time I have an excuse to)



So what do I do? Should I be paying my credit cards aggressively? Paying my loans aggressively? I know I can't make payments directly to the principal balance of my loans, the principal can only be paid if the interest amount is $0. Should I pay them both moderately and save up for an apartment? Should I ""donate"" my eggs? Should I just keep [writing in](http://send.ellentv.com/be-on-the-show/1206) to Ellen Degeneres? Declare bankruptcy? All advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,Is long term health insurance worth it?,"Crossposted from financialplanning

I work for a county government that does not pay into state disability. My husband and I are in good health, in our mid-30s, both work federal/state/county jobs, and do not plan to have children.  We already have life insurance, but I’m worried about when we are older/Have major health problems. I was presented with a transamerica and fidelity plan for $400 a month in which we would receive  immediate monies for any cancer diagnosis and would receive up to one million dollars for me, $200,000 for my spouse if we needed long term health care.  Otherwise, it would be a life insurance payout if one of us died.

My husband said that it’s a scam and that we could always apply for disability if we needed long term health care/had to go into a nursing home.  Is he right?  Is this all a scam or not worth paying for?  Should I cancel the policy (just signed up)?  

Thank you for your help.

personalfinance,Worth it to put part of my emergency fund in a CD?,"I'm currently securely employed in a rather high paying job. I have saved six months income as an emergency fund. I am considering putting some of this in one or more certificates of deposit so I can earn more on it than just letting it sit in a savings account. I have several ideas actually.


(1) is it wise to put this money in an online savings account, e.g. Ally, for a better interest rate? What could the downsides be, compared with keeping it with my brick and mortar bank?


(2) should I put three months of it in one or more CDs? I'm thinking I could do one months worth of money in a 5 year CD with the best interest rate, then two months in a 1 year CD. Obviously, I have concerns about what happens if I incur a cost requiring more than the 3 months' cash not locked in a CD.

btc,Is Segwit2x the REAL banker takeover? Part two:,"Please read first, Is Segwit2x the real Banker takeover? Part 1: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/743qb8/is_segwit2x_the_real_banker_takeover/

Now begins Part 2:

This is Ben Davenport, the CTO of Bitgo, the company in charge of Segwit2x development. Here he admits he wants to restrict block size to push people onto LN:

https://twitter.com/bendavenport/status/831319684632846336

Recall that in Part 1 we read that Bitgo is overseeing **development** for Segwit2x. Bitgo has a product that relies on on chain transactions and 0-conf not working very well, they want to sell you insurance against your transaction not getting confirmed in the blockchain.

This guy seems to have an interest in NOT scaling on chain. He openly admits he wants restricted block size to push people onto LN. His company has a product that relies on 0-conf not working, **and relies on there being the potential for your transaction to not get confirmed in the blockchain:** IF these guys wanted to scale on chain, there would be no reason why your transaction wouldn't get confirmed on Segwit2x, and their product that is protection against that, would have little value. So they need blocks to be full: 

**""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**

Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions 

So this guy is trying to make money from your transactions not being confirmed efficiently. If blocks aren't full, this isn't ever an issue. CLEARLY he doesn't want to see Bitcoin scale on chain to reach billions of users in a decentralized fashion and he clearly has a HUGE financial incentive to make sure on chain scaling doesn't happen, or is at least severely limited.

So that's Ben Davenport, CTO of Bitgo, the company in charge of overseeing Segwit2x development. You think this guy wants to help build a Decentralized Peer to Peer Cash system?  

Let's go above his head now, back to DCG (Digital Currency Group.) DCG is the group mainly spearheading the Segwit2x ""scaling"" proposal. We know from the Part 1 of this post that DCG's board is made up of various central bankers, including Glenn Hutchins, who is a currently sitting Board Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York:

""Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Hutchins

As well as Lawrence H. Summers, ex-chief economist for the World Bank, with strong ties to the federal government and the guy responsible for the removal of Glass-Steagal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

If you are not clear on these details and who these Bankers are, please go back and review Part 1, DCG's Board of Central Bankers (a.k.a. Advisors) is all very clearly laid out in Part 1.   

Back to DCG: Barry Silbert (Ex Banker, Houlihan Lokey) is the CEO of DCG. Mastercard (Bankers) is the investor in DCG. What does Mastercard think about decentralized Peer to Peer cash? Let's have a look: 

https://youtu.be/Tu2mofrhw58?t=167

""We at Mastercard are not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies, largely because they go against the whole principal that we have established our business on which is really moving to a world beyond cash ensuring greater transparency, security and simplicity in the way people live their lives. If you think about it Cash is a problem for a number of countries. Cash really facilitates anonymity, it facilitate illegal activity, it facilitates tax avoidance...and a range of other things that aren't going to drive efficiency in an economy. Trust is a critical component of any payment system. So if you think about the idea that all of a sudden your having cryptocurrencies being ""manufactured"" if you like on an anonymous computer in an anonymous location, it's completely legitimate to have some concerns about how that might be working. What a regulator wants to do is ensure there is a fully compliant root to the transaction, that they understand who is making the transaction, who the payment is being made to and that they have a suitable record so they can ensure there is credential control over the system. If it's an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction. Why does someone need to be anonymous? **I certainly don't want anyone mining technology or mining financial services away from my control, particularly if they're going represent something from me.""**

That last sentence really hit home... ""I certainly don't want anyone mining technology or mining financial services away from my control, Particularly if they're going to be representing something from me."" Which they **will** be representing something from him, IF Segwit2x goes through and becomes the main chain. So right here he says he doesn't want people to be mining things outside his control, especially if they represent him. **This is a huge red flag to me.**

There you have it. Mastercard is CLEARLY and openly an enemy of cash, cryptocurrencies, and it sounds like freedom in general. They do not even attempt to hide this. He came out and CLEARLY said Cash is a problem, said they don't like anonymous transactions, said anonymous transactions are suspicious, said they want to be able to track everything, all the way back to a ""Root"" where there is forced compliance. **These people want to control you. They want to control what you do with your money. These are the people that we are trying to escape from to begin with.** They're right under out in the open, funding DCG and spearheading Segwit2x, looking to restrict block size to push everyone onto L2, which THEY control. Once they've got you on there, they want to keep track of your transactions and ensure compliance. **THIS IS THE SEGWIT2X ROADMAP, PEOPLE!** Clear as fucking day, Segwit2x is bankers taking over the blockchain, removing the peer to peer cash aspect and **forcing** you to comply with their bullshit. 


So, let's recap:

- Mastercard is an investor in DCG. Mastercard HATES freedom and Peer to Peer cash, as indicated in the OP, clear as day. It is no secret that Mastercard wants to control you and your transactions, ensuring compliance. They think Cash is a bad thing, and anonymous transactions are suspicious. They don't want anyone ""mining anything away from their control.""

- Mastercard invested into DCG, which is the company spearheading Segwit2x. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert (Banker.) DCG's Board of advisors include Glenn Hutchins (FED Bank of New York) and Lawrence Summers (Banker and former Chief Economist, responsible for the removal of Glass Steagal.) **A majority of DCG's Board of Advisors are bankers.**

- DCG invested into Bitgo. Bitgo is the company responsible for development on the Segwit2x fork. The CEO of Bitgo admits he wants full blocks to push people onto L2. Also, they're selling a service that protects you against a Blockchain not working properly, which should never be happening. 

So... Freedom hating and privacy hating Mastercard invested into DCG, whose Board of Directors is made up almost entirely of Central Bankers, and then DCG invested into Bitgo, the company developing for Segwit2x that doesn't want your transactions to go through efficiently so they can sell you protection against it not going through. 

Let's be clear...All three of these entities have a financial interest in Peer to Peer cash NOT working out for the people of the world. They do not want you to have privacy. They do not want your transactions to be immutable. They want to control you AND your money and it is not a secret. They know they can't do this if we're all transacting on chain, decentralized. **But they can control your transactions if they restrict block size and push you onto L2.** It's that simple guys. Their goal is restricting on chain capacity to push you onto their Layer 2 systems which aren't decentralized and by most interpretations, **aren't even Bitcoin.** Understand that this means that when presented with the choice of increasing block size or not, they will be presented with a choice of giving people more freedom and cheaper transactions (by increasing the block size), or giving themselves more control and more profit by restricting it. In the mind of a banker, which option makes sense?

These guys have made their intentions clear as day, right out in the open. You may still be thinking that miners can enforce their will somehow here. But HOW? If DCG controls the Github repo, they control development of the main full node implementation, right? If they control development, they control increases in block size. Would DCG, Mastercard and Bitgo, entities that seek to profit off of restricted block size, allow increasing the block size at will to scale? Fat chance. They're going to keep it restricted so everyone has to use their L2. It's not even a secret, they say it loud and clear.

**Let me spell this out for you guys: BANKERS ARE TAKING OVER THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN. MASTERCARD FUNDED DCG WHO IS SPEARHEADING SEGWIT2X. DCG FUNDED BITGO WHO IS DOING DEVELOPMENT. ALL THREE OF THESE COMPANIES STAND TO LOSE A LOT IF PEER TO PEER CASH IS A THING. ALL THREE OF THESE ENTITIES WILL LIKELY BE ACTING IN THEIR ECONOMIC SELF INTERESTS, WHICH IS TO RESTRICT BLOCK SIZE AND PUSH PEOPLE ONTO LAYER 2 SO THEY CAN CONTROL EVERYONES TRANSACTIONS.** 

Sorry guys, this is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. But, I leave you with one last though:

Segwit2x is a culmination of mutually incompatible interests attempting to manifest themselves on a shared chain. It can't work long term because the interests of the miners and the interests of the Bankers will be pitted against each other each time the transaction limit is reached and blocks get full again. There will be debate over whether to scale on chain or off chain each time. The only way this ends is with a chain split anyway. The Cash fork IS that chain split and the miners were smart enough to do it before the first Segwit transaction ever occurred, preserving the original ledger, ensuring Satoshi's Vision of Decentralized Peer to Peer cash is not lost. :] Bitcoin Cash is the original Bitcoin, Bitcoin with Segwit is the changed vision that represents a loss to both miners and users in terms of usability. 

With this said, the economic incentives of Miners, Users and Speculators are all aligned. Users want low fees. Miners want capacity and freedom to increase block size without asking permission from Bankers that control the implementation. Speculators want profit and right now you get 16 coins on the Cash fork for one coin on the BTC fork. Seems to me, the incentives are aligned to make something great happen. :]",cryptocurrency

So I had a federal grant - specifically an [NRSA](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/f32) from 2013~2014. This grant gave me a small stipend ~$40k/year and some additional funds for supplies/sciencing/etc. I reported the stipend as income (as *pretty* sure was supposed to do) and paid state (CA) and federal taxes on it.

Interesting thing is that if you don't complete the term of the grant (at least 2 of the 3 years), you have to pay part back to the US government. I left my public science job to go work in the private sector before time was up so I had to pay back part of the money.

Fast forward to this year when I had to cut a check for ~$25k (~$24k was direct payback, the remainder was an obscene interest charge!).

Question is, can I deduct this money from my income taxes? If so:

* Can I deduct the full amount?

* Can I deduct the interest?

* Do I do it for *current* tax year or do I have to file an amended return?

* This might be from 2013 tax year (need to confirm), is there some statue of limitations?

Regardless, thinking that I might need to actually have an accountant do my taxes this year so that I don't fuck this (and a few other things up), what would I call this situation to see if the accountant has any understanding/experience before moving forward with them?

Thanks for any info you can provide, I have been searching on this for **literally** years but think I have not phrased the problem appropriately.

My current living situation gives me until about the end of the year to find a house or move back to an apartment.

As of now, YTD I've earned $62,800 before tax and $41,500 after tax, benefits, 401k, deductions, etc. Based on this trend, I anticipate earning around $77,700 before tax and taking home around $52,000. My compensation is based off of a base of about $34,000 plus commission, so it tends to vary +/- 500 month to month.

My credit score has been impacted by high credit card balances. I had a few things I needed to use them for over the last few months and haven't been able to pay the balance down as quick as I would have liked. I recently acquired a private loan with a relatively low interest rate (lower than what the credit cards were) to zero out my credit card debit. This will help move my credit score from where it currently is around 620 to around 740. I don't have any serious delinquency or anything on my credit score.

Other than that line of credit (payments are about $350 per month for 24 months) I have my car payment which is $360 and that is it. I'm not contractually obligated as part of a lease, no student debt, or anything else. Other expenses include cell phone bill ($75), car insurance ($125), and that's pretty much it at this point.

I have the 3.5% to 4.5% to put down to satisfy the down payment on an FHA loan if I qualify for one. I'm interested in homes priced from 250k-275k which would come to about $1200-1500/mo with my planned down payment, insurance, PMI, estimated interest, and HOA (if applicable).

With all of that information provided, my questions would be:
1) Will I be able to have a good chance at securing a loan to buy a home? What other things that I haven't considered would a lender be looking at?
2) Since I've paid my credit card bills down to zero, the credit scores have not updated yet. Do I need to wait until they do so to try and begin the pre-approval process?

I know, I know. Be smart with your credit cards. They can cause headache later in life. Well I totally understand that now. Lesson learned.

Here’s what’s going on. I grew a bunch of credit card debt due to family issues. And a bad decision to move out. I’ve gathered about 4,000 dollars in total. I’ve been trying my best to keep on top of one of the two cards. But I just can’t seem to put enough money on to make it go down. I have a thought. I’m a student. Who has a Student line of credit through my bank. Which has low interest rates of prime plus 1%. Would it be a good idea to eliminate my credit dept by paying the card or cards off with my line of credit. Then canceling the one credit card. And lowering the limit on the other. After that I’d only be paying the one bill at the end of the month. And at the lower interest rate. Or would this be an issue down the road for me again?

personalfinance,"Good idea/bad idea, or: Help me figure out if and why this is a bad idea - Consolidation Loan for CC debt","So, we're going to leave my dumbass past choices, income, budgets and everything else out of this, because this is a very small portion of my debt payoff strategy. I've already worked out paying half as much on food, gotten an emergency fund built, done a balance transfer to lower stuff, and am working on getting rid of as much credit debt as I can, as quickly as I can. Nothing new has gone on any cards in 6 months now. In other words, other than getting credit debt paid off, I consider myself financially healthy, thanks primarily to this sub.

So I got a message from American Express today saying I was pre-approved for a debt consolidation loan of up to $9600 with a maximum interest rate of 11.97%. If I make this a 3-year loan, the payment would be 319 a month. It does not appear to penalize for early payoff (which I damn sure will be doing), but it feels like the safest option (in case something happens and I need to pay only the minimum) is to do the 36 month loan and pay it off as quick as I can.

I would use it to pay off 2 cards:

-Chase card: balance is ~6 grand at a rate of 23.24% (yea, i know). Monthly payment is about $307.

-Citi card: balance is ~4500. Minimum monthly payment is around $80, and interest rate is 16.24%

My thought process is, get that loan, pay the Chase completely off, pay the Citi with every remaining penny then aggressively pay off the Citi followed by the loan itself. With an interest rate literally half what the larger card is, and still 5% less than the other card, I fail to see how this is a bad plan. As I said before, I'm no longer tempted by ""ooh shiny empty credit card"" as I've, well, frankly, grown the fuck up in the last 6 months and started tackling this stuff head on. I feel comfortable that it's through Amex and not Billy Bob's Totally Not a Scam Loan Emporium, too...

Ordinarily I view stuffed shirts with disdain and while I'm all for decentralized deflationary currency, this bald guy did make some sense.

Primarily his point was that governments can't afford this proliferation due to the tax revenue it will cost them.  Can't deny that as these crypto coins ascend, part of their value is derived from the fiat currencies they are displacing. They are putting a ton of deflationary pressure on reserve notes of all countries.  Combine the lower value of the tax dollars/Euros/Pounds collected with the loss of revenue as people figure out ways to evade the taxman using crypto and the bureaucracy will either collapse under the weight of hundreds of years of irresponsible spending, or they will get guys like Rogoff to come after our transactions with VATs (something us Yanks aren't exactly used to) to replace that lost revenue so irresponsible women can keep cranking out kids with no daddies.  

I'm sure this topic has been covered before, probably here, but I think it best to discuss it in light of this 5K barrier being broken.

personalfinance,So.... I think I'm screwed,"I've never been one to make much money. I'm finally working at a place where I'm making more than I ever have ($13.50/hour) but my hours haven't been so great and when they were, I didn't have any free money because I was putting towards the living situation with my parents. After I moved out and found a cheaper room for rent with included utilities (and got my parent's truck paid off, which they gave to me, long story short, mom had a stroke and couldn't drive it, I took over the payments. Plus I put the down payment on it in the first place.) I started coming down with bouts of vertigo.
Well, if it's actually vertigo, or something else closely related as far as symptoms go, that's for the doctors to hurry up and decide. But, my normal income of around $1800/month is now closer to $700/month (net). I had gotten these before, but normally about once every 2-3 months or so and didn't have the extra funds to pay for health insurance. I decided to opt for it shortly before it started getting a lot worse.
Well, on top of it, I have a college degree. Unfortunately it has me $44k in debt with no payments made, all my deferments used up, and since the college closed down, employers have actually flat-out told me nobody in my city, or likely in the US, is likely to hire me if I even list that college. I don't blame them either. From the ""watch this youtube video"" classes to the one job they set me up with that promised the moon and provided moldy cheese (Some weeks I didn't even have a check because the ""payments didn't come in yet from the clients"", highest check was around $400, but most were in the double digits with promises that things would get better.... Anywho, I just got a letter threatening to litigate now, even though I've repeatedly asked them for paperwork because the college didn't fulfill any obligations as they presented and did not provide an actual learning environment, and I've been trying for years to get the loans expunged.
Of course hospital bills too, one hospital actually sent a wage garnishment order out on me so I'm still going to be strapped if I get this whole vertigo situation fixed.

Truck needs worked on (actually needs about $3k worth), had to take a title loan out on it to make rent on a particularly bad month.
Hospital bills, Student loans are kicking my butt, I'll try calling them again tomorrow.

I've managed to get some welfare assistance to at least help with food and I got on Medicaid, so at least my current health situation is taken care of. Otherwise, even with my primary insurance, it would have been $985 out of pocket between the two visits and the FMLA paperwork signing alone. No way I could afford that and I probably would have ended up homeless by now.

Am I too far gone? Is there any light at the end of this tunnel?

[EDIT]

Update:
So, rather than contact FedLoan, I contacted the U.S. Department of Education. As soon as they heard ITT Tech, they actually gave me instructions, which is nice.
I was instructed to go to the [Student Loan Borrower Defense website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) and fill out the forms there to get the Collections stopped while they investigate. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to know there is even a possibility of getting this portion taken care of. Believe me, my credit is so shot I got denied a secured credit card of $100, and it's mostly due to my credit reporting ""debt to income"" ratio showing payments due of $4k+/month without the income to match... at least that's how it was explained to me.
This is good. This is... Yeah. I'll keep you guys updated.

[EDIT 2]

Update:
Okay, so my total Hospital/Doctor bills total to around $22k. **Or so I thought. I went to get the actual balances and... most of them dropped off the face of the earth, except for $246 worth of doctor's bills between all three agencies.** Not sure what happened, but I'm counting my blessings. I was pointed to an organization called ""Adreima"" that one of my coworkers had stated actually pays his wife's hospital bills for her twice a year collectively as they build up. Looking them up, it looks like they recently were bought up by another company called ""nThrive"", but I'm going to see what they exactly offer, because the website doesn't seem to offer what he was telling me. However, what I really think I'll do is keep my head low, and do a payment plan of $5/month on each of the 9 current accounts that are showing open. $45/month isn't bad, and should put them in good standing, and show on-time payments I hope? I think that's how credit is supposed to work? **Please correct me if I am wrong**

As for the health: A week and a half ago, my neurologist put me on two medications, one preventative, one for sudden symptoms. Given that I have a history of migraines, he prescribed them to me in the hopes that since the EKG, MRIs, and his own blood work came back clean, that my more recent vertigo symptoms were an extension of my already broad spectrum of migraine types (Headache, aura vision, nausea, fatigue, in separate episodes). The preventative worked, but gave me a different feeling of dizziness, muscle weakness, difficulty staying awake for more than 6 hours at a time, and mood swings. Two days ago I was given the okay to stop taking it, and things are almost back to normal. The medication he prescribed for the sudden symptoms though, I used for the first time today, which worked in about 20-30 mins, so if this is a trend, I may be back to full-time work. My FMLA paperwork has finally been processed after months of jumping through hoops, so my records reflect none of those days as absences/tardies/leave-earlies anymore, putting me back in good standing to apply for a better position in my company. Now, once I'm back over $1600 gross (Normally I would net $1800-$1900 working full time), anything over that is going towards the wage garnishment, so I'm still on limited income until that bill gets paid, which I believe has $2100 left on it. **Oddly enough, the garnishment does not show on any of my credit reports...**

Hopefully, I can just spring for the spark plugs on my truck and that'll fix my gas situation. I've got misfires on 4 of my 8 cylinders now and I'm surprised it even runs. Anyone know how to save a ton on purchasing maintenance parts? She'll need wires and a distributor cap as well, and then I'll know whether the alternator is actually bad or not on her. As it stands, $12/day in gas to/from work x 20 work days in a month = nope. On top of it, recent dust storms and high winds damaged the paint on the passenger side now, and somehow seems to have gotten in the CD player so now it's a CD scratcher. On the plus side, this may be a blessing in disguise, depending on what my insurance says. I still gotta call them, just found out about both today.

As for actual bills and non-medical, non-school debts:
$160/month on insurance. I was recently quoted $124 by another company so I'll probably switch to them since my term is up in November.
$600/month rent.
$12/day gas to/from work. This adds up. Quick. Hence, why I had to take a title loan out until things settle.

$180 water bill - Now this.... Parents needed to put in my name because they had already not paid water bills in the past. Yay. My stepdad keep promising to pay but never does.
$220 Cox Cable/Internet - I told Cox to shut this off, but somehow it slipped through the cracks after I had moved out. They recently sent me a letter stating they'd take $180, but I don't have it just yet obviously. But, again, does not show in ANY of my credit reports... I'll let it slide for now since I haven't seen it on my credit and it's been over a year now.
$170 Centurylink - All me from years ago. Oddly enough, not showing on my credit report anymore. Definitely not been 7 years.
$340 Electric company - Also all me from years ago, letting the electricity stay on so a neighbor could leech it after I left that apartment. Her only income was federal assistance and she had thyroid cancer, was cool people, and I couldn't stand to see her without power in the Nevada desert summer temps.

Another note: As I was checking my credit, I noticed that **every single one of my student loans dropped to $0**. Not sure if temporary or not, I haven't received any correspondence from the Student Loan Borrower Defense, but I'm hoping that's permanent.


Now, for food, I get SNAP, $81/month right now, which is enough for me to buy what I need so long as I don't go for anything premade. (Unless frozen dinners are on a really good sale, like Marie Calender's dinners at under $1.50/box, which is good if there's a day I can't stand long enough to cook for myself, or for work meals. If I'm bedridden for a day, one meal will usually do it anyway.) Once I'm over $1200/month gross income, both the SNAP and the Medicaid benefits go away which means $400 to see my Neurologist each time. I hope my regular physician can handle it from there. At least I have my primary insurance still through my employer, but it's not the best when it comes to actually covering things.

personalfinance,Considering debt consolidation...need some advice,"I have a large amount of debt and have been considering a consolidation loan. I have $21,421 total debt at interest rates all exceeding 15%.I have calculated my current total monthly minimum payments to debts to be $674.85. At an average interest rate of 20%, with high balances, I'm paying $380.61 a month in interest alone. The loan I am considering is for 3 years at 15% with monthly payments of $719.61. I calculated it out that I would pay $4505 in interest over 3 years IF I only made the minimum payment. That is the same amount that I am currently paying in interest for 1 year at my current debt status. 
So just by crunching these numbers it seems like a really great idea. I have some questions though. 
The company that I am thinking about going with is Payoff. Does anyone know anything about that company and reputation?
How will a consolidation loan like this affect my ability to rent or buy housing?
How will have one large loan as apposed to 5 smaller accounts affect my credit score and my debt to income ratio?

personalfinance,"My property was destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. I qualified for a $20,000 loan with a fixed 1.7% interest rate that I don't need; do I take the loan and invest the money, or reject it?","SITUATION RESOLVED: I spoke with my case worker and she informed me that I would have to submit receipts for anything I use the money for, and that I couldn't put the money in any account other than my checking account, even if I would spend the money on replacing my things at a later date. I've decided to bite the bullet and replace my things with money I have saved (it is a fund for emergencies, after all!) and avoid taking on debt. Thanks for the feedback; its been fun!

Hi there! 
I live on the gulf coast and much of what I owned was destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. Things were rough for a while, but with help from FEMA and my employer I've landed on my feet. I was offered a $20,000 loan by the small business administration, but I don't need all that money to replace my things. I'm living in a cheap place now and have few expenses, so I'll be able to save enough to furnish my place once it's rebuilt. I'm pretty debt-averse, but I would only need to beat 1.7% to make money here. I'm leaning towards rejecting the loan, but I want to know if I'm throwing away an opportunity to make money. If I were to invest it, I would probably put it in an index fund and not touch it until I have to put a down payment on a house, send any future kids I might have to college, or until I retire. The terms of the loan were ~ $20,000, 30 years, fixed 1.7% interest rate, monthly payment of $77. I'm in my early 20s and have a stable job where I make ~ 27,000 per year with good benefits. My employer is paying for me to earn a graduate degree, which will significantly increase my earning potential after 2020. I have no debt currently. 
Thanks guys! 

EDIT: Some have said that taking this loan would be unethical. I appreciate people bringing that up; I don't want to do something that is inherently wrong. To provide some more context, the damages to my property were assessed at $20,000 +. I could use the money to replace all of my furniture and items with new ones, but I think that I can spent far less than that and refurnish my place with things I find on Craigslist. I have a little money saved up that I could use for this purpose, leaving the bulk of this potential loan money usable for investing. Does that change the ethical assessment? 

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the feedback, everyone! Keep it coming. I'm thinking now that I would put the money in a CD if I were to take the loan due to the risk of losing my principal in the market, at least until I would pay it off (which I think I could do in ~ 5 years). I still need to have an in-depth conversation with my case worker about the terms before I really decide to take it or not.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why go to the moon when you can stay in low earth orbit with Nexus?,"2 weeks ago it was VEN. Last week it was SNM. Hope you made some money. Let’s go for 3 in a row. My play for this week (and probably a lot longer) is going to be Nexus.

Here is my TL:DR about why Nexus is going to make me a ton of money, and maybe save crypto too:

* Nexus is founded by Colin Cantrell, the crypto genius son of Jim Cantrell co-founder of Space Ex and owner of Vector Space Systems.

* The two are working together to make a free, decentralized, and unregulatable, unbannable, unstoppable internet operated by cube satellites from space. 

* Nexus is orders of magnitude more difficult to be defeated with a 51% attack because it utilizes a 3d blockchain that uses CPU mining, GPU mining, and POS mining. 

* Nexus is the most future proofed currency around against quantum computers thanks to the Skein / Keccak protocols. 

* Nexus is fast, faster than lightning, faster than Visa, thanks to multithreading. It will handle over 100,000 transactions a second without needing any off-chain or centralized technology (read: Lightning)

* Nexus is coded from the ground up to be a better, faster, and lighter cryptocurrency, it is not “just another fork of such-and-such coin.”

* Nexus will be POS with the Tritium wallet with features not found in any other wallet, and it will encourage long term hodling.

* Nexus will host Dapps IN SPACE!

* Nexus will have smart contracts that can make their own smart contracts.

* Nexus and Vector Space Works are well fortified with over 50 patents relating to mesh networks and satellite constellations for free internet from space.

* Nexus will be [live streaming their latest announcements, roadmaps, and partnerships today at 12 noon PST](https://www.reddit.com/r/nexusearth/comments/75cjpq/youtube_live_on_oct_12_much_awaited/). The last time they had a conference the coin tripled in value.

Buy now, or forever hold your peace. For me though… why go to the ugly old moon, when I can enjoy low Earth orbit with Nexus?",cryptocurrency

gaming,My answer to loot crates and DLC,"A majority of the gaming community, including myself are fed up with the growing amount of paid DLC and loot crates. It's one thing to pay for cosmetic items and other aspects that don't give anyone a particular competitive advantage, but when they start becoming pay-to-win it's a problem.

My answer to this, and I'm sure most gamers may not agree, is to simply increase the price of games.

I can still remember buying games almost 15-20 years ago at $60. Hell, some N64 games cost more that that at the time. With inflation, a $60 game back then should be around $90 today.

I would like to propose AAA titles be sold for $80 in return for the understanding that DLC is always free for the life of the game and it will contain no paid loot crates. I believe this is a fair compromise as I understand AAA titles cost a lot of money to develop and they most likely need additional revenue streams after release to keep servers up and running and produce DLC. I think making everyone pay a flat rate of $80 is a reasonable compromise.

Take a look at Forza 7 for example. The regular or 'base' game is $60. The ultimate version with all the future DLC and other fixings is $100. I say we cut that right down the middle and make the whole damn thing a single version for $80.

Again, I get it. Increasing the price is not popular and $20 seems like a large jump. However, if video games would have just increased with inflation over time it wouldn't seem so drastic. I can't go out and buy a new Corvette today for $7,000 like I could back in '72, so why would video games be any different?

I'd like this to turn into a constructive conversation on the topic rather than a ""F*ck EA"" or whatever publisher/developer you hate because of paid DLC/loot crates. So please, share your ideas or comments on the topic below.",technology

personalfinance,Opinions on asset allocation,"Hello. I am considering investing €1000 every 3-6 months with Degiro (EU investor). Given my age (25), risk tolerance and available commission free etfs from the broker, my asset allocation is as below.

Amundi ETF MSCI Europe UCITS ETF 22%

Amundi ETF MSCI Emerging Markets UCITS ETF EUR 34%

Lyxor Commodities Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB TR UCITS ETF C-EUR 4%

Reasoning. I started with global market cap as reference. However, this way I would obtain a lot of exposure in US markets which are way overbought comparatively with the rest of the world. Emerging markets and in a lesser degree European markets have more sensible valuations. I omitted bonds because of the very low interest rates in the developed world, especially in EU and Japan.

personalfinance,Recently married and highly confused about adjusting my W-4,"I was recently married on Sept 30th, I am struggling to figure out how to adjust my W-4 properly.  Previously I was listed as Single with only one Federal allowance/exemption on my pay stubs.  At the beginning of the year I had 2 allowances/exemptions listed as to avoid being over taxed to place this money directly into savings myself.  Around March I was promoted and the pay raise bumped me into a new Tax bracket, therefore I reduced it down to only one exemption/allowance.  My now wife previously filed as single and I believe 1 allowance/exemption and always received a Tax return.  Now that we are married looking at our Gross Salaries 39,826 and 24,024.  I see that she will not move as far as tax brackets but I will drop back into the Tax bracket I was previously in.  

What I find confusing is after entering all the information into the IRS calculator it wants us both to file as Married with me listing 5 allowances and her listing 4....this seems way too high right?

personalfinance,HELP! Trying to decide between HDHP (GEHA) and keeping my traditional plan.,"I apologize in advance for the rather lengthy post here, but I am grateful for whatever knowledge you all may bestow on me. so backstory, I am a fed employee married (35 &amp; 36) and a child (2). I have been on BCBS Basic since joining the government and its been great. However I am considering heading over to the HDHP plan offered due to potential cost savings. I sent GEHA an e-mail asking them my questions and I got back a bunch of crypto-speak that made no sense to me. Any direction would be appreciated, Especially those of you currently in the plan.

Below is my question (Q) followed by their response (R), followed by my confusion (C).

**Q1: Co-Pays, What is the typical copay of an in Network doctor Vs Out of Network Doctor? What about for specialist, and emergency services?**

A:Covered services, including office visits, are subject to the $1,500 individual/$3,000 Self plus One or Family calendar year deductible, and are then payable at 95% of the plan allowance if rendered by an in network provider and 75% of the plan allowance if rendered by an out of network provider. Out of network providers may also bill you for any difference between the billed charge and the plan allowance. This difference does not apply to your out of pocket maximum.

C: This makes no sense to me, I still don't know how to go about finding out my doctor co-pay. And with the information, if its a copay of say $100, am I paying $100 each visit until I hit the $3K, then each visit after that would be $5 or $95?

**Q2. Prescriptions - I currently have 3 prescriptions I take that need to be refilled on a monthly basis (Listed Prescriptions) is there a way to tell what my prescriptions will cost under your plan or do I need to reach out to the Pharmacy to get that information?**

A:Please visit - https://www.caremark.com/wps/myportal/CHECK_DRUG_COST_FAST to check drug costs. *Please keep in mind that the price shown may not accurately reflect what you will pay at the pharmacy. Your actual price may vary depending on your benefit plan design, deductibles, previous payments, pharmacy-specific pricing, future claims and prior authorizations

C: So I had no luck getting anywhere on the website without having a account already set up as well as a HDHP policy, then I called the CVS's GEHAD specific customer service center and after trying about 20 minutes the lady couldn't locate a way to tell me what I could expect. Further confusing is where they say it may change, I don't know how to get a decent estimate of how much out of pocket my stuff will be.

**Q3: Blood Labs - I am required by my doctor to have routine blood tests done on a semi-annual basis, a testosterone lab, metabolic panel and overall labs (cholesterol, etc.). Is there a schedule somewhere that tells me how I would be covered under this?**

A:Covered services, including non-preventive lab charges, are subject to the $1,500 individual/$3,000 Self plus One or Family calendar year deductible, and are then payable at 95% of the plan allowance if rendered by an in network provider and 75% of the plan allowance if rendered by an out of network provider. Out of network providers may also bill you for any difference between the billed charge and the plan allowance. This difference does not apply to your out of pocket maximum.

All Preventive benefits are subject to age and gender appropriate recommendations by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) to receive preventive benefits. Well care with a well diagnosis, age 22 and older, is covered at 100% of the PPO allowance with an in-network provider. 

C: Still not sure what they are saying here, so if the tests are preventative or not I am still charge the full amount which will of course go towards my deductible then they pay 5% or 95%?

**Q4: Dental/Vision, I am a bit confused by this but am I reading correctly that in selecting the HDHP I am also placed under GEHA Dental and Vision coverage at no extra cost? I have to have perio maintenance performed on a 3-4 month schedule, does GEHA cover any of this or will it be out of pocket?**

A:Dental benefits are limited to (per person, per calendar year): 2 Exams, 2 Prophylaxis (Cleanings), 2 Fluoride (No Age Limit), and are paid at 100% of GEHA's allowable amount. X-ray charges are paid at 100%, for a maximum of $150 paid per person per calendar year (any type of x-ray). 

C: So I am still confused here, I was mainly curious if the dental coverage was a separate thing I had to sign up for during open enrollment or is it an extra benefit of the plan?  This question may be better suited for someone who has experience with this plan.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have. Unfortunately I don't know where to turn to get some more straight (or dumbed-down) answers, not really anyone in the HR area that could help me with this either.",finance

personalfinance,How can I help SO meet his potential and protect myself?,"I'm a 32f and have been involved with a 33m for about four months.

I have no debt except for a car loan with about $3k remaining. I love my career and make 75k annually, have a 401(k), and am planning to open a Roth IRA for the additional amount I save. Emergency fund in high-yield savings account. Credit score about 800.

The SO (who has already referred to me as his ""financial advisor,"" so he is open to my input) has $2k in savings, and a credit score of 590. He has two federal student loans, one at $20k that won't start accruing interest (it'll be 4.7% when it does) for another two years, and one at $37k that is accruing at 4.7%. SO got a BA in History and Philosophy and doesn't have much experience outside of the food industry, though he is excellent at sales and fundraising, as proven at a current part-time job he is transitioning out of.

He just began a new full-time job at Whole Foods that pays $14/hr. He has been on Income-Based Repayment for about a year, and his current payments are zero because he's been making less than $20k a year. 

We would like to be together, but our situations are pretty different and we may run into issues. I'd like to understand how someone in his situation should proceed in relation to these loans, creating an emergency fund, etc. One thing I am already thinking about is the loan amount that will be forgiven in ~25 years. If he continues to make this ~$26k and below 40 or 50k going forward (I'm going to assume that's his cap earning potential, but this is pessimistic), the loan will grow, and he would be taxed for that $60k + interest. 

I don't care about marriage (and I would not marry him with this debt load), but it would be nice to have that option on the table someday. Neither of us want kids. Any advice as to how to help him navigate his situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",finance
gaming,ESRB,"The only reason the ESRB exists is because the game publishers created their own ""ratings"" board in the hopes that the government wouldn't regulate them if they appear to regulate themselves. They are not there to enforce the law. In fact, the ESRB ratings system is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used.

As such the ESRB is very much a self-regulatory organization that will do what it can for publishers and regardless of what they say loot boxes are for all intents and purposes gambling. As I've said, everything about the ESRB exists solely to ensure that the publishers can keep making money without interference. The ESRB are the publishers, they aren't going to stand up to themselves.",technology

personalfinance,Hold on to Student Loans or should I attempt to be debt free? I can't convince myself to go either way and could use your thoughts!,"Hi [r/personalfinance!](https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance) I've been doing okay with climbing out of my student loans.  I graduated with just above $80,000 and have been able to pay off the high rate loans.  But now I'm stuck and can use your advice.  I don't have any rolling credit card debt, home mortgage or car loans, so this is the only debt I have.

**Roth 401(k):** $40,000.  Roth Contributions are around $17,000 and another $13,000 from a Rollover.  Returns are averaging around 10%.

**Traditional IRA:** $13,000.  I had set this up in high school to put away earnings from random jobs I had at the time.  The returns are averaging around 7%.

**Student Loans:**  5 loans equaling roughly $21,000.  The current largest loan is $10,000 at 6.5%.  All of the others are at 3.3%.  Monthly payments are around $750.

**Rainy Day Savings:** Took a hit 6 months ago due to a surgery I had to have.  Completely unplanned for, but that's what the savings are there for.  This is definitely priority #1 to replenish before I do anything else.

Option 1: Withdraw the Roth Contributions to pay down the Student loans - from my understanding Roth Contributions can be redeemed.  Redeeming anything more than that amount would incur taxes and fees.  If I were to do this, I would increase my Contribution % to reallocate the monthly student loans amount to restore the the 401k (bearing in mind the company match cap and the IRS cap).  I could also just be wrong about the redemption here, but that's why I'm asking you!

Option 2: Keep paying my monthly amount on the loans since the investments are making a higher return than the interest rates on the loans.",finance
personalfinance,26 Y/O with iffy credit looking to buy/lease a vehicle.,"Hello All,
Long time lurker, first time poster.  I recently graduated from college, moved out of state, changed jobs, and am now in a field that I like, although it is not a lucrative one (mental health field).  
I sold my old vehicle that had recurring issues for 3600.  I planned to lease a vehicle, but i was told that my credit was so bad that it was not feasible, even with a cosigner.  I currently have a credit score around 600 (I have student loans, always paid on time, but I have a credit card that went into collections 4-5 years ago that I have not touched or even thought about since)  I was approved for an auto loan from a small credit union, but the interest rate was close to 11% and the monthly payments for a 3 year old vehicle were very high. 
My take home is about $1,800/mo, and I live with my GF, so rent is not terrible, but I pay about 750/mo
I am also going back to school, so having a stable monthly payment is nervewracking for me, but I understand it may be necessary.  
One of the main reasons that I wanted to lease a vehicle was to build credit, however, I realize that this may not be the most efficient way.",finance
personalfinance,What happens if I don’t pay my credit card in full one time?,"I have always paid off my credit card in full. I’ve never just paid the minimum amount. My bill is due October 15 (3 days from now). I have some returns to make, but it usually takes several business days for the returns to be reflected on my credit card account. If I only pay for the balance minus the dollar amount of my returns, what will happen? Will I be charged a slight interest rate this one time or will this negatively affect my credit score because of not paying in full one time? For example, say my balance is $1,500, but I have $500 in returns I need to make. Can I just pay $1,000 by the due date since the returns will eventually bring me down to that amount? That would leave me with a $500 balance until the returns are credited to my account which would then leave me at a $0. Make sense? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Getting Married in 2 Weeks and Have Questions About Taxes and Finances Post Wedding,"I am getting married in two weeks! But, I have some questions about what happens after we get married. 

Background: I (26F) am marrying (36M). We have been together for 4 years and have a 10 month old daughter. Not long after our daughter was born, my fiance left his job to be a stay at home parent, a decision we made together. I make roughly $40k a year and we live in Oregon. He worked for roughly half of the year as a server/host.

We both have some debt, more him than me. None of it is credit card debt. Mine consists mostly of medical and then some final utility bills from our most recent move. His is medical, one apartment complex, and then federal student loans from when he attended ITT.

Every year that he files taxes, his returns get garnished to pay for the loans. My questions is, when I marry him, are my returns in danger of being garnished? Does it matter whether we file jointly or separately? What if I claim him as a dependent?

Are there any other financial things I should know or be aware of before we say ""I do?""

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to fix a back tax situation while preparing for some urgent life changes next year,"I'm not one to ask for help. I'm a bit nervous, so please bear with me.

I am here seeking advice. While I’m sure many of these individual items may appear in here separately, I believe my situation to be unique and severe enough to ask for some guidance.  Over the past decade, I’ve had zero tax advice from anything other than TurboTax. It will be evident shortly. With that said, I’ve maid some bad decisions that have left me in, what I’m assuming to be, substantial debt. 

I’ve ignored this for far too long. This changes today. 


**About me:**
34, single, NJ
Live-in girlfriend.
Currently work full time in NYC, ~105k. 
Credit Score: 620
Credit usage: 2,086 out of 2,380
Mutual Fund: $13k
Checking/Savings: $0
No retirement fund.

**Expenses** (monthly): 
Rent: 1,165
Utilities: ~280

Storage: ~210
Parking: 200
Car: 225
Car/Renters Insurance: ~120?
Ferry Pass: 270

Home internet: $30
Cell phone: $240 (Family plan)

I usually pay all groceries, we split dining out.


**2013:**
Worked for prior company through 11/1/2013, made under 40.


**2014:**
Worked for a contract gig as a 1099. Assumed it was a temporary gig. I’ve done side freelance occasionally, but all pocket change up to this. Not knowing tax law, knew nothing about quarterly taxes or how to set up a company properly. Got an EIN via Legal zoom and just went with it. 

Thought nothing of it assuming I would have to pay thousands at the end of the year. Somehow I made 85k on this contract, owing 23.5. I paid about 6 up front and paid off the remainder in installments ($800 a month, still ongoing.)

**2015: **

Didn’t notice how bad this was until April when I procrastinated on my taxes. Took an extension, tried to deduct as much as I could. 

Some depression set in. I was too dumb to take it seriously and thought, it’s fine, I’ll work through it. Filed an extension. Depression worsened. October passed. I should file this soon. Wasn’t in a good place. Didn’t realize what I was doing.

Contract continued. Company is doing well. Received options.

…

**2016:**

In February, I lost my apartment to a flood. It was bad. We lost everything. My home office was destroyed and laptops, hard drives, files, everything tossed and unrecoverable. I was homeless for 4 months after insurance ran out. I was compensated for some damaged items, but what was netted from that went on to pay for overages on my Loss of Use coverage. 

Still on the 1099, I convinced my employer to put me on the books. This happened 10/1/2016. 


**2017:**

In that time, I was able to document enough that I was a bit more confident in doing my taxes. Being on the books for 1 quarter helped and I knew that my payments for 2014 were just about done. =) I owed about 11k this time, and was ready to set up a new plan. Feeling a little bit better.

Turns out you can’t file for multiple payment plans within 4 years. Great. 

Received a bill for the 11k in federal and about $1.8k in state. My thought was: Ok, I’ll see if I can hold off a few months until I get a refund, now that I’m on the books. 

Today I went to estimate that refund. Turns out, I’m claiming 2 on Federal instead of 0. Apparently I thought the higher this number is, the more they would take out. 

About to change dependancies to 0, but seeking advice on that as well.


**Future:**

My GF is getting a substantial offer out of state at the end of the year. It’s her dream gig. We’re both tired of Manhattan and tired of dumping money at renting and leasing. Neither one of us have equity in anything. We would like to buy a house, and are set to begin getting prequalified for a mortgage at some point. (I’m also fearful at leaving my job for the unknown at this time)

I’m aware that my financial situation is a partial cause to my depression and I’m looking for help. I never ask for help, but this forum has taught me a lot over the past month.

It's clear I don't know what I'm doing. And that's why I'm here. Much thanks to all.",finance
financialindependence,Invest in bad 457b or taxable account?,"Hi all,

Financial background: I'm 27, currently in my 2nd year of a 4 year emergency medicine residency in California, single w/ no dependents and no plans to change either any time soon. I have about 140k in unsubsidized loans at 5.625%, but am enrolled in the REPAYE program so I pay about $100/month, and 50% of the difference between my monthly payment and my monthly interest is forgiven by the government. This effectively brings my interest rate down to about 3.24%. I'm hoping to aggressively pay off my loans after graduating and then save/invest as much as possible to be FI/RE around 40. 

During residency we make about 55-60k before taxes, but once I graduate I expect to be making in the 300k range. I have a mandatory 4.5% contribution to a 457b plan, matched at 3% by my employer. I can make additional contributions, but they are not matched, and the money is invested in a very low yield fund (average 1.6% over last 10 years). I have no say over what is done with that money. I have 3 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund.

I have a Roth IRA that I max out at $5.5k/year, but I have about $3k left over in my budget that I'd like to invest. Should I increase my contributions to the 457b despite the bad interest rate, with the plan being to roll it over into my Roth IRA after graduating (and therefore preserving the tax benefits), or simply invest in a taxable account with a higher expected earnings rate but no tax benefits?",finance
personalfinance,Can't afford vehicle anymore. What steps should I take to get out of this?,"Hey guys. This is probably something you have seen before...

25 male, had an OK paying job a few months back (making about $50k a year)

Financed a $34,000 truck (I know, $50k a year was not enough to afford that vehicle)

Now, I'm making about $32,000 a year. Unexpectedly lost my last job after the company folded up. Now I REALLY can't afford this vehicle.

I can't afford to keep this vehicle any longer. It's a pick up truck with an 8 cylinder engine in it, a 2014 RAM 1500 specifically. So on top of that payment, the gas and insurance costs are wrecking me as well.

Payments are $517.00 a month with a 5.9% interest rate.

Trade in value is $26,000. Private party sale could be $29,000 at most.

I owe $30,900.

If I cancel the extended warranty (another foolish decision), I can probably knock off at least $1,500 off the loan balance.

Should I try a private sale of the vehicle? I'm just so lost on how to go about doing that since it's being financed and I have no title. I feel like most buyers would be turned off by that.

If I traded it in I would need to take out a hefty personal loan to cover the difference as well as purchase a cheap used car immediately (need a way to get to work). Another problem with this is not having time to shop around for a good used vehicle. I would need another vehicle to get to work ASAP once I got rid of the truck.

I guess I'm just wondering what the best path is to take out of this disaster. Obviously letting it get repo'd isn't a wise decision if I want to keep my credit intact.

Thanks guys.",finance

personalfinance,Received job offer by email for a position and wage lower than my previous. Want help negotiating a counter offer.,"Quick background:

Received an email job offer for a line cook position at a new restaurant opening in Los Angeles.  The pay they offered me was a competitive rate in the city for someone who has no experience.  I have worked in the industry for 4.5 years under some of the best chefs and have most recently left a position as chef de partie for a fine dining restaurant.  I'm not boasting when I say that I am completely confident in my ability in the kitchen.  Any of my previous coworkers and managers can attest to my work ethic, drive, skill, and leadership.  Having been in this industry for as long as I have, I know that I am a rare and quality asset that any kitchen would love to have.  This is especially true in an industry where most chefs are now having trouble keeping their kitchen staffed. 

My issue is that I know I deserve a higher compensation than I am being offered.  It's currently over 25 percent less than the previous hourly rate I was working at.  However I have no idea how to approach making a counter offer and would like to seek the reddit community for advice.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit*

I just submitted a counter offer through email to the employer.  Thanks everyone for the advice and suggestions.  Let's see what happens!

Well that was short and sweet.  The chef instantly replied back and rejected me.  He was ""unable to meet the financial requirements at this time.""  No counter.  This is the unfortunate state of affairs for the industry I work in.  Thanks a lot though everyone.",finance

Since finding PF it has now changed me to think more frugal, to pay this off quicker.


So....

I am currently in a job that at the moment i can pay prob $80-100 max additional on the loan per week.

Now due to work changes they are getting rid of my whole location, and as such can pay me out at $10,000 leave payment, or i can be trained and work with them an hour away.

Or i can find a job closer to me, but if i do i could probably only pay $40-$60 a week additional since jobs here are less paying, and id prefer not to travel an extra 2-3 hours a day (15 hours a week) and i have 3 small children which require school dropoffs etc.


**Pros**

* 20% of Debt gone
* Brings forward the loan to close 2 years sooner
* Saving myself 2 years of $250 a week payments $26,000
* Less interest and more money going on to paying the loan off in full


**Cons**

* Lose my job, back in the grind
* Have to try and find a job
* Potentially will be out of work 1 or 2 months

investing,Synthetic more tax efficient Wellesley fund,"I'm going to manage a trust fund for a relative and they have a need for stable value and current income but also some growth.

Vanguard's Wellesley mutual fund looks perfect, except this will be a taxable account.

I've been playing with backtests of ETFs to recreate Wellesley's metrics and am pretty close although the time available for the backtests on these ETFs haven't experienced significant interest rate changes.

Here's what I've got so far: using VTI or VYM for the stock component and a mix of BND and HYMB for the bond component. HYMB is tax free Muni bonds, so want as much of that as I can use to help keep taxes low. Also can use HYD which is very similar.

Any other suggestions?

personalfinance,How to get through the next 3-4 months?,"Double income, no kids married early 30s couple with hefty debt (medical, loans, mortgage, vehicles, unavoidable wedding stuff) that we were handling, paying off month by month, working on snowball method to chop out the smaller debts as we could. Roughly $4,000 net income between us, spend roughly $3,700 of that on debts/bills monthly (making greater than minimum payments on many debts and living frugally).


Except that in the last several months we've gotten married, we're one month out from our first baby arriving, and my husband is losing his job this month (not his fault, the position's just disappearing- he will qualify for unemployment). I won't get any paid maternity leave unfortunately, not even STD as I don't meet my company's requirements by just a couple months worth of employment-time. :( Blows but they are going to let me come back part time/teleworking as soon as I am capable of it so hallelujah for that and I'm hoping the birth goes swimmingly and I'm at least able to handle PT telecommuting within a month... but I also know that may or may not be the case.


So that said... our income is going down dramatically and we don't have the emergency fund bulked up nearly enough for both of these events taking place within a month of each other. I know within 3-4 months we'll be back on our feet; my husband should be re-employed by mid December, early January as he's highly employable, just has to work around a) the baby's first couple weeks and b) holidays.  Worst case is he'll continue on unemployment for a longer period. 


We will make up some ground if I cash out my old TSP, but as an emergency fund it will only help for 2 months and of course that means tax implications that I'm still trying to figure out. Next year's taxes are giving me a lot of anxiety already.


If we don't cash out the TSP, we're going to have a shortfall of almost 50% in the next 2-3 months and trying to figure out strategies to deal with it. Even with TSP I'm projecting some shortfall.


1) call each creditor separately and try to get 1-2 months at least deferred (Dec, Jan) - unsure how successful this strategy is but new baby + unemployment may be enough?

2) Debt consolidation - both our respective long-term banks (credit union and a federal bank) approved of consolidation loans which would roll in pretty much every unsecured debt we have, leaving our credit open which is nice (we are fine setting them aside to not use other than the one rewards CC of mine which was being used for groceries and paid off monthly), and could be used on secured debts as well. But some of the debts are at substantially lower interest rates and on a variety of payment end-dates so I'm loathe to change all of that up when we were doing well with snowballing payments. Plus it doesn't substantially lower payments by what we were already paying monthly. Over the life of the debts, the bank's calculations are that they would save us $7,000, but that's also assuming we weren't paying more than minimums, which we were very diligently doing.

3) Ask family for loan instead of bank - would not borrow as much as the bank is willing to give (would not feel right asking), but it'd be zero or very low interest and my folks have said in the past that they would be willing to help. I feel guilty as hell asking though, as they had to fight a long battle to receive their inheritances. I'd probably only be asking enough to cover the shortfall in bill payment until I'm off maternity leave and my husband is re-employed, and literally only pay the minimum payments rather than snowballing at least the next few months.

What would you do? I absolutely do not want to just ""not pay"", it's not an acceptable option here as we both have fair credit, no missed payments and do not want to slide down that hole.
Combo attack? 
-Cash out TSP (unlikely I'm going back into federal service and it wasn't really that substantial- plus my job takes out a bit every month for its own 401k so I wouldn't be completely depleting retirement fund).

-Go for the debt consolidation loans (a $500 reduction in monthly obligations while rolling in all that unsecured debt doesn't seem bad even if we weren't considering it because of the situation... we can still throw extra money at it when we're back above water).

-Ask for help just to make up anything that unemployment and TSP can't cover? They are helping with baby prep, but I'm just so loathe to ask them for more.

-Win the lottery (hahaha)? I should add, if worst comes to worst we do have ~$40k in home equity and the bank was happy to consider HELOC or HEL... we just would really like to save that for our next downpayment. And we do have livestock that could be sold but they also bring in chunks of income several times per year... but March is the soonest we'll see the next substantial chunk from that.",finance

personalfinance,"Leasing a car, then paying off the residual with a bank/credit union loan?","xpost – https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/760wxi/leasing_a_car_then_paying_off_the_residual_with_a/?st=J8P3MF04&amp;sh=97915b4e

Hi Reddit, regarding the question above, I'm wondering if it's possible to stretch a new car payment into two chunks, a 36 month (lease) + 60 month (bank/CU loan). Because the longer we have time to pay something, it should be a pretty sweet way to go, right?

I know people might have two objections to this:
1.) It's not a great idea to lock yourself 96+ months into such a quickly depreciating asset. 
2.) If I'm going through so much trouble to finance a car, there's the thought that I probably can't afford it. 

Assuming that I'll irrevocably love and drive the car until it hits the ground (not caring about depreciated value), and that I currently have the finances to buy a car any which way: outright/lease/traditional financing, etc — is it viable to buy a car through this method?


My family has a longstanding tradition of buying really old used cars with cash, but now that I have a job that provides $100/month allowance for its brand's vehicles less than 5 years old plus getting 3% off the dealer's invoice price, for once I'm blessed to consider a new car/*newish* used car. I don't know much about the typical length of bank and credit union loans, such as all the requirements for approval, but with a credit score of 755, is it possible to do 60+ months of financing for the residual of a leased car that I've potentially already owned for 36 months (once my prospective lease is done)?

Done a wholesome amount of insightful reading here to learn about car buying, but with these couple of questions still on my mind; excuse my word choices/concepts if a few are incorrect. Would love to learn :) 

Looking forward to any light that can be shed on this, thanks in advance!!

personalfinance,Wanting some reddit wisdom on budget &amp; debt payoff?,"Hi everyone,



I have lurked for a while and this sub has been really helpful in me sorting out getting a budget together and feeling more financially secure - so thank you in advance.  



Short and sweet of it, somewhat recently finished school and was hoping to get some critiques on my budget and some suggestions for my student loan/debt repayment along with savings advice. I am currently employed and am lucky to feel quite secure in my job. Below is all my debt, costs and income. I initially was aiming to pay my loans off in 5-7 years, but I am hoping to do better.  



Monthly Take-Home Income: $4,900



Student Loans/Month:

Student Loan 1 $550 @ 3.7% ($31,000 remaining)

Student Loan 2 $250 @ 5.7% ($4,900 remaining)

Student Line of Credit $500 @ 3.7% ($74,300 remaining)  



CC Debt:

$7300 @ 0% APR until Dec 2018 (balance transfer card)



Living/Month:

Rent - N/A currently

Groceries - $400

Cell Phone - $150 (It is higher as I require extra data for work, I get a stipend included in my monthly pay for this extra data cost)

Internet - $83

Transportation - $83 (Bus pass - necessary to get to and from work every day)

Car Insurance - $83 (Currently living away from home but parents keep my car maintained and occasionally drive it around the block – I agreed to pay insurance for this)

Banking Fees/Misc. - $30 (For account fees/random interac transfers/wrong branch ATM withdrawals)



Discretionary/Month:

Travel - $350 (Long distance relationship)

Spotify - $10

Personal/Household Care - $50

Fun Money - $200 (Clothing, movies, cheap events around town - rarely gets spent in full - just rolls over monthly)

Dining Out - $300 (Rarely gets spend in full - just rolls over monthly)


Savings:

I only have $550 currently saved but I have quite a few weddings/family events coming up next summer and want to make sure I have set aside money for travel/gifts so it does not just go back onto a CC and I dig myself out of another hole again. I have a few other small budget categories I am not currently funding – like tenant insurance or Christmas gifts.

I am mostly curious about the order in which I should try and tackle my debts - highest interest rate to lowest makes sense to me, but how does the balance transfer card factor into this strategy as that one weighs on me most as it is consumer debt?  

Also, I am not really clear on if/when I should start saving for retirement at all or if I should just pay off all the debt and then aggressively start saving for retirement? Not sure if it's a better strategy to take a bit longer to pay off the lower interest debt and start to save as I go?  


Anyways, I appreciate the advice in advance, and please let me know if any other information would help out!

investing,"Set up LLC, borrow money, and invest it through LLC. Is this a feasible business idea?","I'd like to ask the Reddit investing community if it's a feasible business idea to create an LLC; borrow money from a financial institution or third party; and then invest those funds in dividend paying stocks and bonds through the LLC. 
If doable, how would I go about achieving this? What is the process of lending to an LLC, etc...?
And yes, I'm already aware of the inherent risks involved- borrowed money in the stock market. However, I'm considering this as a business, not just gambling money at random stocks/funds, penny stocks, etc. I favor long term purchases of financial instruments (buy and hold if you'd want to call it that), money management rules and evaluating risks as any other normal business would do.

Yes, I'm aware that the income I get from dividends alone will be less than the interest rate of the loan. However, in the long run (next 25 years or so), I believe I will come out ahead due to appreciation of the equities and dividend compounding. As I said, I'm not looking to trade- I'm looking to buy and hold for the next 20+ years. Otherwise, in the short run, I'm roughly looking at 3% dividend yield (I'm excluding equity appreciation since it is an unknown in the future) and anywhere from 7%-13% APR on a personal loan ($45k) from LightStream.

personalfinance,Are we able to really invest?,"My SO and we're just married a few months ago and since then we have made a lot of financial decisions and want to continue to make wise choices that will set us up for a great retirement one day. We are both 28 and both work full time and don't have any little feet running around (not even ones that are furry either). We purchased a home together about 2 years ago when we were engaged for $123,500. We put down 3.5% for an an FHA loan. We just bought a new vehicle for $19,000. And we are looking to put our home up for sale in mid January. We budget the entirety of EVERY purchase we make via Google spreadsheet we share with one another. We only have one source of debt and that is our school loans. We have combined all of our money into one checking and savings account. Our combined life savings is $65,000 $3,000 in checking and $62,000 in savings. We both get a 401k through our employers which they max whether we pay in or not. 401k total combined is around $2,000. Both of our credit scores are 800+. We feel that our money could be doing WAY more work for us but we aren't sure what to do because of our school loans. 

We make a combined income of $95,000 per year. We save $2,000 a month based on our budgeting that my SO has set up, which is great when we can plan for any big purchases we either need or want. We found out that our house is now valued at about $185,000. If we were to sell it would could stand to make around $62,000 potentially. We are ready to move into a home that is in a better location (I drive nearly triple what my SO does to work) that is more equidistant to both our jobs. Problem is that these homes are in the +$300,000 range. We know that we can afford the 20% down payment for a conventional mortgage. And we know we can afford the monthly nut and the bills that come with owning a house this expensive but my we keeping having an ongoing conversation about our school loans. Of course we want to pay them off sooner than later but not sure how to come up with a good timing scheme. My SO owes $23,000 in only Federal loans and I owe $7,500 in Federal and $8,300 in private loans thru Wells Fargo (for a grand total of $38,800).

Do we stop saving the $2,000 and buget all of that to put on these loans? 

Do we continue to wait to sell our home until we pay off the loans (not our favorite option but we will do what ever it takes, I suppose)?

What kind of structure should our schedule for loan repayment be like if we don't put all $2,000 towards it?

Do we continue to do both (pay loans and buy a new home with our earned gains from selling our current house) and balance payments? We think this option makes us spread really thin. 

We really need to get the $62,000 out of a dinky savings account that earns us ~.5% but not sure where the heck to put it.

Do we need to just talk to a financial person??

I feel like there are so many options available for us to really set ourselves up later but we feel a bit clueless on what our next step may be. I know our careers will take us to both being 6 figure income earners but what good does that do when we don't know up from down in wealth management.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is big enough now that when the current bubble bursts it will affect the wider economy.,"Whether you are bearish or bullish in the long term, Bitcoin is quite obviously in the midst of a bubble. Between the time I write this and a year ago, the Bitcoin price has increased from $640 to its current value of $5700 - an annual increase of 890%. This actually means bitcoin is one of the fastest appreciating financial assets in U.S. history (all similar rises were, of course, bubbles).

While last month it seemed that this meteoric rise might slow on bad news in the form of China shutting down crypto exchanges, this turned out to not be the case. Bitcoin has continued to rise at a truly impressive pace. While this current environment would seem like a bubble ready to burst, I would argue otherwise.

The story from Wall Street right now is that in fact, many more people want to invest in bitcoin than are currently doing so. However for many of these investors, the headache of having to go to bitcoin exchanges and learn about wallets etc. is keeping them at bay. They are waiting for more traditional instruments to come out of Wall Street before jumping on board.

And those instruments are coming. With Goldman Sachs discussing opening up bitcoin operatons, Bitcoin ETF's finally passing muster and being allowed to open, cryptocurrency based investment funds such as the one provided by Metis Management or the EToro's Crypto Fund coming online, and Wall Street beginning to have talks of creating Crypto futures markets, people's access to pathways to Crypto investment is increasing rapidly. Hedge fund managers are also trying to get in on the current action.

This means that Bitcoin and other cryptos are in the process of coming to a much larger market. Of course I don't have to remind any of you that the fundamentals of bitcoin have not really changed since the sub $200 price levels of 3 years ago. Its essentially the same tech. Further, acceptance by business has only marginally increased.

The irrational exuberance of the Bitcoin markets, which until now have mostly been available to dedicated enthusiasts, are opening up, and the irrationality is spreading. When Wall Street does fully jump on board, we are going to see a price run up that will make the current run look pretty cute in comparison.

The current Bitcoin market cap stands at 94.6 billion, but it bears remembering that all other cryptos have historically walked in near lock step with bitcoin, especially on the downward side of the bubbles we've seen in the past. The total market capitalization of all cryptos is 169.1 billion. While this is already staggering for an asset that at this time provides little more than a chance to speculate, with Wall Street really jumping on board this number could skyrocket. Compare the figure 169 billion to a single blue chip stock, such as Apple's $805 billion capitalization, and you can get a feel for how much untapped money Wall Street can provide.

Further, Bitcoin no longer represents an isolated speculative bubble. Nvidia recently reported that sales of mining equipment accounted for a full 10% of their revenue. Many companies, mostly tech companies, have been using coin ICO's as a way to get around federal regulation, meaning that the value of coins is funding a lot of startup activity in Silicon Valley. ICO offerings now provide more start up funds than venture capitalism, the traditional way that startups are funded. A crash in cryptos would be devastating to these ventures.

Blockchain technology unrelated to bitcoin is also taking off in a big way. Companies are starting to look at blockchains as a way to manage many operations, and are getting huge funding, based largely on the current exuberance of the bitcoin market. Look to IBM's ""Blockchain Labs"" for a blue chip example. A big drop in bitcoin's price will shake investor faith in these companies and provoke sell offs. Even governments are jumping on board. The state of Delaware recently launched the Delaware Blockchain Initiative to provide services to companies located in state.

Whether any crash of the bitcoin sphere will ripple further than the tech world is unsure. That all depends on how ""all in"" Wall Street manages to get before something causes it to pop. If total crypto market cap reaches 1 trillion, which at current growth rates would only take a year, you can bet your ass that the pretty highly leveraged and longest running bull market since World War 2, which we are currently in, will take a hit. How bad of a hit depends on how much debt investors are willing to take out to jump on the bitcoin train.

However, even if the bubble bursts now there will be knock on effects for those of us working in tech. And I can tell you one thing: If a fucking internet coin that I never had an interest in buying causes a market crash that affects me personally, I will be quite annoyed.

tl;dr Bitcoin and cryptos are now big enough that the popping of the current bubble will have wider effects on the economy as a whole.",cryptocurrency

Contacted the administrator (sasukebtc QuangTin1990 moonsignals) from Vietnam, money sent (1Gz99ZgYjLDRNqjQ9Nd7w63SqhXXsRJzt7), I had access to the famous group ""PREMIUM MOON SIGNAL"" and what a mess, created in September 21 with signals copied from all over the internet, charts, everything you named it. So I told myself give it a try, what worse could happen. 

And first call ""sell all your bitcoin at $5240, wrong! Buy this, sell that.. wrong again then I decided to compare every single signal given with the actual charts and to my surprise they were all late. So I contacted the guru admin and he claimed he is not a god but then he started to act all stupid. I got fed up, asked for a refund knowing that i won't get a penny then I realized something. There is a network of premium groups out there run by the same guy(s). I contacted few of them just to have an idea and the communication or wording is pretty similar... I might be right, might be wrong.

They do have a free channel (https://t.me/moonsignal), you are free to give it a try. 

Moral of the story, I wanted to see what's the deal with all the premium groups on telegram and luckily I didn't lose any money (well except some of my crypto R&amp;D money to join the scam group)

CryptoMarkets,"Kraken is a horrible nightmare to use, what alternative for European customers?","Hi,

Kraken has become an absolute nightmare to trade with, orders getting front run, orders ""maybe executed, maybe not"", orders that can't be cancelled, limit orders that just sit there for a while in a rising market, just sitting there for the limit to be passed I guess, and so on.

And I'm not a big trader either, I just do an order here and there once or twice a month.

And this has been going on for months, there server upgrade that was to be done shortly hasn't occured either, and so on.

They wan't absolutely to destroy their business, it seems.

You guessed it, I'm fed up with them. So I'm looking for a good alternative. I'm located in Europe, so I'd need SEPA transfers (that execute quickly). Any suggestions?

Thanks.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Better to keep cards with zero balance open?,"Forgive me if this has been answered more thoroughly before but I keep finding conflicting information. My situation: 34 in the Army making decent money after 10 years, but divorced with high child support payments. Fairly frugal, spending $400 on food and gas, very few frivolous things. Anyways, have 3 credit cards, all were maxed out to the tune of $18,000 plus 2 personal loans. I got offered a debt consolidation loan at 17% for 36 months. This paid off most of my high interest debt, and lowered my monthly payments by $300 so I took the loan because my credit score was suffering due to the balance to credit ratio. My credit score dropped 100 points in the past year with no late payments but my debt to income and debt to credit ratios being fucked.

So now that all of the loans and credit cards are paid, I've got  the one consolidation loan, what's the best recourse for building back my credit? I haven't missed a payment in probably 6 years. Do I keep all 3 open? Do I close 2 and keep my lowest interest rate for emergencies?",finance

I've seen a lot of love for Ally here before but some recent customer reviews indicating it takes way too long for deposits to go through has me rethinking them.

personalfinance,10k Loan to help my parents get out of debt.,"Would it be detrimental for my credit/financial future for me to take out a 10k loan to help my parents pay off their credit card debt? If so, are there any alternative solutions?

Some background information; my parents emigrated to Canada from Poland/Czech Republic in their early 20's and faced financial hardships and continue to work low level manufacturing jobs. In the 1990s they amassed credit debt to make ends meet while raising 3 kids and eventually declared bankruptcy. As of today they have around 10k worth of credit card debt that they are unable to pull themselves out of. They are making minimum payments on a wide variety of maxed out (no longer used) credit cards with insanely high interest rates. They have tried to secure traditional debt consolidation loans but are always rejected due to their credit scores. I'm 23, working full time, living at home making 35k a year and have been pre-approved for a 3 year, 10k loan with an 10.99% interest rate (12.97% APR). The estimated monthly payment would be $338.21. My parents would be capable of making these payments once they use the loan to pay down their existing debts so I'm not considering this an additional monthly expense rather I worry about the impact on my credit score and ability to take out another loan/mortgage down the line.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a condo in the near future. Am I ready?,"I'm currently looking at buying a condo in Chicago and I wanted to get some opinions on my situation. I live with my gf of 4 years but since we are not married yet I'm going through the process on my own for now. We make about the same amount of money (150K/yr combined give or take) and split rent/bills at the moment. I don't foresee anything happening with our relationship but would obviously like to be able to afford the place on my own in case.

My take home monthly is roughly $4250 after taxes and 401K contribution.

$250/mo car payment with $5000 left on loan. $100/mo car insurance. No student loans or other debt. No CC debt that isn't paid off monthly. No kids and don't plan on having them. $60K in a money market savings. 805 credit score after a drop of 5 points from pre-approval.

I've been pre-approved at an interest rate of 3.78% fixed. I found a few places that I like and fit our needs for around $280,000 with HOAs at $250/mo. My gf will be living with me and paying half of everything. With 60K saved up I wont be able to put down 20%, pay closing, and have an emergency fund. I'll most likely be putting down around 10%. With my credit score and the money down they said they could get my PMI as low as $85/mo.

We plan on staying put at least 7-10 years. Both of our jobs are very steady. I've been at the same job for almost 6 years. If for any reason I was to split with my gf I'd be renting out the extra room. Comparable places (2bd/2bath) in the neighborhood are renting out for around $2400/mo.

I feel like I'm ready to make the plunge but still get cold feet some days. I also feel like I should hold off a couple years to save more for a down payment. With rent as high as it is, and going up, I don't know if it's a good idea though.",finance
personalfinance,Is bankruptcy my only option?,"Hello PF.  I've been a lurker on this sub for a while, and have learned a few things, and perhaps I'm ready to put some of those ideas into practice.  I do have one thing holding me back.  At this time, I have approximately $50,000 worth of credit card debt. Yes, you read that right, $50k, with interest rates ranging from around 17% all the way up to 27%.  The debt is spread across 10 cards, with balances ranging from a few hundred dollars all the way up to around $8500.  I have recently refinanced my car.  I owe about $5400 on that, and my payments are $120 a month.  I do have a credit card with the same bank that the auto loan is with.  I also owe a payment of approx $600 a month to my ex wife for a loan that she took out (when things were still good) to pay down some of the credit card debt at a lower interest.  Up until this month, I've been making all my minimum payments, but had to skip 3 this month due to simply not having the funds to pay everything.  My net pay monthly is about $2000-3000, depending on how much overtime I get. I've been averaging about $2500 a month for the last several months, but I am expecting OT to be cut back in mid November. I have very few assetts other than a few hundred dollars cash, my vehicle, and my home.  The home is a sticky situation.  I was awarded the house when my mom died, but it is still in the name of her estate, and I make the mortgage payments of approx. $600. 
 Finally, my credit rating is tanked. Depending on which bureau I look at, my rating is in the high 500s or very low 600s. 

To get to the point, I am considering bankruptcy (live in Houston, so Texas rules apply I suppose).  I tried to take out a loan on my own to pay off some of the cards, but did not qualify for anything. I have also talked to a couple debt consolidation places, but I can't get over the feeling that I'm being scammed.  I have never declared bankruptcy before.  This is totally new territory for me.  Is bankruptcy the solution for me?  If so, should I go with Chapter 7 or 13?  I've thought about talking to a couple attorneys in my area, but I feel like I'll only be given a sales pitch, told what I need to hear in order to sign up for something I may not need to do. 

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give, PF.  I greatly appreciate your advice.",finance

It's only offered Feb and July of each year and takes 6 months for results. Until I'm licensed I obviously couldn't get hired anywhere, except as a law clerk and it's been difficult to obtain a job but opening up my options.

personalfinance,Upside Down Car Trade-In Advice Wanted,"Hello PF,

I wanted to get your advice on trading an upside down car loan. So my car is currently upside down about 7000 roughly. I bought the car because I needed it at the time (my job depends on me having a car and all of our cars had broken down). I've been paying it, but the interest rate and overall monthly payment is killing me. I know typically you don't want to trade in a car you are upside down on, but here's my question:

Could I trade in the car for a car which is worth the same as my current car. For example, say my car is worth 10,000, would I be better situated to trade in my car for another car worth 10,000 or less? I'd assume in that case, I would be financing the upside down loan amount. Would car dealerships go for that? 

I simply want to get out of my monthly payment (I've been building my credit for the past year and a half trying to better myself and make smarter choices as I've entered my 30s), and realize a good used car would do me better financially, but I don't know what other ways to get out of the car payment as I have 3 years left on it.

personalfinance,Receiving lump sum bonus from work - question whether to pay off low interest debt.,"I'm receiving approximately $7k USD (after taxes) as a bonus from my work. I have two debts that I'm looking to reduce/payoff with the bonus.

1. $2K credit debt @ 12.99% interest.
2. $6,500 auto loan @ 2.2% interest.

My question is around whether it's worth paying off the auto loan with such a low interest rate? I can afford the payments (and pay over the amount due monthly). Obviously I should pay off the credit balance, and will do so. I'm just curious of your thoughts around the auto loan balance?

I could invest that money instead or just use it to build my emergency fund. Other things to consider would be that I could knock down my insurance payment if I pay off the auto loan, saving me an additional $40 or so per month.",finance

personalfinance,Debt... Help... Would be the best way to put it...I guess,"Back story:
In 2016, I took a job that required a relocation. I had enough money at the time between taxes and help from family that the move was not too tough financially, however the market here is so much more expensive. Everything from Rent to food to gas for your car costs more. And we have done what we can to break even, so we aren't in dier straights or anything as of yet, but it could be going that way if we don't get things under control.

Problem:
Unfortunately, one of the main things holding us afloat is that I opened a couple credit cards in the past 18 months. All of which are maxed out and the payments are becoming more difficult to manage. The cards total $6500... Which may not seem like a lot, but it's putting a burden on our finances. 

Attempting resolution:
I know that I need to pay them down. I am trying to get a second job, but I only have a few hours extra to work since it would cost me extra in after school care to work beyond that, and I don't get to see my kids much as it is.  Secondly, I've been able to get a small interest rate reduction on one card, but the others are too new for that. But beyond these things I am at a loss for what to do. Thirdly, I have thought about opening new cards to share the overall debt to get a better utilization which I heard will increase my score in a few months. I get offers for other credit cards in the mail daily, but the interest rates are terrible, so I have opened them yet.

Questions:
1. Any ideas on what I can do for part time work when I only have about 5 hours a day/three days a week?
2. How can I earn or get offers for the 0% APR on balance transfers to give me a greater chance of paying my cards down.
3. What else can I do to help pay these down?

personalfinance,1098-T Tax Document?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a current undergrad and was recently trying to submit my tax returns for 2016 (I know it's late! I thought I couldn't submit one last year because I was a dependent).

I went on TurboTax to start the process this afternoon, and after I submitted my information on the 1098-T, I went from getting a $522 tax refund to owing $700 in taxes. I was very confused because a school scholarship covers my full tuition, while a Pell Grant and Federal Loans cover the rest (room and board, insurance, etc.)

However, on my 1098-T form, Box 1 is blank, Box 2 for tuition is listed as $52k, and Box 5 for scholarships and grants is listed as $64k. This makes it look like I received an extra $12k in income last year, when really I took out ~$8k in loans and received a $1k refund to buy a laptop.

First of all - can a Pell Grant get taxed that heavily? I read online that if you're using it for education expenses, it can't (and I am).
Also, is Box 1 supposed to include the amount I took out in loans? That would somewhat even out the differences (although not entirely because other school expenses like room and board were around ~20k)

Sorry if this is an unorthodox question but I went to both financial centers here and called the ECSI hotline (she hung up on me) and no one seems to be able to help me. I can't afford to pay the government $700 in belated taxes, what should I do?",finance

financialindependence,"Yes, I know debt is a ""flaming emergency"", but...","I consider myself somewhat new to the FI/RE game, and have began my journey by reading articles from MMM a couple years ago. I recently read his article called ""News Flash: Your Debt is an Emergency!!"" It got me thinking about my own personal debt.

I have consumer debt that I used to buy a car back in my less-mindful days about four years ago. Currently that debt sits at just under $14,000. I didn't finance through a dealer--I wrote them a check. But I got the loan from USAA through their ""Career Starter Loan"" program for military members. The interest rate is a eyebrow-raising 0.75%... quite low. I am ahead on my schedule to pay it down. But I feel that the 'mustachian' attitude toward this would be ""to hell with your schedule! Aggressively pay it down ASAP!""

Since that mistake, I really changed my lifestyle and live below my means. Through this and some windfall I have way more than enough in investments to pay this debt down *today* should I choose to. But the conundrum I am facing is if this is really a smart move. The market is currently in an unprecedented upward swing, and the growth I am seeing in my portfolio far exceeds 0.75%. But I know we are due for another recession in the next few years.

I get that this is one of those ""to each his own"" sort of decisions, but would the majority of people here value being debt free sooner more than the additional portfolio gains of directing money toward investments?

**EDIT:** The car I bought is a 2011 VW GTI. I bought it in 2013 for 21k with 38,000 miles on it. The reason I still have $14,000 left on the loan (principal was $36,000) is I used about $6,000 of it to start up a Roth IRA. The rest I didn't use and paid back immediately. I have been on/off about paying it down because I'm ahead of schedule on it and I wonder if focusing more on investments is more prudent.",finance
personalfinance,From Covered California in regards to discontinuing federal insurance subsidies and impacts to ACA,"We know there is confusion about last night’s decision by the federal government to stop select reimbursements to insurance companies. These reimbursements support subsidies for lower-income consumers known as Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) payments. 

Despite this action, Covered California members will not see any change in their health costs for the remainder of 2017 and the rates and out-of-pocket costs published by Covered California for 2018 will not be affected.

How can stopping the funding for CSR payments not affect insurance prices? It’s because this cut to one subsidy will trigger an automatic increase in other kinds of financial support.

The CSR payments to health insurance companies the federal government is eliminating are designed to help with out-of-pockets costs, like deductibles and co-pays.

These CSR payments don’t go directly to eligible Covered California members, instead health insurance companies lower the costs of some out-of-pocket expenses for eligible Californians, and then the insurers get reimbursed for that expense.

Even without CSR reimbursements, insurance companies are still required to help eligible Covered California members with their out-of-pocket costs. That’s a requirement of the Affordable Care Act and this requirement has not been halted.

The Affordable Care Act also includes another, larger type of subsidy that is specifically designed to reduce the cost of premiums, ensuring that family budgets are largely unaffected. That subsidy or premium assistance is called the Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC).

The CSR payments that the federal government is eliminating only apply to certain silver plans. Covered California has already taken steps to minimize the impact of the loss of CSR funding and worked with insurers to price plans accordingly to ensure stability in 2018, adding a premium surcharge only to silver plans.  Silver plans are the basis for the amount of premium assistance, APTC, consumers receive, so an increase in silver premium will be offset by an increase in APTC for most consumers.  

Because the surcharge will only be applied to Silver-tier plans, nearly four out of five consumers will see their actual monthly premiums stay the same or decrease, since the amount of premium assistance they receive will also rise.

The effect of the federal government’s decision is something like this: Insurers get less money for helping low-income people with out-of-pocket costs on silver plans; premiums on silver plans increase more to compensate; and that forces the federal government to increase all APTC based subsidies to make sure people can still afford insurance. 
So, the bottom line to get the best plan at the best price: SHOP and compare all plans offered by Covered California!!

personalfinance,"29M, HCOL area. Got a big promotion, would like guidance on my situation","TL:DR 29 year old. Went from 66k a year to 92k a year. High COL area. 5.5k consumer debt, 15k cash in hand. Should buying a condo be my next goal, even though I don't necessarily want to own my own place? The 20% down payment seems insurmountable. I feel like if I don't start building equity now, I'll never be able to afford a house here.

I'm a 29 male living in Orange County, California. I was recent promoted to a System Architect for a fairly large healthcare corporation. I went from 66k a year to 92k. I will more than likely stay here for at least another year, maybe two or more if I can get a raise at the one year mark.

I'm making a 3% contribution to my employer funded 401k (they put in 4% regardless of my contribution). I currently have 11k of my own money stock market,  I have 3k cash in the bank. The only debt I have is my car loan, which is $5,400 at a 4% interest rate on a 2010 Hyundai Elantra. I currently have a roommate, so my rent is around $1,150 a month with utilities, however, that is going to end in August 2018.

Before my raise, I was averaging $4,700 in income a month, and spending $4,045 a month, those figures include everything I made in the year (including my tax return), and everything I spent. I also know I spend way too much money on food ($1,200 a month) so I am cutting that down. With my new pay rate, I'll be adding an extra $1,400 to my monthly income.

I said all that to say this, what should my next steps be? I feel like the next logical thing is to buy a condo, but the down payment requirement is so high I don't know if I can swing it. The average condo around here is 400K or more for a halfway decent 2 bedroom. When my roommate moves out, I will more than likely be living by myself. If I'm still with my girlfriend by August (we've been dating 7 months now) she could be a potential option, but I honestly don't know how that situation is going to play out, so I'm just planning on being on my own. Also, I don't necessarily want a condo, I just think it's a better option than paying rent. I'd be just as happy in a one bedroom apartment as I would a condo.

I would also like to buy a new car, I've wanted a 370z for years and now I feel like I can finally afford a good condition used one, but that's just a want. I don't need one, my Elantra runs fine and I have a 5 mile drive to work, so I don't put many miles on it as it is.

What should I do? Should I put more money into the stock market in an effort to save for a down payment on a condo? How big of a financial mistake would it be to get a new car? I feel like if I don't start building equity now, I'll never be able to buy a house down here. I also, as expensive as it is, don't want to move. I reinvented myself when I moved here 4 years ago, and I feel like things are going well for me now, I don't want to move to another city.

personalfinance,Income based repayment vs standard repayment for student loans,"Hi PF! Sorry for the long post, just wanted to explain myself. I live in Texas if that changes any advice. I have quite a bit of student loan debt, and while I read these posts a lot I feel like I'm not fully understanding my best option to repay. I currently have about $84,000 in student loans in two groups- one commercial group with $8,580 at 6.8%, and a department of education group with $76,641 at several different interest rates, but mostly under 6.8%. 

Right now I make $60,000/year. I'm on the income-based repayment option, and my current payment is $315/month. I'm currently trying to pay down credit card debt, and I hope to have that paid off fully within two years. I'm single and live alone, so my taxes and bills are significant. I'm also in a lease with no friends to move in with, so this fact is not likely to change. 

I understand that with the income-based repayment, my loans will be forgiven after 25 years if I stay on the plan. I contacted Nelnet today and they said I am not able to make additional payments just to the principal, all payments will go to interest first, which seems insurmountable to me.  The commercial loan alone has $6,000 in interest, if I'm understanding the representative correctly. 

Since I think I'll have the credit card paid off within 2 years and personal loan in 3 and have those funds available, should I then switch to the traditional 10 year repayment option?

financialindependence,Is buying with cash a mistake vs a mortgage?,"Howdy folks,

I'm strongly considering buying a condo.  I could buy this condo with a 3.25% 15y mortgage.  I could also sell some stocks and buy it for cash.  Ordinarily, I'd never consider paying cash with such a low interest rate, but having it paid for would be a huge comfort for me.  I'm not a market timer, but I do believe that both stocks and real estate are getting rather ... frothy.  This brings to mind Greenspan's '97 'Irrational Exuberance' speech (granted equities went on to run for another 4 years).  

Having said that, I don't expect that either are terribly good investments right now, but I'd consider this condo a place to live, not an investment.  I fully expect that equities will experience a major recession in the next few years, and I doubt real estate will have any real growth to speak of.  Even so I feel drawn to it, just to be debt free.  I also want the ability to direct more of my money towards buying stocks on the cheap *during* the next drawdown.

personalfinance,Should I add my wife on my mortgage/title? Complicated situation.,"OK, here's the situation...

I have no debt, and make about $180,000 per year in total compensation. I also have about $90K in liquid assets and $250K for retirement. She makes about $45,000 per year and has roughly $80,000 in debt (college, but on a personal, not federal loan), on which I am a co-signer. She doesn't have much in savings or for retirement. That said, we both have great credit because we pay all of our bills on time.

However, the main issue is that she is currently not a full U.S. citizen. We are in the middle of the immigration process, but it is taking forever. She was a child when her parents came here, and is currently protected under DACA until 2019. That's why she has so much debt, and a personal loan (and little savings).

To make things more complicated, I work for a large mortgage company, so would be working with coworkers on this, and they aren't aware of the situation, so it gives me pause to bring it up. We are a very large company, and I work on a different side of the business, so wouldn't be directly working with someone I know, but still potentially awkward.

We're looking at houses in the $250-300K range, and despite having enough to put down 20%, I'd rather put down 5-10% to keep things a bit more nimble. The PMI isn't much of an impact.

So, to sum up, I'm less worried about the debt impacting our loan amount given what we're looking for, and more worried about the immigration situation being a problem. Additionally, if I get the mortgage fully in my name, I'm not sure if she'd be able to get her name on the title. That would also put me in a bad situation should we split up (obviously, I hope not, and we have no problems currently, but can't ignore the marriage statistics...) with my name on the mortgage, having fronted all the capital for the down payment, but having her on the deed.

I know she wouldn't be that bothered either way we choose, we're just looking for the best option. I'll consult with my financial adviser and our lawyer as well, but was hoping to get some other perspectives.

Any advice? Thanks in advance.",finance

Blockchain by itself is nothing but a slow database. Making it globally decentralised and incentivizing mining is what makes it immutable and revolutionary. Thats Bitcoin, NOT blockchain.

""JP morgan moves $6 trillion around the world daily, bitcoin only moves a couple of billion.""

Yes thats great, it means bitcoin needs to rise in value ALOT to disrupt you. It isnt an argument against bitcoin, its an argument as to why its value can continue to grow tremendously, yet at the same time he calls it a tulip mania bubble. Oh the irony.

Think about that for a second. If bitcoin ends up doing what one bank does today (move $6 trillion daily) that implies a market cap in the 10s of trillions of dollars, and a price around $1 million. ONE BANK!

basically he is saying it is useful and valuable yet because he doesnt understand the technicalities and thinks the US dollar will never fault he is calling it a fraud.

personalfinance,Should I take over an upside down car with high car payments?,"Hello everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. I have utilized a lot of advice I've seen in other posts in this thread, so I thought I would come here to seek advice for my current situation. I've recently been given an ultimatum from my parents regarding my car, and I'm unsure what to do. 

Long story short, my mom bought me my first car at 18. It was a used car and probably overpriced for a teenager, but I didn't complain at the time. About 3 years later my parents decide to buy a brand new car for themselves, only to decide they don't like it. It cost just under $40k and my mom put no money down at time of purchase. Since my used car was having major issues and service costs, I offered to sell my car, take the new car sitting in the driveway, and gave my mom all the money I got from the sale.

I have driven the new car for 2 years now with my parents making payments on it. The only money I have put into the car is the basics like oil change, windshield wipers, and 4 new tires. They have even paid my insurance. I am very grateful for this, but unfortunately my run has come to an end. They are now asking me to take over the payments and sign over the car to my name.

In general, the car is in great condition and has about 40k miles on it. I don't particularly like the car that much because it is a 4 banger SUV, so it is extremely slow going from 0-60, which makes merging onto the freeway somewhat dangerous at times.

The car loan has a remaining balance of $22k. If I were to trade it in, CarMax told me I could probably get $18k for it, which would leave me currently upside down by $4k. 

My current take-home income is $532 a week, and I pay $500 a month in rent. I have decent credit and could probably get the car refinanced to get a lower payment if I went that route. The current interest rate is over 6%.

The current monthly payment is $582, which is extremely high in my opinion. If I were to go buy my own car, I wouldn't buy a car that had that high of a payment. It's also a lot to take over a $22k loan on a car that I don't completely love. It's not a car I personally would choose if I were to buy one, but my parents understandably can't afford to keep paying this much for me to have this car.

I recently got a good job after spending some time unemployed. My current savings is about ~$1500. Luckily, I am not paying a lot of bills. Here's my expenses:

Rent: $500/mo
Gas: $120-140/mo
Credit cards: I've been paying ~$500 month to pay them down and currently have about $1000 left in cc debt, so should be paid off soon.

So my question is, should I suck it up and just take over the loan? Should I trade it in and get a cheaper car and just add on the negative amount to that loan? Should I trade it in and lease a car? I'm inexperienced in the car world and don't know what to do.
I want to pick the best option that helps out both me and my parents. I'm extremely thankful for everything they've done for me so far, so I don't exactly want to just give them the car back and get my own car separately. I will if I absolutely need to, but that puts them in a crappy situation.

Thank you in advance for your help!

personalfinance,"New City/Significantly Higher Salary, - Need advice/resources on transition as a recent college graduate","Hey all, 

I have landed my dream job and will be starting around February of next year. I recently graduated college and still live with my parents. I was wondering if you guys could go over some of my pre planning as I move forward. I am extremely scared and confused as I haven't done this before. 

Currently:

As of right now, I am working part time at and making around $300 every two weeks after taxes. I've been extremely frugal as I have next to no expenses other than going out with friends. I spend roughly ~$50-$100 a paycheck so I've been saving around $400-$500 a month. I have roughly $5,000 in students loans with minimum payment of $50. (I plan on knocking out these out once my salary kicks in). I have around $1,500 sitting in my debt account at the moment. My goal is to try and aim for $3000 before I move out on my own. My next job will start in February and I will be jumping from ~$600 to around $5,000 a month after taxes with increasing pay every year (Fed job). I can not get another job at the moment due to my current job. They are like family to me and really helped me move  forward. We are very under staff and I have a few projects that I need to wrap up (I'm working with a lot of poor immigrants and its crucial that I am there because college is on the way for many of them. For some, I am one of their sole resource as they are first generation). I also can not work full time as I am currently training for my new job on my own and I will fail if I do not prepare. 


Plan as of right now:

* I'm not going to knockout student loans as fast as I can, but try to within the year. I need the beginning capital to get myself settled. 
* I need a new car to get to work. My 2006 Corolla has around 210k miles on it right now. After browsing this sub for a while, I guess I aiming going to aim for a later model (2014-2016) Toyota/Honda. I do not have enough for a decent down payment, but with my low cost of living, I plan on throwing as much of my salary as I can into paying it down. 
* My area cost of living ranks between 5-10 within the United States. In terms of living arrangements, apartments/condos range from $1500 and onward. However, my work location is located right next to one of the larger colleges in our state. I was thinking of getting a room through their Facebook sites which seems to range around $400-$1000. 
* Living expenses. For the first half year or so, I will be in training much like college again so my budget will be next to zero other than groceries. I will probably transition to my own apartment after my training competes where my salary jumps ~$5000-$10000 a year. I do all my cooking. I do plan on taking over my bills that my parents has been paying for such as cell phone, gym, and insurance. 
* My idea timeline would be quit job around mid December. Relocate around January, and start working February. I would have enough for two months rent if I get a room around college (so I'd be left with ~$2000 after my two months rent). 

Advice:

* I have no idea what I am doing in terms of transition. My parents aren't too far (an hour away), my dad works 20 minutes away as is my extended family. 
* I plan on packing just my clothing, laptop, and supplies I might need. I will buy the rest (which should be $200-$400 of supplies/food/etc. for January before my job kicks in). I will have roughly $1500 left over which will act as a net, before my actual salary kicks in.
* In terms of moving out/living on your own, I was wondering if I could have some general advice/links/resources. I have used the search function and have found a ton of information. 
* I'm an avid follower of this sub, so in terms of money, I will be following the chart we have in wiki and set a budget once I settle down. I live pretty frugal as it is and don't really plan on living out of my means. I will spend a bit more, but my goal right now is to save $2000-$3000 a month out of the ~$5000.

In his view, the chainblock, there are two historic marks: in 2008, Mr. Nakamoto created bitcoin, blockchain produces its first fruit first; At the end of 2013, it can realize intelligent contract and open source system in the blockchain, which was born in Ethereum, and applies the blockchain technology to the field outside the cryptocurrency.
The third history refreshes, which he thinks will happen in one or two years, which is to really integrate the blockchain technology into the industry and real realizing the project of implementation. Thus, Bin, with years of experience in the game industry, chose to join ugChain with the combination of blockchain and games

CryptoCurrency,Create passive income from crypto's,"Hi Crypo traders!

I have been a couple of years in crypto now but really started investing in november 2016 with my primary strategy #HODL. A couple of months ago I got the idea of creating passive income from cryptocurrency and thought let’s share this. Although I lost money along the way to control-finance.com and some bad masternode investments (buying neutron on yobit) for now the ROI is impressive. Disclaimer, only invest what you can lose and always do your own due diligence. For now, my strategy is:

**1.	Masternodes**

Where bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system where the miners are in control. Some altcoins like DASH and PIVX use the proof-of-stake system which is maintained by stakers and masternodes. Masternodes validate all public transactions within about 4 seconds by communicating each transaction across all nodes on the network to prevent double spending (Duffield, Schinzel, and Gutierrez, 2014). Running a masternode can be quite profitable.

personalfinance,job transfer decision,"I'm weighing whether it makes since for me to transfer locations with work. 

It's technically a promotion and comes with an 11% increase (5% in weekly pay and 5% in bonus increase) and entry to a higher tier golden shackle program connected to my new branches profits that I will see first fruits from in 5-6 years (estimating that at roughly 10-18k per year every year after 5 years and a huge payout of around 300k when I retire at 65). My current state has no income tax and new state would have 5% income tax, the cost of living increase and online calculators put it at 15% increase from old location to new. 

I have a wife and several young kids - we love our current home and have it paid down substantially with a very low interest rate and we'd have it paid off in 7 years. The new location would require a more expensive home purchase and we would get a new 15yr mortgage with a slightly higher interest rate. We have spent 6 years fixing up our current home from foreclosure and pretty much have it like we want it now. 

I love my current job - and I'm not really being pushed to the new location by my current manager. There is room for growth for me at the current spot and the only reason I've been asked to move is the guy that had the new job burned out and didn't like working for that manager. The offer letter also requires me to move by the end of this year - which would be stressful. I currently have a company vehicle - I might lose the vehicle if I do not move - but that is an unknown for now. 

I'm thinking the pain involved in the move and the potential unknowns at the new place makes this a pretty easy decision - staying put, not to mention a hardly noticeable difference in take home pay each week. 

We're at the new location now looking at neighborhoods. One of the areas we could live in is incredible and like mayberry according to others - so if we really love it there, I might feel differently - but right now I just don't see it making sense for us.",finance

It's accumulated a good amount of money (6 digits). I'm looking to transfer those funds to another bank that offers higher interest rate (capital one money market, any thoughts on that?). I'm not sure what's the best way to go about doing that. 
Appreciate any help.",finance
personalfinance,How much of a balance should I transfer to a new credit card?,"Here is the situation, I have one credit card Wells Fargo with roughly 15% interest rate with about $2,800 dollars on it with a credit limit of $7,000 on it. The local credit union that I am banking with offered me a credit card with a limit of $2,500. They offered me this with the option of no credit check and simply wanted to open a credit card. This was a wonderful opportunity because I am trying to as much as possible get away from Wells Fargo. This new credit card offers zero percent interest for the first 12 months on balance transfers is done with 90 days of the card being opened. A side note is that my wife has another credit card capital one with about $600 dollars on it.

My goal at the moment is too pay off the credit cards as quickly as possible. Based on my budget I can put about $300-500 a month towards them. In doing this though I am putting no money into my savings account to achieve this. I have $150 put into savings directly from my Bi-weekly pay check and that is going towards the credit cards. Also my wife works two days a week as server and earns tips. Those can fluctuate quite a bit so that is why there is a range of contribution that could go towards credit cars.

There are roughly two scenarios that I am wondering about doing.

The first one is to max out the $2,500 amount of the new credit card.  Then quickly pay off the balance on the other two cards using the goal I have above. That should take about two to three months. Then possible reduce the amount I put towards the credit card so I can at least have some money still going into savings. The concerns I have with this situation is the impact it may have on my credit score with maxing out a credit card. 

The second option is to transfer roughly $1200 dollars worth to stay below 50% utilization of the new credit card. This would protect my credit score a bit more(I think). Then I would simply focus on paying off the wells fargo and capital one cards as quickly as possible without having any money going into savings. That should take about five to six months. Then I could reduce the amount going towards the credit union credit card and start to build savings again. Essentially split the amount between savings and credit cards. Was wondering what PF thoughts were on the situation.",finance

personalfinance,"Paying down some of the principal of my student loan debt each month, but sometimes the interest goes up?","Hi all - For several months I have paid $275.00/month on my student loans, much of which goes to the monthly interest (automatically) but the rest that goes to the principal. However, I noticed that even though I am paying down the principal, sometimes the amount of interest goes up from month to month, which does not make sense to me. If there is a lower principle, the interest should be lower too. Note: All of my loans are at a fixed interest rate. Is it possible that the interest compounds every quarter or something? I just assumed that a loan company (MyGreatLakes) would have it compound continuously.

Here is an imgur link to my recent payments. Please ignore the $1,500.00 payment I have scheduled and the $10,000 disbursement. I recognize that after borrowing $10,000 the interest due will go up the next month. My issue is that since then when I'm paying on the principal, the interest has not consistently gone down.

so me and the boo want to get an auto loan to get a used car next year. we're in california

we both have pretty good credit.. but....

**me:** i have a 693 fico  (should be 700-740 next year) with about 11 accounts, aaoa at around 1.5 years, with my oldest account at 5 years. utilization at 6%... about 6 hard pulls in the last year depending on which report you look at. oh and uh. 18 missed payments across 3 ""closed"" student loan account. the missed payments are from 3 years ago, but we worked it out with the bank. its been current for the last 3 years. the reason they're closed is cuz my parents were the cosigner, and they filed for bankruptcy. i was told that they stopped sending me statements, revoked online account access, and i guess removed it as open on my credit report cuz they're not allowed to ask for payment during a bankrupty. however, it's still due. i dunno. i still pay it every month anyway. 

**my boo:** thin history. aaoa of about a year, with some student loans on there, i think 2 from 3 years ago. 6% utilization cuz she is an AU on all my major credit cards. 9 accounts: 2 loans, 2 cards of her own, and 5 cards that are AU from me. even so, i think cuz of all the AU accounts, her fico is a whopping 765.

personalfinance,Received an inheritance ... Smarter to wipe out Federal Student Loan Debt or open a Roth IRA and make monthly contributions there?,"Hello, 

I'm about to receive about $45,000 in inheritance money, which is enough to wipe out all of my remaining student loan debt with about $5,000 left over. Of the remaining debt, about half is in private loans set to interest rates between 9-11%. The other half is in Federal student loans, who's interest rate is set by the government at 3.5%

 Once I receive the money, I plan to wipe out my private loan debt pretty much immediately. However, I wonder if the Federal loans are worth approaching differently. Because of the flexibility of federal loans, I could maintain an income based repayment plan and contributive effectively $0 monthly without fear or default. While my interest would of course grow over this time, it would do so at a rate much less than the historical 8% interest rate of a Roth IRA. Beyond this, there is the possibility of loan forgiveness if income based repayments are made over a period of 20-25 years.

Based on compound interest calculations, an initial deposit of $20,000 with $200 dollars contributed monthly (the same as my monthly federal loan payments) at 8% interest will put me over a $1,000,000 when I reach retirement age. Alternatively, maintaining an income based repayment plan will grow the interest on my federal student loans to about $80,000, and thats assuming I don't qualify for forgiveness. 

It should also be mentioned that I plan to teach overseas (and open to the possibility of settling somewhere abroad long term). So during that time I won't be contributing to social security in any way. That's part of the reason I'm focusing on establishing a solid retirement plan. 

All this said, I'm new to personal finance and may very well have gathered some bad information along in my research. So if that's the case let me know.

personalfinance,"24M, Finally saving money and don't know what to do with it","Hey all, first time posting in this sub and relatively new to Reddit in general. I'm 24, a  nurse, and last year I took home $46,000, about $3,600/month. I live (rent) by myself and have no kids. No health problems. 

Debt:
I have $16,522 in undergraduate student loan debt with fixed interest rates between 2.5-7%, government unsubsidized stafford loans.
I (regrettably) bought a new truck after my 2001 Honda broke down.  I put down $10,000 and financed $27,000 with 0% apr for 72 months. $24,000ish remaining on principle. My credit is close to 800. 

Investments:
I max my employers contribution to my 403(b). Just over $6,000 in that account. 

I think I live pretty frugally. I work 60 hours a week and don't go out to eat or spend money at bars. Total expenses per month are approximately $2,200. I have just over $6,500 in savings. The kicker is that I'm going back to graduate school next year and will not be allowed to work for the 38 month schooling. I will be living off of student loans and my savings. 

My question is, should I keep throwing all excess income into my savings account in order to minimize my student loan need? Or should I start investing this money? I'm really not too versed in the finance world and I don't know the first step in investing. It's my understanding that my undergraduate loans will ""freeze"" while I'm in graduate school and will not accrue interest. I could be wrong. Any help is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Should I buy a new 2017 Nissan Leaf for $16k or a used 2013 Leaf for $10k? A super good deal on new, but more than we need?","The idea of buying a brand new, yet obsolete car makes my personal finance oriented heart hurt.  My wife and I both make enough money, and have no debt besides our mortgage, and have savings to buy the car with cash.  

Use case:
My wife has a commute from our home that is 3 miles round trip.  A leaf would appeal to our green side, and would make it so she never has to go to a gas station or get oil changes. Also, her alternator currently does not have time to charge her battery, so we replace the battery frequently in the 2001 camry. We have a second car that is a 2010 Mazda 3, with 35k miles, so we won't need to worry about range.  

Because the 2018 leaf is going to blow the 2017 out of the water in every way, Nissan is offering a $10k rebate on the 2017 leaf.    
   

**Math:**   
35.5k MSRP.   
-$2.5k dealer discount  
-$10k rebate (up front, rebate goes to dealer)
-$7.5k federal tax credit (we will pay more than that in taxes)


15.5k  (*plus registration) = ~$16,000

Additionally, WA state waves the 10.8% sales tax on NEW electric vehicles worth up to $35k.  That's about $3k in additional savings.

**Pros and Cons**    
The advantage of a **new car** is an 8 year battery warranty and 3 year bumper to bumper. The battery on a new car should last longer.  My wife can pick the color and it has every single option we want, including ""Alexa, warm up the car"" or whatever.
    
   

**USED LEAF Pro:** 10K (including tax) would buy a 2013 leaf with 20k-65k miles on it and brand new tires. Maybe even one with a warranty on the battery, and NissanConnect for remote start.   
We have 0 range anxiety. We both live within 5 miles of work (and downtown, and our parents, and everything).  
If the battery is reduced to 50 miles of range in the winter, that still totally works for us.    
2013-2017 are very similar, and the 2018 leaf (and future electric cars) will make these things look like golf carts.

personalfinance,Should I let my landlord finance our house?,"My wife and I recently moved into a house with the understanding we would be renting it until we can get financing secured for the loan.  The original agreement was that we would simply continue to pay the original note as our rent and once we were able to get financing secured (working on raising our credit scores) we would get our own loan and purchase the house ourselves.

Last week the owner approached us and provided the offer that he would finance it for us for an extra $250.00 a month for 20 years.  We wouldn't have to deal with getting a loan and we would just make payments to him.  I was leery at first but couldn't really pinpoint why.  Now I have a few reasons to be leery but wanted to post it to you all as well.

My first reason is I live in Texas where a homeowner can claim their primary residence as a Homestead and you get a reduction on your property taxes.  Since he is ""renting"" the property to us, we cannot claim the exemption and he cannot since it isn't his primary residence.  We lose out on that exemption.  

The second reason is income taxes.  If we rent (to own) the house we have no claim to interest on our income taxes.  This could be a huge thing for us in the future, I think.

Finally is the interest rate.  We had started a process to get a loan but were stalled out by something on our credit report that we were told we could fix but may take a few months.  The owner was generous enough to work with us on getting in the house and getting out of a bad situation we were in.  We know the interest rate we would have financed for and I am guessing it is much lower than the owner is currently paying for the property.  And then we add his price to it as well and now we are (I believe) overpaying on interest.  

I'm leaving it up to your brains to come up with anything else I may be missing here?  Is it a bad deal like it seems to me?  The owner is really a nice guy and has been great to work with.  I think he's really just trying to help us out and make a little extra himself but I want a second (or 100th) opinion here.  Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Pay PMI or continue renting?,"Hello, my spouse and I are interested in buying a house. We are uncertain if it is wise to buy fairly soon vs renting for several more months and would appreciate any input.

Essentially,I am very confused on how to know when it is wise to buy, understanding that interest rates and house prices may rise over time.

personalfinance,"(CAN) Dealership took my trade in with $3000 owing, but the bank is still charging me for my trade in.","Hi guys, I dont really know what to do at this point. So the story is, I bought a new car about a month ago, and the dealership said they would pay off my loan on my old car which I had financed with Desjardin. On my bill of sales and the final contracts the $3000 I owed on the car was added on to the final price which I was ok with. Fast forward a month, I realized that the previous bank was still withdrawing money from my bank account, and Im making payments for me new car as well.

I called Desjardin today in the morning and asked what was going on. They told me they never received any cheque from the dealership to close the loan. At this point Ive already made several more payments to the old loan. I called the dealership and they said everything looks good on their end and they sent the cheque already. A few more calls back and forth between Desjardin and the dealership, I got fed up and told the dealership it was their problem to fix. 

Now as far as I know, Im on the hook for $3000 for a car that the dealership already sold, and Im paying for my current car is there anything I can do or anyone I can contact? And what about the difference Ive paid with my own money?",finance
personalfinance,Building a house and the bank valuation has come back $50k lower than expected.,"Before I started this whole process, I had no idea that there could be a discrepancy between the value of the house and how much they will loan you, so I picked a cheap piece of land that I could build a house I love on. 

I was originally intending to put in a 5% ($22.5k) deposit on the total cost of $450k and the rest would go on the loan of which I have been completely approved for. However, the bank has come back and said while they are happy to loan me $427.5k based on my income, for the area I am building on they will only loan me a maximum of $400k because they have performed a valuation and their estimates calculate that $400k is how much they would get for it if they had to sell it quickly (in case of default). Bank valuations are always very conservative because of this reason, which I understand and makes sense. We had it valued by two other banks to make sure this was accurate and they both came back with the same amount. 

Now this means instead of putting in a $22.5k deposit (of which I have already put down $7k), I now have to put down $50k. Which I simply do not have. 

I have no idea what to do from here. I have some extra money that I can put down, but that was intended for furnishing and finishing off the house (landscaping etc), and also just a small emergency fund. But this still does not meet the $50k requirement, and to be honest, putting down every single dollar you have with no emergency fund is extremely irresponsible and is not a way I would want to live.

The other option is to downgrade the house. It would cost me a fee in itself just to get plans changed, but realistically if I stripped it bare of everything and made rooms smaller I could achieve it. But that leaves me building a house I don't want and don't like. Which was the whole point of me building in the first place.

The third option is to cut my losses and lose my deposits and 6 months of design work and meetings and a lot of effort on a lot of people's parts.

A fourth option is to try to take out a personal loan, but of course that will have interest rate fee's 5 times the amount of a home loan which I couldn't afford. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Would a guarantor loan help me, or is that only if they don't think you can't make the payments and not for increasing how much they will loan you based on value?",finance
personalfinance,"$60,000 in private student loan debt (after interest), over $18,000 owed in taxes 3 years from now. I'm on a fixed disability income. Now what?","I got a disability discharge on my federal student loans. After the 3-year monitoring period, I'll owe on taxes from those federal loans; they will amount somewhere north of $18k. 

The federal loans were about $70-75k, and I assume the tax is 25% of the amount.

I still have ~$60k in private loans that I can't pay due to limited means (receiving SSI). (~$32k is the principal.)

After 4 years of in-school deferment, I'll have 12 months of forbearance. What options come after that?

**After my discharged federal student loans go through a 3-year monitoring period, between 18k-19k in taxes will be due. I won't have that much to pay immediately. What then?**

I'm on a fixed disability income (SSI). Will they make the repayments income-based? How much breathing room will they give me?

personalfinance,student loan debt -- pay down balance or refinance first?,"I have about $33,000 in student loan debt - about $17,000 in five Stafford loans held by Great Lakes at 6.5% interest, $10,000 in two consolidated Stafford loans held by Navient at 6.25% (no idea how I ended up with two consolidated loans), and $6,000 in one private loan held by Discover at 4%. 

I want to take a big bite out of these and am planning to make a $11,000 or so payment on the Great Lakes loans, since they have the highest interest rate. But it occurred to me I should probably also try to refinance/consolidate some of these loans, and hopefully end up with a lower interest rate?

So my question is, is there any benefit to refinancing before making a large payment? Or vice versa, should I make the $11,000 payment, and then refinance? Seems to me it wouldn't matter either way, but I don't know if having more or less outstanding balance affects how much of a break I might get on interest.

Also I'd definitely want to apply the full $11,000 to the Great Lakes loans with the highest interest rate, right?",finance

personalfinance,My CU allows credit card payments for an auto loan with no fees.,"I recently bought a car and didn't get any loan pre-approvals on my own, so I ended up getting the financing through the dealer. They set me up with a local credit union and I got a 60 month loan with 3% APR, which is not super great but overall not bad.

One interesting thing I found out after I received the loan documents from the credit union is that in addition to setting up autopay from a checking account, they also allow for one time payments via a separate payment portal which apparently accepts credit cards. I called them and asked if there's any fees for using a credit card to pay my loan payments via that portal and they said no. 

So the very same day I applied for the Citibank 2% cash back card and got it in time to make the first payment, and as far as I can tell, no fees were charged.

I wonder how common this is? By using the credit card and getting the 2% cash back, I'm effectively cutting my loan interest rate from 3% to 1%! I've actually just applied for the Alliant Credit Union's 3% cash back credit card which would essentially cut the interest rate down to nothing at all.

So I guess people should check whether their loan holders also allow for no fee credit card payments. Too bad I can't pay my mortgage also with credit card each month or I'd be drowning in cash back!",finance

personalfinance,"$99K in student loans, tips on my plan?","Hey all,



Sorry in advance for the block of text. Posting on a throwaway but I have accumulated $99k in undergraduate student loans. It's in a relatively well paying field. No credit card debt, and a mid 700's credit score. 

&amp;nbsp;

All loans show up as PARENT PLUS and are all in Great Lakes. Here's the breakdown: 


Loan Type | Principal | Interest Rate | Interest | Excess Pay Allocation
---|---|----|----|----
Parent Plus | $19,659.94 | 6.410% Fixed | $2,003.46 | 0%
Parent Plus | $25,488.05 | 7.21% Fixed | $2,883.45 | 100%
Parent Plus | $22,634.00 | 6.48% Fixed | $1,964.84 | 0%
Parent Plus | $23,004.00 | 6.31% Fixed | $1,022.68 | 0%

&amp;nbsp;

The minimum monthly is around $1,200 and since I've graduated in May I've made 2 payments so far. Before that I made a monthly $100 payment while in school. The payments are deferred (grace period) until November.

&amp;nbsp;

Just started a job in July. It's a public state government sort of job. with great benefits but lower pay. Breakdown:

* $49,500 annual, $3,000 monthly take home
* Automatic 10% from me for 401K, 11% from the company match
* Since 401K takes such a big chunk, no IRA's for the near future
* Currently not signed on my own insurances, still on parents corporate insurance for the time being 
* MBA will be paid for, planning to start in Fall '18 (studying for GMAT right now)
* Job security is solid, basically no one gets fired (within reason)

&amp;nbsp;

My living situation has been very fortunate in that I'm staying with a family member rent-free. I drive a beater car that I've only spend about $1K maintaining since I've gotten it, otherwise rock solid. I don't pay for my cell phone bill currently or my phone (still on parents plan). 

&amp;nbsp;

Just to be clear, I'm very thankful of my current situation in life and the ability for my family to support me through this. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly payments:**

* Adult Orthodontics - $100 
* Car insurance - $40 
* Gym Membership - $30
* Spotify Family - $15
* Amazon Prime Student - $4.50

&amp;nbsp;

Since I've started working, I've set up my bank accounts to split my income as soon as I get paid:

* $500 into Emergency Fund
* $600 into Car Fund (my old car was totalled earlier this year. Hopefully the beater lasts but you never know). 
* $1,200 into Loans

&amp;nbsp;
  
**My bank account breakdown:** 

* Checking -  Whatever is left over from transfers that month
* Car Fund - $4,967
* Emergency Fund - $6,768

&amp;nbsp;

**Credit Line Breakdown** 

* Discover IT - $3,000
* Capital One QuickSilver - $10,000
* Note, this is the credit available, I barely use it though. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Plan moving forward (starting next billing cycle):** 

* Increase loan payments from $1,200 to $1,900 - $2,100
*  Cancel Amazon Prime 
* Stop transferring money into the Emergency/Car Funds
* Reduce eating out with coworkers to a budget of $15 per 2 weeks

&amp;nbsp;

My hope is that after I complete the MBA and work for a few more years, to switch to private sector with higher wages to more aggressively pay down loans. That means probably another 4 years at current job.

personalfinance,Wanting to purchase a home. Q's about debt v saving v 401k.,"We want to buy a house in early 2018.  We are currently renting @ $1100 a month and am on a lease until June 30, 2018.  Our landlord is a bear and raises our rent every single renewal and WILL NOT allow a month to month term under any circumstances.  If we are not out on June 30 our only option is to renew for another year or GTFO.  With taxes (which are very high in our state) we're looking at homes that would cost us $1100-1300 in mortgage/tax payments, so we'd be paying similar but actually have something that was ours and far, far nicer than our rental.

Financially we have been recovering over the past few years and have improved our credit.  I had scores in the mid 500s in 2015 and am flirting with 700 now.  Still not perfect, but improving. :) We have a bit shy of $8000 in credit card debt, 17k on a car loan we are aggressively paying off.  Right now I'm paying almost $700 above minimums every month and if I sell something on ebay or come into extra cash, onto the debt pile it goes.  We have $2200 in savings that does not get touched.

So this is my question...we have the income and scores to qualify for a home loan, but will need to save up cash to have for closing.  We plan to use a Veterans home loan, so no downpayment required.  And this is where I struggle.  Do we continue to pay off the debt as aggressively as possible to have the balances as close to zero as we can come shopping time, or do I revert back to paying minimum and save cash?

We both have 401ks through our employers (both Federal employees) and have been told we're allowed to borrow from it, interest free.  I was considering maybe doing this to get the necessary cash the bank will want to see.  If we didn't use it for closing, I'd stick it back in the 401k immediately.

Thoughts?  I know the situation isn't ideal, but we really do want to stop renting.",finance

financialindependence,How much to reveal to kids about your lifestyle?,"So we're a couple months away from having our first child. I'm 37, husband is 36, and we're doing pretty well for ourselves. We're both federal employees but we've been maxing out our TSP since we started our respective jobs (I found that out when I was dating him a few years ago - SWOON).

Our lifestyle looks very middle class - we have a modest (looking) home in an economically diverse but very school district (which is what we wanted) in a very HCOL area. The house was actually pretty expensive but it's nothing fancy - just the nature of real estate in this area.

So, bottom line is we're doing well, especially for our age. We're on track to retire at 57 if we want to (57 because that's the minimal age for full benefits from government). We have good equity in the house, good savings, excellent retirement funds, will have two decent used cars, etc. We already have a college fund started for the spawn so he has options.

What I'm wondering is - how much do we clue him in on the fact that we're not really as middle class as we look? You really would never know it looking at us - we buy used stuff, we DIY our yard work, don't eat out much, etc. The only clue is that we love to travel but we're really frugal about that even.

What does he need to know about our finances and lifestyle? Should we tell him we can't afford things (even though we can?). Or just that they're not in the budget and we're saving for other things?  How do you handle this?",finance

financialindependence,Income of 25k to 275k in 7 years,"5 year lurker.. first time poster. There have been a number of posts recently of very fortunate people which have been received with everything from incredulity paired with despair to heartfelt congratulations. What a spectrum of emotion! Accusations of humblebragging have reverberated around the sub and it’s altogether been a little too salty for my liking. Let’s start with the basics:    
 


[Graphs]( https://imgur.com/a/xt9i3)

Married, no kids. 30(M), 29(F)  
**Income:** $375k. $275k (me), $100k (DW)  
**Net worth:** $610k   
**Home equity:** $220k   
**Semi-liquid:** $390k. Spread across taxable and non-taxable.  
**FIRE Number:** $2-2.5 million including HE. 


Now that I’m done with my humblebrag, let’s look at what portions of my experience and perspective I can share. If I can do this from my starting point, so can most of us. I am under no doubts that luck has played a large role in my success, but there are number of decisions and risks I took that have been equally important. A number of the seemingly insurmountable barriers that people described are just that.. barriers. You can do it too!  


The above is a one-dimensional view. Let’s look at the barriers on the way:  
&gt;Lower wage job ($25k) in a lower paying country that the US (UK). Check.  
&gt;Degree with poor job prospects (manufacturing). Check.  
&gt;Lower (relatively) income ($75k) in a HCOL (SF Bay area).  
&gt;Single income couple in said area. Check.  
&gt;Student loan debt ($70k). Check  
&gt;Industry that is stagnant, losing jobs and lower paying (manufacturing). Check. 

**Getting a job**  
I graduated in the middle of the recession (2010). TBH it was the best thing that happened to me. Prior to 2010 I was bottom of my class. The raw, primordial fear that the recession introduced into my life changed me from a skirt chasing Counter Strike: Source addict to one of the library’s most studious residents. I had mistakenly studied manufacturing engineering in university, oblivious to larger global trend of automation and the exodus of manufacturing jobs to low cost locations. It was hard, really hard to get a job. My first job paid decent money, $25k, all things considered. I took any advantage I could get to get it- I had to travel for my interview. When I checked into my hotel room, the receptionist told me that my “colleagues” had already checked in. Thinking on my feet, I asked her who they were and what rooms they were in. Turns out, 2 were there to conduct interviews and were in the bar. I dumped my stuff in my room and headed to the bar. We all joked about what a remarkable coincidence it was when all three of us ended up chatting for a few hours! 100% this is why I got the job over the other 200 applicants- I got to connect with them, on a human level, outside of the interview process.  


**Finding a profitable area in a waning industry**  
My early professional life was plagued by a sense of impending doom. I knew I had to do something differently if I wanted to avoid building a career in a dead end industry. Despite my efforts, I couldn’t get into a different industry, so I started to look into the areas of manufacturing less likely to go to a cheaper location. Anything where the value is derived from IP (Pharma, medical devices), government contracts (defence) or major capital equipment (trains, planes). I landed a job in medical devices, $35k at a US multinational. At this stage of my life, I lived on $10k a year with a savings rate of ~60%. I didn’t heat my room, never had AC, I never ate out. My food budget was $25 / week for groceries and $20 / week for subsidized meals at work. Video games kept me sane. I studied at night time to pick up certifications in statistics and business to broaden my skillset.  


**Engineering a relocation**   
In 2012 I went on a business trip to the US. I was dumbfounded. My peers in the States were earning 3x what I was and paying less tax. Not only that, but progression was fast! There were managers and directors in their thirties. I was sick with envy. It was a visceral feeling that hijacked my emotions for weeks! And like that, I decided I HAD to go the US. It was the only option for me. I applied for every single posting I could find in my company and was uniformly rejected. New grad with 2 years’ experience? No chance. Then I found out that an important VP was visiting our plant. I begged my friend, an administrative assistant, for his schedule. She eventually relented. **Pro tip:** Admins are gatekeepers and have huge amounts of important information. Always be on their good side! I researched his career and then “happened” to be in the elevator at the same time as him and delivered an elevator pitch. Just like that, he scheduled a follow up call with me, which led to some other calls. 3 weeks later I left everything behind and landed in San Francisco airport. Salary was $74k.  


**Stuck in rut, but still saving**  
Fast forward 3 years and I’m horribly unhappy. The manufacturing site I’m in has 30%+ attrition and has laid people off. It is disproportionately staffed by low paid visa workers who cannot leave. Compensation is generally 20-40% below market. Thankfully, I did not sacrifice my life for work and I’m in a very happy and meaningful relationship with my future wife, who kept me sane. We were living together and subsisting on one income as she was in graduate school. Total expenses for 2013 and 2014 were $40k and $42k respectively. This was very challenging in the Bay Area. I don’t know how parents support children on that level of income here. They must be budget ninjas! We had a good deal on rent ($1,650 for a studio) which we got by being the first at every showing (usually 7AM), and being willing to sign a lease on the spot.  

We got married ($16k, 80 people). Happiest day of my life. $16k was a small price to pay for such an amazing day. We made all the decorations and married at a restaurant- cheaper as their business model is to provide food and seating together. Surprising how expensive it is to pay two different companies for each separately. My biggest regret was paying the included 18% service fee but leaving no additional tip. There’s being frugal and there is being cheap. I cringe every time I think of it as the staff were fantastic. DW had $70k of debt from her undergrad and master’s degrees. Refinanced at 6.8% and put everything we could towards it.  DW got an excellent job in healthcare, income is relatively fixed around $100k for.. well forever. Her job and income are much more stable than mine, which is nice.  


**Know your worth and take risk**  
Green card came through (did the paperwork ourselves to save $3k+ in lawyer’s fees) and I started job hunting. I was desperate to leave. I was shouted out, called names, lied to and promised a promotion that never came. I knew I was in the hottest job market in the country, one where big risk is rewarded and failure is accepted. I found a company that I really liked the look of. Product was good, financials were healthy and growth prospects were excellent. I found a contact who worked there and got her to refer me instead of me applying. Why? Interviews are an extended negotiation. Having a narrative that “they found you” gives you much more leverage than the other way around. Interviewed, they made me an offer as a level individual contributor with a 20%+ pay increase. I turned it down. What? Yup, I turned it down. When you are negotiating, it is important to know your worth. We had a NW of ~$140k at the time, so I knew I could quit my job and be unemployed if I had to so I took the gamble they’d offer me something better. Two months passed and they rang me back to say they had changed their organization structure around to create a management position for me and offered me the job, I took it. Total comp that year for me was $130k.  

Jumping ahead to now, I’ve been through two promotions and the company has done very, very well. Salary is $155k, the rest is bonus and equity. Still in manufacturing, compensation can be good in any industry. It’s just a question of *where (or how high)* you have to go in a company to find it. Average compensation sucks for most in manufacturing.  


**TL;DR and general advice:** 

Everyone reading this has decent analytical and financial skills (thank you FIRE community). These are real skills, parlay them into your work.   

Learn to read a balance sheet and P&amp;L account. Be mindful of who you work for by understanding their product, market and financials. It is much, much easier to progress in a growing company.  

Focus on value and impact. Don’t focus on the task you are doing. Seems simple, but it is amazing how many people do something because they’ve been told to do so without understanding what they are trying to achieve. Pursue further education to do so.  
  
Luck is important. The ability to recognize opportunity and take advantage of it is even more important. Or “creating” your own lucky situations. See above examples.  

Relocate if necessary.  

Make sure your spouse has shared values. Mine does and everything we do is a team effort!  

No barriers are insurmountable, it is just a question of it of what it takes to overcome it and if it’s worth it. If you think you can’t do something, you can’t.  

**Edit:** Some thoughts on skills and doing MSc's or Phd's. True value tends not to come from deep knowledge of one skill, but the intersection of several. It is much rarer and you can add much more value as a result. Rather than become an expert in something, I've gone around and picked up a few complementary things and built an extremely competitive skillset. 

**Edit:** Appreciate all the kind comments. I'm just a regular dude, I'm not anything special.  I never, ever thought I'd break 100k in income. I use to despair at how unachieveable the salaries I'd see in this sub were.  Regular people can chase FIRE and be successful. That's what this community is about. Anyone can do it!",finance
personalfinance,What's the best strategy for my girlfriend to tackle her student loans?,"Girlfriend just freed up an extra $650 per month (hooray!) to divert toward repaying her student loans. I know that the conventional wisdom around here is to pay off higher-interest debt first, but does this advice still hold when one of the lower-interest loans is gaining interest faster than the monthly payments can keep up?

More details: She has a couple of private loans totaling ~$65,000 at about 8.25 percent. By my estimates she's already paying enough on these each month to counteract interest and pay down the principal. At the current rate of payment, it should be eliminated by 2031.

She also has federal loans, one of which adds up to a balance of $232,000 (she works in medicine) and an interest rate of ~6.25 percent. Her monthly payments here are not enough to counteract interest, let alone pay down the principal.

Should we put as much as we can into paying down the higher-interest debt anyway, despite the fact that the balance on the lower-interest debt is growing? Returning to the question of how to allocate the extra $650/mo: We could counteract the interest-based growth by funneling ~$450 of that extra $650 into the 6.25 percent loan, then dump the remaining $200/mo into the higher-rate loan. Would that make more sense?

Thanks so much for your guidance!

I've saved about £1000 in total and figured now's a good time to open a savings account but i'm not sure what and where I should go. I'd like to be able to access the money throughout the year but only in the case of emergencies etc, other than that I'd comfortably get by without touching that money. 

I'm currently with Nationwide so I'm not sure if I should open a savings account with them or simply move/ open an account somewhere else with better interest rates and benefits. 

Any help or recommendations on what to do and how to prepare for the future is appreciated, thanks :)",finance

Initial thought was to refinance through sofi or earnest the total balance of wifes loans and be cosigner, but that seems like a really bad idea. 

I am interested in helping my wife aggressively tackle this debt. Snowball method is appealing but 

* This tackles the federal loans first, which have benefits that private doesn't have (income based repayment)
* Higher principal loan has highest debt.

My thought was to go avalanche and kill her private loan with the highest balance and rate. I'd also be interested to refinance that single loan jointly, since together we can get a rate closer to 5%. In either case, I feel the majority of that debt should stay in her name, I can match some percent of what she pays for one or more loans. I'm thinking matching 166% of what she pays towards the avalanche target since that is proportional to our incomes.

As for other goals, we are interested in buying a home in the next 5 years, but I want to make serious accomplishments on debt before we start looking. A good chunk of our cash savings was planned for this, but may be more valuable ammo against student loans.

personalfinance,Applying for an apartment while refinancing student debt,"I am about 4 months out of college and I've had a job making around 55k while living with my parents for the entirety of that time. I recently began applying to refinance my student loans (I owe just over 50k in student debt at ~10.5% APR) to decrease my interest rates. Simultaneously, me and a couple of roomates just started looking for apartments. I didn't expect that we would really have anything for at least a month, but we just found an amazing deal right out of the gate that ends today. My main worry about sending in my application for this apartment is that my credit is going to get hit and those reviewing the loans are going to see it along with where it's coming from (I said I was living at home and paying no rent in my application) and reject my application. Out of fear, I asked my roomates to remove me from the application and said I would try to add myself to the lease after the loan situation is taken care of, which is obviously not ideal. Any advice on where to go from here?",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford to study abroad?,"I am in a one year Masters degree at Northwestern and I have about a month off for winter break.

I will have about 14k in private loans as it stands, but taking this trip will mean I have 2 grand less in cash to use towards paying those Federal loans (should only be like 150 a month payments, lower if I refinance it). If I don't take this trip, it could be years before I could just take a month and leave the continent again.

personalfinance,"$100,000 windfall: pay down student loans vs ETF vs purchase rental property?","Hi PF, longtime lurker, first time poster. I recently inherited $100,000 from a relative and I would like input on how to make this money work for my family as best possible. I am considering the following three options:

1) Buying a rental property to create a secondary revenue stream (would pay a management company to make as passive as possible)

2) Investing the money in an ETF, betting the return beats the interest on my student loans

3) Paying down a massive chunk of my student loan debt

**My current financial picture**

Debt: I have about $250,000 in federal student loans from medical school with rates between 5-7%. I currently make minimum payments in an IBR program to a) keep open the option of using public service loan forgiveness and b) make life during residency slightly more comfortable, knowing that this comes at a financial cost. We have no credit card debt. Own our vehicles outright. Partner has no student loan debt. 

Income: Both my partner and I are medical residents. We currently have a combined income of $110k/year. We save roughly 15% of our salaries. In addition, we max our roth IRA. I contribute to a mandatory pension fund and my partner contributes up to full matching of her 401k. We have an emergency fund for 3 months. Our future earning potential is high, we should be able to jointly clear over $500,000/year when residency is over in 2 years.

Mortgage: My partner and I already own a home with a physician loan. We are approved for a second mortgage that would allow us to comfortably purchase a quality rental property in our location. Rate of 4.625% for 30yr fixed. Rent from a tenant would cover the full cost of the mortgage (we've done our research). We know what it is like to own a home and understand the additional costs that go into home maintenance, but have never been landlords. We would absolutely get a management company. 

What are we not considering? What is the best use of these funds given these options and our financial picture? Are there alternative options better suited to make this money grow? Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Recommended tools for finding a better student loan refinance option?,"A couple of years ago, I refinanced most of my private student loans through SoFi. It was a help, and it did cut down my rate for a while, but I chose a variable interest rate, and since the LIBOR has been rising, the loan is now at a rate of 6.24% and likely to continue going up. I'm now looking into other options. (Just to be clear, I am also planning on refinancing again through SoFi and seeing what rate they'll give me this time around, but I want to make sure I'm exploring all of my options.)

I tried searching through Lendkey, and they showed me a fixed rate loan at a good payment schedule from a credit union, but when I went to formally apply for it, the rate had moved from fixed to variable in the contract, which seemed very sketchy.

So I'd love to hear the wisdom of the r/personalfinance collective! What [legitimate] resources are out there to help guide me toward the best refinance option for me?

Extra details, if they're helpful: I'm currently using the avalanche method on my loans to accelerate their payoff. I've paid off three smaller loans with high interest rates already (all federal loans), and I'm working my way to paying down a fourth. I have several loans outside of my consolidated bulk that I chose not to refinance, due to either being federal (and not wanting to lose those protections) or having very low interest rates individually (~4% on the lowest) that were already lower than what SoFi quoted me. I plan on keeping those additional loans outside of what I refinance on this next round.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my private student loans?,"I currently have two private student loans with Citizen's Bank, and I'm wondering if it's worth trying to refinance them?

The loans are $13,225 at 6.99% and $11,040 at 8.74%. I'm on a 5 year repayment plan currently, and saw that rates listed [here](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/5-banks-to-refinance-your-student-loans/) at SoFi, CommonBond and earnest are all lower than my lowest interest rate. I'm particularly concerned about the 8.74% rate and I'm targetting that first after I make the minimum payments on the other loans I have.

I also have around $28,000 in gov't loans but all of those are 3-4% interest and I've heard it's best to keep them gov't loans vs trying to refinance.

What should I know before I try and refinance them? Can I check each of those companies without impacting my credit? My score is in the mid 700's - most current score from Capital One is 750.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to Finance a Used Car for Work and School,"I'm 20, living with a roommate, going to school full time and work part time. I have lame credit (if any) but I've dealt with some pretty bad used car woes and horror stories and I'm finally sick of random and expensive repair bills pushing me past what I paid for the vehicle in the first place. My lifestyle and location require me to own a car. I've been looking to buy a particular car for a while, knowing how low they've depreciated the past couple of years and what it could offer me in savings is quite attractive. 
So the numbers. I'm looking to put $4-5k down and get a loan of no more than $2-3k to buy the vehicle outright from a private party. This will hopefully cover registration, inspection, etc. In the long run I will be looking at a reduction of gas costs from $150 to $75/month and oil changes and brakes no more than every year. A 3 year loan at 10% APR would put me around $100/month, which is exactly what I've been saving monthly in preparation. My worry is that this interest rate is still too generous for my situation. Should I look to my bank of 3 years, my local Credit Union, or would I be best off shopping for a deal on APR? 

Edit: to clear things up a bit, the car in question is a 2011 Chevy Volt, it still has it's powertrain warranty and is hailed for it's reliability. An EV would net me far less in maintenance, upkeep, and gas.",finance
personalfinance,Bouncing back after making poor financial decisions. Need help prioritizing.,"Hey all. Long-time lurker here. Here’s my story (hoping you can assist): I’ve made a lot of poor decisions and have been trying to bounce back over the years with limited success.

I’m 34 with a grad degree working in the DC area. I make $97k a year and have no debts outside of my $155k in student loans. The loans were somewhat necessary for my field (international affairs/national security) and I one day hope to work for the federal government to take advantage of the PSLF program (forgives my loans after 10 years of public service). I’m not there yet, and I’m in the private sector working for a big four consulting firm for now.

I rent an apartment with my girlfriend and we pay $1900/mo (which is a steal for where we’re living). DC is super expensive, but I I’ll likely stay here for at least another 5-10 years because of work, if not longer.

In my infinite wisdom, I withdrew roughly $10k in my 401k a few years back when I spent a year unemployed. I also amassed $13k in credit card debt (which I paid off entirely). Eventually, I got a new job and was slow to start up again with 401k contributions. The company only matches 25% on the first 6% of my contributions, which is less than ideal, but I enrolled last year and am now contributing 10% of my pay to my 401k ($5500 balance).

I have ~$12k in savings, which seems to be growing steadily with each paycheck, and I’m trying to live a more frugal lifestyle. How should I prioritize where I’m putting my money? Should I be throwing everything at my student loans (~$850/mo. with IBR) knowing the goal is to get a federal job that will forgive this debt eventually? Should I be contributing so much to 401k if the match isn’t spectacular? And where should I invest my savings as it grows. I’ve been looking into Vanguard index funds but am unsure of how to balance investment there vs 401k vs. a higher yield savings account.

Lastly, I do have some life goals that may or may not be attainable given my situation. I’d like to be married with children in the next 3-5 years. I’d also like to be a homeowner in the next 5-10.

Any help would be much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Advice Needed - Debt,"Hello r/PF,

Let me preface this by saying I know I'm an idiot.
I'm 26 and I have 4 student loans and 2 credit cards with balances. Here's a list of these:


Loan 1: $3396.15 left, 10.625%, $104.25/month

Loan 2: $13,842.49 left, 4.25%, $111.40/month

Loan 3: $20,335.14 left, 7.16%, $140.20/month

Loan 4: $3219.57 left, 9.99%, 50.00/month



and Cards:

Card 1: 1288.94 balance, 23.24%(!!)

Card 2: 2026.91 balance, 15% (I've stopped using this card altogether, just making payments each month).



I just received a quarterly bonus of $1000. 
I want to use this whole bonus to pay down one of the above debts.

My initial plan was to pay down Loan #1. I've been paying extra towards it each month and would love to get rid of it completely, so I can use the ~$140.00 I pay towards it each month on another loan.


However, I then got the idea of completely paying off the one credit card (which I'd be able to do with the bonus + just a little extra money). The interest rate is outrageous. I still use this card, as I get points back from amazon (which I now payoff instantly; the balance is from previous spending). 


I really had the idea of making a huge dent in one of my loans because they are currently the bane of my existence (without them I'd be able to save a ridiculous amount of money). But the credit card is costing me a lot of $$ as well.


How should I best handle all of this? I know there's no one right answer, but I'm just looking for any advice. Thanks for any help!


edit: I meant to add this initially, but should I look into refinancing any of my student loans? Loan 1 (10.25%) is Sallie Mae, and I'm not sure I can even refinance their loans. I could also look into getting a different loan at a lower rate from my bank or something to pay that off and repay the bank loan.",finance
personalfinance,Buying house but want to convert it to rental property in next 5-10 yrs; best way to structure my loan?,"Mid-twenties in a 2 income household. My partner and I already have a condo we plan to rent out and are finally ready to buy a house. We both have very stable jobs with promotions almost a certainty and household income around $200K /yr. Looking ahead, I've played around with the annuity tables and am being tempted by a 15 year mortgage over a 30 year mortgage.

I understand that investing that money rather than paying off a low interest rate might be the textbook answer, but I like the idea of possibly retiring early thanks to rental income. I also already invest heavily in my 401K, max out my IRA, and think putting money in real estate is a sound way to diversify my assets. 

The final piece of the puzzle though, is that in 5 to 10 years I would likely be converting this next house into rental property also. With a 15 year mortgage that means that the rental income will likely not cover the mortgage. Is it unheard of to rent out a home and pay the difference in order to cash in on that income when it is paid off? Or would it be possible (or even rational?) to refinance the loan to a 20 or 30 year loan when we move?

personalfinance,"An alternative to avalanche and snowball debt repayment: ""squeaky wheels""","**tldr:** Avalanche is still better at reducing total debt paid over the loan's term, but if you want to reduce your monthly minimum payment to free up liquid capital, consider this.

The amount you'll pay toward a debt burden each month is not determined by your loan's interest rate alone, but by your remaining loan principal times its interest rate. I present a method to prioritize loan repayment by the most costly interest rate (squeaky wheels) rather than prioritizing loan with the highest interest rate (avalanche). This strategy may reduce your minimum monthly payments if you are preparing for a period of unemployment.

As pointed out in the comments, this method doesn't necessarily reduce time to repayment or total interest paid. Instead, it targets the highest debt burden each month. In the comments it is shown that targeting the highest debt burden each month does not reduce debt when compared with the avalanche method. 

This project is hosted as a Jupyter notebook on GitHub with graphics and visualizations in line. You can view it using any modern browser.

My husband started his own company while finishing up school(he went to school later). He was doing well. We bought a house.  

I make 75,000, he makes 125,000-160,000 (not sure exactly and it varies year to year.  We have a lot of student debt (100k?), and he messed up taxes in 2014 so we have 20,000 we owe there. I thought 2015 was good, apparently not. Now he's getting calls today from the accountant that 2016 is bad (owe roughly 36,000 more).  

I've asked him forever to seek a financial advisor with how to operate his LLC.  He told me they just take your money and are out for themselves. He has a bunch of credit cards, how many? I don't know. He tells me it isn't my business. It's at least 5-6, he says the balances are low.  I found one he opened and the interest rate is 24%!  

I'm livid.  It's an issue I've swept under the rug and I am so angry at myself. He says no matter how much he tries he can't get ahead. But I've said forever how he needed to put more aside and seek advice on how better to manage money. He has no retirement savings (he's 43).  He buys expensive groceries (organic everything, even mustard), records for himself and we both spend too much on booze. He also smokes. 

He plans these great vacations and loves to hang out and have a good time but this is going on and things like breaks for the car and fixing his crown don't get done. It secretly bothers me so much. I don't know up from down right now and need directions. I don't know anything about finance. I don't even know how or if we should re-finance the house (we still have PMI), open an equity line of credit to pay the taxes off?  Borrow against my 403b?

KBB says it's worth ~$3,500 party-to-party or ~$1k trade-in. We're nearing 150,000 miles so the timing belt, transmission, and top end are all going to need to be serviced and I know it won't be cheap if these things need replacing. Possibly as much as the car is worth.

I’ve read a lot of great advice on this sub, but wanted to seek some advice because of our short-term goals.  

The biggest complication is that I’m currently looking for a better job, and many of the best opportunities in my field will involve moving from our somewhat HCOL area to a very HCOL area. My wife has agreed that I will find a job first and once I have an offer she will look in that city since her skillset has a much broader application. If we move within the next year and like the new area, we’d buy a house In 2-5 years.  

Thankfully, my wife was able to save enough for a down payment while living with her parents for the years between graduation and our wedding. I, on the other hand, have ~50k remaining student loan debt and only had my emergency fund and retirement savings before the wedding. We would like to put her savings to better use since they are currently in a ~1% interest savings account. However, we don’t want to expose the down payment to risk since we hope to buy so soon. We also want to have build up a sizable emergency fund (3-6 months expenses) since we’re not sure how long it will take my wife to find work after the move. Would paying off the $30k of my student loans with interest rates above 5% be a good low-risk “investment”? 

We are also not used to handling the amount of money we bring in. We put together a joint budget shortly after our wedding and realized, without really adjusting our spending, we’re on track to save over $35k this year. This number is in addition to our 401(k)s, which we’ve maxed out the match on. Would this be a situation where hiring a financial advisor would make sense?",finance

At first i said no.  They stated i could lower my payment and also lower my interest rate.  They stated my payment would drop 300 dollars.  I said that sounded great.  I had a baby on the way and anything would help.    
The next 12 months went as planned.  I pay my mortgage 2 months ago and i get a notice stating i have a late fee because i didnt pay enough.  Basically what happened was when they did the refinance they miscalculated the escrow by over half.  If they had calculated the escrow correctly my payment would not have been lowered more then $50 dollars and i would of declined.  I was transferred over and over until i leveled up through wells fargo 4 different times until i finally reached the top.  I told them that i understand there is small discrepancies of a few dollars when estimating escrow, but not 60%.  I stated i want my money i spent on the refinance refunded to the loan.    
Eventually a month goes by and they call me this friday and state they will give me $2000 dollars and put that towards my escrow.  This actually gave me pause.  I feel like if they are willing to just drop me $2000 that maybe they know they messed up and im owed more.  I even told the representative this exact statement. I know i paid more then $2000 for the refinance, i feel as if i push this, they may give me what im asking for.  Where should i go with this?  Accept their offer, or push for the full refund of the refinance?",finance
personalfinance,[Credit] Rebuilding credit - 1 prepaid card enough?,"edit: can't edit titles, my apologies if the formatting is wrong

Good Afternoon PF;

I took a calculated risk in 2013 and stopped paying all of my private student loans (~60k @ 12% APR) and credit card debt (~12k). I would have filed for bankruptcy but the laws protecting private student loans made that not an option. 

I say calculated risk, because I know that I could be sued and have a judgment against me that could immediately garnish 25% of my wages in my state. I did the math, and I was paying approximately 40% of my income at the time in minimum payments. I had done this for 5 years and was in more debt than when I started due to using up forbearance options. 

The math showed that I would need to make 70K a year in order for 25% of my take home to be more than what I was paying in minimums.

I decided to stop paying them, and ignore all calls. I have been sued twice, one has failed to serve me and one never showed in court when I filed a response.

In 2020 these items will begin falling off my credit report. I plan to remain vigilant in fighting the debt collection suits, and should a judgment be ruled against me I will satisfy it.

The other part of the calculated risk is that I would have never been able to purchase a house with that amount of debt to income ratio. 

I recently paid off my car, and I also have federal student loans that I am current on.

I understand this ""strategy"" may be grating to a lot of the folks on this sub-reddit who have bootstrapped themselves out of debt or perhaps made more sound decisions earlier in life. All I can say to those people is please know that this decision weighed on me greatly and I spent 5 years trying to do things ""the right way"" before ultimately realizing that I would never be able to purchase a house and raise a family with my employment prospects combined with my debt.

Now to my actual question:

I recently obtained a prepaid Capital One credit card by putting down a 49$ deposit for a 200$ credit line. The plan is to keep this account open and current to help build credit on the way to 2020 - would it be a good idea to open a few of these accounts so that by the time 2020 rolls around I have a solid 3 years of current reporting, so that once the derogatory accounts begin calling off my credit will rebuild. 

If anyone has any other generic advice for my situation I appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance student loans?,"I just graduated college in May. I accepted a job the semester before graduation that offered $68K salary and good benefits. I’ve been in this position now since July (note: there is a chance I leave this job in 2 years due to my SO’s career starting and likely having to relocate). Also my credit score the last time I checked (January of this year) is 700. 

I will begin paying back my $69K of student loans in January. I have private and federal with interest rates ranging from 3.5 to 9. After talking with all my loan holders and running the numbers, I will be paying $912 monthly. Which luckily I can afford due to a good salary and low cost of living, but, it will be tight and I will be able to save very little. Should I look into refinancing in order to reduce my interest rate and reduce my monthly payments? If I decide to do this, would my credit score take a hit?

Trading,A New Uptrend for US Car Manufacturers?,"Visit https://www.brtechnicals.com/a-new-uptrend-for-us-car-manufacturers/ to read the full blog with charts!

This week we are going to focus on three major United States car manufacturers: GM – General Motors Co., F – Ford Motor Co., and TSLA – Tesla Inc.

Economic Conditions

Over the last several years, U.S. car manufacturers have not made any upwards momentum in their stock price. This is somewhat surprising because cars were being sold at record breaking levels in 2015 and 2016. Plus, gas prices were falling which meant that consumers were willing to buy less fuel-efficient vehicles, such as trucks and SUV’s. These vehicles generally have a higher profit margin, but the stock prices did not reflect this higher demand.

There are a few reasons so many cars have been purchased lately. With cheap gas, and low interest rates, it made sense to purchase a car, if needed. However, this alone does not account for the record breaking numbers.

Since the financial crisis in 2008, many people have been driving their older cars longer. Consumers decided that they could use their old vehicles longer than they would have prior to the crisis. There are a couple underlying reasons behind this sentiment. One, the economy was still questionable. It is not a wise decision to make a purchase that is going to take several years to pay off, especially if you are unsure if you will have a job throughout the payback period. Two, cars have grown to become more reliable and longer lasting. When these two trends are coupled together it makes sense why consumers were less likely to purchase cars.

Eventually though, consumers decided they needed to replace their old cars, and seemingly all at once. The trend started in 2015, and continued through to the end of 2016. 2016 currently holds the record for most cars sold in a year with 17.55 million. However, this trend is not expected to continue. The 2017 estimates for vehicle sales is for more than 17 million, but there are some macro-economic factors that may continue to push car sales down. This may be why stock prices have not reflected the record breaking sales results.

Interest rates are still moving up by the Fed. As interest rates rise, it makes vehicle loans look less and less attractive. There is also the fact that so many cars have been leased. As cars comeback to the dealer, it is going to make new cars look less attractive because there will be more used cars available for sale. Used cars are generally better for car dealers. They  have a better profit margin, so there is more incentive to sell them. Lastly, auto-loans have been lengthening in time. The average loan is longer than 5 years now, and there are now loans offered for 72 months and 84 months. With such long lengths, these consumers will not be replacing their cars anytime soon.

General Motors

Starting in 2014 GM formed a Cup and Handle formation, and broke out early in September. Since the breakout, the stock has moved more than 19.5% and is currently sitting at $44.89. Even with this extraordinary move up, the stock is still sitting with a very attractive P/E ratio of 7.80.



A cup and handle pattern is formed when a stock creates a round bottom and a flat top (the blue curved line). After the stock forms the round bottom, it eventually moves back up towards the top of the “cup”, and completes it. Next, a handle is formed (the two straight blue lines). From here the stock breaks out and continues to move upwards. This is a great example of the formation.

From here, it looks like GM will continue to move upward, but at this rate, it may move quickly to another trading range. This is to say that the stock has moved up so quickly over the last month and a half, that it may reach a certain point where the “value” of the stock is reached and the stock cools off and begins another trading range, like it did from 2014 to 2017. It is also possible that this becomes a sustained trend, but we will need to see what happens.

F

Ford has recently broken a downward price channel (the two dashed red lines), and may be ripe for purchase. The PE Ratio is 12.76, which is still low considering the S&amp;P 500 is sitting at 25.4. Although RSI and MACD showed positive divergences prior to the breakout, the lack of volume is suspect. The momentum indicators (RSI and MACD) look very good nonetheless, and this may be the beginning of a new uptrend, along with GM.



The stock did have a down day, and moved back to the top of the channel. If the stock can move significantly past the top of the resistance line, by at least 3%, then it may be a great time to enter a long position.

TSLA

Tesla was the first stock to break above its resistance line, where the uptrend started in February 2017. The stock has since moved into an ascending triangle pattern, with the resistance line at $390. The ascending triangle is an isosceles triangle formation, where the top of the triangle is flat, and there is an upwards line moving towards it. This pattern is generally considered to be bullish.



The P/E Ratio for Tesla is much different from the other two manufacturers; it is negative. This is because the company is considered more of a technology and growth company. Ford and General Motors have been around for more than a century, while Tesla is still in its infancy comparatively. Although the company is young, the technology and brand they are building may become a force in the years to come. Because of this, investors have pushed up the stocks valuation in hopes that the company does become a car company like Ford and General Motors.

It is also important to note that Tesla is not just a car manufacturer. They are in many aspects of electricity, including solar panels and batteries, now that the merger with SolarCity was approved. This company may be able to one day compare itself with the likes of GE – General Electric (ironic, right?), where it has its hands in many aspects of the economy, both at the business and consumer level.

Future Growth?

Overall, vehicles will still be playing a large role in the lives of consumers for years to come. General Motors and Ford represent the old manufacturers, while Tesla is paving the way to the future. This does not mean that the old companies will be leaving anytime soon. As new technology becomes available and new economies are built, they will likely be a part of it. Ford has begun to work with Lyft to build autonomous vehicles, where it is imagined that they will be able to pick up and drop off clients without a driver. Also, General Motors recently announced that it is ready to begin mass production of its own fleet of autonomous cars. These companies may represent the old economy, but they are quickly moving into the economy of the future.

personalfinance,I think I have a TSP and I don't know how to use it.,"Long story short, I worked for the Air Force as a civilian employee for about 6 months. As a result, I have a Thrift Savings Plan (and maybe an IRA? Are they different?).

personalfinance,"Buying a 2nd house, is a HELOC on the investment property the best way to come up with a down payment?","I own an investment property in California which has good cash flow and decent equity. I'm currently renting in Hawaii, but want to purchase a house prior to selling my investment property (why stop a good thing?). Is a HELOC on the investment property the best way to come up with a down payment?

We have worked hard to get out of debt, and now I have 13k in the bank, 60k in retirement, and excellent credit. I make 150k a year, 10 years at the same employer. I have no debts besides the 350k loan on the California investment property, which is worth 610k. That property was my primary residence until January of this year, so I will probably sell it before the 3 year mark of converting it to a rental to avoid capital gains taxes. I can get away with 5% down on a house here and just pay the PMI until we sell the investment property and bring over that equity. I might refi at that point if interest rates are still low. The best HELOC I can find on an investment is prime + 1%, interest only, no closing costs. Thanks in advance!

Reasons for buying in Hawaii:

1. We are staying long term

2. We want to make improvements to the property and not be at the mercy of a landlord

3.  Possibly rent out the house/room when we are in the mainland

4. Rent is really high here

5. Could use an extra bedroom/office

6. Mortgage rates are low and I believe housing price still have upward momentum here",finance

**Expose to the sunlight what DCG is and who is behind it**

First, let's just post the links to the sites listing all the companies supporting the attack for quick reference:

https://coin.dance/poli

http://segwit.party/nya/

Then, let's post a list of the individuals still supporting this attack despite the overwhelming evidence presented to them about how and why S2X is not only totally pointless from the technical as well as economical (benefit for the whole ecosystem and not just a few) points of view and also about how and why S2X is an open attack on Bitcoin.

 Those guys are pure greed, they don't care about the 7 billion of people on this planet. Expose them and don't give them your business. Starve the beast. They will regret sticking with the B2X altcoin that will go the BCH way (and all the other highjack attempts before them). Moneybadger don't care and only gets stronger and immunized after each snake-bite, that is as a system, but we, as individuals, do care and must be proactively working against this attack. 

 Actually &gt;99% of the Bitcoin community supports the real Bitcoin. The centralized B2X-coin attack is only supported by a handful of [rich crooks](https://i.redd.it/t1z62pow09qz.jpg) *and* the people they've managed to bribe with their deep pockets, so here they are:

&gt; 


DCG (Digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG. 

Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:

http://dcg.co/who-we-are/

Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting: 

**Glenn Hutchins**: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, **currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.**

**Barry Silbert**: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)

And then there's the ""Board Advisor,"" 

**Lawrence H. Summers:** 

""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.  

**It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?** 

So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo. 

(BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.) 

""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/

So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:

**""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**

Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions

So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. **What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already?** 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value? 

Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time? 

It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem. 

Also worth noting these two things, pointed out by /u/Adrian-x: 

1. MasterCard made this statement before investing in DCG and Blockstream. (Very evident at 2:50 - enemy of digital cash watch the whole thing.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2mofrhw58 


2. Blockstream is part of the DCG portfolio and the day after the the NYA Barry personal thanked Adam Back for his assistant in putting the agreement together. https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/867706595102388224


**So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.** 
 
So, to recap:

- DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank. 

- The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.

- The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable. 

- Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then **literally** gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 


**Did we just spend so much time fighting and bickering with core that we totally missed the REAL takeover of Bitcoin, happening right before our eyes, by the likes of currently serving Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board Members?**

personalfinance,Should I pay off my $155k of federal student loans (that has 6% interest) in one lump sum payment by using my home equity line (that has 4.25% interest)?,"Please bear with me as this is my first PF post.

Essentially, I have accumulated around $155,000 in student debt from graduate school. I graduated this past May 2017 and my six months 'grace period' is up next month. As such, I must start repaying that student debt.  The interest rate for my student loans is an even 6% I believe. 

I have a $300,000 line of credit (home equity line) that bears 4.25% interest. Therefore, I was thinking I would just pay off my student loans with the equity line and thus not have to pay the 6% rate and instead I would only pay the 4.25% rate (and pay off the equity line debt over time).

My situation is that I have a gov't county job that I plan to start next month that only pays about $54k a year to start (plus benefits).  Additionally, I do work on the side that will garner anywhere from $100-2k a month additionally. I do not have any other debt (no car debt, no house debt, no CC debt).

So I ask, would paying off my student loans with my home equity line be the smartest thing to do?",finance

personalfinance,housing vs student loans,My husband and I live in a rent controlled apartment and our landlord has indicated that next year he'll be buying everyone out and selling the land.   We've been saving for a place for a number of years and with the payout would be able to do a full 20% down payment on a permanent place with some left over for emergencies.

personalfinance,Quality of life,"I'm an orthopaedic surgery resident making $2700/mo after taxes.  Rent and utilities is $900.  Engaged, no kids, no car payment.  Only debt is $400k student loans.  Approx 270k is at 6.5% compounded yearly.  The remainder is federal between 6 and 7.25%.


I'll make approx the same salary for the next 5.5 years.  Each year my annual salary increases by around $2000 (currently 56k gross).


After that I'll be looking at an average starting salary of $480k and $700k after 5 years at which point the numbers become more variable.

My question is if it's worth it to put off paying my loans for the next 6 years so that I can maximize my quality of life.  Clearly I'll be able to pay everything off fairly quickly in the long run.

I think my current salary doesn't really allow me to make a significant dent in my student loan debt especially given the enormous bump in salary I'll get in a few years.  So I feel like it's ok to let interest accrue because even if  my debt triples, my salary will increase by 10x and I think I still come out ahead.

Except this has taken 4 years so far and I'm really fed up with living in a half-finished house, plus the area is no place to raise a kid.

We've been snowballing debts and have cleared 2 bills and have an extra $708 a month now. Our debts, not including student loans, is at $44K ($25K credit card, $9.5K car, and $9.5K personal loan through bank). Yes, we fucked up really badly on credit cards and used them to work on the house plus things we didn't need. We have stopped using it completely.

Our combined monthly income after taxes, 401K, health insurance is a little more than $4,800. With current bills plus at least $1,200 going to credit card we have around $1,500 leftover if we stick to budget.

We are currently trying to sell the house as-is without finishing the cabinets and bathroom and back room (neighborhood isn't the greatest and average median household value is around $45K so don't want to pour even more money in and not get anything more out of it). We would like at least $30-35K. It has new wiring, roof, windows, walls, etc., so it shouldn't be too hard to find someone to buy. I would use this to wipe out the credit card and personal loan debt and use any extra as a down payment.

We already found a house we like. It's $78K and the bank has given us a 4.4% rate. With 3% down the monthly is $683 or so. But we are waiting on our house going first. We won't do it if we can't sell the house.

My question is, should I open up a business bank account? Will the credit on my business bank account also affect my personal credit? I do not want to keep destroying my personal credit.

Should I pull my investments to pay off my debts completely? How long till Would it take to get back up into the 700s if I paid off my debt? I plan on paying off my credit card first. I am completely new to most of this.

personalfinance,"Sold a vehicle and want to use the money to put a dent in my debt, wisely","I sold a classic car I've had for 8 years and want to use the money I made to pay off some of my debt and do it in a way that makes sense based on interest rates, etc. I have $4000 to use currently and
my current debt amounts to:

$750 car loan at 2.5% paying $123/mo  
$4800 CC debt at %17 paying $125/mo, $65 of which is interest  
$900 CC debt at 8% paying $20/mo, $6 of which is interest   

&amp;nbsp;
My thought is that I pay off my car loan, free up the $123/mo, my car insurance goes down a bit due to no longer having to have full coverage so I'll free up that amount as well, which I can put towards my debt monthly. Then pay down the $4800 $2000 or so and maybe consolidate and get a loan at a manageable interest rate to better handle the debt over the coming year or so. Am I being naive here? Should I put all the money toward the highest interest rate card instead and deal with the others gradually since they are such low rates? Any other options?",finance
personalfinance,"Considering buying my first house, is there any reason to not get a 30 year mortgage?","As the title says, I am considering buying my first house, and I am not entirely certain when it comes to mortgage options. It seems to me that there is no reason to get a shorter mortgage, as long as the rate on a 30 year is decent, because stock returns are beating mortgage rates? IE, I should keep my money in stocks where I am getting more than 4% returns, which covers the 4% interest rate on a mortgage.

Am I missing something? Why do people get shorter mortgages?

btc,"Bail-ins, Bail-outs, (hyper)Inflation, Negative interest rates, Capital controls. These are just some of the things bitcoin mitigates or avoids. Those who compare it to ""tulips"" are absolute morons.","Even if bitcoins only use to society was avoiding negative interest rates, bail-ins + bail-outs, that is incredibly useful. Of course a banker like Jamie Dimon would call something a fraud that removes a ""bank tax"" on society by allowing them to avoid these fraudulent charges.

Banks gamble with their customers assets and when things go south: A bail-in means depositors funds are used to help pay the bill. A bail-out means taxpayers are used to help pay the bill. How anyone can say this is just and isn't fraudulent is beyond me. They are reaping the reward when their gambling goes well, yet they are not defraying the costs of their gambling when it goes south.

Additionally, governments around the world are slowly eliminating cash. Of course banks would support such an endeavor because of negative interest rates. A negative interest rate is where you pay the bank to hold your money instead of them paying you. It would be a forced tax upon humanity in addition to all the others we are paying.
Lets make something clear: Gold doesn't bypass the fraudulent negative interest rate taxes because it doesn't allow you to easily USE your money. If banks charge negative interest rates and cash is eliminated you will need to be able to send and receive money for payments... something gold sucks at.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Schwab's actually a pretty good bank,"Obligatory /r/HailCorporate

Schwab doesn't just provide investment accounts, they do banking as well. I was going over my finances and was looking at how I wanted to structure my banking going forward, when I had a look at what Schwab had on offer. Some of their offerings are pretty damn good.

For example, Schwab's high-yield checking yields .15% interest with no minimums required, no annual/monthly fees, no foreign transaction fees, and ATM fees are refunded.

Their high-yield savings has .35% interest with no minimums or fees.

They also have credit cards, one of which is a blanket 1.5% cash-back on all purchases w/ no annual fee. Unfortunately, it's American Express (blech).

Sorry for the advertisement, but when I saw a checking account that offered the same interest rate as the high-yield savings at my local credit union, I knew I had to share. Tie all this to a brokerage account that grows your wealth via index funds, and you've got an interesting long-term hybrid banking/investing strategy.

TL;DR: Schwab's actually a pretty good bank.",finance
personalfinance,Do all credit unions use an effed up account numbering system?,"Got a new account at a credit union, and received the odd advice that when setting up online payments into the account, to use this scheme:

Account number: `1234567` + `-1` for Savings or `-9` for Checking.

Internally, at my CU, to differentiate several accounts owned by one person, they just use the member number for all of them, and then add the name of the product. E.g., `1234567 Checking`. And so to work with ACH, they depend on a hack.

I discover, though, that this doesn't work at the first merchant I try, likely because a hyphen is not valid in an account number. But it's after hours and so I have to call them tomorrow and hope that whatever hack they advise me to use will work and my money will end up where it should.

Looking around for info, I found that this is common for credit unions: an account number used internally, and then a different scheme used for ACH. E.g., instead of just assigning an internally unique account number, they force the customer to jump through hoops:

* https://www.docfcu.org/about-your-account-number ""Your account number is your 7-digit Member number PLUS the 6-digit prefix that indicates checking, savings or other share type. You must use the whole number for all outside transactions . . .""
* https://www.pscu.org/account-numbers/ ""The 10-digit account number is made up of the Share ID, zeros and your member account number. ***Exception: If the Share ID for your Savings Account is 00, then the 10-digit account number begins with 98.***""
* https://www.sdccu.com/other/routing-account-numbers ""Your account number is printed at the bottom of your personal checks. Each sub account (savings, checking, etc.) has a 2 digit suffix attached to your account number. For example 1234567 + 89 = 123456789.""

Do they all simply use the same brain-dead software? Is there any legitimate reason for this? I can't think of any. 

This is really Mickey Mouse. Makes me consider going to a big bank like Chase just so I'll get a genuine unique account number for each account.",finance
personalfinance,General advice for 30 year old getting ready to buy a house.,"So I’m 30 years old and married and my wife and I are planning on buying a home within the next year or so. We both have never owned an APT or home. We’d like to start a family soon and want to buy property before we do.

My wife just finished her Masters and landed her first full time job so our gross income went from about 90K to 140K.

Combined we have about 70K in student loans. I’m currently in the process of refinancing to get a lower rate on some of my bigger loans (interest rates in the 8-10% range). My credit score is around a 780 and my wife’s is 810.

We are currently renting paying approximately 1,000/ month and looking to buy a house in the 300-350K range. 

We have about 10K saved up.

So just a couple questions:

What kind of rate should I be aiming to get for our student loans given our high credit scores?

Should we pay off the student loans first before buying? Part of me thinks we should but we would like to have a child soon. The APT we rent right now is a 1BR and very cheap and nice for the area which has allowed us to save a little while my wife was finishing her masters. We’ve been here for 4 years. However, we wouldn’t be able to have an infant here. A 2 BR in the same area (we want to stay where we are) would rent for $1,600-1,800/month. Which I believe would be close the the mortgage on a 300-350K house.

First time homebuyers loan in Massachusetts? If you make over a certain amount are you disqualified? 

How much should we have saved before starting to make offers on potential homes?

Thanks!

personalfinance,"$130,000 dollars in student loan debt and terrified","**UPDATE ON BOTTOM OF POST**

Hi guys, I've never posted on Reddit before, but have been a long time lurker on this subreddit and I am inspired by how much you guys help people.  

My short story:
A 17 year old ass goes to an out-of-state private college and comes out with 100,000$ in private student loan debt from Sallie Mae and 30,000$ from federal loans.  Basically, my parents did all the financial stuff behind my back, and did not tell me that because they have terrible credit for a number of reasons, my average interest rate is about 14%.

I just recently found out that I'll be paying about 1700$ a month, which is impossible to pay.  I have two jobs and only make about 1300$ a month, so even if I spent NOTHING, I still can't pay these loans.

My parents and I have applied to ten different refinancing companies (Which I will be happy to list: soFi, connext, Citizens Bank, Laurel Road, Earnest, etc.), and we have been rejected every single time because of their credit score.

I feel trapped and helpless and these loans are coming up in two months and I am terrified and only 21.  Whatever advice you can offer I appreciate more than you can imagine.  If you have anymore questions, I'm happy to answer them.

Also please be kind, I'm in a bad place right now.

EDIT: For those asking, I work as a paraprofessional in a public school and a tutor/babysitter on the side.  I have a degree in history and education and am a certified teacher that could not get a full-time teaching job.

EDIT 2: I just want to thank you so much.  From what everyone has said, I have been able to list out about 7 different options when I thought I had none.  You guys have been amazing.

**UPDATE**

So taking a lot of your advice, I called Sallie Mae crying that I wasn't going to be able to do anything to pay the loans.  They put me on an interest only payment plan for 12 months (which is still a little under 1000), and reduced my monthly payments to about 1300 a month after that in exchange for making it a 15 year term.  It's not a permanent fix, but it doesn't require me to relocate or join the military, and it gives me more time to figure things out.

I just wanted to thank everyone again for the help, I read and tried to answer every single comment.  I thought this post would maybe get like 5 comments, let alone 500.  Idk, I'm so grateful.  Thanks guys, much love. &lt;3",finance

Should I be considering lenders mortgage insurance?

personalfinance,I have a lot of liquid cash for emergencies/budgets - better to put in a mutual fund with check writing?,"Hey everyone.

I have a pretty rigorous budget that I have adhered to for years. I used to do the ""envelope"" system with cash, but then I moved it to separate accounts on capital one 360 since it is extremely easy to add/close accounts as needed.

I have accounts for:

* Emergency fund for one year
* Non-monthly recurring bills for one year (insurance premiums, heating oil, community center memberships, etc)
* Car savings (both cars are paid off, so we put back about 200 a month for purchase of new cars when the current ones die)
* Home repair (for replacement and repair of things around the house that are or aren't predictable, like roof replacement, fridge repair, buying a new lawnmower)
* Kid savings (storage of cash gifts for our newborn - we have an entirely separate 529, this is purely an account to hold cash for her to spend/invest when she is a little older)
* Vacation - savings for vacation and travel
* Etc (short term holding accounts for a private loan, monthly investments, investments for daughters 529, a holding account for our monthly credit card payment)

The way the accounts are currently set up, I earn about $25/mo in interest.

This has worked great so far. But, because everything has been set up to be conservative, I find myself with a glut of cash on hand. Since most of these are working accounts that DO have both deposits and withdrawals against them, I can't really lock them up in something illiquid. 

Rather than having all of the cash sit there, I am considering taking a big portion of that pile of cash, most likely the car, emergency, and bill accounts, and moving it into a somewhat safe mutual fund that has check writing privileges.

I live in Pennsylvania, and have a long term position in $VPAIX (Vanguard PA Muni bond fund). That means all dividends, short and long term gains are tax free at both state and federal levels. I have a large enough position that I can write checks if I so choose. If I were to move the contents of those cash accounts into VPAIX, I would be earning about $120/mo in monthly dividends. The price of VPAIX has hovered between $10 and $12 for 16 years, and should be largely immune to market fluctuations as a fixed-income type assets.

This would give me a better return, maintain liquidity thanks to check writing, and in theory lower my overall tax burden (by a negligible amount because bank interest is taxable, Muni bond interest isn't). Plus the fund itself is rather stable through various market conditions. However, it would make a VERY large stake in a single fund in a single sector, which is a bit concerning.

I just wanted to get some input on this idea before starting to put it into action. I know there are more devils in the details that I'm not thinking of.",finance
personalfinance,How old I effectively pay off my student loan debt?,"Sorry for the typo. I need some guidance with getting my student loans paid off once and for all. I recently was given a merit increase that now brings my salary to $71,000. I owe $47,000 in federal student loans at 5.75%. I am 33 and I really want to have my loans paid before I am 40. I try to live frugally so if you see anywhere I can trim the fat let me know. I am on the IBR plan and I pay $356.00 a month. I have done the math, and I figure that I would need to make nearly $100,000 annually to reach the same payment amount under the standard 10-year repayment plan. Right now, I would like to start contributing more to my student loans and to my retirement while remaining on IBR.

What I would like to do is pay $1300/month on my student loans. Is this amount too high? Does it make financial sense to pay $1300/monthly on my student loans while increasing my 401k contributions to 15% of my salary?

gaming,Skyrim - Imperial or Stormcloaks,"My fellow reddit community,
there is this one discussion i had with my best friend going on for years now.

You don't have to look closely into Skyrim to see the conflict going on between the Stormcloaks (native) and the Imperial Army (invader).

The thing is, the Imperial Army brings not only war and death to Skyrim. They are like ROMA in our world history. With them comes progress and connection. They provide savety to the locals, build governments and legal protection, in a worst case scenario like you see in ESO tamriel dont need to form a federation cause they are already once.
The Imperium provides trading and nationwide economy. They are civilization.

In the other way, the Stormcloaks are lokals who want to ceep there tradition alive and wanna rule thier landon thier own.

In the stage you enter Skyrim, i can't see such bad resons for the locals to fight the Army.

personalfinance,Just received $11k credit card through my bank. What to do with other debt?,"I applied for, and received, a joint credit card account with my wife.  She has a 700 score, I a 740 score.  It's got an $11k balance and offers us an opportunity to get rid of other credit.

For example, a Best Buy card at 25.4% with a current balance of $400 needs to go away.  The new card is 16%, and while not amazing, isn't terrible.

Do I just use the new card to pay the Best Buy card so the balance is carried from there?  Should I get a balance transfer through the bank directly?  After that, do I destroy the card or close the account entirely?  What's my best option(s)?

Additionally, I have another signature loan through my bank where my wife and I replaced the HVAC in the house because it died.  There is balance of $900 on that with 13.74% interest on it.  It's a lower interest rate, so I believe my answer is ""No"", but should I also transfer that loan to the card, if only to consolidate it?  The monthlies would be lower, but overall, I'd end up paying a little more, I suspect.

All current debt is up to date and there is nothing outstanding.  We're not hurting, but I want to improve in any way I can and this is uncharted territory for me.",finance

last year my car crapped out. i couldn't keep up with the repair costs. i tried to get a loan from my bank to get a new car but i was turned down for lack of credit history. after exhausting all options i had to go to a payday loan company that offered long term loans.

my original loan was 2500 at 59.99% interest. payments were around 50 bucks a paycheck or thereabouts

earlier this year i refinanced with them for 3500 at again 59.99% so i could pay off some things that were stacking up.

personalfinance,Dissolve portfolio to pay back loan?,"I have a government-funded loan (limits the interest rate) for my flat.

The interest rate is currently at 1% (I'm in the 3rd year) - it will raise to 2% in two years and go to 4% after 10 years, 5% after 15 years and peek at 6% after 20 years for the last 10 years.

Questions is: Should I pay back the loan if I have enough money sitting around?

The money used to pay back the loan is currently invested in a diversified stock portfolio - most of it ""safe"" investments (as the money is dedicated to pay back the loan). The portfolio grows about 2-3% every year.

I tend to pay back the money right now - the losses from the difference between the earnings of the portfolio should be compensated with a more aggressive investment strategy once the loan is payed back.

personalfinance,Mortgage assistance help,"First time posting here, so please be gentle. 

My husband and I bought our house 6 years ago. We have never been late, never missed a payment until recently. I'm not working due to an adoption at first, and now I'm pregnant. We tried filing for mortgage assistance in August with chase. We where denied because my husband had too much disposable income. They wouldn't even take into account our other bills. Me losing my job literally pushed us down to less than half of what we where making. We don't qualify for any subsidies for the kid because he's related, I had to stay at home with him for minimum 3 months. We also don't qualify for much public assistance. Our bills are more than he makes in a month. He had a second job, but got laid off in August because of no hours. We also have a significant amount of debt, but not enough to get a debt consolidation loan. What else can we do? We have to come up with 1400 before the end of this month or they are gonna start foreclosure. And before anyone asks, no we have no one to borrow it from, and we don't qualify for any loans because of the debt. 

Edit: I forgot to point out, we have a low interest rate because it was a first time home buyers loan. We also have our insurance and taxes lumped into our monthly payment. They go up about $200dollars every 6 months, because they claim it drains our escrow account. When we ask for proof of what they are paying, they never send it. We have asked to have it taken off and we would pay it ourselves, but they won't. They claim the taxes and insurance are going up, but we have proof that our taxes went down because the value of the house went down, and our insurance keeps going down because we have it bundled with our car and we have never been in an accident. 

Edit 2: Basically what I'm asking is, are there programs out there that can help us? My husband called again and they finally let us talk to the people that do the home equity. We both have to have a 680 credit score and he doesn't, so that cancels that option. They won't remove the escrow stuff without being up to date. Is there anything we can do or say to them to help us with mortgage assistance besides selling the house?",finance
Bitcoin,Wells Fargo just took me to the cleaners.... can crypto save me?,"First of all, let me preface this with:  I knew better...  I claim full responsibility...  I am and have been a born-again crypto believer for years.  That being said the levels to which banking thievery and collusion among other institutions(court) caught me with my pants down.  r/bitcoin, any advice you could give me is more than appreciated...

Here's what happened-
I am in the US and had an unauthorized WF credit card opened and sent to me several years ago..  Being that I was broke, I used the card and accrued several $K worth of debt.  When news broke last year of the rampant fraud, I disputed the veracity of the CC with WF and asked for proof that I opened the card.  After being flatly rebuffed I decided on principle to not make payments and deal with their civil action.  The court papers were delivered to my door around 5 months ago.  I filed a dispute/reason according to my local court protocol.  I was told by the court clerk the next step is to wait for a court date.  In my naivety, this is what I did, I even hoped that possibly the attorney's representing WF had given up hope, considering the settlement is now proceeding.  Alas...  Even worse, because so many accounts were linked to WF, I kept the account open and $ in bank checking/savings account.  At the risk of vomitting, I admit, it was all my fiat...  (Did I already admit to being an idiot?)  I've never dealt with a civil judgement.  In my mind, when the papers were served and I had to appear in court, I would empty out the accounts in preparation for an unjust judgement...  That never happened.

Friday the 13th:
I awoke to an overdraft notice.  WF emptied my account (set-off is what they termed it), EVERY LAST DIME.  And also yesterday I received via snail-mail a notice dated from last week where WF used an attorney privilege to file a summary motion and receive a court date with a judge on the same day, in which they ruled in WF favor.  All of this without my knowledge...  Any small-faith I had in the US court system that a citizen can in any way challenge a corporation is obviously shattered...  My stupidity kept me up all night and I don't expect any sympathy...

This Saturday:
I have a 3-week vacation planned to the UK.  $0 in my bank account...  Thankfully Ive been hodling a small amount of crypto and I'm hopeful this can float me.  SO, question is:  any advice on how to survive in the UK for 3 weeks on only crypto??  Thankfully I am staying with a friend, so that is a major relief...  I've began searching crpytocribs to find a flat for a few days, but any suggestions as to a pre-paid VISA or crypto-app so that I can purchase food, bus tickets, etc?  All the other misc things I will need with a multi-week stay....

r/bitcoin, let this be a warning to anyone with a shadow of a doubt that its time to blockade the banks and fully withdraw.  There's no meaningful consumer protections, I honestly would have been better off owing $ to the Mafia...  Thanks and again, please go easy on me I can't stomach food and am appropriately flogging myself for my insolence...",cryptocurrency

How will this affect my credit score if I do pull the trigger and refinance? (I worked so hard to raise it over 120 points throughout the last year, so I get scared when i think it could drop again)

Is it worth refinancing this even though the payoff date on 2/3 loans would be in 4 years as opposed to 5 or 7?

Is there anything else I am missing or steps I should take to go about this whole process?

$5800 left on Car Finance - $400 a month for roughly next 15 months

$11000 on Credit Card 1

$18000 on Credit Card 2


Obviously the interest rate on the credit cards are higher than the car but with a lump sum like this, does it benefit to pay off most of the car quickly and then put the $400 extra towards the credit card over the next year instead?  I think the money savings are to use it on the credit card but not having another year of car payments is peace of mind knowing that one of the debts are paid off.

Personal Loan (2016) $2,600- interest rate is 135%. This was the only way I could pay rent/expenses when I was unemployed (unemployment was not enough to cover everything). Payment is $294 a month. Payoff quote was $2700.   


Car Loan (2015) $12,550- interest rate is 17%. Payment is $309. I needed a car (had a junker that died) to get to all my appointments when I worked in behavior science. I probably got swindled and will definitely be smarter in the future. I've had the car 2 years and I definitely need it in my area. It's worth about ~7k now according to KBB.

personalfinance,She owes the Man.,"Recently I helped a friend with her taxes as she was unsure why she owed money to the IRS.

financialindependence,"Seeking confirmation bias for my 10-year plan (or talk me out of it, either one)","Howdy.

My wife and I are in our mid-30's and we are building our dream home. We move in next summer.

Here is our situation:

This dream home will have a $200k mortgage (approx) with a 10-year ARM at 3.875%. 

We have no other debt, except for one student loan my wife has (12k balance), and it's under 3%.

At the end of the 10 year arm, the interest rate could vary up to 2% in the next year (5.875% max), and then up to 5% every year after that (so it's capped at 8.75%).

I really want to own my home free and clear for psychological reasons. Debt stresses me out.

But I know the math and I have discipline. So, here's the plan:

Start in Summer '18 with a taxable account (low cost index funds), and put in every spare penny I have in the account for 10 years. Our costs are low and our earnings are considered high (~$250k combined), so I can likely put $4-6k/month into a taxable account.

My thought is this......even if there's a downturn in the next few years, if I'm riding a 10 year investment period, it will likely correct during that time frame. At the end of 10 years, when the ARM adjusts to the current interest rate, I evaluate my situation. Obviously, if the interest rate creeps towards the 7-8% rate, I would just pay the house off, no big deal.

Relevant to the situation:

Wife is engineer working in the auto industry. Not recession-proof, but she kept her job through the crisis in '08, and she's close to irreplaceable at her job.

Myself, OTOH, run my own business that is 100% commission and not recession proof. I run a fitness business, and I'm a ""luxury expense"" for all of my clients. Basically, I'm likely the first expense cut if times get tough.

What would you do?

Pay off the house furiously in the next 2-3 years and be done?

Follow through with my plan for 10 years?

Something else?

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,"Student Loans won't Take my $$$, Interest Building","That title sounds like an exaggeration... but it kind of isn't.   
  
I'm been fighting with FedLoanServicing since August 11th of this year. I 'owed' $13,000 (not horrible), but I can't afford it. My grandpa is finally, thankfully, offering to pay it off in FULL.  He said, ""Have them send a bill in the mail, I'll return a check."" HE doesn't like computers, and frankly, I want a paper trail. I don't want them calling me for decades asking for payments on an account I've already paid off (like credit companies do)...   
  
Anyway, the bill NEVER arrived. I've called FedLoan several times since then, and none of the representatives could fix the situation. They kept ""mailing"" me NEW final payoff notices for me to give my grandpa, and yet they never came.   
  
Today, I called with my mother, because she gets results. It turns out they supposedly sent 1 letter in physical paper in August, but the the U.S. mail ""must have lost it."" (plausible) Because it never came. Apparently every letter after was mailed to my paperless billing account. (Okay, I never use it. I only click 'okay' years ago to keep the 3 letters a week bills to stop coming in; I'd been putting them under my bed they came so often. They argued that me signing up for paperless billing made it my fault, so I am responsible for the interest up until now. Making the final bill not 13K but 14K! Another $1,000.   
  
I said to the billing representative, ""Having signed up for paperless billing or not, my inbox is not my grandfather's physical home address, as has been requested every time I've called."" That's nonsense. And secondly, when they said ""I'm mailing it out to you."" That's horribly misleading language. It doesn't sound like email at all. Otherwise the representative at each call could have said, ""I'm messaging it"" or ""sending it to your inbox."" All I know, they're screwing me and I can't stand for it. My question is, how can I pay for my original bill that I asked to pay for in August for 13K, and not the interest that they are trying to charge me for that I don't feel responsible for? I feel like I have a court case even...

I have one capital one and discover card. She had info on both. She had the first numbers on both cards on the system. I would assume the company that issued the card had access to it unless there's a third party handling these kinds of things that has access to both cards.

personalfinance,Mortgage APR vs Rate-- maybe this should be under Explain it Like I'm Five,"Ok, definition I have found :

""The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal loan amount. It can be variable or fixed, but it’s always expressed as a percentage.

The APR is a broader measure of the cost of your mortgage because it reflects the interest rate, as well as other costs such as broker fees, discount points and some closing costs. The APR is also expressed as a percentage.""


My question is, don't you pay those fees- broker, closing costs, points, etc, at closing??  You're not continuing to pay them, you paid upfront and are done. Why are they factored in?

My best guess is like if you add those costs to the total, the APR is calculated after that.  But if the fees are already paid then APR is moot.

So I graduated college in December with about $45,000 in student loans. $14,000 is through citizens bank and the rest is fedloan.  I currently work as a teacher's aide and make about $1200/month. (Planning on starting another part time job soon) Back when I was in college and thought jobs were included with diplomas, I had set my loan payments to the highest possible amount- $630/month- As of recently it was getting to be too much to afford. I just applied and was accepted for the REPAYE option where my loan payments are based on my income. I will continue to owe $320/month for the Citizen's Bank one and right now owe $0/month now for my federal loans. 

My plan is to continue to pay the Citizen's Bank loans and then take $150 a month and direct it to my specific federal loans that have higher interest. (I have like 10 smaller ones- some of mine are around 3%, the higher ones are 6.8%)

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin: A Global Currency, Digital Gold, or Neither","Bitcoin as a global currency:

On May 17 2010, bitcoin enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz posted on bitcointalk.org: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day”. Five days later he found a taker and received two large Papa John’s pizzas in exchange for 10,000 BTC; worth about $40 at the time. While leftover Papa John’s sounds nasty and $40 seems a bit pricey, Laszlo made a far worse exchange than he could have imagined.
In 2017, 10,000 bitcoin would buy Lazlo 2.75 million large Papa John’s pizzas. In hindsight, Laszlo essentially chose 2 pizzas in 2010 over 2.75 million pizzas in 2017 (or $55 million in cash): a regrettable trade. Instead of making the purchase in bitcoin, let’s assume that Laszlo paid for the pizzas with USD. With an inflation rate in the United States of about 1.9% over the past 7 years, Lazlo’s $40 should theoretically buy him about 1.75 Papa John’s Pizzas in 2017. Had he paid using USD, Laszlo would have effectively chosen 2 pizzas in 2010 over 1.75 pizzas in 2017: an excellent trade. While this example is extreme, it highlights the most overlooked difference between USD and bitcoin: inflation.
While many bitcoin enthusiasts will rant about how the Federal Reserve is defrauding us by “printing” money and creating inflation, clearly, printing money serves a purpose: it encourages us to buy things with USD today. Implicit in each transaction we make in USD is a belief that the USD we spend will not appreciate in value and afford us more goods or services in the future. The same cannot be said for bitcoin. Given the currency’s fixed supply, the more popular bitcoin becomes, the more goods and services each bitcoin will likely buy. As Laszlo’s purchase demonstrates, falling prices reduce people’s willingness to spend bitcoin: destroying any hopes of it becoming a global currency.

Bitcoin as “digital gold”:
So if bitcoin will not be used extensively for daily transactions, what will it be used for? Among other uses bitcoin could potentially be used as a store of wealth or “digital gold”. Despite gold being a physical asset and bitcoin a digital asset the two are comparable across multiple facets:

Limited Supply — A maximum of 21 million bitcoins will be created or “mined”. Further limiting this supply are the millions of bitcoins which have been and will continue to be lost. Current estimates for the total amount of bitcoin already permanently lost are as high as 4 million. Estimates for the total quantity of mine-able gold range from about 171,000 metric tons to 2.5 million metric tons. While estimates of gold’s supply cover a much wider range, both gold and bitcoin come with a degree of certainty that neither will be devalued due to the creation of more units.
Costly extraction: The average cost to extract one ounce of gold is estimated to be about $1,000. Similar to how gold must be extracted from the earth, bitcoins must be digitally “mined”. Bitcoin miners are taxed with the massive responsibility of verifying all transactions on the bitcoin network in return for modest fees and, more importantly, a chance at getting newly created bitcoin. The amount of electricity used to mine one bitcoin is roughly equal to the amount of electricity needed to power 3 American households for an entire year. With 657,000 thousand bitcoin being created in 2017, the electricity used to extract bitcoin in 2017 could power over 2 million homes for an entire year.
Security: Gold holds a distinct advantage over bitcoin when it comes to security: the ETF. With the introduction of the ETF, investors in gold can easily offload the risks associated with holding physical gold to a custodian bank. While many uncompromising investors still prefer to hold physical gold out of distrust for the custodian, for most of us, the ETF represents a cheap way to reduce the risks originally associated with holding gold. For bitcoin, security is dependent on measures taken by individual bitcoin holders. Abstracting from the risk of hackers stealing bitcoin off of phones or computers, physical security poses a major risk to bitcoin holders. Anyone who has opened a bitcoin wallet should remember writing 12 or so obscure “wallet words” on a sheet of paper and stashing it somewhere in their house. While these words serve as a backup password, whoever finds these “wallet words” can immediately steal your bitcoin. Serious investors would be wise to take more reliable measures when it comes to storing their “wallet words” such as putting them in a safety deposit box at the local bank: An action that would demoralize the pioneers of the anti-establishment bitcoin revolution.
While bitcoin and gold share a number of characteristics, the growth of bitcoin as “digital gold” is dependent on people continuing to arbitrarily assign value to it. Begging the question of whether there is more intrinsic value in a few numbers on a digital ledger than in a lump of gold: a question which remains to be answered.
Neither:
While Bitcoin’s use as an alternative to gold seems more plausible than its rise as a global currency, it could be neither. Actions taken by governments could force bitcoin onto the black market. Excessive speculation could cause downward spirals in prices. Attempts by hackers to steal large quantities of bitcoin off of exchanges could be successful. Alternative currencies could dethrone bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency.
Nevertheless, the innovative block chain technology underlying the bitcoin payment system is here to stay. While the risks posed with investing in cryptocurrencies run abound, the only way to learn about cryptocurrencies is to go out into the market, buy some, and make a transaction.",cryptocurrency

We have been working towards being ready to buy a first home. We have no CC debts or student loans (thank god) but we have 2 car debts, one with 4200 left on it and one with 14k left. Both loans are sub-2%interest rate. We have 10k in savings, and were looking at 15-20k as bare-ass-minimum for downpayment on a house in our desired region.  I am currently working out of town til july which allows us some fairly hefty deductions ontop of temporarily much higher pay scale . 

Her Argument: We should focus almost all our efforts on saving for the house. The car loans are at a ""basically cash"" rate in her words and we wont save that much by paying off early. 

My argument: I desire to at the very least pay least off the smaller car loan within the next 4 months or so. I feel it'll unlock 172$ a month or so in what we can afford for a house payment, as well as free that money up for saving/paying other car faster in the meantime.  I also feel it'll provide an emotional boost to our savings to pay off 1/2 our remaining debt sources.

I graduated college this past May and recently took a job in a medical field.

The job I have now offers 401K and I currently invest 3% into it.

She is working full time while going back to school and will be bringing in ~30k/year. My vehicle also KBB's for $1,000 so I will need to get a more reliable mode of transportation in the near future as i have a 1-hour drive one-way to work. 
In total, my debt is approximately 16K overall and I want to make sure that I am investing my money wisely while also working on paying off the student loans that come with the higher interest rates. I have very little experience with personal finance because quite frankly, I didn't have many bills before (living at home 3/4 years in college), and never having much disposable income. 

I should also add that I do plan on paying down my student loan debt ASAP, and I am not paying interest to my family's loans, so those will come second.

personalfinance,Keep my car and continue to make payments? Pay it off in full? Or sell it?!,"Ok guys. Here are the details. 2011 Nissan Sentra. Bought the car in October 2015. 48 month loan. Loan for approx $9300. Monthly payments $226. 

Right now I am exactly 2 years into paying my car off. $226 x 24 months = $5,424

That means I owe exactly $5,424 on the car for the remainder of the loan (the remaining 2 years). 

Interest rate between 7% and 8%. I know I've already paid most of the interest during the first two years of the loan. 

This year I've had some issues with it. Had to get rear drums replaced, replace bent rim, new tires, new brakes, alignment, and other issues. Might seem minor to some people but it was a lot for me to have to pay up front. Amounted to about $1,300. 

My car also has some driving issues and steering wheel shakes and probably needs some more work done - but is 100% drivable. 

My question - do I sell car as is while it is still worth something? Or do I continue to make payments and finish out the loan? Or do I pay it off in full and then sell later down the road? I am so lost and don't know what I should do!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!!",finance

Bitcoin,An Introduction to Crypto-Derivatives,"Pre-existing business solutions are gaining new forms on a blockchain. While the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies exceeds all possible forecasts, a rapidly expanding market consistently offers more and more advanced alternatives to classic financial instruments. The social behaviour of leading participants involved in exchange of cryptocurrencies determines their price, and is a consequence of volatility in its most hypertrophied form.

To date, traditional financial markets have been stemming risks from many popular assets: agricultural goods, gas, interest rates, and even stock indices, through financial derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options. A good decision on which derivative to use provides investors with an additional layer of protection, and increases their confidence on the market. Now is the time for the next milestone.

The extra sensitivity of digital currencies to social and governmental activities makes them less attractive for general users and impedes their mass adoption. On the other hand, traditional derivatives made specifically for institutional investors are crudely standardised, have a high market entry threshold, and as a result leave no place for private investors or merchants willing to secure their interests.

Although derivatives on bitcoin and the ether exist, currently market participation requires considerable financial expertise and investment to secure. We suggest to think over a creation of a software platform which is more transparent, advanced, and community-oriented than ever before. We propose to allow holders of any crypto-asset to individually assemble unique financial instruments and offer them to the crypto-community.

Let us imagine that you run an online store and accept bitcoins. You expect to receive 5 bitcoins by October 30, 2017, which will be used for the purchase or production of goods for further resale. Currently 1 bitcoin costs around USD 5,5k but you must be sure that when the time comes, you hold the right equivalent to 5 bitcoins and not less, i.e. USD 27,5k. Using an option on bitcoin allows you to acquire a right (without any obligation) to sell 5 bitcoins at a desired price by October 30, 2017 for a counterpart interested in buying 5 bitcoins for USD 27,5k. In the case of any significant shifts in state legal regulation, as we have seen in China and South Korea, the bitcoin price might suffer, but this will have no impact on you as you have already agreed to sell your bitcoins through a smart-contract under the supervision of the crypto-community. This solution would allow you to hedge price-associated financial risks and execute your business decisions as planned.

We see that key features of the proposed platform could be (i) the total decentralization of derivatives and (ii) an intuitive AI-powered constructor, allowing the drafting of the terms of the derivative in accordance with individual needs. That means the absence of any brokerage or escrow accounts and exchanges, the logic of which is executed by smart-contract wallets managed by platform users. In addition to that, participants can agree on the terms of the proposed transaction through decentralized consensus.

Smart-contracts add significant value to the ecosystem when they are used as (i) wallet holders, and as (ii) cession instruments. A wallet holder is a powerful tool which reduces transactional costs and protects investors from opportunistic behaviour. It ensures the performance of obligations under derivatives, by making it impossible to withdraw funds unless in the due course of an agreed transaction. It also excludes the necessity to provide any bank guarantee, and reduces transactional expenses to nothing. Having its own value, the smart-contract will be considered as a standalone entity and an independent crypto-asset. Thus it would be possible to resell, lend or even pledge the smart-contract.

We believe that easy-to-use crypto-derivatives is the next logical step for the development of digital currencies. We hope that our ideas will find community support and welcome any feedback to get the ball rolling.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Home equity for student loan to reduce overall monthly interest question.,"I currently am sitting in student loans of 76 k majority at 3 to 5 percent but 22 k of it at 6 percent all through federal loans.  I currently owe 62 k on my house with approximate value of 100 k to 110 k at 5 percent on 15 year mortgage.  I have 14 k in the bank right now.  I normally keep 10 k for emergency fund and dump the end into highest interest student loan, but my wife is off work for 2 months due to surgery so I was hanging on to extra.  Out combined yearly income is 130 k.  


I have the option to refinance to a 10 year mortgage at 4 percent for a credit union fee of 400 dollars estimated costs to switch the loan.  I would then take the 20 k of equity and pay off the 22 k loan at 6 percent decreasing my interest by a couple points.  Should I take advantage of this or is their merit in holding onto the equity in my home versus paying down my student loan for a yearly interest saving?",finance
personalfinance,Capital One not applying payment to balance for weeks,"Hello PF. I have three credit cards with Capital One. I have no issues with the two cards but the third card is a GM Credit Card (www.gmcard.com). The GM card is taking weeks to apply the payment to the balance of my credit card. This is negatively affecting my credit score (reporting previous balance). I'm not sure I can prove/verify this but I assume the longer the higher balance is there the more interest I'm being charged. 


I made two payments recently. On September 29th I made a payment of $100 that withdrew from my checking account on October 2nd. I made another payment of $50 on October 13th that withdrew from my checking on October 16th. Both payments in my Capital One account still show as pending transactions and neither have been applied to my balance. I make frequent payments to keep the balances low because of the interest rate. I only have the credit cards for rebuilding credit. 


I have a few concerns regarding the holds. First I should mention they've never had a bounce back or anything of that sort so there is no reason for the hold. This issue with the GM Card has been ongoing since I opened in over a year ago. With the payment not being applied in a timely fashion it is preventing me from using the card. I assume the longer they hold the payment the more interest they can charge. This is also negatively affecting my credit report as the balance being reported every month is the wrong balance (I know it lags, but it's two months behind on the balance because of this). I've had to call them at least 3 times on this issue and they fix it on the phone each time. I was told that I have to make payment with a debit card in order to have it post quickly, but I can't do that online. 


Is this something they are doing intentionally? Is it legal? Or do they just suck? I'm tired of calling them to get something simple like making a payment fixed.",finance
personalfinance,How many credit cards are too many?,"I hope this is the right thread. Didn't want to post in /r/churning as I'm looking for stable credit cards and not looking to keep changing constantly.

I'm not sure of my credit score, but I'm sure it's 750+.

I do all my banking through bank of America/Merrill edge so I'm platinum honors there. I currently use my bank of America cash back card for 5.25/3.5/1.75 % cash back on gas/groceries+wholesale clubs/everything else.

I recently got a Costco credit card ~2 months ago just so I can get 3% cash back on dining out (decent amount of dining out).

I also have a lowes credit card for purchases in store, and an old pen fed credit card that I have open but never use.


I'm currently interested in the new premium rewards credit card at bank of America. It has a $95 annual fee, which I've been trying to avoid cards with fees, but has $100 travel vouchers yearly and $100 for TSA precheck every 4 years. Also the rewards would come out to be 3.5% travel/dining and 2.625% on everything else. The extra $500 for signing up and spending $x is bonus.

We don't fly very much. If we travel it's usually by driving and staying at airbnbs. We usually spend $500-1000 a month eating out, and my monthly spending on my credit cards total seems to vary between $2k-5k the past 3 months depending on things that come up (car issues, business trip).


At the end of the day, I'll end up using my regular boa credit card at gas, groceries, Costco. New premium boa credit card for dining out, travel, everything else. Costco credit card to get into Costco and if I ever book vacations through Costco.

Is the additional credit card worth it? Especially with the annual fee? I appreciate any input and will answer any questions possible when I can!",finance

personalfinance,"Refinancing some student loans, but not all?","I'm an attorney who graduated law school in 2011. Salary is $85K and monthly rent $1030.

My total principal student loan balance (I borrowed to pay for both undergrad and law school) is $121,000. Mostly federal, some private, with mixed interest rates ranging from 3.25 to 8%. I currently pay about $1100/mo. in an income-based repayment plan. 

Naturally I would like to pay less per month and less over the life of the loan (or, the same per month and less over the life of the loan). I applied on SoFi, entering in my total loan balance, and the new interest rates and monthly payments seemed actually pretty underwhelming, with different options mostly around 5% and up.  

**My question is:** Can i refinance only some of my loans (i.e. the ones with interest rates of 5% and higher) and not others (i.e. do not disturb the ones with 3-4% rates)? I think that would be the best of both worlds, i.e. lowering the rates on my higher interest rate loans and not raising the rates on my lower interest rate loans. 

I have searched online a lot and not found a straight answer.",finance
personalfinance,A couple of credit score questions with upcoming house purchase maybe next year,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get some advice here, because I've been told some things recently that I'm not sure if true, I figured people in here would be pretty knowledgeable.  
So, I've worked hard over the last couple of years to improve my credit score, going from sub-500 to 683 currently. My income is up and my debt is down and we even just got pre-qualified for a mortgage, which is relieving because at 47 and with kids, I've been a renter all this time and thought I'd never get to this point.  
Anyway, we are thinking about waiting. We only just renewed our lease, and with some other things going on, it seems buying and moving would be better done around May of next year. Our current pre-qual expires in December, so we'd have to run another one in the spring. My brother-in-law just told my wife that this is a bad idea: he said that the hard inquiry on this pre-qual will drop my credit score by 70-80 points and we won't qualify when we try again in the spring.  
This seems extreme to me - I expected maybe a 15 point drop or thereabouts. Actually, it's been just over a month and my FICO score dropped by only 4 points (from 687 to 683) per the FICO score reporting feature in my bank account.  
So I disagreed with him, but my wife things he may be right - and wants to follow his advice and rush to buy a house now. Which is it?  
  
Also, I've been thinking of refinancing my auto loan. My debt/income ratio is in a favorable range so it's not something that *has* to be done, but I can lower my interest rate significantly now that we have a credit union account, and lower my payment by about $100/month. But again, would a new credit inquiry and new account negatively affect my credit in the short-term? Would this be something better to wait until after closing on a house next year?

personalfinance,Buying a House and Car and prepping for a Wedding all in 2018,"Hi folks. It's happy time for me in my life where I'm close to getting married and settling down. With it comes a great deal of spending and I can surely use some sound advice from those who already went through it all.

Our current financial situation:

* credit score in the high 700s/low 800s

* no student loans (gf just finished paying off hers!)

* $63K salary (gf makes a little over $70K)

* car lease of $200 a month, expiring May 2018 (gf is paying $200 for her car, interest free)

* currently renting $700 a month for an apt per person

House is the first priority. I already have $18K saved and can save another $2K by January by the time we're looking to pre-qualify for a loan and start looking. My gf can cover $5K in closing cost, if needed. I already talked to a well-trusted real estate agent for our price range, $150K-$200K for a townhouse and she walked me through the details of finding the right loans for a right house. I think I'd like to know anything that typical real estate agent might miss or forget to tell you or general things to look out for as a first time home owner.

Car is the second priority. I'm pretty much set on getting a used Mazda3 since I already know how it drives and love everything about it. It's currently listed around $13-16K in my area and I think I can manage to put down $3K in May when I have to return my current leased car (VW jetta, hate it, won't consider buying out). I'm worried that lenders will be harsh on me because I would have recently taken out a loan for the house. Is there anything I can do to show that I'm still a responsible lendee and lower the interest rate? Is it possible to get the loan from the same place as the house? Is this a good or bad option?

Wedding is the third priority. I'm set with the engagement ring (fully paid) and got all the parents' blessings. I know my gf has been saving for the wedding but she doesn't know that it can cost way more than what she thinks. So I'm planning to save at least $4K for anything that she wasn't expecting. I'm putting this as a third priority because it'll be at least a year before we save the date so we won't be spending a lot on the wedding prep in the near future. However, I'm a bit worried that after the moving into a new house and furnishing it, and buying a car, I'll be stretched pretty thin for a wedding. I'd hate to dip below the ""6 months"" savings to pay for the wedding but it appears I'll go down to about ""4 months"". Is it childish to ask my parents to help out for an interest free loan? Should I consider getting a new credit card with interest free for first several months to accrue charges and slowly pay it back?

I'm just generally overwhelmed with all the big spendings I have coming up next year and I want to make sure I take each step logically without letting my emotions take over the finance.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Question,"I wanted to get a second opinion on whether refinancing my mortgage will be worth it. For background, my wife and I purchased a house 5 months ago for $425,000. The initial mortgage was 10% down (paying PMI), 4.25% fixed rate conventional. As rates have come down since then, I am looking into refinancing. I got the term sheet from my mortgage broker and it outlines the following:


* Mortgage payout: $380,913.00
* Lender fees: $1,140
* Appraisal fees: $100
* Prepaid interest: $608.96 - not a problem
* Insurance escrow: $284.00
* Tax escrow: $4,489.03
* Titles fees: $500
* Lenders title insurance: $725.00
* Recording fees: $279.00
* Lender credit: -$870.00

Based on my math, this will end up costing me approximately $1,875 true out of pocket, but results in my interest rate decreasing to 3.75% which would lead to about $30,000 in interest savings across the life of the loan.

Am I missing anything here on why I shouldn't go forward with refinancing? I am assuming other brokers will be roughly in line with rate/costs so if I shop around, the fundamental question will remain.",finance

investing,"EDV vs VUSTX, and a few other questions","Hey Team,

A recent post here regarding long term treasuries has led me to re-evaluating my asset allocation. Right now I am at about 80/20, but more geared towards short term bonds. Everything I have is in a Roth IRA

The fact that long term treasuries are not correlated with the stock market, makes it seem like a good idea to have at least some exposure to them (more than the total bond market gives). This raises a few questions (sorry if this turns out to be some what of a question dump, but bonds are way more complex than I realized, after days of reading, I have a lot of questions):

1) Two options I have been considering are EDV and VUSTX. I know EDV is longer duration, but wanted to see what you guys thought about which to choose. If I go with EDV, do I need less exposure to bonds? (maybe going 90/10?) Should I go with the little bit safer VUSTX? Maybe some sort of mix? Should I consider BLV as well?

Portfolio visualizer shows that the most long term treasuries have lost in a year was about 10%. There is not really a category for something like EDV, so I'm not sure how much more volatile it really is.

2) Do you abandon all short term bonds? ( I have a sufficient emergency fund, maybe only a small amount of savings into short term bonds?)

3) How will a portfolio consisting of mostly stocks, with 10-20% in long term treasuries, react to high inflation? Should I be concerned with high inflation? Anything I can do to hedge against inflation besides buying Gold or Bitcoin?

4) Interest Rates - Yes, we are at or near an all time low. I think they can go lower still or stay the same, but will they? Is this something to be concerned about? Do you think rates will stay low? Is it worth waiting (market timing) until December until the Fed announces the next rate hike? Rate hikes supposedly affect long term bonds more, is this safe to assume?

5) I understand that the returns of long term treasuries the past 30 years have been influenced by the steadily declining rates. I think they can stay low, or go a little bit lower, but is it realistic to expect these types of returns with rates as low as they are? If I am buying into long term treasuries, am I basically betting that rates will stay low (because I have no idea if they will or not?) Is it worth it to have long term treasuries, solely for the hedge against a stock market crash? (Because I have no idea if it will or not)

6) I'm young and don't have much money, is an 80 stocks (60/40 us /inter) /20 long term treasuries allocation a good long term plan?

Let me know if any more information would help out. Thanks in advance!!!",finance
personalfinance,Am I being unreasonable with my expectations of US Bank?,"Sorry, this is going to be exceptionally long.

I was in a car accident on 10/15/16.  It sickens me that I'm still dealing with this over a year later.  The exact situation is described in detail in the letter below, but here's the short version:

I got into a car accident, car was eventually deemed a total loss

I called US bank many times, they said insurance payments would back-date to the date of the loss and they would fix my credit report after all insurance payments were made

I couldn't pay the payment for my old car and my new car at the same time.  Really wish I had figured out a way to do this looking back.

Once all insurance payments were made, I had a tiny balance remaining that GAP insurance didn't pay, and I paid it immediately.

US Bank now says I was responsible for the loan (no dispute there) and they are not going to remove the 5 months of late charges that have destroyed my credit score.

I had NEVER been late before this.  I didn't wake up one day and decide to be a deadbeat.

I sent them two more letters, and both times I got the exact same canned response back from the same agent.  Getting fed up, I sent a letter to their CEO.  It was answered by someone on the executive communication team, and she sent it to the CRA department again, where it was AGAIN answered by the EXACT same person and given the EXACT same canned response saying it was a duplicate request and I need to provide more info.  The following letter is FOUR freaking pages long.  All previous letters were one page.  How exactly is this a duplicate request with no new info?  Can they actually continue this cycle of not reading my letters and sending me the same canned response over and over?

Email to CEO:

Mr. Cecere,

I understand that you are a very busy man, and have neither the time nor inclination to read a letter as long as the one I have attached, but I am at a loss on where to go from here.  I do not believe the reporting from your CRA Management department is accurately reflected, and they refuse to change it after multiple attempts to deal with them directly.  I do not believe my letters are even being read, and are simply receiving a canned response.  If you could please forward this letter to someone that will actually read it and understand the situation, I would sincerely appreciate it.  My wife and I cannot qualify for a mortgage due to this issue that was truly not my fault.  Please do not hesitate to have someone reach out by phone or e-mail if it is at all beneficial.

Most recent letter to US Bank:

Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing today in response to the letter I received from US Bank dated September 21st, 2017.  This letter was a response to my appeal for a goodwill adjustment to my credit bureau report that I faxed to US Bank on September 18th, 2017.  I have attached a copy of that letter in this transmission as well.

In the letter I received most recently, Credit Analyst M. Priest stated that no action would be taken because this was a duplicate request for dispute and no new information was provided.  I don’t believe that to be the case, as the first request was made via phone, and the letter contained many more details than the initial report your phone representative took the first time.  I am concerned that my letter was not read, but simply scanned and discarded.

Upon receiving this most recent letter from US Bank, I contacted the phone number listed and spoke with your representative Kaime (I am not certain if this is the correct way to spell her name).  She was very understanding when I told her about my situation, and she agreed that my request to have this information removed from my credit report was reasonable.  As an aside, Kaime was an excellent representative of your company and conveyed empathy and respect, and regardless of your decision on my case she deserves to be commended.

To ensure this is not also considered a duplicate request, I am going to go into a very detailed accounting of this situation.  I apologize in advance for the length this letter will eventually reach, but I feel the details are very important in this case, and I do hope you will take the time to read all the way through, as my future literally depends on it.  My family’s plan to buy a house rests in your hands, so please take the time to read and understand everything.  Since this letter is indeed quite long, here is a brief summary:

1.	My vehicle was a total loss On October 14th, 2016.

2.	I spoke with multiple US Bank Representatives that said the payments from insurance would be back-dated to the date of the loss.

3.	I had NEVER missed a payment in the nearly four years I had this loan prior to the loss of my vehicle.

4.	I could not have known that my GAP insurance would not cover the entire balance remaining on the vehicle.

5.	When I did find out GAP insurance was not going to cover the entire balance, I immediately made arrangements to pay off the balance.

6.	While I acknowledge that I technically had a past-due balance with US Bank after the GAP insurance did not pay off the loan, I am asking you to look at this situation and all the details surrounding my creditworthiness as a consumer.  I did not and could not have known that the GAP insurance was not going to cover the entire balance until they issued payment.

7.	Credit Bureau reporting is supposed to display a consumer’s creditworthiness to other creditors.  Based on the extenuating circumstances of this situation, I do not believe this reporting reflects my creditworthiness accurately.

On October 14th, 2016 I was in a terrible car accident.  I was at a dead stop in traffic on the highway, and someone rear-ended me going approximately 60 miles per hour.  The aftermath of the accident was terrible.  I was in the hospital, then physical therapy.  There were multiple injuries that had to be addressed, some I am still living with nearly a year later.  The first few months after the accident, I could barely function.  The pain I was in prevented me from sleeping.  I couldn’t take pain medication to help me sleep, because once it wore off my pain from sleeping in the same spot would be unbearable.  Due to the lack of sleep, I became a very irritable person.  This accident strained my family relationships, work relationships, and personal self-worth.  However, even through the suffering I was enduring, I made certain to work with my insurance company and never missed a call from them or was unresponsive to their requests.  In fact, I decided to use my own insurance company to process the claim, even though I had to pay my deductible, simply so the claim would move faster.

Even though my accident was on October 14th, 2016, Geico did not deem the vehicle to be a total loss until November 3rdth, 2016, nearly three weeks later.  As soon as I found out about this I called US Bank to let you know that the vehicle was a total loss and to get any additional information requests you may have for Geico.  At that time, my insurance adjustor had informed me a check would be in the mail already, as I went in to sign paperwork to release the vehicle to Geico the same day I found out about the total loss.

On November 27th, I noticed that payment had still not been updated in the US Bank online system, so I called US Bank to investigate why.  I spoke with your representative Samantha, who stated that US Bank sent required paperwork to Geico, but never received the “total loss breakdown” or a check back from Geico.  I then stated that I was worried about impact to my credit score, and I asked Samantha to extend the grace period on my loan while we waited for Geico to issue payment.  Samantha stated that I would have to ask that question of the total loss department.  She transferred me to that department, but they were closed.  After that, I immediately called and left a message for my Geico adjuster, requesting that he explain why the check had not been sent or the appropriate paperwork filled out.

On November 28th, 2017, I called the US Bank total loss department during their normal business hours and spoke with your representative Ashley.  I explained the entire situation thus far to Ashley, and asked her for two things:

1.	A copy of the paperwork Geico needed to fill out so I could send it directly to the insurance adjuster

2.	I requested an extension of my grace period for payment, and specifically stated the reason was so that my credit would not be impacted.

Ashley explained all the paperwork that was required, and said that Geico did not fax back the Total Loss Claim Initiation Request form, even though it was faxed to Geico on November 7th and 14th.  Ashley explained that once they received that form, it would take 5 business days to send Geico a letter of guarantee.  She also stated that she could not send the form directly to me, but I could give her department’s phone number to my adjuster so he could call in and request it be sent to him directly.
After that, Ashley stated that payments from Geico or GAP insurance would be backdated to the day of loss.  She said “We do ask you to stay current, but we do back-date to the date of loss.”  She then put me on hold so she could speak with her supervisor about the matter.  When she came back on the line, she said there may be derogatory marks on my credit report until the payments are made, but once the account is paid off, the payments would be back-dated and the negative reporting to the credit agencies would “fall off.”

This is an important point.  After this point, I thought that if GAP insurance did what it was supposed to do (which is pay the balance remaining on my vehicle), I would be fine.  I had no way to know at this point in time that my GAP insurance would not cover the balance, and as soon as I found out that there was a balance after the GAP payment (months later), I immediately made arrangements to pay it.  This point alone shows that this was a misunderstanding, not a willful decision on my part to not pay my bills.

After I spoke with Ashley, I called my Geico adjuster again and explained that US Bank had still not received a check.  This surprised him as well, and he looked into the claim file to attempt to figure out where the issue was.  At this time, he was unable to determine why payment had not been sent, and promised to call me back when he found out what the issue was.  I expressed my extreme dissatisfaction with the lack of follow-up on his part, and asked that he update me as soon as possible.  Later that day, he called me back and explained that the faxes from US Bank were never received by their automated system, possibly due to typographical error when the fax was sent (that was his explanation, not my speculation).  He said he would call the total loss department at US Bank, get the required paperwork directly, and get it over to them ASAP.

Eventually, Geico had to have this paperwork filled out by a different department, and the check was issued on December 8th, 2016.  I called my adjuster again on December 19th, 2016, and he said the check had not yet been cashed by US Bank.  I do not remember precisely when US Bank recognized that payment via the online system, but it was shortly after the 19th. 
Since Geico had only paid a portion of the loan balance and not the entire loan, I began the process of dealing with the GAP insurance company to get the remaining balance paid.  After my initial call with the GAP insurance company, they stated I would need the vehicle warranty refunded before they would issue a payment.  So I began working with the warranty company to get a payment sent to US Bank for the warranty refund.  According to my records, this process still had not been completed by February 13th, 2017.  This was not due to a lack of effort on my part, but incompetent and uncaring employees at the vehicle warranty and GAP Insurance companies.  Despite my repeated efforts to expedite the process, they continued to drag the process out as slowly as they could.  During this time, the GAP Insurance representatives made no indication that they would not pay off the balance of the loan in full.

On February 23rd, 2017, even though the GAP Insurance and warranty company had not yet paid, I did find out the amounts they were going to send would result in a balance being left on the account.  On that same day, I set up a payment for my normal monthly amount as instructed by US Bank representative Dave who said that would stop further negative reporting.  I believe that this shows a good faith effort on my part to make the account whole as soon as I knew that the GAP insurance was not going to cover the entire balance.  

On February 28th, 2017, I spoke again with US Bank Representative Dave, and we discussed that there may still be some small balance after the GAP and warranty payments came in, along with my payment from the 23rd.  At that time we discussed waiting for the GAP and warranty payouts for the next week or two, and then I would take care of the remaining balance if there was any balance left.

Dave called me back on March 3rd, 2017, and said the GAP Insurance and warranty checks had been processed.  At that time he placed me on hold to determine the final amount due on the account.  He explained that the remaining balance was $61.20, which I immediately scheduled a payment for.

I understand that this vehicle loan was my obligation until the account was paid in full regardless of an accident or total loss.  I do not dispute that there was a small balance due once the various insurance companies paid their portion.  What I take issue with is the fact that this mark on my credit bureau reports make it appear that I am a person that does not pay my bills or take my debt obligations seriously.  My experience with US Bank for the nearly four years prior to this incident should be proof enough that that this is not even remotely true.  I do not believe this reporting on my credit report is a fair representation of my individual creditworthiness, and I would sincerely ask you to reconsider my case.

My wife and I have found a house that we love, in a neighborhood with great schools for our children.  Please, consider all the extenuating circumstances contained within this letter, and please remove the negative reporting from my credit reports.  I am committed to repaying my debts.  This was an isolated incident that I have learned from, and I hope you can approve my request.
Best,
fat_zack_gets_fit


Am I being completely unreasonable?  Is it even possible they will reverse this?  If the GAP insurance had paid an extra $61.20, it would have been back-dated to 10/15/16 and I wouldn't be in this situation.  As soon as I found out the balance due to me I paid it.  Need some outside perspective on this please.  Don't hesitate to be brutal if necessary.

personalfinance,To re-refinance student loans or not? Detailed numbers inside,"Hey all,

I graduated last year from an expensive engineering undergraduate degree with about $138K in student loan debt. I received no help from my parents (not that I expected any) so I've been stuck paying off this amount. Thankfully I landed a relatively high paying salary ($77K after bonuses) so I was very aggressive in handling it and continually made payments of a little over $2K/month.

When I first graduated I had a number of individual smaller loans (including Parent Plus loans) that ranged in interest rates from 5% to 8%. I refinanced right away using one of my parents as a cosigner at a 7-year variable rate of 3.8%. Over about the course of a year this had risen to 4.7% and it was absolutely depressing me considering the fact my interest rate kept rising and I still had a balance of about $110K.

About a month ago I decided to RE-refinance my loans yet again and because of my great credit and my cosigner I thankfully got an incredible rate of **3.18%** FIXED for a 5-year term from a lesser known company (they offered me the best rate they had possible). My monthly payments are now $2030/month for the next 5 years.

I realized a few days ago though that I could easily make much more than 3.18% on the market if I invested these funds instead. I called up the same loan provider and asked what my options would be for a lower monthly rate. These were the two options they gave me:

**7-year Fixed:** 3.85% with monthly payments of ~$1500

**10-year Fixed:** 4.45% with monthly payments of ~$1100

Now let's say I decided to convert my loan into one of those. Would it make sense to take the additional $530 or $930 I would save each month and just sock it into index funds or other investments? I would guess I'd actually be coming out ahead over that 7 or 10 year period (assuming favorable markets) and not to mention I would have that money liquid for the opportunity to use on more lucrative investments down the line. Would the increase in interest be worth it? With such a large amount ($100K) each 1% increase would equate to an additional $1K I'd have to pay in interest in just the first year.

If it is a good decision, which refinance plan would be best? 7 or 10 year?

solar,To install solar or not...,"Hello all, I live in Ocean County New Jersey. 

Early last week, a gentleman knocked on the door offering to talk with me about installing a solar system on my house with little cost to me… He works for one of the top 5 companies that I recognize, and is pushing the [NJ Clean Energy program.](http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/renewable-energy-incentive-program)

- Currently, my average monthly bill for 12 months is $94, 7710kw usage… Say $1,200 a year.

- Solar system installed will be a 7000kw system. 

- With this program, I am paying off a loan of the total system. My bill will be $144, fixed, with some variables I’ll explain below. 

- The total system costs $32,760. Mosaic bank holds loan to do installation, permits equipment, everything… 

- For 2017 taxes, I will get 30% back from the FED on this program @ $9,828, leaving me $22,932 to take care of. 

- In addition to this system, I will be enabled to obtain SRECs for a total of 15 years. In NJ the market is variable. Anywhere from $190-290 per SREC. 94% offset, leaving me 260kw to pay the utility company for each month. Each 1000kw the installed system creates, I obtain 1 SREC… total of 7ish a year… @ $1400 a year gained. 

- I need to apply all the SRECs I have obtained within the first 18 months and the $9,828 tax credit to the loan. This will drop my $144 a month bill $10-20ish. In 18 months, I estimate 10 or so SRECs @ $200 each = $2000 + $9,828 = $11,828… $22,932 - $11,828 = $11,104… First 18 months paid out of pocket @$144 = $2,592   – $11,104 = $8,512. 

- If I dedicate all the gained SRECs to the bill, if they stay at a decent trade price,  I can have this loan paid off within 7ish years, and have the remaining years to gain SRECs to pocket, and a small electricity bill @ $15+/- a month.

personalfinance,"Pay off all student loan debt (4k) in December, or spread out the payments?","Hi,

I've been thinking about my student loan repayment plan and I could use some advice. I have 4k in student loan debt and I have to start paying it back in December. The interest rate is 4.29% on it. I started working a little while ago, and I am able to save an average $2000 cash a month after rent, living expenses, and some fun money. I expect this number to be about the same, maybe a little less come the new year as I will be paying more taxes (since I only worked part of the year this year, I pay less in taxes). I am also contributing 6% + 3% company match to my 401k. I have no credit card debt or any other debt for that matter. At the end of the year (when I need to start paying my student loan), I should have about $7500 saved up. I factored in all my expected expenses for the rest of the year, plus a little extra to arrive at that number. 

My question is, should I pay all of that off in December, leaving me with $3500 cash and no debt, or pay it off over time (maybe 4-6 months), so I have more readily available cash in case I need it? My goals are to build an emergency fund, save for retirement, and invest some money.",finance
business,Lets take a look back at the first half of 2017,"During the first half of 2017, many businesses were created while others collapsed. Every industry experienced suddenly appearing “spotlights” that soon died down (e.g. sharing economy products, live streaming, VR).

So what are some of the obvious trends that we can observe throughout the first half of this year?

1. The popularity of innovation and start-ups may be coming back.

Zhongguancun, the most famous and important area for start-ups in Beijing, used to be flourishing with visitors and the interested. Over time, this place has slowly become deserted as the capital inflow into the start-up industry declined.



Now, the heat of innovation and start-ups may be coming back.

Over the past two years, many people began to mock entrepreneurs because the average return for starting and managing a business for five years was often less than the return of purchasing a house. However, alongside the increase in strict policies regulating the housing markets, start-ups may now be the only method to achieve an advancement of social and capital class.

Current news in the VC industry states that there are more and more investors fighting for projects, decreasing the overall difficulty of finding financing.

A possible reason for this comes from growth of the start-up industry in the past two years. Since the start-up bubble in 2014, many failed entrepreneurs instead decided to become investors, and lots of current and confused investors instead transitioned to becoming FAs. Furthermore, increasingly strict regulations in stock and real estate markets has funneled much of these stagnated assets into the VC market.

Briefly speaking, it is not that good projects are increasing; it is instead the amount of stupid people and their money that is increasing. This is similar to the bubble back in 2014, where any project that is in a “spotlight” and has hype might be financed.

However this re-heating of the industry is still an uncertainty. Rising interest rates and uncertainty in the global markets have begun to create interesting developments that are hard to predict.

2. The entertainment industry is reviving.

The “lipstick effect” shows us that when the economy is slowing down, the sales of lipsticks will increase. According to the data from iResearch, the lipstick industry indeed became a spotlight of the online make-up market in 2017.

To be more specific: When the middle class has fallen into a state of ambiguous futures, class blocks and anxiety, both the entertainment industry and general user consumption will increase in demand.

The primary profit from the Internet for the past few years has been concentrated in platforms and tools which are aimed at “improving efficiency”. The goal has always been to save time and improve accessibility.

Now that the efficiency of many aspects have been improved by an unprecedented amount, some areas are even “too efficient”.

The problems facing consumers nowadays are no longer scarcity and low efficiency, but the fickle and anxious fast-paced lifestyle brought on by the improved efficiency. Because of the upgrade of communications tools, modern citizens (especially urban folk) have begun to directly interact with others less and less. These circumstances have begun to cause a wide range of issues associated with loneliness, such as depression and social anxiety.

With this circumstance, “entertainment” that can eliminate these boring and anxious periods will be in the spotlight. The fragmented time saved by our more efficient technology will ultimately be wasted on other beautiful and joyful things.

Different from practical tools, there is no “solid demand” for entertainment. Instead, entertainment is classified by “popularity”. Its specialties lie in a very obvious periodicity of demand and hit content.



The evolution of mobile entertainment started out as simple as single-player games like “Angry Bird” or “Plants vs Zombies”.

Then it became social tools to talk with strangers; suddenly everyone is trying to ask each other out.

After that came the rise of large online platforms focusing on content and content creation. Some examples are, “iQiyi”, “Toutiao”, and “Ximalaya”.

In 2016, everyone’s focus was on live-streaming.

But in 2017, the most obvious bubble is with augmented live-streaming. Watching beautiful girls and using the reward system to simply send gifts has decreased in popularity. Both the rich people and the people in the lowest social class find this entertainment method boring.

However the spotlight of 2017’s entertainment industry is a model combining gaming and social features. Some representative figureheads of this are “Honor of Kings”, “The Online Werewolves of Miller’s Hollow”, and “paipai”. In fact, some popular apps in 2016 had already started demonstrating this trend.

The main characteristics of these social games are:

Using group communication as an important composition, method and form of the game. The game itself is a social experience, and the social experience is the game.
Taking advantage of fragmented scenes and themes so that people can play immediately.
A universal appeal to the masses. Make the game suitable for everyone of all genders and ages.
A fast and reliable profit making system.
During this industry fervor, more and more innovative operating models will be created. Eventually, these games will begin to better and better replicate real-life social experiences.

So the future will have two possibilities. On one hand, this trend could be similar to some board games which were popular for few years, before being dropped by the vast majority of consumers. On the other hand, it may be like poker. Eventually the trend will become established and concrete, attracting stable demand and becoming the norm for ice-breaker tools in the future.

If the second future comes true, then the new entertainment may have bits and pieces of a pseudo Tinder-like community integrated within. Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing, is up for debate.

3. New physical economies in the “Offline” market.

Because of the lacking strength of todays’ innovators and and the devastating monopolistic power of Alibaba and Tencent, most people think that there is no “online profit” anymore. There is now a returning interest in the “Offline” markets.

However, after experiencing the failure of O2O (Online to Offline) and group purchasing models, start-up companies are hesitant to access existing resources through online platforms. Instead, the trend is leaning towards innovatively creating new business entities and models.

These companies do not want to do B2B2C, so instead they skip traditional merchants and directly operate B2C.

But how can these businesses directly connect with consumers? The key is to create a totally different and new “physical economy”. Take the KTV for example. By simplifying it to a size only as small as a telephone booth, a wholly different experience is created. These booths will only allow only one to two people to sing in it, and be automated to save on labor costs. This is the mini KTV, and it is in a separate market than the traditional offline KTV.

A key representation of this trend lies in these new “self-servicing” or “time-sharing” leases that have been dubbed the “sharing economy”. Key properties include:



High frequency, solid demand and fast operation.
Weak dependency on online operations. Some businesses include those like sharing battery banks or sharing bicycles. These are all products that do not have to rely on merchants, and can be directly distributed.
Fast earning methods like small payment amounts or lease deposits that can acquire cash at a high speed.
Self-servicing, networked, and standardized. Cost must be effectively managed and efficient.
Nevertheless, because the capital market always thoughtlessly chases these spotlights, some glaring issues are ignored. Although the concept of the “sharing economy” can build beautiful financial models, when the market becomes saturated, daily operating costs actually become glaringly high.

Ideas like the sharing battery bank, sharing umbrella, and mini KTV, all have similar motives behind them in this “spotlight” craze. Namely, every object that has this “self-servicing, time-lease” or “sharing economy” tag attached to it will automatically go up in value and cause capitalists to madly chase after it.

The development of the sharing bicycles basically fit all predictions made at the beginning of the year. There will only be 2-3 big firms in the end, and other smaller players wouldn’t even get a chance to be sold to the bigger players.

This property will be soon replicated in other similar areas. Sadly this means that if you aren’t chosen to be incorporated by market giants like Tencent or IDG, please stay far away from these industries.

4. The middle class is a target consumer group.

These poor middle class citizens are slowly becoming livestock and fodder because of their anxiety brought on by mediocre achievements.

Their path to the higher class is blocked, the “door of the fortress” seems forever closed.

It seems that at any moment they might fall down and become the lowest class, “Diaosi”, who has nothing.



So here are the two directions in approaching the middle class market:

The first one is to sell and reinforce the concept of class distribution. The product should be highly priced, and luxurious. This is to give off the feeling that the product belongs to a higher class of consumption. This also applies to things like snacks and drinks that are dubbed as “high-class”.

The second approach is to weaken the concept of class distribution. Let more people, especially young folks from small towns, obtain these “first class” services for the lowest price possible. For example, since they can’t afford brands like Hermes, provide them with alternatives that simulate this fashion sense.

However, there are also some bad news. Notice that the “voice” of e-commerce platforms that only focus on the middle-class consumers has begun to get smaller and smaller. In contrast, the big platforms are getting more and more attention. Why is that?

5. The unstable elements of start-ups that create content is increasing.

Starting a content creation business should be the most appropriate direction for most people after the passing of the app development trend. After all, there are not many entry barriers in this industry, despite it being hard to do well. The competition between content distribution platforms over quality content has become more and more heated, leading to higher rewards and benefits for creators of quality content.

But there are huge risk points in content start-ups:

Apple and WeChat are vigorously fighting over the “reward” problem. The result is both giants likely to adopt a model for dealing with content providing other rechargeable content (paid content). For example, in the future, there is a possibility that any rechargeable content hosted by iOS apps will receive a 30% profit tax from Apple.

Due to other recent changes in policies, much of the content produced and hosted must by systematically regulated. This limits a start-up to conforming to what is required, rather then what they are capable of.

These features have caused some new trends for content start-ups:

Late-comers to the content creation industry are more willing to adopt a cross-platform strategy. One example of this is conducting cross-promotion with a base on the WeChat platform, but emphasize a focus on a distribution point outside of the platform. This is a method that serves to diversify the risk associated with the lowered profits from producing content for the WeChat platform.

Paid Knowledge currently has stable production and development, but is unlikely to quickly explode in popularity. Although all platforms offering paid knowledge have put many resources into it, the actual maturation of this industry still has a long way to go.

Outside of WeChat, many alternative platforms dedicated to the distribution of content have begun rising through the masses. These platforms such as “Xiaomiquan” or “Fantuan” have quickly racked up a decent fan and user base, and offer much more transparent and lighter profit solutions when compared to major platforms like WeChat.

6. Bubbles are being created in short video industry.

Instead of claiming short and brief videos to be the future, it is better to claim that “the shortening and fragmentation of videos” is a firm trend. In the short video area, we can observe:

The PGC (Professionally Generated Content) model has matured. Besides noticeable articles, well-produced and creative short videos have become the best method to attract users with.

In the UGC area, “MOMO”, “Kuaishou”, “Douyin”, and “Weibo” are all engaged in a deadlock. However, the success of Kuaishou is due to the long term investiture in building a community, rather than a short-term fervor. Kuaishou built a system that can allow almost anyone, especially the lower classed, to obtain profit through produced content. Although other platforms may be able to coax some of the more popular figures from them, Kuaishou can continue growing due to their firm foundation.

More and more people have begun to want to create MCNs(Multi-Channel Networks). The vast majority of these people are not even content producers. This situation is similar to one where the people who are creating successful projects have not yet appeared, but the people who want to do distribution, outsourcing and training these projects have appeared instead.

7. AI has been over-exaggerated and over-evaluated.

Unquestionably, AI will be a long term strategy. It is not wrong to say that it is the future.

However, today’s sensationlization towards it seems to be too much. Many investors and entrepreneurs in the tech industry can’t even make it through two sentences without mentioning the words “AI” or “machine learning”. Isn’t it too early for this?



Intelligent hardware will be the future, but people have hyped it up too much from 2014. The expectations of this industry have caused it to fail horribly.

AR and VR are also the future, but what was the result of last year’s crazy propaganda towards it? Hype was created, and people were disappointed. This led to many people now being dissatisfied with the state of the technology, despite it advancing at a perfectly reasonable pace.

Through the development of smartphones, we can observe and analyze the process for creating this kind of groundbreaking and foundational technology. It usually goes something like this:

The technology usually first appears in western society, where the innovation culture is rich;

Always first completed by giant tech companies with solid foundations.

When a company successfully launches their “standardized” products, most of them will conduct open source operations and development. This usually causes a destructive strike to their competitors. When one succeeds, thousands of others quickly die out. The rise of Apple and Android essentially murdered the developing Nokia and Blackberry products.

From this perspective, even with the lack of evidence, the bubbles in today’s AI industry are very big. There are truly valuable companies, but most of them are destined to eventually be outshadowed, acquired or die out.

8. The change in Marketing Strategy

I have a friend who drives a Ferrari and has tens of millions in assets. He’s in the traffic botting business. In other words, he fakes web traffic for start-up companies.

His favorite phrase is, “Many investors are stupid, all of their money is transferred to me through unreliable start-ups. I don’t need financing because I have all their funds.”

Sadly, when these start-ups need fake data, investors will also need fake data to deceive investors from the next series. In the end, traffic botter becomes the final winner. The booming market of the start-up and innovation industry is partially supported by fake data.

However, alongside the launch of more innovative products and marketing strategies, these companies may soon lose the ability to earn profit, and simply faking web traffic may become a dead end. It is slowly coming to a point where traffic simply does not guarantee exposure.

For times like this, viral and precise marketing is quickly becoming unprecedentedly important. Creating a campaign with strong Transmissibility and the intention to go viral may become the next major form of marketing for future products.

Transmission is the king, the clients are the queen, and data is the lord; a new creative era is coming.

9. The innovative paths for “New Media” are slowly dwindling.

Globally, newspapers and magazines and dying one by one; the future for TV programs and paper books are getting more and more worrisome.



The channels that people use to access information is irreversibly changing.

The old system is so powerless when faced with “New Medias”, just like when telecommunications met social messaging apps such as WeChat.

However, “New Medias” also brings higher risk and information control, meaning the industry will likely meet many ups and downs in the short term. In China, all medias need to maturely fit and conform to the current system.

The word on the street is that the Chinese Government is backing up the dying traditional medias. To do this, the government is more likely to seriously control and force out certain “New Medias”.

All entrepreneurs must understand a principle: From the long term perspective, the potential force of the market is close to infinity. However, the potential market is not equal to capital, and the current state of the capital is so fragile in front of the Chinese government.

In recent years, the country is reacting faster and faster to new things on the Internet. If the country lays its hands on it, the P2P mode will die. Live streaming will eventually follow, and self-medias shouldn’t be feeling too safe either.

This is especially true for industries like finance and media that may touch the core interest of the country. You should be careful about them, and don’t try to mess with them, otherwise a swift death may come to claim you at anytime.

Isn’t being alive so good?

These are all the abstract trends that we observed in the first half of 2017.

We believe that general trends are more believable then the words of some investors.

After all, many Chinese spotlights only exist in the words of investors and media PR activities. They don’t need to fit into actual data or common logic.

Don’t ever think successful financing means a successful start-up. From the long term perspective, the ultimate success for all start-ups is due to the vision of the founders.

No matter how good their backgrounds are or how much they know about financing, those who do not have vision will inevitably walk into holes.

Once you have failed, no matter how smooth the early financing may have went, investors will abandon you faster then you can react.

They will treat you as a normal statistic, yet you may end up with tens of millions in debt; have you thought this through?

One must a have functioning brain. Don’t be fooled by short term profits and the superficial phenomenon; don’t blindly follow the “mainstream” point of view; most importantly, don’t be stupid and lazy.

Sometimes I have lack of tolerance toward lazy and stupid people. However, I dislike my thinking, because at least most of them are kind.

personalfinance,30k windfall. How to calculate which debt to pay towards?,"Hi guys! I received a 30k windfall and am trying to figure out which of my 2 debts to apply it to. I have 2 mortgages as well but the interest rate is so low on those (3.75% and 4..25%) that I plan on never paying them off (LOL) if possible. However, I have two HELOCS.


#1 30k @ 7.25


#2 97k @ interest (5.15% (currently)) only for 9 more years then the pay down period begins


I am currently putting around 4k a month towards these debts.


Usually I just go to a mortgage calc and run the numbers or it's obvious because of the rates. However this is a little bit more confusing for me because of the interest only loan. Obviously the 7.25% rate is higher but I'm not sure how to calculate the long term cost of the interest only loan or two determine which one I should pay down first.


I plan on having both loans paid as quickly as possible (under 4 years) and then buy another investment property.


Anyone have some advice at where I can look?

personalfinance,"How is severance taxed, specifically in Oregon?","I'm getting ""managed out"" of my position at my job and I'll be offered a severance. It's likely that it will be a ""traditional"" severance, where I'm paid out a lump sum equivalent to about two months' salary, but there's a chance I could argue for an ""extended compensation"" arrangement, where they essentially just keep me on the payroll for two extra months but I don't go to work. I'm figuring out pros and cons like how the latter would extend my benefits, etc.. but one thing that came up as I was discussing with HR was how the severance would be taxed (in either scenario). She said that in California, they end up getting taxed like bonuses at almost 50%. I'm really hoping that's not the case, or at least not here in Oregon. 

So, answers I'm looking for are:   
1. If I take the lump sum severance, will both the federal IRS and Oregon tax it just like normal wages, or is there some other formula I can use to predict what I'll end up with?  
2. Same question if I do the ""extended compensation"" option?  
3. I would assume that if I do the extended compensation option, I can't file for unemployment until after that period is over, but if I do the lump sum I could file after my last day?
4. My HR person said that one problem with the extended compensation option is that it would be ""no good"" if I got another job before that was over and so the question arises whether or not I could take another job during that two months (this sounds like horseshit but I'm not a lawyer or HR professional).  

So basically, what are the tax implications of severance, and what do you recommend I push for?

Thanks in advance for your assistance, Reddit! Again, I'm in Oregon and I'm well aware that my severance will be taxed _in some way_ so no need to explain how severance is considered wages and therefore is subject to tax, etc.. I know that much at least.",finance

I recently purchased their stocks about a month ago and have already sold it for a small profit (about 6%). The reason I pulled out so quickly is because I feel there's something sinister in a stock that rises so quickly. As of writing this, their share price stands at ~ 5.50 which is nearly double what they were worth back in June (6 months ago) @ approximately 2.95. 

In my opinion, the business model seems unsustainable and with companies on the rise offering similar services, Afterpay is doomed to fall sooner or later. But the constant green next to their name just tempts me further to buy more.

btc,SegWit2x Relevant: Banks Pretended to Hate Federal Reserve Act,"There was a lot of drama back in 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was enacted.

However, there are two high impact credit factors that are hurting me the most.

1. I have a late payment on my credit card from December of 2015. The credit card is with my bank. Do I have to live with this for the next 5 years, or is there something else I can do? Besides this my payment history is spotless. The late payment was for a very small balance.

2. This one is a bit tougher. I had a bill sent to an old address. Being that I never saw the bill, I didn't pay it until collections started coming after me. Once I found out about the collections, I paid it immediately, but it still haunts my credit score to this day.

Is there anything I can do to not have to live with this for the next 5+ years?

I tried applying for a loan recently and was given very high interest rates for precisely these two reasons. Right now my credit is about a 670 with other negative impacts being a short credit history and not enough credit accounts.

personalfinance,using Snowball; new Balance Transfers...now what?,"*edit: my ""snowball payment"" is currently $800 a month, in addition to the minimums

it's been a few years since i've been chipping away at my debt. (I paid off 8 accounts. it's been so long that I cant even remember the combined totals... probably around 25k) i use the snowball method.  my credit score hasnt been all that great up until recently... so i decided to go card shopping for the balance transfer promos.


I went kinda crazy with the applications-- did 3 in the same day. I got the 0% promos (10, 18, and 21 months) and made some BTs yesterday.  The 3 new cards' BT covered 3 of my older cards.  I have 6 other cards to deal with. So, as it stands, 3 new cards with the transferred amounts + 3 old cards with 0 balance + 6 other cards = 12 cards in all.   I will most likely close the three ""paid off"" accounts because I really dont want access to them-- I'm afraid I might trip up and dig myself into a hole again.


Now, how do i go about continuing with the snowball method?  


I'm guessing the minimum due on the new cards will be $25-$30 each; the old cards had minimums of $29, $40, $71.  Because they're BTs, it's not technically ""paid off"" ...should i be using the $ difference (example: $29 minus $25 would be $4; apply that amount to the snowball)? And a little curveball, here, is that one of the new cards has the lowest balance (which would be considered the ""target"" account to attack with the snowball method), but it also has that 0% promo.  


The way I'm figuring things, i'll keep the 3 new cards out of the snowball equation and just pay the minimums until their promos end...then fold them back into the mix at that time.  This approach would make it as if the balances on the old cards were truly paid in full and the new cards never existed.  I have some wiggle room in my budget to accommodate the new $25-30 minimums.


What do you guys think? any suggestions? tips? strategies? or would it be wise to step back, take a look at the numbers again, and consider the avalanche method?


The remaining 6 accounts are like this:
macys 2900, 24%
 
capital one 2900, 21%

bestbuy 2300,  22%

discover 2300, 23%

capital one (card #2) 1800, 19%

sams club 800, 23%

I choose the snowball method because all the cards had very similar interest rates... so the money saved using the avalanche would have been minimal. Plus, seeing my list of accounts get marked up as ""paid in full"" every few months is a great morale booster!",finance
btc,"Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then","*	People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
*	Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
*	Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
*	Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
*	Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. 
*	All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. 
*	From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. 
*	This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
*	This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
*	What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
*	Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
*	Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
*	Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
*	The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
*	When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure. 
*	What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in late-2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.

Edit: Fixed the whitepaper date, please don't forget that this post originally is due to the courtesy of u/hodlgentlemen and thanks for the gold but I don't feel like I deserve it. Maybe we can keep this list of bullet points aa an open source project and the mods could create a new post for it and sticky it.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Best way to finance ~20% of a new house,"Long story short, my dad died and I inherited a fully paid off house, a small hunting cabin and some money. I don't wish to continue living in his old house and have found my dream house a state over.

With said money, I can comfortably finance about 78% of this new house. 

I already do not quailfy for a morgage as I've taken more than 3 months off of work due to personal issues, so that option isnt viable.

One of my uncles suggested a home equity loan but didn't go into any further detail. 

The house I currently own has been looked at by a realtor and I was told it could be sold for as much as 170k but won't have any issues selling it for no less than 150k. 
The hunting cabin is around 100k.

I would ideally like a loan for around 60k, that would cover the remaining amount to finance the new house and partial moving fees.

I don't know how long the house I want will be on the market, and I wish to detail parts of my current house before I get it listed, for visual appeal in the pictures (paint walls, clean floor, etc.) but cannot right now due to my dogs and all our boxes taking up room space. So selling my house while living in it, then using that money and my own to fully purchase the new house, isn't my ideal route. And due to my current location, neither my husband or I can find employment, at least at the house I wish to purchase, he can live there and work while I clean and put the finishing touches on my house. That way there will actually be some source of income.

What's my best financial bet??
I'm 24 with excellent credit, currently unemployed.
I dont want to be screwed with interest rates, but am almost sure my house will sell within a year, if not half or less, so I don't mind paying an annual interest on a loan for my current house, as long as it won't be more than a few thousand. 

Keep in mind I dont know anything about anything, this will be my first house purchase. Please help

Thank you kindly!",finance

personalfinance,Bank Levy for Taxes from Joint Tax Return,"Hi, I'm new here. Hopefully my question is appropriate for this subreddit.

My spouse and I are separated in NC and are getting a divorce next year once the mandatory 1-year separation has been satisfied. During our separation, my spouse sent me a copy of a notice from the North Carolina Department of Revenue for taxes owed for 2015 tax year. Another notice was also sent to me by my spouse for federal taxes owed. I was able to figure out the problem, and indeed these taxes are owed due to unreported income (we did not include one of my W2s for that tax year on the return). I have a business but operate as a sole proprietorship, meaning I am my business, if you will.

Although I've had a change of address / mail forwarding service with the US Postal Service in force for the duration of the separation so far, the letters from the NC DOR and federal government/IRS went to my spouse because his name is also on the letters, and because I hadn't thought to call the NC DOR or IRS and give them my updated address since we separated.

I can't say how long they've been sending letters, but the ones my spouse sent me copies of indicated they'd been attempting communication with us for a while, and I was just finding out recently, around mid-September. My spouse insisted the tax debt is mine, of course, and said I should pay it, so I set up payment plans with both agencies. From everything I had heard from the NC DOR and IRS, my spouse had not set up any payment plans of his own. However, apparently the NC DOR didn't want to wait to collect the back taxes via the installment agreement I made with them, as they ended up garnishing my spouse's bank account for $2,100 some time last week, which was the amount still owed for the back taxes for NC State income tax for that tax year.

I called the NC DOR about our case, and an agent there told me that my payment plan with them only protected me from garnishment, but not my spouse. She, the agent, also informed me that the process to levy my spouse's bank account was already underway when I first set up my payment plan in September. So, it went through and they garnished the remaining balance of $2,100+, and my spouse's bank also charged him a $125 processing fee for the garnishment.

Yesterday, I heard from my tax preparer who spoke to my spouse about this issue. The tax preparer shared that my spouse called the NC DOR and told them his reasons for why he should not owe the back taxes. He also shared with our tax preparer that the NC DOR is refunding the garnishment to him and will be waiting on me to call them to set up a payment plan. Further, my spouse's attorney emailed me yesterday and said in the email that my spouse made a $150 down payment and that the down payment was a ""kind gesture"" to me from my spouse, and that my spouse had set up a $76/month payment plan with the NC DOR. Then the attorney wrote that I needed to call the NC DOR immediately and provide them with my bank account # and routing # so they could switch the payment plan to my name since it was my debt.

None of this makes sense to me because:

1) Why would he get garnished if I had already made a payment, and was on a payment plan, for the back taxes? Does the NC DOR's reasoning make sense to you? Despite it being what they told me, I guess I remain doubtful for some reason.

2) Why would the NC DOR return a garnishment? It takes time and money to pursue and enact a garnishment, and we filed a joint return, so why would they give it back just to wait to collect it from me if they already got the full amount from my spouse via a bank levy?

3) Wouldn't it be all the same to the NC DOR, and perhaps even backed up by the law, that as long as one of us pays the debt by whatever means, including forced collection via bank levy, that the debt is paid? Do they really care who paid it out of the two people who were liable for the debt (as should not need stated, we both signed the joint tax return)?

4) Why would he get them to return the garnished funds only to make a down payment and set up a payment plan with them? The $2,100 isn't a small amount of money, but he isn't financially hurting. Why ask for money back that he didn't feel he owed, only to in the same move turn around and give the money back to the NC DOR over time via a payment plan?

5) Why does the NC DOR need my bank information when they already have it from the payment plan I had set up with them in September?

6) My spouse told our tax preparer that the NC DOR considers him essentially not liable for the back taxes, and so they're refunding the garnishment. How can it be? Isn't he jointly and severally liable alongside me? We both signed the return, and he even elected to not file with the IRS for ""Innocent Spouse Relief"" because he knew he wouldn't qualify, given his knowledge of the unreported income (he was aware of the source of income on the unreported W2, and he is equally as guilty as me for not catching it on the tax return before singing the return). If it turns out it is true the NC DOR is considering him not liable, might I have any recourse? My tax preparer said I'd need to pay the taxes myself and then bring up the joint and several liability during equitable distribution proceedings that will happen later (next year, just before we divorce, I will file for equitable distribution).

My spouse is very adversarial and argumentative, and he plays the victim card constantly. I am asking these questions here so I can be more informed or have a better sense of what might be going on before I call the NC DOR myself later this week to find out what's really happening. I have this sense he may be trying to do all of this as a scare tactic and that it might not be true that he got the bank levy reversed. My tax preparer was skeptical that the NC DOR would so quickly and easily return money collected in a garnishment, which is my feeling on things, too.

So much of this makes no sense to me... does anyone have any knowledge or input that might be helpful? I welcome any questions, comments, perspectives, etc. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Employer offering to pay my student loan INSTEAD of contributing to my 401k,"Yesterday my employer let us know that they will be offering a new program in January. Instead of matching up to 6% of our salaries in 401k contributions, we will have the option to put that money toward student loans. I currently have about 33k left and with regular monthly payments of $470, they will be paid off in roughly 6.5 years. I can currently add about $500 to the monthly payment, and at that rate, they will be paid off in ~2.5 years. Using my employer's new program, I could have them paid off in ~18 months.  

My 401k will be at about 12k by the end of the year. I make 50k, so the annual contribution between my self and my employer is 6k. That 6k over 40 years will be worth ~60k at least. Short-term, it would be nice to pay off my loans a year earlier, but long-term, my 401k loses a pretty big chunk of money. Is this a good assessment?  

I appreciate all responses, thanks!

personalfinance,(25 y/o) I've cut a lot of extra expenses but I'm still frustrated with my debt situation,"Hello, 

I'm ABE Educator making roughly $35k a year. I bought a home last November ($560/m mortgage), and had internet, ate out way too much, went stupid with a couple of credit cards (~$8000), but I've been committed to making better financial choices. 

I've cut up the cards, cancelled my internet ($70/m), only eat from home ($300/m on groceries), and I've sold all of my video games as they were a huge burden to my wallet and I honestly believe I was addicted to buying games. I did have a silent leak in my toilet over the Summer which racked up a nice $450 water bill but that has been taken care of. 

Off the top of my head, here are my monthly expenses now after a  month of significantly cutting my costs. It is important to note that my girlfriend of 7 years lives with me and works full time in childcare (~$10/h), so all of these expenses are based off of the two of us. 

Satellite TV $70/m
Gym Fees $40/m
Mortgage $570/m
Normal Wtr. bill ~$50/m
Auto insurance 2 vehicles $149 (but I was told this should drop in November)
Electric bill ~$160/m (I feel like I'm conservative with the electric so I'm confused by this)
Gas bill $40/m
Credit cards ~$350/m if I only pay the minimum
Cellphone $110/m
Student loans $50/m

A lot of my girlfriend's money goes to her car payment at $250/m and she picks up groceries for us as well as helps pay for pet food and other necessities. Both of us live within 5 miles of our work via car, so our gas prices are minimal. We shop only at an Aldi where we can get all of our cooking ingredients at roughly a 20% lower cost than other stores on average. 

I know my monthly expenses should be lower this coming month considering I won't need to purchase another pressure cooker and I'm caught up on the water bill that took an extra $300 over the past month and a half. I just don't know what else I can eliminate at this point, so I'm really just interested in what you guys have done in the past. Should I try and negotiate my utilities or are they all fairly low?

Edit: Okay, everyone. So when I looked at my income I realized that something has to be up. I work in a school district and all of our pay is based on college experience plus on the job experience. My net is $1040 a check which I receive on the 15th and 30th of each month. No dependents claimed and I only ask that the Feds take out $20 a month in withholding. Should I really be paying $10,000 in taxes?? That's mind blowing to me.",finance

personalfinance,I paid for home solar with credit cards and saved over $3000.,"I looked at a dozen companies for solar and finally made my decision after getting the last two in a bidding war. This alone saved me $10k by shopping around and not going with the first quote. ALWAYS get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th opinion when making a large purchase.

At that point I was ready to buy a system that would cost around $14,971 before financing and interest payments. (edit:This is also before any federal and state tax incentives that one might receive the following tax filing). The standard option that most companies offered would be a ~4.99% loan with no prepayment penalties BUT there is a 15% origination fee if you choose to finance. They also require you to immediately pay them the 30% tax incentive and any state tax incentive back after you file next year's taxes otherwise the loan re-amortizes and monthly payments go up.

I would basically end up with an monthly (reduced) electric bill payment to the solar finance company for 20 years. That is how they like to sell their offering to 99% of buyers. They say ""You are already paying $100/mo electric bill. Buy solar and just pay $80/mo and after 20 years you pay nothing but a connection fee of $10 per month""

I decided to look at my options and I came up with the following:

* Solar financing with $2k+ origination fee wrapped into the total amount due
* Cash (not ideal as it would drain my emergency fund)
* Personal loan or HELOC around 5.99%
* Apply for a bunch of credit cards with 12-18 month 0% interest

The credit card approach is not a traditional route, but I decided to look into it. I would save on the origination fee, save on interest if I paid it off before the end of the 0% interest period, and could also earn sign-on bonuses. I applied to 6 cards the same hour and was approved for 5 of them (credit score was ~799, now 762). All cards have $0 annual fee so I can keep them to help my credit score and not worry about fees.

I plan to make minimum payments and save over the next year until the rest is due. After receiving a tax refund, I will put that towards this debt. I have sufficient emergency fund and income that I won't need to worry about paying any credit card interest, as I am sure I can pay this all off today if I had to.

Total savings:

* $10,000 from negotiating and getting several quotes
* $2,245 from avoiding the origination charge
* $1,037 from cash back and sign on bonuses

Choosing to finance with credit cards vs taking the solar company financing saved me over $3000 and helped me drop the break-even time from 11 years to around 6. I also know I am taking a temporary dip in credit score due to the inquiries but hope long term will see a positive impact with the higher credit limit and more payment history.

Note: Yes, I am aware of opportunity cost and TVM. I know that I could have many scenarios where I compare these options with vanguard investments but I will spare you the details.  I will still be contributing to my 401k, HSA, and IRA to the maximum allowed by law",finance
personalfinance,Should we tap into retirement account to pay off debt,"Have a financial situation I am not sure how to handle.

Debt $130,000 debt consolidation loan at 4% interest. $1109.53/month

$80,000 IRS Installment agreement with penalties and interest  $1036 (The interest seems to be 4% and penalties were $334 last year)

We have $150k in retirement account making 15%-21% in various funds.

Is there any reason to cash out of the retirement account to pay these off. Based on interest rate and ROR it seems like we should just keep it as is but based on the mess I got myself in with this what do I know! Any help would be appreciated. How I have handled our finances is the biggest regret of my life.",finance
personalfinance,"Planning to get LASIK, should I use HFSA + Credit Card or just Credit Card?","Planning on getting the procedure early 2018. My employer just opened up benefits elections for next year, so I have the opportunity to put money in my HFSA. I think the max is ~$3500? The LASIK procedure will cost $5000. Since HFSA contributions come out of my paycheck pre-tax, it seems like a good idea to use them for ~$3000 and the remaining $2000 on my Credit Card (2% cash back). 

Right now I am trying to figure out if maybe its worth it to put the whole thing on the CC; 2% of 5000 is $100, so really not that much. I am not sure how to estimate the savings from using the HFSA; my income for 2018 will likely be ~$90,000, and I've historically had ~33% income tax (fed + state + NYC).",finance
personalfinance,"Looking for advice, do I save for retirement or focus on debt? (25 years old)","A lot of you guys are great at calculating pros/cons when presented with situations, so I need your help with my current situation! 

Currently, I bring in about 3,400USD (net) a month and I pay into CalPERS for retirement. I want to start ""saving"" but my problem is, with the debt I have, I feel like saving is counter-intuitive. 

Right now I have about 13k consolidated debt in student loans (3-6% interest rate), 12,000 car loan (1%), and ~$5000 credit card debt no interest rate until 2019. I also bought a house in Jan. so I have a mortgage.

investing,dangers of MLP investing,"I recently saw this comment under an MLP discussion:

&gt; Who is sick of watching these MLP GPs stuff their LPs?  Thumbs up if so.

&gt; Next LPs up to bat to get stuffed is ETP (mark my words).  That high dividend yield is the siren song of a value trap.   

&gt; For that reason I pretty much will only invest in MLPs with no IDRs at this point.

Does anyone have any good case studies on how the GP's have screwed over LP unitholders? I've heard rumblings that Kelcy Warren's ETE/ETP complex has a history of doing this, especially when ETP merged with Sunoco Logistics (SXL), but I'm not quite sure how.

Hoping to learn more - would greatly appreciate any examples anyone could share.

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"Lost my son as dependent and need to reduce taxable income by $4,000 to avoid tax liability. Ideas?","OK so in the past I've taken my son as a deduction on my taxes.  (U.S.A.).  I make $65,000 annually, and with the deduction, received a modest refund ($1200) from the feds.  Now my son is on his own and I will not have the deduction.  I understand the average deduction for a dependent is around $4,000 from taxable income.

I'm in corporate America.  Have a 401K.  It's now pushing November.  How can I best and easiest reduce my taxable income by 4000 or so to hopefully maintain that refund, rather than have to pay in?

I like the amount I contribute to the 401K.  It's not at the max, but helps me to keep my budget on a monthly basis.  I have the savings to move 4000.  Is an IRA possible?  One time 401K?  Other methods prior to year end, 2017?

Your advice is much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,What to do about my student loans,"Hi all,

Coming to you with a student loan question. I just graduated in April and have a pretty good job making 54k a year. I live with my parents and currently do not have any expenses. I currently have $57,356 in student loans with an average interest rate of 7.12%. I am planning on refinancing through SoFi once my loans are outside the grace period. 

I am in the grace period, but I have still been making payments regularly. I pay $1,400 a month in student loans. Is this a good tactic? I do not know much about repayment plans and I really don't want to be paying student loans for the next 10+ years. I want to be as debt free as possible as quickly as possible so I can start saving up for other things such as a vehicle and house. 

Is this smart on my part or incredibly stupid? Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Interest - Fixed or Variable?,"I about $30K in private student loans that I am consolidating and I would like advice on selecting a higher fixed or lower variable interest rate.  I understand the variable rate could increase over time, but the two companies (SoFi &amp; Laurel Road, I think) I am looking at consolidating with, the variable rate is 2 percent lower than the fixed.

It will be a 10 year loan; paying off the private loans first, then focusing on the federal loans after.  Can I consolidate private loans into a federal direct consolidation loan?  

My thinking is that I can start with the variable rate and I would be saving money until the variable rate goes above the fixed rate.  At some point I can re-finance them again, if needed, to get a fixed rate if the payments/interest exceed what I can afford.  

My youngest child starts school next year and so my wife can start working then.  Our plan is to get the payments where we can afford them now and then put almost all of her income towards the loans and pay them off as quickly as we can.  We have a budget (we are sticking to it), I am contributing into my retirement account with my work, we're saving money each month (building the emergency fund), have $4K left on a car loan and have less than $8K in CC debt (currently on 0% interest intro rate).",finance

Her accounts are with Navy Federal and another local credit union.

I'm wondering if it's worth closing all my accounts with WF and moving my Roth IRA to another bank, or what the benefits are to opening all new accounts with one of her banks and then a joint checking account for bills and such.

Any advice anyone out there has with this would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Thoughts on loan companies such as Lending Club and Upstart?,"I'm considering consolidating my CC debt which is currently about 15k. I was planning on just paying them off through normal means, but my 0 interest intro period has worn off on one of my higher balance cards and I'm now getting hit with a 27% interest rate on that card, which prompted me to start looking at these loans. Does anyone have any insight to these companies, and any hidden consequences/benefits that might not be readily apparent? I just got a mortgage in June and my FICO credit score at that time was ~740.

It seems like a no brainer to get one of these loans (consolidate loans of 15% 24% and 27% into one at ~10%) but is there any company in particular worth checking out / avoiding? I have been making pretty steady payments of about $1000 per month since March 2016, minus a couple months of extra expenses/saving for down payment on the mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating Debt - Need Advice,"I'm about to switch financial institutions going from a bank to a credit union. Much better interest rates all around.
I'm trying to organize my finances and am wondering how I should consolidate my debt.

Originally I was only going to get a loan to pay off my credit cards but now I'm wondering if I should broaden the scope. If I just do the credit cards it would be an **$8000 loan**. Depending on how many months I decide and the interest rate the monthly payment should be around **$200+**. This would be **$50-$100 cheaper** than what I normally pay monthly. This would save me quite a bit of money as 1 credit card has an **18+% interest** rate and the other is **12+%**. The loan should be around **10-11%**. 

Now if I broaden the scope and pay off a car and hospital bill the total loan would amount to **$11,000**. The monthly pmt would be around **$300+/month**. This would be much lower than what I would pay monthly between the cards, the loan, and the medical bill. But... The auto loan interest rate is **8.9% and 0% interest** on the medical. 

Should I just get a loan for the credit cards or all of my debt?",finance
personalfinance,Parent asking me to co-sign a home equity loan/HELOC. Any advice?,"As the title states, my dad asked me to co-sign a home equity loan/HELOC and I have no idea what to do.  He's been retired for 10+ years (disabled from a non-work accident) and has be accruing significant ($40k) credit card debt over the last 3-4 years.  Since he isn't working, he needs me to co-sign the home equity loan, which he will use to pay-off his high interest credit card debt and also do some much needed repairs on the house.  He owns the home outright and it's worth about $900,000.  For various reasons, selling the home is not an option at this time.  The bank is offering a 5.5% interest rate on a 15 year fixed loan.  He is also considering a HELOC. I understand the general differences between the two types of loans, but was hoping for some general advice.  

Briefly, I'm 29 years old, recently graduated from school, and just started my first major job.  I am making approximately $55-60k per year for the next 3 years in my current position.  My credit score is very good.  I have a great relationship with my dad and he has never asked me for help or money.  He covered all of my living expenses and tuition while I was in college.  I have no doubt that my dad would make all of his payments, but I am just concerned overall about the financial situation he is in and I'm not sure what the best course of action is.  Any advice on home equity loans, HELOCs, or any other options or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.",finance
Bitcoin,Incase you forgot why bitcoin was made or you are wondering why bitcoin was made. Here:,"* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
*Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
*Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
*Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them.
* All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.
* From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
* Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.
* What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in late-2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.


So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

personalfinance,Pay off significant student debt with Inherited traditional IRA while I have no income?,"I inherited a traditional IRA somewhat recently and need to begin taking my RMD soon, but I'm unsure how I should use the money. I'm currently in professional school, so I currently have no income and have $75K in student loans with an interest rate around 6%. The IRA is worth around $65K and is currently sitting in a Vanguard settlement fund. I won't have any income for tax years 2017 and 2018. I'm wondering if it'd be smarter to withdrawal as much as possible during these years and pay off my student loans, rather than invest the Inherited IRA assets?  

Additional info:

My current understanding is that I'd owe ~$5,432.50 in income taxes next April if I withdrew $30k in 2017. I could use part of the life insurance payout that I also received. I'd then do the same thing next year.

I'll finally have an income starting in tax year 2019 and I'll be taxed around 25% based on the current brackets. I plan on opening a Roth IRA during these years and contributing to it for 3-10 years while I'm at a qualifying income level. I'll probably move into the 28-33% tax bracket after a decade. I won't be able to make contributions to a Roth IRA after this point (at least not easily). EDIT: I will also lose the student loan interest deduction at this point, so I'd be losing yet another benefit. 


I have a small traditional IRA from the job I had prior to starting school that I've had in a Vanguard target fund for ~3 years.I've got more than enough ""emergency funds"" in a high yield savings account and spending $11k of it on taxes likely wouldn't jeopardize my financial security. 

Tl;dr: Use 65K from the inherited IRA over the next 2 years to pay part off part of my 75k worth of student loans, which means I'll pay ~$11,600 in taxes total OR add to my income when I'm at a higher tax bracket.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to decide if I should put extra money towards a loan or a credit card. Help!,"First time posting, but I've been struggling with the math on what to do with extra money. Thought someone here might be able to help out. Thanks in advance!

Remaining: $11,356.30, 40 months of $375.00 payments. No penalty to pay additional each month.

$12,923 on a credit card. 16.99%.

The loan has a higher interest rate, so my first thought is to put extra money on that. But what's confusing me is that I've got a set payment schedule on the loan but the credit card charges me interest on the balance each month. Is the loan basically doing the same thing, just in the form of a set payment schedule, so I should pay that down first? Or is the credit card worse?

My question is, should we trade in the Corolla and get something new (used vehicle with lower mileage) while it's still worth something?

It is a 2011 Toyota Corolla and honestly is not in good shape. She did not take care of it at all before I met her. We've done some repairs but it still is pretty beat up. It has 130k miles on it and we use her car for any trip that isn't driving around town. I got an offer on it from a Toyota dealership (I took it out of curiosity) for $5k a month ago. They told me that would drop should the condition get any worse or the mileage hit 150k. 

The interest rate on the Corolla is 5.9% (not great I know but I already refinanced it once when it was at 9%) and the Camaro is 2.1%.

I pay $250 on each per month (honestly not even sure what the monthly payment is on them but that is more than enough because the next payment due is always a month or two further up. Think currently the next one for both is in December). 

Any thoughts on how to proceed? The car overall is fine. It drives fine and has good gas mileage. But she is wanting to get another car because of how beat up it is and for space purposes. We have 2 dogs and my Camaro holds nothing obviously. I will be getting her something EVENTUALLY but I didn't know if I should re think my current plan.

Three Ex-Government Agents Just Created the Ultimate “Privacy Coin”
Here’s How We’ll Make 7,000% Gains Over the Next 12–24 Months Buying It
By Teeka Tiwari on October 19, 2017
 

In February 2017, I wrote to you about a tiny Chinese crypto project then valued at just $5 million.

Just a year earlier in 2016, the project’s value was $25 million.

That meant the coin had shed 80% of its value.

At the time, it was a difficult decision to recommend it. The chart looked ugly. But the idea was compelling. My research convinced me the coin had long-term value.

When I recommended it, I told you I thought it would become China’s preeminent blockchain development tool.

I said you could make 100 times your money on it.

And so, we bought it at 13 cents.

Eight days after recommending this crypto, the price collapsed to 8 cents. Its total market cap slumped to just $3 million.

To anyone looking at just the price, it looked like a disaster.

I never did find out what was behind that drop. But I am forever grateful to the shortsighted people who sold their coins to my subscribers for pennies.

Just six months later, Neo (then Antshares) rose 60,760% from its lows.

It would go on to hit a high of $50. That was a gain of 41,605% for Palm Beach Confidential readers who bought in at 13 cents.

This month, I’ve found a similar situation to Neo before it shot up.

Earlier this year, the coin was trading as much as 170% higher. It’s up off its lows… but the trading is still lackluster.

Volume and sentiment is low. And just like my original recommendation of Neo, the market cap is tiny at just $16 million.

On top of all of that, the price chart looks ugly.

But just like Neo, this idea is compelling. And my B.I.T.S. system is screaming “buy” (more on that below).

A Big Announcement

A dream team of ex-government agents have come together to create what I believe will become the world’s most widely used privacy coin.

But it’s more than that.

It’s a full-blown privacy platform.

The platform allows for globally secure payments with built-in anonymous messaging. You can also publish documents and store data anonymously.

And developers can use the platform to build and launch their own privacy apps.

Outside a small number of people, this coin is virtually unknown. But over the last six months, some of the brightest minds in crypto have been quietly rallying around this project.

Charles Hoskinson is the former CEO of Ethereum. He’s a close advisor of the project. And he has a team of developers working on it right now.

The main core technical team developer is the same guy who leads the payments engineering team at the $31 billion vacation rental behemoth Airbnb.

The project has attracted a fierce following of developers and community members that number over 1,000.

In the next few weeks, the project is about to make a big announcement.

The announcement will make this privacy coin the most secure network in the world. More secure than current leaders Monero, Zcash, and Dash.

When this announcement is made, investor money will flood into the coin.

We want to own this before that announcement is made. (More on that below.)

Short term, I think we’ll see this one double over the next few weeks.

Within one to two years, I expect this coin to have a $1 billion to $2 billion market cap.

That would take the price from around $7 per coin to between $250 and $500 per coin.

That would turn a $400 investment into $14,300–28,500. Or a $1,000 investment into $35,700–71,400.

At Palm Beach Confidential, we call this asymmetric-risk investing. It’s the strategy we use to take a trivial sum of money and convert it into life-changing wealth. Thousands of my subscribers have already done this.

If you are new to Confidential, welcome. It’s your turn to get a crack at a 50-bagger.

I want you to remember that just like Neo, this idea will be wildly volatile. We might double in price right out of the gate. We could just as easily drop 50% next week.

And I’ll tell you it doesn’t matter…

When you take a small position size, you can safely ignore volatility and focus on the big picture.

And the big picture for this idea and its future are bright.

Be sure to check out the resources we’re constantly adding to our Crypto Corner. If you have questions about anything cryptocurrencies, chances are you’ll find the answers there.

There, you can access our research on web-based wallets, hardware wallets, and other cryptocurrency services.

The Dream Team: Mercenary Mathematician, Nuclear Sub Officer, NASA Hacker

This idea was born from the meeting of three ex-military guys who wanted to create a “more secure, anonymous version of bitcoin.”

To do that, they combined their expertise in the military, intelligence, and cryptography fields.

In his own words, project leader Rob Viglione is a “mercenary mathematician.”

He’s a former U.S. Air Force officer with experience in satellite radar, space launch vehicles, and combat support intelligence.

He also was a private U.S. military contractor embedded in Afghanistan. There, he used mathematical algorithms to map out the likely locations of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Rolf Versluis is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. After graduation, he was commissioned as an officer of a nuclear submarine.

Joshua Yabut is a former cybersecurity expert at NASA and former National Guard executive officer. His job was to break into government and corporate networks. By all accounts, he was excellent at it.

A year ago, these three men joined forces. They saw a world becoming increasingly hostile to individual freedoms and decided to do something about it.

They want to give people back control over their privacy. Here’s what they wrote in their white paper for the project:

We live in a hyper-regulated and surveilled world where billions of individuals are deprived of basic human rights, such as property ownership, privacy, free association, and access to information. The technology now exists to solve some of these problems…

These three men come from a unique background in government. No one I’ve met in the crypto space has a better understanding of the government’s security apparatus than they do. They understand nation-led security threats at a deeper level than any other privacy coin team in the world.

That’s why instead of just building another privacy coin, they built an entire privacy ecosystem.

Your Privacy is Under Assault

Everywhere we look, our privacy is under attack.

In an increasingly online world, governments can see what we read, with whom we talk, and what we do with our money.

Take Turkey, for instance. That country’s government has jailed people for downloading certain apps.

In 2016, a military coup tried to topple the government. The plotters used a smartphone messaging app called ByLock to coordinate the attack.

In retaliation, the Turkish government jailed nearly 75,000 citizens for downloading the app. Even if they had nothing to do with the coup.

Think about that.

And don’t think this is just something that happens abroad. Your privacy is under assault in the United States, too.

According to former FBI director James Comey, you have no right to privacy at all.

“There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach,” Comey said at a Boston College conference on cybersecurity back in March.

Apparently, in the eyes of the FBI, no corner of your life is sacred. It can look at it all.

That’s why it should have been no surprise when we discovered the National Security Agency (NSA) has been monitoring all of our communication for years.

But it doesn’t stop there. Governments also want complete oversight of our personal wealth.

Here’s why…

In the West, governments are drowning in debts they can’t pay back. The only answer is to assault our wealth with new taxes.

But you can’t tax what you can’t see. And that’s one of the reasons many governments fear cryptocurrencies.

Unlike fiat currencies, governments can’t easily steal cryptocurrencies when a crisis hits.

That’s what European Union member Cyprus did during its banking crisis in 2013. The government confiscated up to 30% of its depositors’ money in some cases.

With cryptocurrencies, you control your own private key. That means no one can take your wealth from you. Governments hate this.

It’s not just national governments targeting citizens’ wealth.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization with 189 country members. In 2013, it proposed a global 10% wealth tax on all citizens with a positive net worth.

As governments struggle to bridge funding gaps, we expect more and more outrageous attempts to seize your wealth.

Long story short: The world is becoming a smaller, less private place.

Whether it’s the NSA listening in on all our calls, or the Turkish government cracking down on privacy apps, or the IMF trying to tax your wealth, governments are trampling over citizens’ rights.

This has led to the rise of “privacy” coins.

Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that seek to hide your identity. They are designed so governments can’t track how much you have or what you buy.

When I first started looking at privacy coins a year ago, the entire market was under $200 million. Today, it stands at over $4 billion.

That’s a 1,900% increase.

Two of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies are privacy coins Monero and Dash. We own both and have done quite well.

As of this writing. we’re up 923% and 111%, respectively. But as good as Dash and Monero are at protecting privacy, they focus on small niches.

In my research, I’ve found only one project that provides a much broader level of privacy that the future will demand.

A New Way to Shield Transactions

The name of this project is ZenCash (ZEN).

ZenCash has about 2.2 million coins outstanding. Just like bitcoin, there will never be more than 21 million ZenCash coins.

Here’s the background on ZenCash…

ZenCash shares a similar history to the $2.2 billion privacy coin giant Dash. (Dash is currently the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the world.)

What many folks don’t know is that Dash went through a long, winding road before becoming the powerhouse it is today.

Dash started as a clone of bitcoin… but with privacy. Its original name was Darkcoin. It then “forked” (spun off) into XCoin, and then forked again into Dash.

Each change brought further refinements to the underlying protocol.

We’ve seen ZenCash follow a similar path.

ZenCash started as a clone of Zcash.

Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to use a form of cryptography called zk-snarks.

A detailed explanation of zk-snarks is beyond the scope of this report. The bottom line with this technology is that it allows for something called “shielded transactions.”

A shielded transaction hides the identity of the sender, the receiver, and the transaction amount.

Zcash is a brilliant project, but it has problems. One of the biggest is how the mining reward is set up.

For the first four years of Zcash’s existence, 20% of the mining reward went to its original development team. This didn’t sit well with certain developers. So, they forked Zcash and created a new coin called Zclassic.

Zclassic stripped out the founders’ reward and gave miners 100% of the mining fees.

Scrapping the founders’ reward was a step in the right direction… but it didn’t go far enough.

Zclassic still had a fundamental weakness… It was dependent on the goodwill of the community to keep developing it.

It had no funds of its own to ensure constant development and improvement.

That’s when Rob Viglione, Rolf Versluis, and Joshua Yabut decided to “fork” Zclassic and create a better version: ZenCash.

In a moment, I’ll explain to you the changes the team made that will make ZenCash the No. 1 privacy coin in the world.

Before I do that, I want to show you what’s wrong with the privacy coins we have right now.

The Four Problems With Current Privacy Coins

The world’s privacy coins are each solving small parts of the overall privacy problem.

Zcash wants to keep your transactions and wealth secret.Dash wants to be a commerce coin with optional privacy.Monero wants to be untraceable digital cash.

Each of these coins has done great work in its relative niche… but each has fundamental drawbacks.

Drawback No. 1: Inadequate Funding Model

Monero’s funding model relies on developers donating their time to the project. They are not paid to improve Monero. Perhaps that’s why there still isn’t a user-friendly mobile wallet.

Zcash’s funding model is only in place for the first four years. After that, Zcash is expected to rely on the “community” for further development.

Only Dash has truly sustainable long-term development funding through its treasury model. Dash’s design sends 10% of the mining reward into a treasury to pay for ongoing development.

For long-term success, a privacy coin must have a self-funding model.

Drawback No. 2: Not Fully Secure

Privacy coins aren’t as anonymous as advertised. To our knowledge, no cryptocurrency today employs end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is a system of communication. In this system, only communicating users can read the messages they send and receive. No eavesdropper can access the messages.

Without end-to-end encryption, anyone monitoring the network could see all traffic across all blockchains.

This means governments could track down the origin of transactions and identify users.

Here are two examples of so-called untraceable coins getting traced…

In 2016, federal law enforcement agents seized nearly 12,000 Monero coins.

And this year, law enforcement agents seized nearly 3,700 Zcash coins from the late Alexandre Cazes, the alleged leader of dark market drug purveyor AlphaBay.

Obviously, the government did not publicize how it was able to track down these “untraceable” coins. But it makes sense that the lack of end-to-end encryption could have played a role in unmasking these transactions.

While you and I have no interest in running an illegal drug bazaar, there are many legitimate reasons to want privacy. For instance, do you want everyone to know exactly what you buy or what causes you support?

The government has a history of persecution based on political beliefs.

In 2013, news broke that the IRS had targeted organizations affiliated with the Tea Party.

Let’s say you want to give money to WikiLeaks, a website that publishes secrets and classified information from anonymous sources.

If you donate publicly, the government could use that information to deny you a security clearance or federal job. Even private sector jobs could discriminate against you.

What if you want to give money to a pro-life or a pro-choice charity? Either choice could lead to employer and/or social discrimination.

The point is there are lots of legitimate reasons to keep your financial transactions secret. Without end-to-end encryption, you can’t be sure you are safe.

Drawback No. 3: Easily Blocked

As governments become more fearful of cryptocurrencies, they’ll try to block your access to them. We’re already seeing this in China and Russia.

China has shut down its domestic crypto exchanges. The Russian central bank has said it will block access to all cryptocurrency trading websites.

Governments will enforce these bans by making Internet Service Providers (ISPs) keep a list of banned sites.

You literally will not be able to connect to these sites. Dash, Monero, and Zcash have no way to overcome this type of government blocking.

This is a huge flaw in today’s leading privacy coins.

Drawback No. 4: They Only Handle Payments

Dash, Monero, and Zcash are primarily designed to handle the transfer of money.

Zcash offers something slightly different with its private messaging function.

Dash also has unique offerings like “instant send,” which allows you to receive money instantly.

The privacy coin of the future must be able to do more than move money.

It must have built-in messaging.It must allow anonymous data publishing and storage.It must have end-to-end encryption and be unblockable.And of course, it must be able to handle the anonymous transfer of money.

None of the current privacy coin leaders have all of those functions… except ZenCash.

Why ZenCash Will Become the Most Widely Used Privacy Coin

Earlier, I told you ZenCash is the brainchild of three ex-military men.

This is important because if you believe in the saying “it takes a thief to catch a thief,” then you’ll understand the value these military insiders bring to a privacy ecosystem.

Throughout their careers, these founders have had ringside seats to how governments really operate.

That’s why they shed their government careers and devoted their professional lives to the creation of a total privacy platform.

The ZenCash team has designed a platform that will plug the holes that plague the current privacy coins.

Plug No. 1: Robust Funding Model

Developing software costs money… lots of money.

Traditional software firms rely on issuing stock, sometimes bonds, and on rare occasions, actual earnings to fund their operations.

Typically, cryptocurrency projects rely on community donations of time and skill.

Relying on the goodwill of others is not a long-term scalable solution.

The other problem with relying on a community of developers is that a small group of folks ends up steering the project.

This results in a centralized development team, which can lead to a weaker project.

We like decentralized development teams. In that model, the community votes on which aspects of development get priority.

When you have a funding mechanism that the community votes on, it ensures the best ideas and the most committed developers are getting the money they need to keep improving the project.

ZenCash has solved this problem by using a “Treasury Model.”

Every 2.5 minutes, 12.5 ZenCash gets mined. Under its Treasury Model, 88% of the mining reward goes to the miners. The ZenCash Foundation Treasury gets 8.5%.

(I’ll explain where the rest goes in a moment.)

Right now, 7,200 new ZenCash gets mined each day. Of that, 612 coins (8.5%) go to the ZenCash Foundation Treasury.

At current prices, that’s $4,284 per day… or $1,563,600 each year.

Now, remember: ZenCash is only at $7 right now. As the price starts rising, we’ll see the treasury allocation rise along with it.

This model ensures that ZenCash will have a steady supply of capital to pay for its ongoing development without having to engage in dilutive coin offerings.

This funding model means ZenCash will always have the money needed to keep growing and improving.

Plug No. 2: End-to-End Encryption

Earlier, I mentioned that ZenCash is on the cusp of a major announcement that will bring in a flood of new investors.

It has to do with end-to-end encryption.

As of this writing, there is not a single cryptocurrency that offers end-to-end encryption.

ZenCash is about to fix that with a solution it calls “secured nodes.”

According to the white paper, secured nodes “ensure the system remains distributed, resilient, and secure. By enforcing encrypted communication between nodes, and between nodes and wallets, Zen protects against eavesdropping […]”

As I mentioned earlier, end-to-end encryption helps thwart government efforts at linking network traffic to users’ identities.

As regimes such as China and Russia’s become more hostile to cryptocurrencies, this service will become a must-have option.

The secured node network is being beta-tested right now. It will go live in two to four weeks.

Right now, there are 170 test secure nodes. The founders estimate they will have 1,000 secured nodes by the end of the first quarter of 2018.

They expect such rapid growth because anyone operating a secured node will be entitled a share in 3.5% of the mining reward.

We think this is a very smart way of ensuring the ZenCash network stays highly distributed and secure.

Plug No. 3: “Domain Fronting”

As I write this, Russia’s central bank has announced it will block its citizens from accessing cryptocurrency websites.

As already mentioned, China has shut down its domestic cryptocurrency trading platforms.

The founders of ZenCash have long known this day would come. That’s why they built “domain fronting” into ZenCash.

With domain fronting, you can make a domain (website) you’re trying to access look like something else.

For instance, if you are in Russia and want to access a ZenCash wallet, domain fronting would make your network request look like you were going to an approved website.

Here’s another way to think about domain fronting…

It’s like having a plane ticket that says you are flying to London. This lets you pass the security checkpoint. Except once you’ve passed security, the ticket changes and lets you fly to Cuba without anyone knowing.

ZenCash is the only privacy coin we know of that will have domain-fronting capability. As more governments become hostile to cryptocurrencies, this is another feature that will be critical to a privacy coin’s success.

That’s why we expect the global demand for domain fronting to soar, and ZenCash along with it…

Again, as of this writing, ZenCash is the only privacy coin that offers domain fronting.

Plug No. 4: Full Privacy Platform

ZenCash is more than just a way to send and receive money anonymously. It is a full privacy platform that other developers can build upon.

So instead of having to build your own privacy platform from scratch, you can build applications on top of the ZenCash system.

Here are some of the different applications you’ll see launch on the ZenCash platform.

ZenTalk is a secure communications network that allows you to broadcast a message from one person to many people. Think of it like an encrypted invitation-only Twitter feed.ZenPub is a platform that will let you publish and store documents anonymously.ZenHide is the domain fronting service. ZenHide will give users the ability to circumnavigate crypto-commerce blocking.

On top of all that, ZenCash includes the ability to send and receive money anonymously (or publicly if you wish). Plus, you can use it as a one-to-one private messaging system.

In addition, ZenCash can work with other blockchains (that means it’s interoperable).

Let’s say you want to set up an Ethereum smart contract but handle the payment via a ZenCash shielded address.

In the future, you’ll be able to do that.

This rich set of features makes ZenCash more than just a privacy coin.

It’s a privacy platform… and platforms are incredibly valuable.

This is because platforms attract other developers. And more developers equate to more apps, which equate to more users.

More users equal more demand for ZenCash, and that, my friends, equals much higher prices ahead.

personalfinance,Invest for retirement vs. Pay off student loans of 4-5%.,"I'm working on finishing my 6 month emergency fund. I had always planned on the next step in my financial plan being working towards saving 15% gross towards retirement. I was reading in the ""prime directive"" today. It recommends paying off non-mortgage debt over 4% interest before proceeding to save for retirement. 

I am wondering if in my situation I should consider going against the recommendation in the prime directive. I currently have ~$157,000 in student loan debt. $100,000 is in federal loans. $57,000 is in private loans at 5% interest. I currently pay $400 per month on my federal loans and $470 on my private loans. 

I am working towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan, and the federal loan debt will be forgiven in just under 2 years. When my loans are forgiven in 2 years, I was planning on using the $400 I was paying towards my forgiven public loans and putting it towards my private loans. Putting $870 per month towards my private loans would take about 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 

I'm currently saving 4% of my income. When I get raises, that money goes to saving until I'm at 15% gross. 

When my emergency fund is finished, should I (1) put my 4+% I'm currently saving towards the loans to get them paid off as recommended by the prime directive, (2) put the 4+% towards retirement, (3) some combination of 1 and 2, or (4) something else I haven't considered? Thanks for advice!

investing,Look at $NLY,"TL;DR - Strong dividend REIT stock (~10% yield) with lots of room for growth in the next few years with high valuations. It's not a meme stock, but it is a solid investment.

Annaly Capital Management ($NLY) is a mortgage real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of real estate related investments.

A longer commentary, per Valueline.com, states:

&gt;Annaly Capital has issued common stock for the first time in a number of years, signaling a more aggressive approach. It used to be a fairly routine occurrence for the company to come out with stock offerings when conditions in the government agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market were appealing. The company now feels that is the case, and will be using some of the $1.5 billion in funds received (which also include a preferred stock offering) to expand in that area. The company will also be using a portion of the proceeds to build up its other lines.

&gt;The prospective return to normal conditions in the MBS market may provide a long-term opportunity. The Federal Reserve’s extensive securities purchases following the last recession skewed the market, but that policy is reversing course this month. The Fed plans to allow $10 billion a month of maturing securities (40% mortgage-related) to roll off its balance sheet. That amount is set to increase by $10 billion a quarter, to a maximum of $50 billion. Presumably, the bulk of those securities will be replaced with new issues, creating an opening for Annaly.

&gt;The capital raise might not do much for earnings right away, though. The interest-rate cycle may not quite have run its course if the Fed follows through on its plans to raise short-term interest rates a few more times. That possibility is not set in stone, but higher rates, if they arrive, might well keep a lid on the valuations of mortgage-related securities. Still, the issuance of new stock, with the proceeds scaled up by a leverage factor of around six to one, will allow the company to build its balance sheet. In turn, that should ensure sufficient interest income to maintain the dividend at its current rate. The shares retain their interest as a high-yield vehicle, and they are generally stable. The stability largely arises from the consistent dividend, which appears secure. It will be interesting to see how quickly the fresh capital being deployed by the company provides optimal benefits. Part of that equation rests on how soon short-term interest rates stop rising.

I ran a regression model against the S&amp;P, a Free Cash Flow of the Firm model (FCFF), and a constant growth dividend discount model (DDM).

The regression showed that the 10-year beta of $NLY continues to be incredibly low (0.287) with a low alpha (0.0078), making it a safe investment even if the company underperforms the market, especially because of its incredibly strong dividend. [Here are my regression results](https://imgur.com/a/Z8Grr); I can also send the rest of the model and equations if anyone wants to run them themselves.

While $NLY was very hard to value (no income tax, no operating margin, no current assets/current liabilities, etc.), the FCFF showed promising future results. It showed the intrinsic value of $NLY to be around ~$27.65 as opposed to the current selling price of ~$12.30. I had used conservative estimates but, like mentioned above, this security wasn't easy to value. [Here is the FCFF model](https://imgur.com/aZ8spf7). I can also send equations if anyone is interested.

While I did run a DDM as well, it's a pretty strong outlier. After running it, the intrinsic value came out to be $44.1694, far higher than the FCFF, so take this one with a grain of salt. I can also provide the equation.

CONCLUSION

Strong REIT with a solid dividend and high valuations, decreasing debt, good growth projections while being well managed. I'll be buying shares within the next few days.",finance
cardano,Denominations,"In terms of money units there are two points of consideration. First in Japan, yen amounts are much larger, 10,000 yen is like the 100 dollar bill and factoring this into the units you go from 25 billion Ada to 250 million. Second Ada has six digits from the decimal not eight for Bitcoin. An Ada is a million Lovelaces (the smallest unit). Adjusting for this takes you to 2.5 million.

investing,DYK The Fed pays *6%* DIVIDENDS to banks??,"https://newrepublic.com/article/116913/federal-reserve-dividends-most-outrageous-handout-banks

&gt; As a condition of membership, regional banks must purchase “stock” in their local Federal Reserve Bank. But as the Fed notes, owning Reserve Bank stock bears little resemblance to owning stock in AT&amp;T or General Motors. First, all nationally-chartered banks must join the Reserve system and purchase this stock. No public stock has ever been issued; the banks are the only shareholders. The stock has a set value that never changes, and banks cannot sell, trade, or pledge the stock as collateral. With the price constant, banks cannot lose money on the stock; even if a regional Federal Reserve Bank somehow disbanded, the government is required by law to pay out stockholders at face value. The stock purchase must equal 6 percent of the bank’s total capital and surplus; half gets paid in to the regional Reserve Bank, and the other half is on call. If the bank’s capital goes up they must purchase more stock, and if it falls they get a refund.

personalfinance,Concern on Debt Situation (US),"Ok, I’ve been working through this year in order to fix the situation that I had dug for myself after losing my job in September of 2015.  I went about 6 months unemployed and my credit completely came unglued going down as low as a 400 on my credit score about 18 months ago making me feel completely doomed.  I have posted in the past for recommendations and found things largely helpful and over the last year I have dug myself out by about $15,000 of the total debt that I owed, things have looked up.  My score has increased and is a 552 with TransUnion and a 538 with Equifax.  I’m trying to work towards recovering everything and improving things.

Currently I am working in a situation where I make a little over $50,000 annually and now only have a few accounts still showing on my credit.  They are as follows with four bills from WAY back.
Car Loan 11,048.00 (This is in good standing with over 12 months of on time payments no issues)
Credit Card – 1,202 (Closed account still needs paid) Last activity 27 July 2017 – Payment for $200.00
Old Cell Bill – 2,345 (Closed account still needs paid) Last activity 22 February 2017 – Put in Collections
Old Credit Card – 729 (Closed account still needs paid) Last activity 26 January 2016 – Put in Collections
Fingerhut (idiot decision) – 1,035 (Closed account still needs paid) Last activity 16 February 2016 – Put in Collections

There’s one additional that I know what it is showing on my credit but I’m confused in a few realms and I really don’t know what to do or how to handle as it seems like it has exploded on me completely.  I have email statements in regards to this last account showing that the account was for 3,618.77 on September 21st 2016.  However, since then they have charged it off (as is their right) in the amount of 6209 (September 30th 2016).  But my big concern is that I not have someone emailing me (I haven’t responded yet) who is stating they are the debt collector for this debt stating that the balance is 9714.20 and they are willing to take a lump payment of 6314.23.  Now my guess is this account isn’t accruing interest and my only basis for this is that I have received the exact same email from these people but with a 30 day increment between them. 

So there are a few questions I have as I’m working through the next year in the hopes of recovering another 100 points on my credit score even though I know this is likely an impossible task.  My question is based upon the fact that I initially had a plan, but after finally seeing these email communications from the debt collector I am second guessing myself.  My plan before having seen those emails was to have the next four old closed accounts that total out to $5311 paid by around February completely paid off so that they’re not looming over my head any longer, but I didn’t really know the route to fix my credit more beyond just paying my truck payment every month.  I have seen the usual advice to get 2 secured cards and keep their balance at 10-15 every month so that they’re showing proper credit usage.  But now I’m worried that this ridiculous balance from the email thing is going to be at 15-20k around the same time next year just based on the inflation shown from my credit report to those emails.  I just want to do right by my family as I finish my degree as I know that to pursue any type of larger income I need to have a good credit score as well.  

I have 4 kids and am former military, usually my tax returns are a little less than 10,000 that I get back between state and federal as I didn’t really know how to write up my exceptions.  It’s something I never really understood or got taught and I always have this constant fear of having to owe money at tax time, so I claim 1-2 every year and just take the big tax return and last year used it to pay down debt.  

I’m 34, with my first 401k that at year end I will have contributed about 5,000 into myself, I know I probably should be worrying about clearing these debts out of the way completely before I’m contributing, my company matches up to 6% and am just trying to be responsible and an adult after years of screwing around and being stupid.

Please any advice will help and I know I rambled on and this might be confusing in some rights.  In advance thanks for any information/help that is able to be provided.",finance
Bitcoin,Theoretical Idea for Stable Coin - Feedback?,"Hello all,

I wanted to ask for some thoughts on an idea I have for a cryptocurrency. The idea centers around a ""Stable Coin"", which is, in theory, a cryptocurrency with low price volatility. There are low cryptocurrencies already created with almost no volatility (ex. Tether)

The other concept that I want to bring in to this stable coin is ""store of value."" As many of us know in the crypto community, fiat currencies can be a poor store of value and citizens can lose wealth over time just by holding wealth in a fiat currency. I would like this stable coin to slowly appreciate in value. Removing the volatility would be a key component and the SLOW rise in value would help users gain trust in the currency.

I have a dream of a currency that makes users more wealthy just by holding their wealth in the currency. This stable will appreciate in value as the users sleep. The users will never need to worry about the stable coin drastically dropping in value overnight.

I believe, to achieve this, this stable coin will need to be tied to a hard asset, such as precious metals or real estate. The monetary policy will need to be detailed, yet simple.

What do you think? Is this possible? Or is it nonsensical to dream of a currency that is a brilliant and stable store of value? Bitcoin is a great store of value, relative to existing fiat currencies, but the volatility can be risky and large bag holders have more power in the market than individuals do. This stable coin would put the individual first, no matter how small their bag.

Thank you.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Choosing My Student Loan Repayment Plan,"It's time for me to start repaying my student loans. I have options to pay off the loans (2) in flat allocations over 10 to 30 years. The interest rates on the loans were set when I received them. Obviously, the 30 year repayment plan has smaller payments and the 10 year repayment has less total interest paid.

So here's my question: Am I okay picking the 30 year repayment plan so that I have the smaller monthly payment, and then just making payments above the minimum? This would allow me more financial flexibility if a hardship arises, and I don't think it will affect my interest rate either since they were set with the loan. Thoughts?

Also I have a decent salary at a non-profit, as such I am eligible for 'loan forgiveness' once I have paid for 10 years. In which case I would want to probably pay the minimum amount possible during that time. Since it's not a given that I will stay with this organization doesn't it make sense to just go ahead and pay off the loan as soon as possible?

Thanks in advance!",finance
crypto_currency,What is Quantstamp? And Why?,"A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, by helping exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.. Being able to execute and enforce a contract in a completely decentralised and trustless way, has many applications in today’s world. With many useful functions like autonomy ( no need third parties), trust ( data encrypted), backup (multiple backup on blockchain), saving cost and accuracy.

However, smart contracts still has its own challenges. Since smart contracts based on computational programming, and most computer programs are unpredictable. Therefore it may occur errors and bugs throughout audit conventions. We were all reminded of the intolerance for human error within programmable money when a $30M hack surfaced in July 2017 from a one word bug stemming from the Parity multi-sig wallet.This proved that smart contract bugs and hacks are not born from incompetency, but rather from the inherent complex mechanics of programmable money.

The first fundamental concept of Quantstamp was born based on that idea, to create a more secure environment for smart contracts. Quantstamp is the first scalable security-audit protocol designed to find vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, that arms to boost credibility, security and convenience to all smart contracts built on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Here are the basic characteristics of Quantstamp can assure delivering to clients

•	Cost effective: For smart contracts to truly play an important role in the future of many industries, cost-effective code auditing is integral.
•	Scalable: Quantstamp’s protocol is designed to scale to verify all Ethereum projects, and become a fundamental part of mainstream adoption for Ethereum.
•	Secure: Centralized audits are vulnerable to insider attacks. The proof-of-audit protocol is designed so that malicious actors cannot manipulate audit results.

Why choose Quantstamp

•	Experienced Team Members: Quantstamp team is one of the best teams I’ve seen so far in 2017, comprising of graduates from veterans from top companies like IBM, Google, Amazon, Samsung, etc. Most of them already have domain expertise in security and blockchain.  Together with a strong core team is an impressive roster of advisors. Most notable are Dr. Vijay Ganesh, Dr. Derek Rayside, and Dr. Sveinn Valfells.
•	Unique Competitor: Quantstamp is not facing much competition due to a surprising lack of projects in the field.
•	Potential Project: Althought Quantstamp is not officially launched, but the reviews that Quantstamp has received on multiple cryptocurrency platforms is overwhelmingly positive.
•	Bold Advertising Scheme: The “Proof-of-caring concept”. Unlike other project, where investor can spend as much as they can into a project, as far as I concerned, this is the first time a project only let investors to investing as much investments based on their knowledges about the project, leaving time for investors to research and truly understand the core meaning of the project before making any decisions. Ultimately to help introducing the project to more audiences. To date, they've already accumulated over 4000 people in their telegram chat and conversation is happening at all hours of the day.

•	Positive Statistics: 
o	By using QST token, which is basically used in their platform, to pay for, receive, and improve verification services and used as a bounty for the identification of any bugs in the platform/contract, Quantstamps is trying to create an encouraging ecosystem. As the platform becomes adopted, I do see the value of these tokens increasing, as they are inherently needed for contract creators to verify and validate their smart contract’s security.
o	The public sale for Quantstamp's 'QSP' Ethereum ERC20 token will take place in November. 650,000,000 QSP will be available to the public from a total supply of 1,000,000,000 QSP. The soft cap is $3M,hard cap $30M. Of the remaining 350,000,000 QSP, 200,000,000 tokens will be distributed to the team and advisers on a long term vesting schedule. The other 150,000,000 are intended as a reserve and for community development. Tokens will be distributed 7 days after the public sale. Unallocated tokens will be burnt. 

•	Encouraging Opportunities: QuantStamp is incentivizing all players to participate in this audit system through the use of their QSP tokens.
o	Find a bug? Earn some QSP
o	Run a node to help with the computing power needed for audit? Earn some QSP
o	Security expert who wants to contribute some auditing code? Earn some QSP
o	ICO project that wants the coveted stamp of approval &amp; trust? Pay some QSP


Conclution

In the end, Quantstamp is being built from the ground up to be a long living protocol, a new and growing company with open positions, but they’re already staffed with some serious heavyweights. The Ethereum ecosystem is still constantly changing, and as a rapidly growing market, chances are that Quantstamp will be looking at some competition arising soon. Although there will be much challenges and difficulties up a head for Quantstamp, but I can see huge potential and bright future for Quantstamp to become a successful project in the mainstream adoption of smart contracts, which is a huge benefit to the Ethereum Network and Blockchain technology in general.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[US] Taking higher paying unrelated job to save up OR take lower-paying relevant jobs until grad school starts?,"Hi pf! This falls under both career guidance and personal finance guidance but I would appreciate any input on my situation. 

I am 23, looking to make a career change to Accounting. The Master's program starts next fall (~Oct 2018). Here's my job history

*  Company A - 1yr: 44k/yr. Left on OK terms with boss, but ruffled feathers of upper mgmt when I left for competitor B. Has a Roth 401k w/ match after 1 yr. Friends are willing to help get me up to speed (Company A is hiring and I can go back) 
* Company B - 6mo: 54k/yr, until I got laid off.  
* Company C -1mo: $12/hr. Current company, Part-time Receptionist work with Accounting duties. Relevant to grad school degree, but pay is dismal. Other entry lvl jobs have similar pay, and I have no other Accounting exp other than this. 

My financial situation:

* $20k in Savings. thinking of starting a 529 with some of it
* $5k Vanguard brokerage, all ETFS.
* $30k Roth IRA. Want to avoid touching this. 
* Right now, total take-home pay $622/month. if I found a FT role, I could MAYBE make $1.4k/month, saving $400/mo.  
* Side hustles - random, can sometimes get an extra $25-50. unreliable. 
* For grad school, I am looking at $25k tuition. 6% fixed interest rate. No federal subsidized loans for grad school. High COL cause California. 

Monthly expenses (No debt): $852

* Rent + Utilities: $735
* Gym: $32
* Food: $50
* Phone: $35
My fiance and I live together+carpool and he isn't making me pay for gas/insurance. I own a car, no payments, I think it's reliable but who knows. He makes $54k/yr [enough to pay for both of us] and offered to do so but tbh, I feel a little weird about it. He'd rather pay for both of us than move to somewhere w/ lower rent.

So here's my question: Should I go back to my former employer to make more $ for grad school? Cons: Definitely going to burn a bridge. Resume a mess. Looks weird to future employers that I went back instead of doing Accounting. Awkward to go back after getting laid off from competitor. Enemies in upper mgmt (?) Pros: Saving $, and pumping up a Roth 401k that I can rollover to a Roth IRA when I leave. Friends are there to get me through the new stuff. 

Or, do I spend 1 year in a relevant Accounting role making less money, but gain experience in the field? Cons: More loans later. If something bad happens, I will be in a more financially unstable position. I'd rely on my fiance a lot more and would feel bad about it, even though he offers to take care of things - what if something bad happens to both of us? Pros: Might make it easier to get an Accounting internship while in Grad school. Makes me look like a serious applicant. Future employers would see a clearer progression in interest from Engineering to Accounting and not so much job-hopping.

**TLDR;** (1) Go back to former employer for more $ to save for grad school (but unrelated job + resume will be a mess) or (2) Stick with RELEVANT but lower paying jobs until grad school starts? What do you guys think?

personalfinance,Please help me help my parents.,"Hey guys! I'm a 24 year old with a B.S. in finance, but a career in the manufacturing industry.  During school, I was very interested in the personal finance and retirement classes.  I'm telling you this about myself so that you know that I'm not  *completely* unprepared when it comes to the topic of retirement, but I'm not a professional, either.

&amp;nbsp;

I was on the phone with my mom yesterday.  We recently inherited some money from my late grandfather, so I asked her what she was going to do with her portion.  That led us into the topic of retirement, where she divulged to me that she and my dad have a total of about $18,000 in retirement.  She went on to say that she puts 4% of her paychecks into retirement, and my dad puts away 6% of his.  I hinted to Mom that she should have more than that.  She kind of scoffed and said ""We know that, but we had kids and we had fun, we didn't have any extra money to save.""  Mom is 50 years old, and Dad is 58 years old.

&amp;nbsp;

Hearing this made my heart drop.  I'm 24 years old, and I have more in my retirement account than Mom has in hers. From my classes and reading online, I'm under the impression that their retirement should be at least half a million by now. They live across the country from me, and they're always talking about how they'll visit me twice a year in retirement, and how they'll go on at least one vacation a year like my grandma does. This just isn't even in the scope of possibility the way they're currently heading.

&amp;nbsp;

Finances has always been a very touchy subject with them, but I feel like they *need* an intervention. I want to be as gentle and tactful as I can. I don't want to simply say ""Hey Mom, you guys really messed up, you have to fix your finances."" I'm also going to suggest that they find a financial advisor, and help them find someone if they allow me to. But, I want to give them some content to read and some facts to chew through.

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any suggestions to at least attempt to make their retirement somewhat comfortable? Do you have any calculators that I could use to show them where they *should* be at? Do you have any articles or books that you live by that might be helpful in changing their stance about retirement? I know I could Google all of this, but I thought it'd be nice to ask for some human opinions as well. I really don't want them to think that I think they're stupid, or think that I'm talking down to them.

Car needs about $700 worth of tire-related repairs now. It Kelly Blue Books at $1,500 but the automatic locks just broke, too. So I'm probably $3k upside down.

Credit isn't terrible, but I fell behind on a few things over the past 2 years or so, mostly due to the $250 car payment being just a little too much for comfort. So credit has worsened. 

5 year plan: fix my credit, kill off my smaller debts. To do this, I want to pay less for my car. I can't pay less on almost anything else I pay for right now. A $180 or so car payment would give me some breathing room so I could get ahead on other items. 

I'm not overly concerned about the long-term suckness of leasing because that will factor in after I spend the next 5(ish) years getting my financial shit in order. I want a house and some goddamn goats and I'm sick of paying things late and screwing myself over with how cyclical that gets (late fees, etc.). 

I do NOT want to have to worry about costly car repairs for the next few years. Chevies are not known for their value retention, which is what's hanging me up. My current interest rate also sucks on this car, because I didn't research when I bought it. At all.

Ripple,It's as though some are not grasping what XRP is.,"A value of a currency depends on an economy. or something to back it up. MANY many many many many people come from other Crypto's and can't quite figure out what's XRP deal. Well lets take you down the rabbit hole. 

I am sorry for anyone who has Bitcoin honestly, Why? Because what is the economy that is supporting bitcoin? Honestly go look up definition's write books I don't care because you won't be able to write anything. Bitcoin has Zero Economy... So why does it go up... Jamie was correct calling it Tulip Mania Sure it has some value... Why? because mining is backing it up which is why mining was written into the code because it forces valuation on the token. It costs this much to produce I will only sell it for this much. But whats happening is everyone is jumping trying to make money I mean Honestly..... Ask your self this, once XRP reaches a $XXX dollars your going to sell... But to who??? Who is going to buy your XRP??? it has to be someone who sees more value than what it currently is so they buy it from you. 



So this is how Bitcoin currently works. The last person in line pays the most, then everyone starts selling because no one will pay anymore because everyone just wants to make money.  It only stops when it reaches a value that everyone agrees upon which they will not sell their coin. It will never drop to 1 dollar because no one would be willing to trade it today at 5,600 and tomorrow at 1 dollar because they have added Value on top of the cost of mining to it. 10 years it could it be worth 1 dollar sure. What needs to happen? People stop farming it, people see no value in it. Slowly people pull away realizing it has Zero Economy, something to back it up. 



Economy
the wealth and resources of a country or region, especially in terms of the production and consumption of goods and services. 


Bitcoin doesn't service any of these. Gooooooooooooooooood luck trying to actually buy something with bitcoin, the only thing you can do simply is sell it for fiat which it's exact opposite what it was designed for. It was meant to be fast, but it was not designed this way which is why Vitalik left and was going to work on XRP but started Ethereum because he could not obtain a visa to the US. 


Ethereum is designed to be the younger but much better Bitcoin, really meant to replace it because Bitcoin came about on an idea a really fucking great idea but it's initial design had many many many flaws which Vitalik saw and is trying to correct. Ethereum is going to take along time to reach proof of stake, it has many many steps to overcome just not on the coding itself but also the regulations it will face once it has reached proof of stake. Once you can buy goods and services with Eth, assuming its much faster than it currently is. the value will grow because you have an Economy where you can actually trade Eth for goods and services. Assuming its Fast, Efficient can be traded at local stores or banks.


Banks. 


Ripple, has its native token as XRP.  Used in the settlement of Cross border payments.  Sells software to help reduce costs but also utilizes it's native token XRP to further reduce cost for cross border payments, Incentivizing banks to use it's XRP.  



Why is it a Long road to Tipperary?


1. Regulation....  The banking world is Heavly regulated and for good reason. Money stolen blah blah blah how many stories have you heard. How many have you heard that the feds were involved. If someone uses my credit card they know where when have possible video evidence can track prosecute and dismiss the charges on my card and issue me a new one. What happens if someone steals your Crypto's Zip zero zilch. This is example of just 1 in a multitude of many things that need to be in place. But..... Ripple is so far past every other Block Chain to Regulation it's not even funny, Honestly this is a 1% chance there too early. But that is for another time. 


2. Usage **(Use Cases)**.... Because Ripple wants to dominate the block chain world which I honestly believe it will it has to come at the banking world at an angle that appeals to real world use cases. It has to fill a void that currently exists in the Banking world. That is Cross Border Payments, You don't see any other block chain trying to do this. They are building on the Technology of the block chain( if you don't know what block chain technology is you should look it up) which is incredible but trying encourage you to use it in day to day transaction (bitcoin... which isn't going to happen because its slow and expensive)or build on the technology of Block chain to help facilitate ease of transfer of money and..... and smart contracts (Ethereum). Every token out there should have Use case or White Paper if you don't know what they are read them if your investing without reading the White Paper then well good luck to you because your throwing your money where it might have zero value and you don't even know it. Every crypto out there serves some kind of purpose most are obscene with delirium. China Creating there own crypto currency has its use case they plan to use it as there digital fiat, that actually has use which supports the economy it going to be used in. 


3. The Problem.... Besides the first point of regulation being a problem for XRP it faces the obstacle of cross border payments. XRP needs liquidation, That means it's ability to change from Digital Currency to real world value of fiat, goods or services. Banks Have Absolutly zero fucks in the world what the value of XRP is if they are using for cross border payments.  It could be .5 of a penny or .01 of a penny all they need to do is transfer from point a to point b and get the correct money at point b. Lets take things slow and stupid and imagine it was transfer of hands with simple computers. Bank a needs to send bank b money. Currently the process is slow and inefficient and expensive and prone to errors and sometimes even theft. With XRP lets say banks had actual involvement with the XRP token itself, which they don't because it is part of the software but lets just humor this ideology. Bank a goes to the street corner and says hey I am need to transfer 100 usd to some guy in china, I need to make sure the guy in china gets 100 usd equivalent of yen. Buddy on the corner sells him 400 xrp says this will fix you up man, just send this through Crypto Info through your computer to guy in china he will find a guy in china on a street corner who will buy that 400 xrp for the equivalent of 100 usd in Yen. So bank A buys this xrp sends it to bank B they go the street corner get the exchange and they have there money. Now..... what happens in the real world investors like us (as in people not country) is xrp understand its value were willing to buy that xrp for value of our fiat.  The problem is banks are not currently heavily using it, they will be! because of people like us! It just faces regulation and People understanding its use cases. 


4. The People This isn't really a problem... Not really but it was brought up as people were sad when it was said banks aren't really looking into it. But people ignored the reason why.... Because customers were not asking for it. Once people start asking to use it because of its Use Case, then banks will Jump on board and push for regulation. 


Anyways it's Friday Night I hope I got my point across I have been drinking heavily so I hope people appreciate my humor at the end. I hope some one got some understanding especially new people maybe some people who have been here learned something feel free to downvote or comment whatever man its your life do what you want. 

For those who say bitcoin is a store of value then that is what you say.... Not me... Even gold is a store of value but has use or an economy and dont tell me you can buy stuff with bitcoin unless you actually have done it",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Teacher (25 - TX) looking for financial guidance,"Hello Personal Finance,

I have been a lurker for awhile, but I have never posted here. I am looking for financial guidance because I do not know if I am on the correct path or not at my age and my profession. 

Occupation: Mathematics Teacher (8th Grade, 2nd year)
Salary ('17-18'): $48,700
Monthly Salary: $4058 pre-tax (~$3,100 after-tax)
Bonuses: ~$3,000 

Expenses -
Rent: ~$450 (shared with S/O 2bed 2bath and 1 roommate)
Spotify: $11
Dollar Shave Club: $10
Misc (food, gas, alcohol, dining, fun, etc): ~$700 
Student Loans: $191.82 (directly from savings)
[I do not pay cell phone, car insurance, or other big monthly expenses that some others might have. These bills are paid by my parents]

In reality, I do not keep an exact budget of everything I spend, but I do keep a balance of $1,500 in my checking at the first of every month. This way, I stick to no more than spending $1,500 in a month except for extreme cases like car repairs, Christmas, anniversary, or other special events. 

As of this post, I currently have $301.68 in my checking and $22,193.39 in my savings account. Since I am a teacher, my school does not have a 401K, but it may have a 401(b) option. I am not entirely sure. I do know my TRS account says: 

""Account Balance as of 8/31/2017: $4,580.74
Years of Service as of 8/31/2017: 2
∗∗ Membership Tier: 5""

As for debt, I do have substantial student loans I am hoping to be forgiven for the most part. Right now, I owe $9,500 in a Federal Perkins Loan that should be forgiven in full after 5 years of teaching. Also, I have $50,064.15 in student loans that I am on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan to pay down and I am hoping to be forgiven for the remaining balance of whatever is left after 10 years of teaching (completing 120 on-time payments of ~$191.82). 

/PersonalFinance, am I on a decent track? I honestly do not know where to begin at 25 years young as a teacher. I have heard constantly about opening up Roth IRA, IRA, and 401K, etc. I do not know if that is in my budget especially if I am in Austin with a housing market that makes me dread of ever getting a mortgage.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time in reading and replying :)",finance
personalfinance,Advice for debt consolidation,"Hi Reddit, I have approximately $30K of credit card debit with interest rates ranging from 11.25% to 23% with a total minimum monthly payment of ~$700.  I've been making double payments but it doesn't feel like I'm making much progress.  Looking for some advice on the best way to deal with this.  Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Getting a mortgage with 716 credit score.,"I've been in USA for just over a year now. Started with no credit history and I just got preapproval mortgage loan. The advisor told me that my credit score is not too great. I think it was 716 or 760. The interest rate is just over 5%. He said if my score is better or I put more down then it will lower the rate. I didnt really pay attention to the score because it doesn't mean anything to me. But after reading a few posts, 700+ is a good score! Should I wait till my score increases further? Im also really doubting my judgment on whether to buy a condo in Manhattan or not. It looks like the market is cooling down and the forecast doesn't look too good! However I'm paying a lot of rent which doesn't make any sense to me. I guess it is better than losing 1/2 the value of the condo after a few months!?",finance
personalfinance,Should we take on another mortgage?,"Hi all, I'm debating whether it's a good investment to buy a co-op and rent out our house. I did some calculation on the numbers and if we were to rent out our house, which has 3 bedrooms and an attic, we will be able to collect $2500 in rent. The monthly cost of the co-op will be around $2000. We will be able to have an extra $500 every month, which is around 11% ROI. The co-op will cost us anywhere between $250k to $300k. We have enough in our bank for the 20% down payment. 

Now what I'm concerned about is taking on another mortgage. As of now, I already have a co-op which I have $200k of loan under my name. I also co-own a house with a family member, together our loan is $400k for the house. The family member makes $30K annually and I'm currently self-employed and not making a lot either. We were able to take out the previous two loans because of my previous employment. Both the co-op and the house are rented or partially rented and the rent payments cover the mortgages with a couple extra hundred dollars left every month. If we were to take out a new loan, it will be through a mortgage broker because traditional banks won't approve additional mortgages given our current financial picture. I haven't worked with one before and not sure how much the interest rate will be.

My question is, is it a good idea for us to take on another loan at this point? What are the risks? A few I could come up with are vacancies, bad tenant not paying rent and increase in property taxes. All of which are manageable since we live in a place with a lot of demand for rentals and we screen our tenants very carefully. Are there better investment options for the $60K?

Apologies for the long post. Would love to hear what everyone thinks. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,RLC product release in November!,"I have been following this project for quite some time and I am super excited about their product release in November.
They have a brand new website with loads of info on the project http://iex.ec/.

The project has a killer team and is led by two great minds in cloud computing. The team is well funded and has been recognized by the French government and the cloud computing community. The team is amping up the pace and I think will have a few massive wins to close out the year! 

**So what is RLC?**
RLC is a Blockchain-Based distributed cloud computing infrastrucutre. They have a pretty neat video explaining this [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07ojusto6s4)

For those that want to do further research I highly recommend reading their [whitepaper](https://iex.ec/app/uploads/2017/04/iExec-WPv2.0-English.pdf).


**Why Cloud Computing?**
Data and computing power are both becoming precious commodities and there are currently only 3 big players in this field AWS (Amazon), Azure (Microsoft) and Google. With the number of computers in the world sitting idly doing nothing but showing a screensaver there is no need for cloud computing to be so centralized and expensive. We don't need to bow down to these giants and hand them our data and let them hold an oligopoly in cloud computing. This is where RLC comes in, with their distributed cloud computing infrastructure. Their platform allows computing tasks to be distributed across nodes on the network using blockchain. Their aim is to decentralize cloud computing and make it more affordable and ultimately more powerful than what is currently available on the market.

**Team**
This project is led by [Dr Fedak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilles-fedak-4a303a5b/) and [Dr He](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hehaiwu/) both highly respected PhDs in the field of cloud computing. They lead a team of freakishly talented people and are about to disrupt cloud computing! Just look at this team! (https://iex.ec/about-us/)

**Recognition**
The project has been relatively kept quiet and there hasn't been much of a focus on community engagement as they were busy working on the platform itself. But with their beta product being released recently and the Essential Product release coming up the team has been recognized by local media outlets and innovation and technology organizations. They recently won the [2017 Award of Disruptive Innovation](http://iex.ec/iexec-wins-2017-award-disruptive-innovation/) and have also made appearances on one of France's biggest newspapers Le Figaro. 

The team is now focusing on adoption and reaching out to the tech community and businesses to trial the beta [product](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk).

**Partnerships**
The team has a partnership with [request](request.network) which recently completed their ICO where each stage sold out in a matter of hours!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Getting ready to start paying back 88k in student debt,"In a less than a month from now, my student loans will be leaving their grace period and I will need to start paying them back. I'm not the best with finance and loan numbers, but it's looking like that I'll have to be paying back about 88k (that number is including the interest, or at least what I'm seeing I think), split across 3 different loan companies.

I'm getting ready to speak with someone about refinancing my loans, since some of them have 9% interest rates and seeing if I can refinance for a good interest rate. 

I've never really done this kind of stuff before, and I'm a little nervous about going about it and how I should go about it. Is there anything I should specifically do or keep in mind? Is there any way to predict how bad my monthly payments will be? Is there a bank/company that's known to be better to go to in terms of loan refinancing? Sorry if I sound like a finance scrub asking all of this.",finance
gaming,Future of gaming.,"Hello r/gaming.

I'm concerned.

I'm very worried about the future of gaming. Big studios buy up the small studios and control everything. We get games that are full of microtransactions and loot boxes. It's not uncommon to pay $100+ for games. The latest installments from my favorite franchises have been huge disappointments for me. Halo 5, ME: Andromeda, I personally didn't enjoy AC Syndicate, Battlefront was promising but was full of issues, namely only one era represented and no single-player campaign. 

How long has it been since we've had a single player star wars game with a great story? EA recently shut down the Star Wars game that Visceral was working on which I was very excited for. 1313 got canned when Disney took over, Force Unleashed 3 never happened, KotOR 3 never happened. Instead we got a subscription based MMORPG in The Old Republic. 

Battlefront II promised to fix all the issues that players had with Battlefront. However, now we find about all the loot box and microtransaction drama. 

Games aren't made by people who like games anymore. They're made by business tycoons and corporations. Any passion that someone wants to put into a game gets snuffed out by greed. 

Why do you think there is such a large indie game community? Why do people buy games that are 10 year old or more on steam? Because THEY WERE GOOD GAMES. they were FUN. They were COMPLETE. They were made with PASSION. 

I'm falling into a rant. 

I don't feel excited for games anymore and it is heartbreaking. 

So, gamers of reddit. What can we do about it? Where do you see the industry going? Will we ever see the ""death"" of gaming? Will big gaming companies ever listen to the players? Will we ever see an end to microtransactions? Will couch co-op ever be a thing again? Where is gaming going?

I need your thoughts and opinions. Please be honest. Tell me how you feel and what you think. If there's anything I left out or said poorly, forgive me. I'm just frustrated with it all.",technology

personalfinance,Options when I can't pay private student loans?,"Like many in my situation, I went to college and listened to the advice of my elders and took out way more debt than I'll ever be able to handle. Since my parents supposedly made enough to ""help out"" (which they couldn't since they had more than just me to care for) many need-based grants and federal help did not happen. So I had to take out private student loans. I graduated four years ago, had a string of decent jobs that I could make payments on my loans every month. Recently I had a great job as a contractor and made enough to save up every month.  
Well, the contract ended and I'm running out of savings. I've cut off all non-essential spending, but I've got maybe a month left before I can no longer make payments on my student loans. I've talked with my loan providers, who basically say ""tough luck, pay it or we'll come after you"" which really helps nothing in the end. I'm frantically searching for work, and currently working as much as I can at my min. wage job until something else comes along. I'm even probably going to take on a second job, but still won't be able to have enough hours to pay all my loans.  
I've tried refinancing through companies like SoFi and all the others, they all say I have too much debt:income ratio (even with a cosigner) and deny my applications.  
What are my other options? I get the occasional freelance gig, but can't drive enough business up to get anything substantial going, and every time I have a great job interview I call back the next day/week and never hear from companies again.

personalfinance,Pay Extra to Mortgage or Invest,"Hello,

Curious about what PF thinks is my best bet here. 39M, married, 3 kids under 7. Home is worth about $425,000 and owe about $283,000 on a 30 year fixed mortgage at 3.75%, about 5 years in. Payment including taxes and insurance is $2090. 

We've been paying about $1,000 extra per month, all going to principal. I'm thinking about three options:

Refinance to a 15 year. This would lower my interest rate (looks like to between 3 and 3.25%), but would permanently increase the payments and we'd lose some flexibility.

Pay the minimum payment, invest the extra $1,000 in a Vanguard fund (probably the 500 index). We could then use the money in the account after 15 years or so to pay off the full amount. The benefit here is we should earn a little more on the money than we'd pay in interest, although there would be some tax liability when we did sell.

Keep doing what we are doing, and just pay the $1,000 extra a month. The benefit here is we pretty much get a guaranteed return.

So what say you, PF experts?",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell my house and use the equity to wipe out my student loans?,"I am considering selling my house to use the equity to pay off my student loans and credit card debts. It is a foreclose I bought 4 years ago at the bottom of the market, and I’ve put a lot of a lot of time and equity into rehabbing the house. A very conservative estimate would put my equity around $50k, but using local comparable homes or Zillow estimate could put the equity closer to $80k-$100k+. It's been my primary residence for 4 years so I think I'm clear of any capital gains (USA-Michigan).

&amp;nbsp;

Mortgage details:

Principal balance: $122k

Interest rate: 4.125% fixed

~27 years left.

&amp;nbsp;

Student Loans:

Principal balance: $50k

Interest rate: 5.75% fixed

8 years left at current payment rate.

&amp;nbsp;

I also have about $14k credit card debt that I’ve been chipping away at (divorce woes!), interest ~17%.

&amp;nbsp;

The idea of paying off my student loans is very enticing. It’s always felt like a monkey on my back, and having the real possibility of paying them off and freeing up $700/mo in my budget sounds amazing. Just reallocating the SL payment, I could easily save another decent down payment in 24-48 months if apartment life was miserable. But I I don't have any big concerns going to an apartment or rented house, I could find something nice for the same as my current mortgage payment. No kids/wife/dog or anything to worry about.


Any downsides to selling? Is there some kind of equity/refinance thing that makes more sense?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bitconnect will give cryptocurrency a bad reputation when it crashes... don't let this happen,"So you see my opionion on this project above. This an obvious red-flag project. 

Of course it works at the moment. And of course somebody will make money from it. 

1%-2% interest income per day, I took this information from the website.  

But, you can not get out whenever you want. You are locking your money up. They are claiming, there is a bot, that makes profitable trades on a daily base, but for me, this is pure BULLSh**... 
The interest rates are paid from the new incoming money. It is soooo much a scam.  

This is a bubble maker coin and greedy people are buying it, knowing that there will be a crash... knowing it but arrogantly thinking that they are smarter than most people and will cash out before the crash. Some will, most won't... 

Actually, I would not even care. I would say, let them play, role the dices. And the only winner will be the bank in the end... or in this case, the team behind bitconnect.  
BUT I do care!! I do care because this is the kind of bullsh*** (excuse me) that will make people lose a lot of money. It got a 1.5$ billion marketcap. This is nothing we can go and ignore because when it crashes, there will be people yelling for regulation. 
In german we would say, Das gibt den Kritikern ordentlich Wasser auf die Mühlen (it will support criticism of crypto) and can give cause some serious up and downs in the market.  

The bottom line is, we should not stay calm and wait for the moment when we can tell people ""I said it before"". We have to understand us ALL as a big crypto family... if you are BCH or BTC enthusiast, if you love ETH or ETC, we will sit in the same boat when regulations strike in. 

I don't want to see cryptos regulated strictly, but I think Bitconnect has the potential to cause some serious issues. 

I beg you all DESPERATELY(!!!) Do not buy bitconnect. 
Do not tell people to do their on research, maybe the greed will win afterwards. 
If you are kind of an influencer... spread those words.

Bitcoin,"What will happen to gold, silver and Bitcoin during the next economic crisis.","Here are some thoughts on how this might play out. Take it with a grain of salt but try to understand the fundamentals which are sound.

If you look at the 2008 crisis you will see gold and particularly silver actually dumped hard when the crisis hit. Silver going to $9!  The reason is simple; most assets will decline as stocks collapse as they need to liquidate assets to bail out their ugly positions.

Stocks right now are a parking lot for low interest rate money. As interest rates get bumped (q4 / q1 q2 2018) stocks will deflate and perhaps violently. Existing bonds will be dumped for newer issued bonds at higher rates. There will be no escaping this deflationary spiral other than parking in dollars as all assets accept one will be actively pumped.

Bitcoin however is not held by a majority of people invested in stocks. Some yes but a bulk of crypto investors are crypto investors and not positioned too heavy into stocks. This means while some will liquidate crypto to cover margin calls etc Most will not.  Crypto and especially bitcoin will very likely not fall very far when the next crisis hits.  

This will not go unnoticed by those scrambling to find a new parking lot for their rapidly deflating assets.  Capital will flow into crypto like you have never seen it. Metals will not bounce until the initial crisis bottoms and knee jerk stimulus is put into place. By this time many gold bugs will have capitulated and shifted a lot of wealth into crypto.  If Bitcoin had a market cap of $7Trillion like gold we might not see a pump during deflation as bitcoin is a commodity and all commodities will be falling in price.  What is different however is bitcoin is $100B and the amount of capital looking for a flight to safety will be $15 Trillion or more. With less than 8 million bitcoins liquid and for sale we will likely see a giant premium as it sucks in $1T to $2T of homeless scared money. 

Bitcoin will likely skyrocket to $75,000 or more before crashing back to earth at maybe $20,000 and quickly rising to a stable $35,000

Anyway that's my thoughts of q1 to q3 2018 when I think a massive deflationary collapse will happen.  As the criminal oligarchs in power freak out they will quickly pump liquidity back into the markets at a rate that will outpace confidence causing hyper inflation which will then call gold, silver and yes bitcoin again to make meteoric rises albeit offset slightly by a then plummeting dollar valuation.   The only way 'the state' and their bank cartels will be able to hold onto control will be to use bitcoin as a reserve currency so look for bitcoin market cap to reach a minimum of $5T by 2020 and a corresponding price of $250k which will be worth around $125k of today's money.

Gonna be wild.. 
Metal bugs should liquidate positions and buy bitcoin and if they like, buy some metals after they are 'halved' after the crisis hits bottom.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,23 with 76 college credits can I afford to finish right now?,"I've made some mistakes in my life financially or otherwise I know that myself I would appreciate it if the replies only contained help and not reminders of my mistakes

Anyway 

So I'll start with a little background:

I went to an Early College High School Program. All my teachers had their Master's Degree so most of our classes counted for double credit. We also attended classes in the local community college for free. I graduated with 60 college credits and an AA in General Studies. 
I was moderately active in high school:
 
* Member of National Honor Society
* National Technical Honor Society
* UIL MAth Club (Number Sense)
* Business Professionals of America (4th place in Advanced Spreadsheet Applications in state competition Texas - Qualified for Nationals)
* National Hispanic Merit Scholar

I applied to scholarships but did not receive any. I was accepted in University of California, San Diego but could not afford tuition (~$40k/semester) so I decided to stay home to attend the local university(~$3K/semester). I skipped my first semester of school to save up money for tuition and began Spring 2013. In all honesty it did go very well as I couldn't handle full time work (my parents needed help paying bills) and full time school. In the semester of Fall 2013 I told my advisor I would be skipping school to work for more tuition money and he persuaded me to apply for financial aid as I would most likely qualify, if not it was in my best interest to take out a federal student loan. Since it was very close to the start of the semester he told me to take out an Emergency Loan and pay it back with the financial aid money. I did not qualify for any aid since my dad is retired and gets social security so we have ""too much income"". As of today i still owe the university about $2500.

Since then I've attended community college whenever I could afford to pay on my own. I think it's also important to note other trouble I've gotten into in that time:

Got arrested in 2014 for minor possession of marijuana (placed in and finished deferred probation)
I've accumulated about $2000 in credit card debt
Currently paying back student loans even though I've been attending community college mostly part time
I have terrible credit under 600

I am currently making $11 an hour working as line cook in Texas. I give half my paycheck to my parents to help them pay bills. After this semester I will have 82/120 credits for my Electrical Engineering degree.

What's my best option from here?
Should I focus on paying back my credit card debt and my student loans?
Everyone in my city tells me my best option is to join the military, but is it? I would honestly prefer not go but I'll do whatever it takes to finish at this point
if I do will anyone hire me as a 29/30 year old engineer? (4 years of service + 2 years to finish school)
will anyone hire me period because of my record?

personalfinance,"Girlfriend's family is going to lose the house within a few years, figuring out options.","Sorry in advance for the wall of text, made a throwaway for obvious reasons.

So ive been dating my girlfriend for a few years now and I know this is going to be the girl I marry so this will effect both of us and our future. Heres the backstory for her family and how it came to this.

So my GF's family live in a up and coming gentrified neighborhood where property is only going up. The neighborhood is in Queens, NY. They've lived there almost their whole life (around 30+ years) and because of bad financial decisions in the past they still have not paid off the house. In a nutshell the mother was the one in control of the finances and in the past she tried to do some get rich quick schemes where in the end she lost 100k the first time and 150k the 2nd time. She also ruined her credit as well as her husband's since she tried to file for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is not approved yet from what I'm told. They had to refinance the house twice and right now they have a crazy high interest rate. Their lawyer said at the rate they're going with the monthly payments they are going to lose the house within a few years. It also doesn't help that she has an older brother who pretty much leeches money off their mom. But thats a whole different story. I already know he has to be cut off.

Her parents are at the age (70) where they are about to retire soon. I would say they have anywhere between 3-5 years at the most. They dont have much of a savings and only have a small pension. Her family were trying to see if my gf could be a guarantor for the house so they could refinance the house under a different bank with a lower interest rate since she has great credit. She got a quote today from 2 banks and it would cut the monthly payment almost in half.  I would be all for it but the fact that her parents are at that age where they will retire or god forbid, get sick, it would leave my gf and myself stuck with the monthly payments. The quote we received if she were a guarantor would be 3.2-4.2k/month depending on the bank. The lower payment would require her to have a full time job (shes currently free lancing at the moment as a graphic/ux designer) with a salary of at least 85k. 

I'm not sure what to do. I want to help her family out and tell her yes but I don't want us to drown also. She feels the same way. I know if she signs up for this, we would be responsible for almost half the loan term which means it would be really difficult for us if we wanted to buy a house ourselves in the future. At best the house could probably be paid off within 12 years but thats being optimistic. Thankfully at this moment both of us still live at home so we don't have any crazy big expenses but I know soon we want to get our own place. I know if we did this it would be really hard to move out. I dont want them to lose the house but at this point I'm not sure what options we have. Any advice?",finance

My bills are also behind, every bill i have now (rent, electricity, Comcast, cell phone) is late and i cant seem to get out of the vicious cycle of late fees and having no money.

I make 9.10 an hour at 38 hours a week, and i also have a side contracting job where i will receive $1,200 in wages sometime in the next two weeks. After that, i will take that same contracting job for the January-May season where wages haven't been negotiated yet, but i am hoping to receive $400 per month guaranteed.

personalfinance,Laurel Road vs Earnest,"Hey /r/personalfinance!

I just recently applied for student loan refinance for my two private student loans. I received approval from both Earnest &amp; Laurel Road and I am trying to decide which one to go with. They both offered very similar interest rates: Laurel Road 5.10% and Earnest 5.15%. Both have the same autopay discount (.25%), so it should end up being 4.85% for Laurel Road and 4.90% for Earnest. These are also both fixed rates, which I prefer just so I know it won't go up.

Considering my loans are currently at 6.99% for $11,500 and 8.74% for $11,000, I think these rates are really good and should save me something like $25-$30 a month in interest. However, I'm just not sure which company to go with, so I'm looking to see if anyone here has used either company before and what the experience with them has been.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bitconnect could potentially have a 'successful' pyramid scheme structure.,"*Let me first start of by saying that it's not really questionable if Bitconnect is a pyramid scheme or not. It 100% is.*

Whilst I feel Bitconnect is very clearly a pyramid scheme, it actually could pull off one of the most profitable pyramid schemes in history, even with paying back all of it's 'investors.'

A typical pyramid scheme collapses because new investors eventually dry up and therefore, not enough money comes in to pay the old investors. 

However, with Cryptocurrencies, this isn't as big of a problem than normal FIAT pyramid schemes purely because of the growth in price we've seen with most of the top cryptocurrencies. For example, if Bitconnect was given 1 bitcoin as an investment 30 days ago, they were provided around $3973. 30 days later (today), the $3973 they were given, is now worth around $5952. 

That's around a $49.81% increase in value. Based on those numbers, they could provide that investor 1.66% daily returns in the last month whilst still breaking even. Obviously, not every month see's a 50% increase in Bitcoin value, but spread over a year or many years, the monthly returns have been extremely high.

(Yes, a traditional FIAT pyramid scheme could invest in stocks and use those returns to pay back investors, but they do not see the massive scale in profits that cryptocurrencies have been seeing, so burn out and run out of funds.)

Here's what I see happening. Bitconnect is going to continue to grow for quite a while. You will then see them taper off things like like the high referral bonuses. They will reduce the payout dramatically. You will then see them slowly taper off the amount of daily returns. Still providing returns daily so people see money coming in, but on average, the daily rate lowering. You have to remember they have never shown their 'trading bot' so it's pretty obvious they just pull a daily rate out of their backside currently. 

With the rate that Bitcoin has being going up but their daily rate going down, they could get to a stage where their gains in value outway the payments owed to investors. 

This would allow them to pay back all the original investors and walk away with tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. There is no reason (as far as I can see) why this would fail, if the price of Bitcoin etc continue to rise as they have done so. You also have to consider how long they lock in investment until you can withdraw. This is a massive advantage for them, for when they decide to switch to lower interest rates. It gives them so much lee-way, when it comes to them cashing out.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to Pay for Grad School in a healthcare field,"I am a married 28yo going back to school for a doctorate in nurse anesthesia in January. It is a 3-yr program and I absolutely will not be able to work for the last 2.5 years of the program. When I get out, my earning potential will be &gt;130k starting, so (assuming financial stability for 2.5 years) I should be able to repay loans. However, I’m not sure of the best loans to pursue. 

My husband makes 75k currently and will work the entire time. We currently have about 30k in savings (not including 401k) and 30k in debt from undergrad (with no interest rate &gt;5%); some are private and will still be in repayment despite my return to school. I would like my husband to continue to max-out his 401k during school, if possible, but I’m not sure that is the best plan. I wasn’t raised by the most financially responsible people and my husband came from an extremely well-off family. So I’m nervous that he is not sufficiently conservative financially and that I am not sufficiently knowledgeable. I am in-state for my program so it’s pretty affordable (approx. 16k/yr), but we will have living expenses for that time. We live in a *VERY* expensive area. We both have excellent credit.

Grad plus loans seems like they are pretty expensive interest-rate wise. My program offers scholarships but they aren’t available until later semesters and are fairly minimal (&lt;$1000/semester). I am reluctant to deplete our current savings because I view it as an emergency fund, but I also would like to avoid taking out a lot of high-risk or expensive loans. 

What should I do? Is GradPlus my best bet? Should I spend down some of our savings to make for the first semester (8k due in January)? Is there anything I’m missing? Are there healthcare-related loan options I’m missing?

Just re-entered AD military, so I have a steady paycheck (O-1E, 5 years: $3818 base pay + $1371 Housing allowance monthly)

33.5K Federal Student Loans (3.5-4.5%). Monthly payment is $371. I am paid ahead about 5 months

Next to nothing in the way of savings or retirement accounts, but also no other debts. I blew through all of that staying afloat for the few years I was out of the service and in-college.

I've been aggressive with my loans trying to get it down to $25K, so I can just wipe all my student debt and effectively reduce the interest rate.

Is that a good strategy? Should I even bother contributing to my TSP at this stage?

After 10 years of consecutive payments, my debt will have been paid off, and there wouldn't be anything left to forgive, and I would have paid a good amount extra in interest.

personalfinance,Making plans to pay off ~$5k credit card debt in the next few months.

I'm looking at a lot of overtime work coming up during the holidays, and my wife is working full-time as well.

There's no good excuse for having $5k of credit card debt (and student loans on top of it) but we're both ready to eliminate the expense. The only approach I've used is to simply pay more than the minimum balance every month. Logically, we'll focus on the card with the highest interest rate first.

Are there any other solutions that would be better? Should we look into transferring the debt onto a single card? Should we close the accounts after paying them off? Is this a good opportunity to check out /r/churning?

personalfinance,"(US) Making a large purchase (engagement ring), should I put it all on a 0% APR credit card or split it with the ring companies 0% APR financing offer","Hi guys, I'm in the process of buying an engagement ring (**planning to spend ~$8,500**) and am wondering what would be the best way to spread the cost in terms of my credit score. 

**Background info**

* 721 credit score

* 6% credit card use with $66,300 credit limit

* 2 hard inquiry - 1 from April of 2016 and the other from this month

* $7,000 in student loans at 5.31% interest rate which I have to start paying off in Feb 2018

* The 2 0% APR cards I have the option of using are 1) $10,500 limit, no interest rate till 12/2018 and 2) $2,800 limit, no interest rate till 07/2018

* Financing option from the ring company is 0% APR for 6 months from purchase. Will probably be till 05/2018

* I have a stable, well paying job in tech in a low COL city (relatively)

**Options**

* Pay for the entire ring on the $10,500 credit card *(18% credit card use)*

* Split the cost over the 2 0% APR credit cards *(18% credit card use)*

* Split the cost between 1 (or 2) credit cards and the financing option with the ring company. This would require the ring company making a hard inquiry to determine what credit limit they'll give me *(3 hard inquiries, 12% credit card use)*


So what would be the best option here? If I use solely credit cards for this purchase my credit card use will jump to 18% and will slowly decrease from there over the course of next year. I know that credit card use has a huge impact on your credit score so I'm not sure how bad this will impact it.

On the other hand, I already have 2 hard inquiries on account and a 3rd will put me in a worse tier (according to credit karma). I know hard inquiries are low impact on your credit score compared to credit card use and the loan with the ring company won't fall under my credit card use. However, with my budgeted plan I can only borrow $4,000 from the ring company (with the ability to pay it back in time) and this will only bring my credit card use down to 12% which is still higher than the 9% cut off they show on credit karma.

Also, I've already budgeted how to pay each of these off so no need to worry about missing any of the 0% APR periods. I'm solely looking at the best option for right now.

Thanks!

Edit: I also know how much to spend on a ring can be a controversial topic but this is something I have already decided on after much thought. I appreciate everyone respecting my opinion :)",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell all my stocks to pay off my auto loan?,"hi reddit.

A while back, I bought a new truck w/ about $19.5k to go (first time buyer). At the current rate of 4.5% interest, it'd take me 4.5 yrs to pay it off, if not longer.

After my rent, bill, gas, groceries, and helping my parents,.. I'm left w/ barely $200 bucks each month for anything. And often, there'd be some surprise expense too. In short I am penniless end of each month.

Rent cannot be helped, so there isn't much I could do about that.

My employer offers me ESPP, and I have about $10k in my eTrade account (vested amount).

My auto loans payment I owe is $400/mo which is a new bill for me. Before I bought my new truck, my life was a lot more easy to breathe, and I had some money I could save each month, or spend for needs. I wasn't checking my bank account every day, or worrying if I have to buy a meal at work. My life had some semblance of peace.

I was wondering, if I should sell all of my stocks and try to pay off as much I could on my auto loan, so that I could ask for a lower monthly payment and interest rate for the rest of the 9.5k? I need some advice on this.

A little bit about the $10k. It is my *only* savings. I contribute 15% of each of my paycheck to my ESPP. I contribute 10% to my 401k. I have no other debts other than my auto loan. I am 34/single male.

Am I making it work each month? Yes, I am. I have no family of my own, except that I support my parents. $200/mo to each of them. I have been managing ok every month for almost a year and a half now with the new truck payments, so it's not really that new. I am not broke. I'm a little tight every month, and thrifty as opposed to my life before. But the overall quality of my life *(which isn't very much to begin with)* has gone down a ton, and I'm a bit unhappy.

investing,Russia abounds with favorable investment opportunities,"The Russian economy has already added significantly, recovering from the fall in oil prices and the national currency rate in 2014. Positive dynamics developed slowly, but steadily, and inflation was much lower than the projected level. In conditions of stable oil prices, lower inflation and diversification of the economy, progress should continue, despite the difficult economic and political conditions. While long-standing hopes for a relaxation of tensions between the US and Russia are likely to collapse again. And the most preferred objects of investment in the financial, energy and technology sectors are Sberbank, Gazprom and Yandex, as well as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (EEM) and Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (RSX).
	The recent reduction in the rates of the CBR once again proves that inflation in Russia is below the forecasts, and the economy is on the path of recovery. In March, the Central Bank surprised the markets, unexpectedly reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points to 9.75%. At the same time, only 11 of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 25-point decrease - this decision was made for the first time since September (4 meetings of the board of directors were held during this period). It is very likely that inflation has been under control since the spring of 2017, falling from a peak of 17% to some 4.6%, while the economy dominated by the oil industry is again experiencing growth, which is supported by stable the price of oil. There is a high probability that oil prices will recover steadily.
	Russia cut its crude oil production in March, approaching the volume agreed upon with OPEC as the deadline expires. Russia is the largest of the 11 non-OPEC oil-producing countries that fulfill the agreement reached with OPEC to reduce oil supplies to a total of 1,800,000 barrels per day in order to eliminate the global satiety of the market.
	The base price of Brent oil looks comfortable at $ 50 against the backdrop of an agreement with OPEC, which serves as a solid foundation, and assurances of Russia about continuing production cuts. The agreement between OPEC and partners on the production of 1,800,000 bpd is not for the market aimed at reducing excess reserves in the world after a three-year abundance and is expected to last 6 months before the end of June, but a number of OPEC member countries indicate a possible need to extend it. If Saudi Arabia, which cuts touched the most, will affect OPEC, and the production of oil shale in the US will continue to grow, the agreement may not be renewed.
	The discussion of the policy of detente seems to have started and ended. The worst scenario is taken into account - the absence of changes in the relationship. We applauded Trump's reasoning during the election campaign to improve relations with Russia, but deeply entrenched political and bureaucratic interests will vehemently fight against his desire to put this into practice. There are serious obstacles to a consensus for the lifting of sanctions. One can agree with Jim Rogers, who believes that the Russian market is hated, and investors are profitable to buy hated and unpopular markets. The Trump administration has just started working, and the easing of sanctions can still come. But even if sanctions are not weakened, it will be a positive moment, as it makes the Russian economy develop domestic markets and industry.
	By the end of 2016, the Russian economy began to grow again after a recession that lasted seven quarters in a row since the fall in oil prices in 2014. GDP grew by 0.3% compared to the previous year in the fourth quarter, but fell by 0.2% for the whole year. GDP growth in 2017 is expected to be within 1 - 2%.
	The Central Bank ""sent"" the ruble to free navigation in order to facilitate the adoption by companies of measures to counter external influence and help the economy to withstand a decline in the conditions of Western sanctions. Unlike the crisis of 2008-2009, when GDP fell by more than 10%, the decline over the past two years was just over 3% at comparable prices.
	For further economic growth, investment and domestic consumption are needed. While recovery in real terms and aggregate net income will support consumption, investments may be limited to companies' revenues. This year, the ruble is among the top 3 most successful currencies in the world, continuing the success of the best in its history in 2016, while the Central Bank continues the concept of short-term speculation.
	In a statement after the decision to lower the interest rate, the Central Bank indicated that the risk of failure to reach the target target for inflation by 4% has decreased, there is the possibility of further lowering of rates in the 3rd and 4th quarters, with an increase in the projected GDP growth in 2017 to 1 - 1.5%: ""The Central Bank recognizes the possibility of a gradual decrease in the key rate in the second and third quarters,"" the bank said in a statement. At the same time, it is noted that the monetary policy of the bank will remain moderately tight, since inflation risks have diminished, but still remain high. The decrease in the inflation rate exceeds forecasts, the forecasted inflation continues to decline, economic activity is resumed. Economic growth also occurs with a higher rate than forecasted - this follows from the statement of the bank. The Central Bank of Russia forecasts GDP growth this year by 1 - 1.5% and in 2018 - 2019. on 1 - 2%.
	Today, Russia has one of the highest real interest rates among the leading emerging market countries, and even with a forecasted moderate GDP growth of 1 to 1.5%, there are significant prospects for its decline. Russian bonds of the five-year loan stably hold at 8.11%, while the MICEX index fell slightly (by 0.4%).
	With cooperation in the field of production between OPEC countries and their partners, which is likely to continue, with the possibility of prolongation of agreements on extraction and increasing risks of escalation of hostilities in connection with the situation around Syria and North Korea, it is quite possible that the price of brand oil Brent should be stable and be in the range from 40 to 50 $. Russia cut its crude oil production in March, approaching the volume agreed upon with OPEC as the deadline expires.
	If Saudi Arabia, which cuts touched the most, will affect OPEC, and the production of oil shale in the US will continue to grow, then the agreement may not be renewed. But the risks of compliance with the quota and the extension of the agreement still remain. As OPEC begins to discuss the extension of production cuts - in part, in order to withstand mass supplies from the US, Venezuela's role in the world market is growing. But to convince the financially weak leader of this country about reducing the extraction of the main resource of the country is an unpopular idea.
	Russia is the world's second largest producer of oil and gas (after Saudi Arabia), the world's 12th in terms of economy and 9th in terms of population. At the same time, Russia is the largest country in the world, its area is almost equal to the areas of the United States and Canada combined. And we must not forget that Russia, along with the US, is a nuclear superpower, as well as that this country is replete with favorable investment opportunities.
	And there is also a ""golden"" nuance. It is known that today Russia occupies the third place in the world for gold production with a rate of 250 metric tons per year, and in terms of gold reserves it is on the 6th place in the world (1,460 metric tons). The largest volumes of gold reserves are owned only by the central banks of the United States, Germany, Italy, France and China.
Obviously, Russia buys gold not for the sake of fun: it is clear that this long-term strategic decision was made before the collapse of oil prices. As one Russian parliamentarian noted a few years ago, the more gold in the country, the greater independence it has in case of cataclysms with the Dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling and other reserve currencies. It can even be assumed that the BRICS countries are using growing gold reserves as a way to encourage trade with settlements in their national currency. In other words, they are trying to get rid of the dollar. Or Russia and China are really preparing for the end of the dollar era. It will be found out very soon!",finance

The standard 10 year payment plan would be about $2.1K per month, which is too high for my budget, especially when I start clerking with a reduced salary. My questions are whether I should (1) enroll in PAYE or IBR, since my salary is going to decrease substantially for 2 years, or (2) refinance with a private company to reduce my interest rates to a fixed 5% over a 15 year term with monthly payments around $1.6K.

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Ideology,"The digital gold rush is upon us and I thought it would be helpful for those that only see Bitcoin as an investment to understand the philosophical reasons to own Bitcoin. To the bitcoin warriors out there, keep doing your thing to promote this revolutionary protocol. Peace and love. 

IF you’ve only recently tuned in to the seemingly endless conversation about bitcoin, you could be forgiven for thinking that the digital currency is little more than the latest Wall Street fetish or a juiced-up version of PayPal. After all, so many headlines in the last few weeks have focused on its market price and the cool stuff you can get with it: Bitcoin breaks $1,000! Bitcoin plunges by a half! Bitcoin has a banner Black Friday! Use bitcoin to buy a ride on Richard Branson’s starship!

But all the talk about bitcoin’s value (or lack thereof) obscures the fact that it was never really meant as an investment nor primarily as a way to purchase sex toys or alpaca socks — let alone a brand-new Lamborghini. One could argue that bitcoin isn’t chiefly a commercial venture at all, a funny thing to say about a kind of online cash. To its creators and numerous disciples, bitcoin is — and always has been — a mostly ideological undertaking, more philosophy than finance.

“The ideas behind it — that’s what attracted me,” said Elizabeth Ploshay, a regular writer for Bitcoin magazine, which describes its mission as being “the most accurate and up-to-date source of information, news and commentary about bitcoin.” And if the magazine has a mission, so, too, does the subject that it covers. As Ms. Ploshay explained it, bitcoin isn’t merely money; it’s “a movement” — a crusade in the costume of a currency. Depending on whom you talk to, the goal is to unleash repressed economies, to take down global banking or to wage a war against the Federal Reserve.

For those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on Jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker — or team of hackers — working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that Napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. In a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, Nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: “The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

It was fundamentally a political document and, as such, it attracted followers among libertarian and anarchist groups who saw in bitcoin a means of removing the money supply from the grasping hands of government. In blog posts and at bitcoin conferences around the globe, these evangelists began to spread its gospel. It is only in the last few months, as bitcoin has attracted the attention of political parties, regulators and speculative investors that the narrative of bitcoin as a tool for change has been drowned out by a simpler story line: that of bitcoin as a kind of crypto-credit card — or, even more, as a digitized casino game.

“Price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin,” said Roger Ver, an early investor who is often called, in a typical movement phrase, the Bitcoin Jesus. “At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.”

While the bitcoin hype has inspired Ron Paulian dreams of evading inflation and undermining the Federal Reserve, the currency has also gained cachet among less conspicuously conservative adherents, like the founders of BitPesa, a start-up firm in Nairobi, Kenya, that plans to help Africans abroad send money to their families at home. According to the World Bank, $1.3 billion in remittances is sent each year to Kenya, a process that costs about $110 million in fees. By using bitcoin’s peer-to-peer technology to avoid banks and wire-transfer companies like Western Union, BitPesa hopes to reduce these fees by two-thirds, saving ordinary Africans $74 million annually.

You know you’re talking to a true bitcoin believer if you hear the word “disruption.” But that’s how bitcoin is seen within the broader movement: as an unruly tool with potentially transformative effects on entrenched businesses like retail payment and asset management.

“Right now in the United States, bitcoin is mainly considered a get-rich-quick scheme with a little financial privacy thrown in,” said Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the self-proclaimed center of the decentralized crusade. “But its larger implications down the road are major disruptions to certain legacy industries.”

Mr. Matonis added that the ideology of bitcoin was wide enough to accommodate people on all points on the spectrum — “from libertarian capitalists to socialists.” It not only has a following among the anti-central bank crowd, he said; it has also proved attractive to communitarians like the residents of the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, which now boasts the highest density of businesses accepting bitcoin in the world.

There are even those who see bitcoin as the ultimate alternative to the global banking system. Ryan Singer, a co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Tradehill, based in San Francisco, compared the currency to email, conjecturing that it would gradually supplant traditional banking, just as digital messaging displaced handwritten letters. “When kids wake up to the fact that they don’t need their parents’ help to create a bitcoin wallet,” Mr. Singer said, “when they can use bitcoins for free international transactions, at any hour, in every major city on the planet, then you’ll know that something has changed.”

Perhaps the best proof of bitcoin’s ideological underpinnings is that a schism has emerged in recent weeks between moderate elements in the movement who sense the necessity of cooperating with officialdom, and a more uncompromising faction that wants to keep bitcoin free from any government regulation. The hard-line bloc is exemplified by the crypto-anarchist developers of a bitcoin product called Dark Wallet, which is scheduled to be introduced next year and will include extra protections to ensure that bitcoin transactions remain secure, anonymous and difficult to trace.

“We see this as part of the total sublation of the state,” said Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet’s director, who gained fame earlier this year when he published online the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3-D printer. “I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah’s Witness, but we’ve only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues.”",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"What are some Ponzi scheme ""red flags""?","Interesting to read these thinking about Bitconnect or Bitpetite right now.

-----

Many Ponzi schemes share common characteristics. Look for these warning signs:

* **High investment returns with little or no risk**. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspicious of any ""guaranteed"" investment opportunity.
* **Overly consistent returns**. Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns. Be suspect of an investment that continues to generate regular, positive returns regardless of overall market conditions.
* **Unregistered investments**. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with the SEC or with state regulators. Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company's management, products, services, and finances.
* **Unlicensed sellers**. Federal and state securities laws require investment professionals and their firms to be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
* **Secretive and/or complex strategies**. Avoiding investments you do not understand, or for which you cannot get complete information, is a good rule of thumb.
* **Issues with paperwork**. Do not accept excuses regarding why you cannot review information about an investment in writing. Also, account statement errors and inconsistencies may be signs that funds are not being invested as promised.
* **Difficulty receiving payments**. Be suspicious if you do not receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out your investment. Keep in mind that Ponzi scheme promoters routinely encourage participants to ""roll over"" investments and sometimes promise returns offering even higher returns on the amount rolled over.

ethereum,dApple,"People first started hearing about the dApple protocol in 2020. At first it was just a website where you could buy remarkably high quality Apple Watch bands, but quickly it started to carry almost every accessory Apple sold. These weren’t knockoffs - they had the exact same quality and design as the real things, but they were sold online for 30% of the price. dApple became extremely popular in Asia and shortly thereafter the United States. Normally Apple Inc. would have sued to shut the site down, but because it was anonymously hosted on IPFS there was no one to sue and no server to disconnect.

After a few months it was discovered that Apple suppliers in Asia had started selling chips, cases, and batteries on blockchain supply chain networks, which they loved because they got paid instantly and enjoyed tremendous volume. The buyers, who assembled these components into final products, were anonymous, and the packages were routed through a distributed delivery network that didn’t keep records so they were impossible to trace. Because of their large fabrication centers, the Chinese government was able to trace the chips back to a handful of manufacturers and forced them to stop, which dried up supply on dApple for most devices. The cases and bands couldn’t be tracked back to a single manufacturer, but some were suspected. 

A little less than a year later, dApple products started appearing again. This time, authorities weren’t able to locate any infringing factories, so they couldn't stop the flow of these fake Apple products at the source. It was believed that fabrication centers had been set up in the Ukraine, although these were just rumors. Luckily for Apple Inc., the best products available on dApple were AirPods and speakers - none of the crown jewel flagship products were at risk.  

A few years later, an entire ecosystem around the dApple protocol was humming. A couple of Apple Inc. engineers had been caught and sentenced to prison for 25 years for copying the iOS source code to IPFS, but once it was leaked Apple Inc. wasn’t able to hide it. Quickly, anonymous online hacking communities modified the iOS software to work on non-Apple Inc. hardware, and dApple iPhones and iPads were launched. These devices were truly identical to Apple Inc. products in just about every way (except price), and they exploded in popularity.
Over the following months, a cat-and-mouse game ensued between the dApple ecosystem and Apple, Inc. Apple Inc. quickly banned these dApple devices from accessing iCloud services, but in an amazing 10 days the dApple anonymous hacker community had rebuilt the entire service suite and provided it through smart contracts for dApple devices. Every iOS update Apple Inc. released was cracked by dApple hackers in record time. The dApple protocol posted $100 million smart-contract bounties for forged e-sim numbers so devices could connect to cellular networks, which Apple Inc. had successfully sued for supporting illegal devices. 

This whack-a-mole battle for Apple Inc. carried on endlessly. Every time Apple Inc. found something to block or stop, the dApple community figured out a workaround in amazing time. Every new product that Apple Inc. released became available on dApple just a few months later. Because they were sent through distributed package-routing networks of millions of people managed by smart contracts, authorities had no way to stop products from getting to customers. Executives at Apple Inc. began to suspect that employees at the company were secretly leaking secrets to dApple hackers in return for cryptocurrencies. At one point, a serious proposal was floated to require all Apple Inc. employees to regularly submit bank and credit card data to ensure they weren’t having unexplainable windfalls. 

By 2024, Apple Inc. was really feeling the heat. Their revenues were down 40% y/y, and shareholders were demanding action. Apple Inc. executives declared all-out war against dApple, and lobbied governments around the world to assist them in stopping the sale and, in an unprecedented step, use of illegal devices and software. Apple Inc. wasn’t the only company in dire financial straits and begging the government for help.. pharmaceutical companies’ patented drugs were being sold in online markets, the entertainment industry’s content was perpetually uploaded to IPFS and pirated by billions of people, banks were losing depositors in droves as the demand for cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. It seemed that every great industry and profitable business was under attack. The federal government was in full agreement that drastic action had to be taken to save American industries, so it was declared that the possession of illegal devices and the installation of any unauthorized browsers or software would be considered a criminal offense. Border guards, police, even teachers in schools were given authorization to verify devices’ authenticity and scan for illegal software. 

Only 3 months after passage of the American Industries Protection Act (AIPA), massive protests were sweeping the nation. 150,000 children and young adults had already been found in possession of illegal devices and software, and families refused to pay the fines. An impasse between the American people and its businesses was at hand. Under severe pressure, the President ordered suspension AIPA enforcement while the matter could be considered further. Expert panels were convened and every solution imaginable was considered. In addition to industries, governments were also struggling due to rapidly falling tax revenues. It was impossible to levy sales or income taxes on payments that couldn’t be tracked.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,My elderly father fell for a scam that wiped out his savings ($10K+). Does he have any recourse?,"Long story short:  my dad's cousin's Facebook was hacked and my dad received a message from his ""cousin"" talking about how she got a federal grant to assist the elderly, and told him to connect with this guy (Who we'll call Jagweed for the rest of this post) to get his own grant. 


Through messenger, my dad communicated with Jagweed, who had my dad buy a TON of iTunes gift cards and send Jagweed pictures of the codes on the backs.  My dad wouldn't tell me the exact amount, but I know it had to be in excess of $10,000 and totally wiped out his savings.  My dad has identify theft insurance and already contacted them, but they can't help him with this issue.  My dad usually runs stuff like this by me before acting, so I could have prevented it, but I was out of state and out of cell phone service for two weeks.

personalfinance,Tax/Student Loan Planning,"I hope this is the correct place for advice. I'm trying to figure out whether it is better for my wife and I to file jointly or separately this year. Background:
We were married in June. I make ~$68k per year. Wife makes ~$34k per year. (She has overtime so it varies) I owe ~$200k @7.5% for undergrad + grad school to the feds. (On Income Based Repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness) Wife owes nothing in student loans.
Our deductions are as follows: My student loan deduction We also have the option of funding our traditional IRAs to minimize tax burden.
In filing as a single person, it was always in my best interest to maximize IRA and student loan deduction because that minimized my student loan payments (I have ~5 years before the balance is forgiven).
I'm not clear on the rules for the married life balance. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
If I'm reading the rules correctly: If we file jointly we'll qualify for a partial IRA deduction (aka around $2,750) but if we file separately, we'll give up the IRA deduction. Further, if we file jointly, IBR payment would be about $760 per month, but if we file separately it'll be around $450. Is that right?
If so, it looks like I'm in the small minority where filing separately actually saves me money (about $1k over 12 months).",finance

I am currently in the midst of a crisis because I have a parent who is less competent than the she thinks she is due to a degenerative disease and who lives in a large city far away from me.  She has a bad habit of firing caregivers, going through red lights on major roadways and knocking off other people’s and her own side-view mirrors.  So you see that time is of the essence.  My siblings cannot take care of her so I must decide whether I can leave my job and work for myself part-time and even if I can retire shortly thereafter. I would appreciate anyone’s advice.

Emergency Funds: $50,000 in savings, most of which I expect to place in my taxable bond fund which I kind of consider an emergency reserve anyway.
Debt: None

Tax Rate: 25% Federal, 6.45% State
State: NY
Age: 48
Desired Asset Allocation: 80-85% stocks/15-20% bonds

Current Assets

I co-own an apartment building that is free and clear, in a desirable area of a large city that brings in $40,000 after expenses and before taxes.  We don’t plan to sell this because capital gains tax would be significant.

I own an apartment in a suburb with a long term tenant that nets me about $8,000/year.  I wouldn’t sell it unless the value went up considerably.  Right now, it’s earning about 6.7%.

Total Stock: $94,072
Total Bond: $25,172

Pensions
NY State (Very solvent): About $450/month starting at 62
Other insolvent pension: About $150/month starting at 65

Social Security
If I work part time until 60 and earn around $40,000/year, I will receive approximately $2400/month at 70.  If I stop working completely, it will be around $1,400.

EXPENSES: Approximately $80,000/year

I currently live in a rent-controlled apartment in NYC with my SO with whom I split all costs, in other words, cohabitation gives me another $10,000/year.   Next year, our rent will be about $1500/month.  I don’t have a car and obviously don’t need to worry about paying for upkeep on residence.  I have $10,000 in reserve for apartment bldg. for emergencies.

My current expenses are actually closer to $50,000/year but I gave myself a lot of leeway because:

•	I’ll be self-employed=more taxes,
•	I’ll be flying between my city and my mother’s on a monthly basis,
•	I’ll have to pay for my own insurance, approximately $600/month,
•	I would like to travel a lot more, but I don’t know how much more and how much it will cost.

I have a long term care policy that covers $200/day for three years that costs $600/year.  My health is excellent.

In addition to insurance on my on apartment and properties, I have an umbrella insurance policy for $2,000,000, which includes my and my business partners’ properties, apartment, and eventually (and hopefully), my mother’s.   It’s through AAIC and costs about $1,000/year.

Questions

1.	Would it be feasible for me to work part-time and earn about $35,000-40,000/year?  This is my initial plan.  I would live off the real estate and my earned income until 60, by which time I would hope that the amount in the taxable account would double.
2.	Would it be feasible for me to retire?  I really don’t want to because I like what I do.  I’m just curious.  Firecalc and cFireSim say I can.
3.	The apartment building is in my mother’s city.  My mother has property in trust for her children in this same city.  If my mother gives me power of attorney, would I be able to deduct my flights and transportation related expenses from my taxes?
4.	Is $10,000 enough of a reserve for a ten-unit apartment building?  We also average about $3,000/month to pay for expenses.
5.	Is this umbrella policy expensive for a commercial policy?
6.	Should I increase my bond holdings beyond 15% even though my properties could pay more than half of my expenses?  We don’t have any trouble finding tenants.  

I was planning on leaving my job at 50 and working part time.  If I worked until that point, I’d probably be able to save another $50,000 or so, which would constitute a small percentage of my net worth if I multiplied my yearly rental income by 30 (3.3% SWR).  Right now, I’d just like to make it until the end of the year.  Thank you very much for your help!",finance

My SO and I are married and 26 years old with about $30000 in CC debt largely due to eating out all the time and buying round trip Amtrak tickets every other week to see my sick mother while I was finishing up grad school.


I recently started my first full time teaching job in September and my SO is currently a full time student majoring in aviation who is searching for a job.
We are committed on working towards this debt and have made necessary lifestyle changes(stopped eating out,cancelled almost all subscriptions, cut the CCs, etc.) 

We started following the snowball method by paying off the smallest balance and was wondering if there is anything else we can do. Any criticisms/suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

-Selling our cars is not an option at the moment as both of our commutes are about 40 minutes away. 

-We have about $6500 in savings which we want to use to pay down some of this debt. 

-SO has a few thousand in various Cryptos (BTC/ETH/VTC etc) that we would prefer to keep holding

-I work at a understaffed/underfunded charter school in a low income neighborhood with about 30+ kids in my classroom, I get to work at 7AM and usually don't leave until 7~8PM due to the workload so picking up a second job will be very difficult at the moment.

######THE NEM TECHNOLOGY


- [White paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/NEM_techRef.pdf)
- Proof of Importance
 - Different from PoW and PoS
 - Higher importance score gives a higher chance to harvest a block
 - Need 10k XEM vested (explained below) to get a POI score, otherwise PoI score is 0
 - The amount required to be vested can be changed in future if necessary
 - Algorithms make it so scores cannot be manipulated or gamed
 - More useful than just harvesting – a form of reputation
 - Can be used for voting and preventing spam



- Harvesting

 - Harvesting in NEM is the process of generating blocks and earning the transaction fees in that block as a reward for the contributed work. The PoI (Proof-of-Importance) algorithm determines who is allowed to generate a block (or more precisely: which generated block is considered as valid).
 - Account connects to super node to harvest.
 - When a new block is created, harvesting account gets the fees.
 - In order to be eligible for harvesting, the 10,000 XEM in your account must be vested. “Vested” means that the XEM have remained in your account for a certain number of days. (Usually a couple of weeks, depending on the amount.) 10% of unvested balance gets moved to vested balance per day adding to your vested balance.
 - A one-time fee of 6 XEM is required to start harvesting.
 - Harvesting block difficulty is kept within certain limits and fluctuates with a cap of 5%.
 - See page 17 of Technical Reference (white paper) for more detail
 - You can turn of PC with delegated harvesting. No hardware is required to harvest.
 - Separate account is created for delegated harvesting that connects to main account. Private key of main account is not exposed as the key of the proxy/created account is used to harvest. That proxy account harvests with 0 XEM (so no funds can be stolen), but uses the PoI of main account.  Fees collected get sent straight to main account. 

- **Security**

- *“Sybil Attacks” were taken into consideration, PoI is Sybil resistant with below*

 - NCDawareRank (Similar to PageRank)
 - Send portions of its balance to other accounts and send all of that XEM back to main account. PoI score adjusts for this. Whales and spammers would gain very little PoI for this and it actually decreases after a certain point in simulations. 
 - Vested Balances with 10k XEM
 - Takes days/weeks to be fully vested so one can’t immediately attack system
 - Can only be so many accounts that can then attack the system

- *Net-Outlinking XEM* 

 - Sending XEM between two accounts adds PoI score at a decaying rate

- *Decay of PoI* 

 - Sending XEM only gives temporary boost.

- *Largest component of PoI is amount vested*

- *Advantage of gaming or spamming to get more PoI is minimal*

 - PoI gaming will not result in a significant qualitative advantage over actors with the same balance who do nothing. (Tech Ref pg 37)
 - PoI gives accounts with smaller PoI and vested balances more salience in the network than small time users in a PoS network. It also gives less salience overall to richer accounts than PoS. 
 - There is a theoretical maximum PoI score so whales cannot dominate.


- *P2P Reputation Management, modified version of EigenTrust ++*

 - Modified because original EigenTrust++ was written with file sharing networks in mind where incomplete data is shared. NEM network downloads entities in its entirety and needed to be refined. 

- *NEM uses elliptic curve cryptography to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and non-reputability of all transactions.*

 - Uses the Twisted Edwards curve, which is considered one of the safest and fastest digital signature algorithms.

- *Protecting against spamming (Technical Reference pg 14)*

 - Consider the unconfirmed transaction cache as having 1000 slots for a node. As long as less than 120 slots are filled, no transaction is rejected. Otherwise if there are already 120+ slots filled and transaction signer A arrives, that transaction is put into an equation to decide if they have a fair number of slots already taken up. If A occupies less slots than its fair share, the new unconfirmed transaction is accepted.
 - Note: You can increase the chance that your new transaction is accepted by voluntarily increasing the transaction fee.


- **Network**

 - Nodes synchronize time to keep time stamps for transactions and blocks consistent
 - Comprised of NIS super nodes and nodes
 - Each one associated with a primary account, used for authenticating responses by that node. This prevents attackers impersonating a node without a private key.
 - Having an account with a private key is how you can run a node

- *Super Nodes*

 - Super nodes first tier of network.
 - Super nodes do heavy lifting of creating blocks and confirming transactions.
 - Need 3,000,030 XEM to start a super node.
 - As of October 21, 2017, there were about 670 super nodes online with 25% being in Japan, 18% in Germany, and 18% in the US
 - [Node Locations](https://nemnodes.org/)

- *Nodes*

 - Nodes are light clients, like nano wallet
 - Second tier of network
 - Allows more users to use PoI (With 10k vested)
 - Collect transaction fees from blocks they harvest. Harvesters keep 100% of harvested amount.
 - Can also be run on something like a Raspberry PI to harvest although this is no longer needed since delegated harvesting was implemented.


######FEATURES AND ASPECTS OF NEM


**Mijin**

- Mijin is the private blockchain solution developed by Tech Bureau. Mijin can be used by companies that want their own blockchain solution to improve their existing businesses. Transactions across private chains (Mijin) require the use of the public blockchain and XEM. Any customers paying for products or services from companies that are using Mijin pay with XEM from the public chain and the transaction would be recorded on both public and private (Mijin) blockchains. Mijin uses the NEM blockchain technology and therefore, XEM. 

**Universal easy to use RESTful JSON API**

- [Linke to a great explanation of what an API is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY )
- The easy to use NEM API can be used with any programming language, making it easy to find developers to start using NEM. 
- Each node provides the API gateway that applications may use to access the blockchain and its features. This means that your application does not need to run any complex node software; all usage functionality is available through the API interface on each node in the network itself. This means that the blockchain can be used to create a variety of solution architectures with light-weight code in any language. For a few examples, it can provide direct mobile app access, be a gateway for client apps or web services, and link existing business contract logic, systems, or databases to the blockchain. 

**Smart Contracts are not on blockchain**

- This is by design as on chain smart contracts have posed serious risk for other blockchains, have presented scalability issues, and can lead to too much resources being wasted on the deployment of it. For NEM, smart contracts can be executed off chain, such as on company servers, and the transactions can be recorded on the blockchain through the NEM API. Instead on chain smart contracts, the below customizable smart assets can be used on chain.

**Mosaics**

- Mosaics are the smart asset of NEM. Any kind of asset, real or digital, can be connected to a mosaic. They have customizable names, descriptions, divisibility, quantities as either fixed for mutable, and transferability restrictions if necessary and can have levies applied to them or be levies themselves on other mosaics.  Example: The DIMCOIN ICO distributed their coins via mosaics. You invested XEM and they would send you a mosaic containing the tokens. The mosaic looks similar to an email with an attachment, the attachment being the asset. Once received, you can easily see your list of mosaics in the Nano Wallet. In the DIMCOIN example, you can then send those coins from the mosaic to other wallets or exchanges. 

**Namespaces and subdomains**

- This is a domain naming system. Continuing with the above example, when buying in the DIMCOIN ICO, the tokens came in mosaics and the tokens were named “dim:coin”. “dim” is the name space (what domain the asset is coming from) for the DIMCOIN tokens and “coin” is the subdomain (a description of the asset). Hence “dim:coin”. What’s special about this is that there can only be one namespace in the blockchain. So, you can be certain that when you receive the mosaic with “dim:coin” that it actually came from the DIMCOIN foundation because only they have access to the namespace, root domain “dim”. 

**Messaging**

- NEM messages can be open, encrypted, and hex. They can be of any length up to 320 characters (272 encrypted), and messages can be strung together if needed. These can be used with mosaics to be official records, dates, or descriptions of the asset. Messages can also be used in sending XEM from one account to another.

**Multi-sig Accounts**

- Unlike other blockchain solutions, the multisig account is not created by combining public keys from other accounts. Instead, a pre-existing and funded address is converted into a multi-signature account and the cosignatories are assigned to it. The cosignatories can be assigned in any m-of-n combination where both the m and n can be any number of 1-32 (up to 32 cosignatories on an account); this includes 1-of-1 multi-signature contracts.
 - A 1-of-1 multi-signature account is possible in NEM as the account being turned into a multisig account has its private key nullified; meaning, it no longer has any power to initiate transactions. Only a cosignatory’s private key can initiate transactions on the multisig account’s behalf. It is therefore that accounts in NEM’s multisig implementation can be analogously thought of as parent/child accounts, where the parent accounts are the cosignatories and can make the child account, multisig account, make any transaction.
 - This is useful because now a dedicated account representing a blockchain notarization can receive messages to update the blockchain notarization, and can receive assets/mosaics sent to the dedicated account locking in value or adding status to the blockchain notarization. But the other subtle yet critical utility about NEM’s multi-signature solution is that, the dedicated blockchain notarization account be transferred from person to person. This means that the account is no longer “just an account” but instead is a certification account representing the state of the underlying content that is linked. These certification accounts are called “Apostille accounts”.

**Apostle**

- [White Paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/ApostilleWhitePaper.pdf)

- A notarization system that can be moved, changed, and updated on both the private and public blockchains with multisig accounts. Uses for Apostle would include car titles, government registration, digital media licenses, luxury consumer goods and anti-counterfeiting, two party legal contracts, and any other need for notarization.
- An application framework convention with the above properties is powerful because 1) multi-signature contracts allow these Apostille accounts to be transferred or conjointly owned, 2) using namespaces denotes authority, authenticity, and authorship, 3) mosaic assets can be sent either to or from the Apostille account representing value or status, and lastly, 4) messages can be sent to or from the Apostille account representing additional information and updates.

######NANO WALLET AND CATAPULT

**Nano Wallet**

- [Nano Wallet Download](https://nem.io/downloads/)
- Can be used desktop or smartphone. Don’t need to sync or download blockchain.
- In the wallet you have access to Apostle, Mosaics, Name spaces and subdomains, a voting center, messaging, your delegated harvesting, sending and receiving XEM, XEM market information, and details of transactions and assets. 
- Address book
 - An Address could be as simple as a user’s account full of coins, like most blockchains. But it could also represent things like: a package to be shipped, a deed to a house, or a document to be notarized.
- You can also buy XEM right in the wallet through Changelly. 

**Catapult**
 
- [White Paper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/catapultwhitepaper.pdf)
- Catapult is the big upgrade the NEM developers have been working on for some time now. It’s an upgrade of the core NEM technology from Java to C++ for scalability and speed. It will be deployed on Mijin first (Lon Wong said in interview “before end of 2017”), then the public chain afterwards. In tests, it has achieved over 4000 tx/s and averaging in the 3000 tx/s range. 
- It’s designed to be a highly customizable blockchain solution that can be utilized by any company, but specifically financial institutions. It’s ease of use and flexibility are meant to help facilitate the gradual shift from banks existing platforms to a blockchain driven system as its core operating platform.
- Its API gateway allows the blockchain to be easily connected into other centralized (new or existing solutions) or decentralized (new consensus driven solutions implemented by other initiatives) systems including smart contract systems, internal process driven solutions, settlement, payment, and clearing systems. 
- [An article by Lon Wong examining what Catapult was designed for.](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/RadicalizingEquityMarket.pdf)

- *Catapult will have the below features and highlights*

 - High scalability, design based on the industry standard tiered web architecture commonly found in enterprise computing 
 - Interoperability – allow external decentralized or centralized applications or smart contract solutions to transact using the blockchain. 
 - High transaction rates (in excess of 3000 transactions per second) 
 - Introduction of a high performance and highly scalable API gateway server layer with an open integration architecture 
 - High throughput message queues for real-time analysis and big data analytics of transactions 
 - Embedded escrow service for exchange of assets on the blockchain – a special transaction contract 
 - Permissible access to accounts, i.e., each person can only access what she can see. 
 - Business Rules – rules where object states can result in an indisputable transition to a new state as a result of a definite and conclusive action, specifically on the calculation of transaction charges based on a predefined set of irrevocable and immutable input criteria. 
 - Metadata – Accounts and assets shall have configurable metadata fields. 
 - Use of NoSQL database at the API layer, which is more suited for high speed messaging 

- *In addition to the above, the existing functions and features already present in the current release of NEM will be enhanced and ported across to the Catapult project. These include:*

 - A built-in messaging solution
 - A process activated or manual sign-off function for transactions, with multiple approvals, where needed.
 - A multiple ledger with multiple corresponding assets in one blockchain. Every account can hold multiple assets from multiple ledgers in the same blockchain so that these accounts can be used for all products and services the bank is offering, e.g., one account can be holding USD, EUR,GBP, Gold, Interest Rate Swap, ETF units, etc., each with its own history of transaction records and balance.
 - Every account can be controlled by the financial institution – allowing for compliance and AML control mechanisms to be implemented in order to manage these transactions
 - Freezing accounts
 - Transaction reversal with full audit trail and accountability

######THE NEM ECOSYSTEM – Platforms built on NEM

######FAQ

**Why is volume so low?**

Most of the XEM volume is on Zaif in Japan. Zaif does not publish their volume data as they have no transaction fees and want to prevent any bots from manipulating the volume numbers.  


**Is XEM on any other wallets like Jaxx or Exodus?**


 Unfortunately, not yet. No plans for any other wallets as of now. Nano wallet is your best option.  


**Where to buy XEM**


You can buy XEM for Bitcoins (BTC), CNY, or JPY on exchanges such as Poloniex, Bittrex, BTC38, BTER, Changelly and Zaif.
XEM to be integrated on Shapeshift soon


**Difference between XEM and NEM?**


 NEM is the blockchain technology and ecosystem. XEM is the crypto coin. 


**What drives the value of XEM?**


This answer is somewhere between the author’s opinion and how it actually all works and will work. (Just an FYI). The overall cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption is also a big part, like any other coin. 


Companies can easily adopt the NEM blockchain to their existing networks because it’s ready “out of the box”, making the transition smoother and easier for the companies to integrate the NEM blockchain. Mijin is also positioned to be a big player in the banks and financial institutions of Japan because Mijin was originally tested by large Japanese banks, so most are aware of it already, and it was designed with them in mind.  So, NEM being easy to use and integrate with existing systems while also being highly scalable and secure are key features of the adoption of NEM into existing companies.


 The value of XEM will increase as the NEM ecosystem described above grows and we start seeing these applications and solutions slowly find their way into everyday life, such as buying a cup of coffee with XEM (which the Hitachi partnership will likely accomplish soon).  On top of that, XEM is required to communicate between public and private chains. XEM is held on the pubic chain. These transactions between chains require a small fee and will need to be harvested and confirmed. When these companies start interacting with their clients, customers (their products and services will be integrated into the private chain, Mijin) customers and clients will need to hold XEM to interact with these companies private blockchains. So, as more companies start to accept and adopt the NEM blockchain solutions, the best currency available to interact with these companies will be XEM.",cryptocurrency

I am trying to go to graduate school, and I know that higher credit might mean lower interest loans. I have one credit card with a limit of $1000. I normally just use this card for things that my fraternity reimburses me for (I am social chair, so I routinely spend about $300 a week on alcohol that they then pay me back for).  I then immediately pay off the card after I am reimbursed.

personalfinance,How can I assess how I'm doing financially for my age?,"Hey PF-

I love this page and read it frequently. I read so many people's success stories on here or the extremes that people go to become financially secure and I'm not sure where I'm at realistically.  Although I've seen the threads about general milestones for certain stages of life and seen ""rules of thumb"" for retirement and savings-- how can I find out if I'm doing OK overall or not? I guess it's all subjective, but right now I'm debating starting a second job to increase my income but don't know if it's financially necessary. 

Basics: Married, late 20s, between the wife and I, we make gross 107k/year and after taxes, pensions (yes both of us), health insurance, FSA, and life insurance, our net per month is approximately 6k. Our expenses are 3500/month which include our mortgage, taxes, fun spending, groceries, student loan payments, car payment, dog care, and more. This leaves us roughly 2500/mo leftover which we've been snowballing towards student loan payments. I also have an IRA with roughly 4k in it that I chip 200/month in right now just to keep adding while still paying down debts. 

Outstanding debts: 42k of student loans at various interest rates from 3-9% with us overpaying on the 9% loan with 5500 left on that one, 7700 on my car worth about 10k at 0% interest and our mortgage which is 213k remaining on a house valued at 260k at 3.5% interest. 

We have roughly 3 months in an emergency fund because we worked hard to pay off one car and lower the 9% student loan from 8k to 5500 in the last few months. Both our jobs are unionized and stable so we don't feel a need to have too much in our accounts prior to paying off the 9% loan. I feel that we can have all of our debts (and a new car to replace my wife's in a year or two ) paid off in 3-4 years without changing our spending or quality of life. 

I can work 15/hrs per week and make an extra 1k/month to throw at debts but in the grand scheme... is it worth it? I have a lot of health problems so I could definitely use that time for self-care and to spend with my wife and dog. 

I know so much of this is subjective but I guess I need a reality check of ""am I doing OK or not?"" and to ask the more general question of ""and how would I know if I am"". 

Cheers.

personalfinance,Continue with REPAYE or Refinance?,"Hi guys,

personalfinance,Relative cashed out investments in 2012 to help pay for my college; I am getting hit with late fees for a 2012 return I never knew I had to file. Any way to get late fees waived?,"Hi there.

It's sort of a long story and all my details are a bit fuzzy so I will try to make this simple to understand.

While I was in college, in 2012, a relative cashed out some investments which were applied to my college debts (federal loans). When I filed my 2016 tax return, they held my refund due to not having completed a 2012 return. 

Since I didn't make any income in 2012, I thought this a bit weird, but apparently my name was on the documents when the stocks were cashed out so I am expected to pay taxes on it. The relative who cashed out the stocks is not really able to file returns or otherwise help with this, so I decided to acquiesce to the IRS and fill out the 2012 return for the income from those stocks.

Today, I received the bill which, in addition to charging the owed taxes, is asking $300 in failure-to-file and interest charges.

Thing is, I didn't even know about all this until 2016. The return is technically a few years late I guess, but I didn't know about this income or that my name was attached to it. I would like to save that $300 if I could help it.

Would I be able to 'appeal' the interest or failure-to-file penalties? Has anyone experienced something like this and been able to get late fees waived?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies and the Black Swan,"# Introduction

I recently re-read the notes that I took on the book The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb, which can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherdurr/booknotes/blob/master/blackswan.md). When I first read The Black Swan, it completely changed my viewpoint on how systems work and function. Rereading my notes, I immediately realized that many of the principles from The Black Swan could be applied to the space of cryptocurrency today.  In this post, I will use ideas from The Black Swan to analyze cryptocurrencies as a whole and hopefully allow you, the readers, to gain some more insight into systems not only behind cryptocurrency but also in systems in general. 

Please note that in this article, when I use the word cryptocurrency I am also including blockchain technology within that definition. 

# Our Illusion of Understanding

As humans, we suffer from various mental biases that cause us to believe things that are not in fact true, especially when it comes to looking back at history. These three mental biases are:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people

I believe that points one and two are the most salient for this discussion when it comes to cryptocurrency. The first point applies to when we believe we understand how the world works when in reality we do not. I find this especially prevalent when I attempt to explain to others how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work to other family-members and friends. To them, they believe digital currencies cannot have any value because it is artificial. They believe they understand how money works, when in reality they suffer from the illusion of understanding.

That's not to say that those that understand the value of cryptocurrencies don't also suffer from this mental bias.  I am sure that I too have only an illusory understanding of cryptocurrency, and that in 10/20 years cryptocurrencies will be able to accomplish things that I had never even thought of before. Take Amazon, as an example, which when it started out only sold books. Now you can buy practically anything on Amazon with the mere click of a button. It would've been difficult in the late 90's to predict that Amazon would go that route, and yet here we are. The same principle applies to cryptocurrency as well. 

The second point,  regarding retrospective distortion, is also important because that's what gives us the ""I knew it all along"" attitude. Nassim Taleb explains retrospective distortion by stating ""Much of what took place would have been deemed completely crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the events."" I believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. In 10/20 years, the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. Of course, when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. As Taleb states -- *""History and societies do not crawl. They jump"".* I truly believe cryptocurrency will be that next jump in our society. 

# The Turkey Fallacy

I believe that the Turkey Fallacy is the perfect example of our illusory understanding of the world. Here is the story behind the fallacy:

A turkey is selected by a family to be the turkey for Thanksgiving. In order to prepare the turkey for the feast, the family begins to give the turkey extra food months before Thanksgiving to make it extra plump. Now, in the turkey's view, he has it pretty good. He is consistently being fed more and more food. In fact, if the turkey assumes this will continue forever he'll have a pretty good life. Finally, on the day of Thanksgiving, the family takes the turkey and kills it immediately to feast on it. 

The Turkey Fallacy is essentially this: Things work until they don't. What we learn from the past turns out to be either irrelevant or completely false, and at worst looking at the past as an example of the future can be incredibly misleading. This was no doubt the case with the turkey, and this will also be the case with cryptocurrency as well. A cryptocurrency in the top 20 marketcap, for example, may have a fatal security flaw and suddenly it becomes worthless. The best way to prevent this type of event from affecting you is by diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio.   

That unexpected event is what Taleb calls a black swan, and it comes from the fact that explorers in the 14th century believed all swans were white. One day, however, they came upon a black swan and that worldview was shattered. 

Black swans can be both positive and negative, but a key point to remember is that positive black swans take time to show their effect while negative black swans can happen very rapidly. This can no doubt be seen with cryptocurrencies as well. Negative black swans, such as The DAO hack, happened very rapidly and caused the price of Ethereum to crater very quickly. Meanwhile positive black swans, such as applications that can be built on Ethereum, will generally take much longer to show their effects because it takes time for those positive events to occur.

# Confirming our Worldview

The major reason that people do not become aware of black swans is because people more often than not wish to confirm what they already believe, instead of what the truth actually is. If you look hard enough, it is easy to find sources that confirm what you believe to be true. 

Unfortunately, this is the wrong way to view things. You should look at the evidence and then reach a hypothesis, instead of the other way around. As soon as you formulate a hypothesis, you should immediately try to find evidence to the contrary of your hypothesis to test it. Ask yourself, ""what evidence would prove me wrong?"" If you find evidence that goes against the validity of your hypothesis, then readjust your hypothesis. This type of thinking allows you to formulate well-structured, thorough hypotheses on things. This is especially important when it comes to cryptocurrency, as the field tends to learn towards complex hypotheses as opposed to simple ones. The world lends itself more to shades of grey as opposed to simple black-and-white viewpoints, which usually only serve as naive simplifications of complex issues.

# Why we can't predict black swans

A key component of black swans is that they are highly asymmetrical in terms of consequences. If you look at Bitcoin, for example, you will see what I mean. The rise in value of one Bitcoin in the past 7 years was massive and, even for people who understood what Bitcoin was capable of, would be nearly impossible to predict. Other black swans, such as the DAO hack, caused an extremely negative outlook for Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole. 

One can see why it would be useful to be able to predict a black swan -- after all, if we can see it coming then we can avoid its effects entirely. Unfortunately, predicting black swans is nearly impossible. Why? Because we have an innate bias to think we know more than we actually do. This is also known as *epistemic arrogance*, which is hubris concerning the limits of our own knowledge. 

The issue, too, is that people may acknowledge this fact but believe that experts in a field are somehow more capable of predicting these types of things than normal people. In fact, the more we view ourselves as an ""expert"" in a field the more our estimations become inaccurate in other fields: Janitors and cabdrivers were able to make more significantly accurate predictions in random facts like the height of a building than Harvard MBAs. 

Studies have shown that people who professionally make forecasts are especially prone to this type of mental bias. Public price predictions of Bitcoin that predict the price will reach [$100,000 in 10 years](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html) or even [$1 billion](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/fox-business-speculates-bitcoin-price-reach-1-billion/) are more based on making sensational headlines and news stories than being based in reality. People who publicly state price predictions are usually incentivized to make outlandish claims because:

1. It makes for a good headline
2. It gives them the ""knew it all along"" if they turn out to be right. These people will be heralded as geniuses or market ""wizards""
3. If they're wrong, they can simply deflect questioning. Most likely, the price prediction will be forgotten quickly anyway. 

When you perform incorrect predictions, you usually deflect in three ways:

1. You tell yourself that you were playing a different game entirely. 
2. You invoke the outlier. i.e. ""that event was one in a million so there was no way to predict it!""
3. You use the ""almost right"" defense: You focus on the parts you got right, not the ones you got wrong. 

It's also important to remember that sophisticated or complex methods of predicting events does not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts than simpler methods. 

# Tools and Toys

The most important advances we have in society are also the least predictable. Bitcoin is a clear example of this. Almost all advances in society are the direct result of a tool that was built. These tools can lead to unexpected effects and outcomes, which themselves can lead to even more unexpected outcomes. Whatever tools lead to, they rarely are used exactly for what they were first intended for. Facebook was originally exclusively for Harvard students.  Taking a more outlandish example, Play-Doh was originally created because Kroger wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper. 

""We build toys. Some of those toys change the world"". 

The best way to get maximal exposure to positive black swans is to continue researching and gathering potential opportunities. It is important, however, that we do not use the past too often as a reference for what the future will be. Too often, when we think of tomorrow we project it as just another yesterday. As the common saying goes, ""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" Even if the past were somehow an indication of what is to come, we do not truly know much about the past either. 

It's also important to distinguish between chaotic and random systems. Random systems are completely random and do not have any predictable properties. Chaotic systems, on the other hand, have predictable properties but are difficult to understand and know. Lottery numbers are random, the price of a cryptocurrency is chaotic. Being able to tell the difference between the two is key in discovering areas where you can find black swans. 

# How to maximize the effect of (positive) black swans

Now that you understand what black swans are and how difficult they are to detect, what can you do in order to increase the likelihood that you effected by a black swan? You must maximize your serendipity. Serendipity is defined as ""the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way"". To maximize your serendipity, you must find instances where there are highly asymmetrical positive payouts (e.g. Bitcoin, other altcoins, etc.) and increase your exposure to these instances as much as possible. 

When exposing yourself to these highly asymmetrical opportunities, you must do it in a number of different fields or areas in order to diversify serendipity while limiting your downside but maximizing your upside potential. Let's use another field besides cryptocurrency as an example of this: venture capital. Let's say that a venture capitalist invests $25k into 10 various startups one year after their founding, all of which could  potentially have positive black swans. Let's say that 8/10 of those companies experience negative black swans and those go bankrupt. Out of the two companies that's left, one of them happens to break even and you make your money back but that's it. Unfortunately, you're still $200k down. But what about the last company? What if that last company you invested in were Uber, or Facebook?  Suddenly that $25k could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, more than making up for your other losses. The same principle applies with investing in cryptocurrency: You probably won't be able to pick exactly the next big winner, but you could probably diversify among 10 different coins that could have positive black swans in the future. 

It is usually futile to exactly predict black swans, as usually what occurs is reading the signal as the noise and over-interpreting data. Instead, it is recommended that you instead spend your time looking for areas where there is a strong possibility a positive black swan could exist, even if you don't know exactly what it is yet. Seize anything that looks like an opportunity, because they are much, much rarer than you think. Remember that to feel the effects of positive black swans, you must be exposed to them first. 

Lastly, remember that usually there will be periods of calm and stability punctuated with massive change (for better or for worse) concentrated from a small number of black swans. Those black swans are the ones to look out for, and the ones you least expect.

personalfinance,Debt advice for 3 credit cards and 1 personal loan (AUS),"Throwaway account but read this forum semi-regularly

Have been a bit scared to post as people on here tend to get a bit aggressive and over the top with their comments but need some advice pretty desperately..

Basically, my partner has debt that we have both agreed we need to get on top of..

We are in Australia and the details are as follows

Credit Card 1 = $1114.34 @13.24% pa (monthly minimum $24 repayment)  
Credit Card 2 = $2000 @ 14.55% pa (monthly minimum $75 repayment)  
Credit Card 3 = $5954 @ 11.95% pa (monthly minimum $66 repayment)  

Personal Loan (that she took out for a car when she was 18 that was a lemon)
= $11,199 @ 15.74% pa (monthly minimum $270 repayment)

The personal loan is currently a variable interest rate and we have learnt that if we change it to a fixed interest rate of 11% there are crazy penalties for paying to off faster than the agreed amount.

She is putting whatever is left over at the end of each week after food and biills onto these debts. (which is about $150 per week) but as you can see this is barely putting a dint into it as the interest rates are so high.

Any ideas of where to start and what to do in order to help reduce the interest rate as she tries to pay off these debts?

Your help and advice is much appreciated.",finance

Bitcoin,Any of these look familiar?,"Five Steps of a Bubble
Minsky identified five stages in a typical credit cycle – displacement, boom, euphoria, profit taking and panic. Although there are various interpretations of the cycle, the general pattern of bubble activity remains fairly consistent.

Displacement: A displacement occurs when **investors get enamored by a new paradigm**, such as an **innovative new technology** or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in May, 2000, to 1% in June, 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic lows of 5.21%, sowing the seeds for the housing bubble.
Boom: Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question **attracts widespread media coverage**. Fear of missing out on what could be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of participants into the fold.
Euphoria: During this phase,caution is thrown to the wind, as **asset prices skyrocket**. The ""greater fool"" theory plays out everywhere.
**Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase**. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot, or more than 350-times the value of Manhattan property. After the bubble burst, real estate lost approximately 80% of its inflated value, while stock prices declined by 70%. Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March, 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.",cryptocurrency

I moved recently and spent a lot of money on it but unfortunately I chipped my tooth the other week. Big one right up front. I decided to go to the dentist and see my options. They're are telling me the tooth is too chipped and decayed to do a crown. They are suggesting a bridge across my front teeth. Canine to the other side next to the other canine. 3 teeth bridge with crowns on each side. My insurance only covers up to 1500 dollars a year and what they are saying costs 6300 dollars in all. They're is a chance that they could do the crowns once they shave the tooth down but it's not guaranteed. Won't know until then and then I would just have nubs.
I looked into care credit but it seems unlikely I'll get approved for that amount and the interest rates seem absurd.
There's a payment plan option thru another company but they require 30% down and that is still too much. 

Is a payment plan with the dentist possible? I did see a sign that said they don't send to collections unless you fail to pay at least 10 dollars a month.

__Surplus without mortgage:__ $2152


Now, I am not sure how this differs from the US, but here a mortgage is obtained by basically selling bonds worth up to 80% of the property value though a special bank, that charges a fee for providing this service. There are multiple bond/mortgage types available, but I'll just present 2. 


The simplest is a 30 year fixed interest rate bond. Currently, a 30 year 2% bond sells at a price of 98,5 with a yearly fee of 0.75%, totalling 3.06% in total yearly expenses over a 30 year period. With this loan, we would pay $1260 a month before tax breaks / __$1080__ after. The loan would go down __$600__ a month.


The other one is a variable interest mortgage with adjusted interest every 6 month to a market rate. It currently sells at a price of 100.21 for a -0.28% (yeah, negative) interest 30 year bond. The fee on this type is 0.9% totalling a yearly expense of 0.83%. We would pay $1003 before tax breaks / __$964__ after, and reduce the debt by __$855__ each month.


So basically the question is whether to gamble or not. By picking the variable interest rate, we would be paying $116 less per month after taxes and still reduce the debt by $255 more. The ”price” of a fixed interest rate is thus __$371__ monthly compared to a variable interest mortgage. It is nice, however, to sleep well knowing rising interest rates won't matter. On the other side, we have the income to afford rising rates. I am really torn on this issue, and any thoughts and/or advice would be appreciated.

I would feels bad saving for a down payment on a house because it should be in a savings account or something decently secure. However, you can also think of it as money you won’t need to pay interest on when you finally pull the trigger on purchasing a home - so you get that immediate return. 

Say you were planning on making the same payment monthly regardless of the down payment (so with the down payment you pay off the house faster). You could think of the money you saved for the down payment as ‘earning’ the interest of the loan times the number of years it takes to pay off the house - since if you didn’t have the down payment it would take you longer to pay off the house. 

For example, compare if you had no down payment and paid off the loan in 30 years to having a 100k down payment and paying it off in 25 years (idk if these numbers are very accurate but it’s supposed to be illustrative). You could say the 100k down payment earned 100k*(compounding loan interest over 25 years). Like a 25 year bond with fixed interest rate equivalent to the loan interest rate.

Does this actually work/make sense?",finance
personalfinance,Expat Investing?,"I'm a 27 year-old US citizen who has been living abroad now for over three years. I've finally paid off all of my student debt and am ready to start investing. I make roughly $60,000/year so am exempted from federal US income tax because of my status as an expat. My goal for now is just to build wealth and won't need this money. I currently have over $50,000 saved up, just sitting in a money market account.

If I were living in the US, I would open a roth IRA. But because I live abroad and don't pay US income tax, is that still an option? Should I Just invest in mutual and index funds? Will I owe taxes of any kind on those investments?",finance

personalfinance,Is the bank rate war really worth chasing it?,"The Fed has been raising rates lately, with another one expected in December 2017.  In turn, this allows banks to raise their interest rates on savings products (Savings, CDs, Money Market).  My question, is it worth moving your money around from one bank to another simply to chase rate?  I love my bank, their rate is good, but it isn't the ""highest"" rate out there.  I love my bank, they have all the features I look for in a financial institution, but I'm wondering if I should be chasing 10-30 bps?

personalfinance,Can I refinance a new car a week after purchase?,"I bought a new car yesterday and financed 23k at 4.9% interest.

The dealer said that I could refinance in three months, keep the rebate, and everyone would be happy.  In hindsight it was stupid of me to not walk out and do  additional research before making such a large purchase, but... well, no excuses.

After searching online it looks like I could get a 3.25% interest rate from my current bank.  If I start the process tomorrow, is there anything that I should look out for?  Will I have to pay any additional fees, and is there any chance of losing the rebate if I refinance so soon?",finance

I will keep posting this in relevant threads until the day of the fork, with the hope that more bitcoiners learn the true nature of S2X/B2X/NYA open attack on Bitcoin disguised as an ""upgrade"".

We need to keep our efforts to expose and inform people about what S2X/NYA/DCG really is. Don't trust and don't do business with these companies and individuals supporting the S2X attack on Bitcoin.

Moneybadger don't care and only gets stronger and immunized after each snake-bite.
&amp;amp;gt; 
&amp;amp;gt; Actually &amp;amp;gt;99% of the Bitcoin community supports the real Bitcoin. The centralized B2X-coin attack is only supported by a handful of [rich crooks](https://i.redd.it/t1z62pow09qz.jpg) and the people they've managed to bribe with their deep pockets:

TL;DR: B2X (S2X/NYA) is nothing more than an open attack on Bitcoin, not an ""upgrade"" as they want to sell it. This attack has no 'consensus', at all. It was ""agreed"" by a bunch of miners and corporations behind closed doors, with no community nor developers support.
Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the B2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin community is totally against this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

&amp;amp;gt; Every bitcoiner should know about what DCG [(Digital Currency Group)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/74wejs/exposed_how_bankers_are_trying_to_centralize_and/) is, and call out publicly the people that are working for the Corporations/Bankers against Bitcoin.

Need some advice on how to consolidate my debt and not get hit with insane interest rates.,"Hi, if you are reading this I'm pretty worried I have got myself in a bad hole. So I'm in about £9,000 pound worth of debt, £5,000 credit card £2,000 damages to my rented apartment and £2,000 of other debt. I only 3 months ago started my new job which gives me abase salary of £65,000 with over £80,000 if I hit my yearly target, I get paid quarterly on comms so come Jan I hope to be abe to be debt free. The thing is I have a really bad credit rating and I need to pay of £4,000 in the next week or things will get bad for me.

They want to do this because it’s cheaper than creating a will or a trust. My question here is, will this affect me if I want to buy a house soon myself.

I’ve heard that if my name is on a title of a house already and I try to buy a new house myself then it will be considered as an investment rather than a primary residence and I’ll be getting a much higher interest rate. 

Is that true? Are there other reasons to not put my name on my parents house title?",finance
personalfinance,Older adult with dementia and outstanding credit card debt. Can she default if her credit score doesn't matter?,"My mother has a credit card with a remaining balance of just over $5,000. She's 77 and has dementia, which is advancing quite rapidly. So it seems that her credit score is not really a concern for her anymore. 

What happens if we simply let it go into default? 

It's been suggested that I could let it go into default/collections and simply ignore it...or offer to resolve it by paying a relatively smaller amount after it's gone into collections. 

Here are my concerns:

* The credit card is issued by the same bank where her checking account is held. Could the bank take money from her checking if she defaults on the card?
* My parents are still married and live in a ""community property"" state. Would my father's credit/finances be placed in any risk if she defaults? 
* Both parents are retired and live off of social security. Would their SS payments be at risk if my mother defaults on her credit card? 

The other option we have is to tap into their savings and pay it off. Not the ideal option...but I'd rather have that debt out of the way, and we can ""repay"" the savings account over time without wasting money on interest rates from the credit card. 

But I wanted to explore the default option since someone told me she did the same (with the bank being the same for CC and checking) and had no issues. She took a credit hit (as expected) but no one came after her money. 

Any information is very much appreciated. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"Recently graduated with a new job, Looking for guidance","Hi guys, I recently graduated this past summer with my IT degree and have been working at my new job for almost two months now. I'm mainly looking for guidance on how I should be distributing my income between student loans, savings accounts, retirement, etc. 

**Where I currently stand financially:**

-I get paid semimonthly ~$1500 (~34k annual) after taxes and health insurance

-I currently have 30k in student loans subsidized and unsubsidized.

-I only have one checking account that I opened back when I was a freshman in college and 1 credit card I've had for a little over 2 years now.

-I don't have very many expenses apart from my loans since I'm very fortunate that my parents still support me.

**Questions**

1. Since my official graduation date was set in October, my grace period lasts until May 2018. Should I be making payments toward paying off my student loan now or wait until May? Should I at least be making payments to my unsubsidized loans since they still accrue interest?

2. Should I be aggressively paying off my student loans or be setting aside money in case of emergencies? How much should I be saving for emergencies?

3. What kind of savings account with which financial institution is recommended or should I just go with Ally bank (since I hear that name being thrown around on this subreddit) or whatever high interest account my mint account recommends for me?

4. My original plan was to pay off my student loan within 1-2 years (earlier is better) but that would mean that I would most likely not be making very many (if at all) contributions towards my 401k. How bad is that?

5. My job offers a Flex spending account (2k max, 500 carryover into the next year). Should I look into putting money into that to pay for some medical expenses such as doctor's visits, dental, vision, that I can expect within the 500$ carryover?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for any advice or insight you can share with me.

Edit: I currently only have Federal loans since it was asked of me:

business,My business Partner,"Hi guys,

Long story but I could use some advice please.

I own a small trucking company that I want to grow to offer warehousing, regional/interstate transport etc.
When I first started the business, I was primarily using contractors (owner drivers) to do the work, while I booked/planned and I made about $50 a delivery.


An acquaintance of mine, a rich kid from mainland China, had moved to my same city and was looking to invest in a business, so for about a month he hung around me to see what I was doing and how we could make more money.


I told him, the best thing to do is, buy our own truck and have our own driver and depot and grow the business that way.


I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've managed other business's in the past and I know the money and profits that can be made from trucking compared to my past ventures with cafes/restaurants.


So, he came into the business and I gave him 49% shares, he put in $40k and we bought a second hand truck and he put in another $40k to buy our own trailer etc.


For about 8/9 months he worked in the business and slowly learned how to plan/manage/invoice/speak to customers but he hated it, he really hated chasing customers for money and thought that our debts didn't need to be chased, he use to hate speaking to Chinese clients asking for our overdue payments, I don't know if that was because hes so well off he doesn't want to look like hes begging? So instead of chasing the debts, he would use the money from his parents to pay off our outstanding bills.


Eventually he bought a block of land for our business as sharing a depot with other trucking business's was causing issues.


He spent another 25k to road-base it and put up half a fence. He didn't ask for rent he just wanted the yard to help the business, (although were not approved and we have no water or a full secure site).


So about 9 months in, I said to my partner, look, I drive my BMW to work every day, I'm just going to buy a second hand ute (pickup) which is 100% tax deductible and use that to go to work as it will be cheaper in the long run, he then wanted his own ute and he didn't want a cheap or second hand one, so we bought 2 brand new Hilux's worth about $55,000 each.


The following month after buying the Hilux, he disappeared and stopped coming to the office, he bought a couple of Chinese franchises, 1 does Chinese tea and the other does some fried chicken. He didn't really work in them, he found other business partners, gave them 20% shares in the business to manage it.


Now when he did this, he paid for everything outright, no loans or anything and he expects to get a weekly return of like $1000? Not 100% sure to be honest but anyway, some months later, he came to the office and we spoke about his new business's, he told me he was making money there but not here, which was true but I tried to explain to him that he bought and paid off those business in full and that those business's he bought are cash sale business's, I also tried to explain to him that now we have 2 trucks and trailers and 2 Hilux loans that our profits are going into the loans and back into the business, he couldn't understand it and he demanded to get his investment money back or some kind of weekly benefit, he was already getting a Hilux (loan/insurance) a fuel card, telephone and road tolls account all paid by the business.


A year past and the situation had not really changed, he rarely came into work or contributed to the business and he would just put this business down and being a waste of time and that hes making lots of money elsewhere, he demanded we sell the ute and buy him a new car, we tried to sell it but our neighbor offered to take on the loan repayments so we gave it to him, while my business partner used this business to buy another BMW X6 for him to drive around in, mind you, he did pay a $15k deposit but the loan and repayments through the business again.


He doesn't understand how a work pickup is tax deductible and that this X6 isn't, he doesn't understand how we offset tax against interest rates and that we claim losses to reduce our tax rate etc.
I try to explain this to him and I don't know if hes just stupid or if its his bad English.


Now.. Since he stopped coming to work, he would say to me every time we caught up that he will fix the business, he will bring money in to fix all things, he really wants to make a warehouse and he really wants to grow this business etc etc.


Last month he came to work to tell me he was going to China and that when he comes back he will pump a million into it the business to build a warehouse etc.. but he then wanted me to shut this business down, restart a new business with a ridiculous name he has decided on and give me 20% to run it for him.


I now feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and I'm not sure what my next move is. DO I wait and see if he is really going  stick with this and grow it as planned or do I find another business partner and continue elsewhere, or do sell or shut shop?",finance
CryptoCurrency,My Crypto Bubble Theory,"Right now it looks like Crypto is in a bubble. Perhaps it is in the short term (looking at you fork), but the long term trend will continue upward, as long as we stick to buying as much as we can afford to lose and only sell what we've gained. So far the fundamentals add up.

An early sign of the big fat shitstorm bubble is when major unions start to tie pensions into PoS and rendering cryptos inaccessible to small time shits like us. Kind of a self fulfilling prophecy when whales raise the price by buying massive amounts with money they're not pulling out.

Start running when banks start providing loans for crypto. It will be brutal. Poor innocent fools will barrow against their homes and cars to buy .0001 BankCoin^tm and pay more interest than they can afford.

The economy would face collapse, so the fed would bail out the banks, while they hodl their ill-gotten shitcoins into another reserve scam (looking at you bitconnect).

Please keep in mind this is not the only way the crypto market could bust. Shutting the fiat gates or a mining crisis could do it and I accept that possibility as a risk. But my theory is set in the scenario where everything goes smoothly and we're break dancing on the moon in our Space Lambos with our robot slaves.

TLDR: Don't spend anymore than you can afford to lose.",cryptocurrency

I logged in and saw my own user sitting in the channel. cant imagine why that would be available.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Getting an auto loan for a private party seller with no credit score?,"So here's my current situation:

I'm 19 and I'm a complete nut for cars, it's the only thing I've ever found that interests me and that I've found a real passion for. Currently, I own 2 vehicles (by a very conservative estimate, worth $4,000 and $5,500) yet neither is my dream car. However, I found a car that just seems to be more and more perfect the more I look at it and look into it. The seller is looking for $7,000 and I currently have $2,200 saved up that I can spend on it, but have no idea how I might go about getting the rest. I know he is willing to negotiate the price some so I figure I ought to get a loan for $5,000 in order to have some money for plates, title transfer, etc. I will only need it for the time it takes me to sell my two current vehicles and I can afford to make payments of over $500 a month at least to keep from paying too much interest. 

The problem is I've never used credit before in my life. I've applied for 2 credit cards and was denied on both for not having any credit history. Naturally, this made me check my credit score which, apparently, I don't actually have. I'm at a loss for what to do here, if I can't even get a card with a $200 limit how could I get a loan for a few thousand dollars? Any ideas on how or where I might be able to solve this? Like I said, I intend to sell two cars I own that should be worth nearly double the loan I'm looking to get, and even if that never works out I can pay way more than any minimum monthly payment so I'm of the opinion that interest rates won't be the biggest deal. It's just an issue of finding someone willing to lend $5,000 to some 19 year old kid. 

Thanks in advance for any help, and I'm sorry if I've done anything to break any rules. I'm new to this sub and looking for some advice. 

Edit: For anyone in a similar situation trying to figure something out: things have worked out already for me. I went to a credit union today with no credit history at all and was able to get approved for a $5,000 auto loan on a 1999 car. Even if the odds are totally against you on something like this and you think there's no chance, try a credit union, I can't speak for all of them but the one I went to was extremely helpful and happy to work with me and get me in the ride of my dreams.

financialindependence,Diminishing returns for extra payments on mortgage,"I am working out the age old question whether it's better for me to invest or pay down the mortgage.  I came across [this](https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2015/07/01/extra-mortgage-payments-worth-it/) article about extra mortgage payments.
I'm in my second year of a 30 year fixed mortgage ~$200,000 at 4%.  If I pay double mortgage payments for the next 4 years won't I get a greater ROI than 4%?
My reasoning:  At the beginning of a loan basically all of the payment goes toward interest and very little towards the principle, so extra payments carry the most benefit and would give a greater return than my interst rate of 4%.  After paying extra for 5 years, I would start investing (hopefully getting a return of 7-8%) since putting additional money towards mortgage payments yields diminishing returns.

A scenario:
I took out a $200,000 loan today with a 4% interest rate for 30 years.

1.
If I pay $1955 per month for the first 5 years and then pay $955 per month thereafter, I will only pay $63,885.86 in interest.
After those 5 years I would invest the $1000 per month and get a rate of 7% until the the loan was paid off at 214 months.
Then for 146 months I would invest $1955 per month.
Stock investment after at 360 months =$1,003,001.37
Total interest paid on load =$63,885
Net gain $939,116

or

2.
I just pay the $955 per month for 360 months and invest the $1000 per month in the stock market and get returns of 7%.
Stock investment after 360 months = $1,177,064.86
Total interest paid on loan =$143,735.88
Net gain = $1,033,329


Initially I thought that paying extra toward mortgage would save money.
In scenario number one above paying $1000 per month for 5 years ($60,000) saves me $79,850 in interest.  Wouldn't this mean my 5 year ROI is more like 5.8% rather than the 4% interest rate of my loan?
Even with that better ROI it seems like investing over extra mortgage payments is the way to go.  Is there something I'm missing?",finance
personalfinance,Can I survive if I accept this job offer? (US),"I currently have 63k in student loans (half federal and half private). I recently got extended a job offer after I graduate for 70k yearly salary + 6k bonus. However, this job offer is in Boston where I would be expected to pay probably at least $1200 in rent. I won't need a car but I am wondering if $70k salary is too low given my debt.

gaming,Fed up with Season Passes,"I recently returned to console gaming after spending a few years mainly PC (Steam) gaming. I am no longer a person that needs to rush and pre-order games or buy them on Day One. I got used to the deals and bundles that exist through Steam, Humble Bundle, Bundle Stars, etc.
So yes.... I have become a bit of a miser when it comes to buying games. Having a kid played a role in that for sure. 
But on to the main point of this all, what in the hell is the deal with all of the season passes for new games? More importantly, why hasn't the gaming community come together and told the developers to fuck off and release all bits of a game on the initial release?

This all kind of stemmed from wanting to buy the South Park game directly through XBL and I couldn't buy the game for less than $80. Which is another thing... game prices are through the roof.

personalfinance,Debt Snowball Calculator with snowballed payments?,"Are there any online calculators that actually apply the proper snowball approach?

My understanding is that you set out your debts with:
* principal
* interest rate
* minimum monthly payment

Then you input whatever amount you can afford to repay on top. 

Problem I've found is that if, say, I say I can pay £500 on top, and I have 3 debts all with minimum £50 each (as an example), my amount I can allocate to remaining debts once I've cleared one of them should rise from £500 to £550 in the second month, and then £600, £650 and so on. 

All the sites I've seen so far seem to ignore this, and just allocate the original £500 despite (in this example) an extra £150 being free up. 

Can anyone link me to a website that covers this?

investing,Under what conditions would a bond fund actually increase in value?,"Interest rates in the EU are already close to 0% or negative (which confuses me a lot). As far as I understand individual bonds, their value increases when interest rates fall (old bonds have a better return than new ones) and decrease when interest rates rise (can get newer bonds with a better return). However, I'm having trouble imagining the interest rates going down even lower - who would ever want to lend somebody money and then *pay them* for the privilege? Thus the interest rates can only rise, which would lower the value of bonds. Yet this doesn't feel right - who would ever invest into bonds knowing that they can only lose value? 

While I can to at least some degree reason about individual bonds, I have no idea how bond funds are supposed to behave. For example, if more people become interested in buying bonds, does the price of bond funds increase or decrease? I could imagine that it would increase because demand is bigger, but I could also imagine they would decrease in value because borrowing money would become easier and thus interest rates would fall. What moves the price of a bond fund?",finance

personalfinance,"Wife's Old Job Getting Rid of Retirement Plan, What Do We Do?","My wife left the hospital she was employed at a year ago. They recently sent her a letter saying they were dropping the retirement plan she was enrolled in. Yesterday, she received this letter in the mail:  
  
&gt; You are currently eligible to receive a distribution of your vested account balance from the above referenced retirement plan. An application is enclosed. As of the date of this letter your vested account balance is $15,333.11 The distribution fee that will be charged against your account at the time of distribution is $50.00. Also enclosed is a document entitled ""Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Payments"". This notice may help you make the decision to take your distribution in cash or to roll your distribution into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or another Qualified Retirement Plan. There are certain situations that could affect the distribution options available to you, we suggest you discuss the alternatives with a qualified Tax and Financial Consultant.   
&gt; If you would like to open an IRA Rollover Account with a financial institution currently involved with the management of your plan please contact [REDACTED]. Please review the checklist items and return the completed application as indicated on the checklist. Questions regarding the forms may be directed to [REDACTED]. If you do not complete and return the enclosed application by April 6, 2018, it will expire and you will have to request a new application and notice.  
  
They then give her three options:  
&gt; * Retain your relationship with BPAS and HUNTERDON HEALTHCARE 403(B) RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN You may have the ability to keep your account balance in the HUNTERDON HEALTHCARE 403(B) RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN, if it is allowed. By doing so, you will continue to benefit from the Plan’s tax deferred status. In addition, keeping your balance in the Plan may also afford you the ability to request a participant loan from your account, should the need arise.  
&gt; * Rollover Option Employer Sponsored Plan: You can roll your existing Plan account balance to your new employer’s plan if accepted. An eligible rollover avoids current federal and state income taxation, and potential early withdrawal penalties as explained in the Cash Option below. Individual Retirement Account (Rollover IRA): You can roll your balance to a Rollover IRA. This option also avoids the taxation and penalties explained below. If you already have an existing IRA or other employer−sponsored plans, a Rollover IRA allows you to consolidate and streamline all your retirement assets in a single, easy−to−manage account.  
&gt; * Cash Option You can elect to take a distribution of your full account balance in cash. Please note that you will be subject to 20% federal withholding and any applicable state withholding. If you are under age 59 1/2, the IRS imposes a 10% early withdrawal penalty on your tax return in the year of taking the distribution.

personalfinance,(FR) I am about 22k€ in debt. I'm trying to pay them monthly but what's left isn't enough to live so I keep getting more loans. I need help to organize myself.,"Hi !

I've been in debt since about 10 years (I'm now 29 years old). I've tried to pay them back as much as I could but as of now I realize I can't afford my lifestyle with what's left after my monthly fees. Is there anyone here who could help me budget things so that I can get clean as soon as possible ?

Here are all the info you might need (hopefully) :

1/ Monthly expenses :

* Rent : 635€
* Health insurance : 22,13€
* Internet bill : 17,88€
* Phone plan (including Spotify subscription) : 28€
* Car and home insurance : 98,83€
* Electronical devices insurance : 9,90€
* Gym membership: 29,90€
* Netflix subscription : 8€
* Autolib subscription (needed to rent a car in Paris) : 10€
* Electricity bill : 2€ (I have a discount through my work)
* Bank charges : 16,30€ (cost of my Visa Premier) (note : most of my loans have been contracted with this bank so I'm contractually forced to keep my main account into this bank until I pay my debts. I'm not forced to have a Visa Premier though but it's convenient since I travel a lot)
* IRS taxes : 375€ (I will probably have to pay the same amount or a bit more next year)
* Loan n°1 : 180€ (ends in September 2021)
* Loan n°2 : 100€ (ends in November 2022)
* Savings for traveling : 250€
* Emergency savings : 100€
* Company restaurant : about 100€
* Gas : about 50€
* Grocery : about 200€

2/ Other expenses :

I have subscribed to a program at work that transforms my intern years into a regular paid year so that these years contribute to my pension scheme. I have to pay 11 000€ for this but they still haven't claimed the money yet.

3/ Monthly income :

* Salary : 2300€

4/ Other income :

* Profit-sharing : 2000€, received in March each year (I usually deposit the whole thing into a company savings account because my company adds 70% to the amount each time I deposit. It is then blocked for 5 years).
* Target-based bonus : 2000€, received in April each year
* Workload-based bonus : 2000€, received in July each year
* 13th-month-bonus : 1150€, received in June and 1150€ received in December

5/ My current situation :

I sometimes use a corporate credit card to pay things in advance, the bill comes about 40 days after buying. Currently I'm waiting for 2 bills :

* 810€, due November, 1st
* 998€, due November 6th

Then my current situation :

* Main bank account at BNP Paribas : -120€
* Main bank account at Boursorama (used for savings for traveling) : +50€
* Emergency savings at BNP Paribas (interest rate : 0,75%) : +7000€
* Company savings (blocked for 5 years, no interests) : +6000€
* Other savings (used for the IRS taxes, interest rate : 0;75%) : +70€


Note :
I'm living in Paris (and intend to keep on living there for most of my life). I couldn't provide any estimation of my shopping and nights out related expenses because it obviously depends. But I can guess it would be around 500 or 600€ monthly. I'm willing to reduce these expenses to help my case but I know I won't be able to cut it out entirely...

In the end you can see that I'm unable to end the month in the green. Until now I also have always used my bonuses to pay my debts and I've almost never put it into my savings. I'd like to change that, get clean of my debts, and hopefully be able to live a more stable life (since I'm almost 30 and unable to move out, make life plans, etc).

Feel free to ask me anything you need to review my case ! And most of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read this and, hopefully, to give some needed advice !

There's been a bit of panic here and in r/investing over this, but I figured it was obvious it wouldn't happen. No way they were going to directly offset a corporate tax cut by limiting 401k contributions in the face of a retirement epidemic.  This still begs the question of how they are going to pay for the corporate tax cuts. Given the historically high Debt:GDP ratio, I don't think we can pay for these tax cuts with debt. I think the stock market rally is held up by the promise of these tax cuts and a huge correction will happen if they don't figure something out. With historically high Debt:EBITDA ratios, exacerbated by rising debt interest rates, congress will need to do something (LOL!) about the increasing cost of debt that will begin hurting corporations' bottom line.",finance

personalfinance,"What debt-to-income ration (DTI) will make you feel ""house-poor""?","So my SO and I are looking for a house and we're at impasse as to how much house we should buy.  Here are some rough numbers for our financial situation:

Our combined pre-tax income is over 300K. 

We have one debt with a 1.75% interest rate that we pay approx. $300 a month.  That's it for our current monthly debt.  

My SO only wants homes in the 1.1-1.2 million range, while I think 1.3-1.4 is more appropriate.  We'll have a 20% down payment for any of the houses in this range.  

We have recurring monthly expenses - cell phone, childcare, internet, etc.  We dine out on weekends and would like to take a nice vacation yearly.  There's also retirement and college funds to save up for.  

My SO is convinced that going up to 1.3-1.4 million (which roughly puts us at an 25-27% DTI) would make us ""house-poor"".  Staying at 1.1-1.2 puts us at an 22-24% DTI.  SO believes we won't be able to save for retirement, take vacations, eat out, etc., if we buy a bigger home. 

So does r/personalfinance have any insight into the difference between a 22% DTI and a 27% DTI, lifestyle-wise?  Maybe there is no difference and it's personal preference.  But if there's anyone out there who's experience one or both and would share how it's impacted them, it'd be helpful.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Leaving college for an apprenticeship? Best course of action financially?,"Hi Everyone! Longtime lurker, 20/f/New England, US area

For some background info, I'm currently employed at about 30 hours a week at a job that's pretty dead-end, but enjoyable, and attending community college. I have 44 credits in college, and hate the environment. It feels very limiting, and like I'm not gaining the experience I want. (Not to mention it's miserable, and I'm incredibly unhappy). 

I figured since I hate traditional school/college, I would pursue a trade through apprenticeship, and began looking into apprenticeships in my area in a field I love. 

My state requires that employers of apprentices, still pay the state minimum wage if they are above 18, which would have me bringing home about $1000 per month. My current take home pay from my job is $1200. 

**Stats:**

* Student loans: $13k with an average 4.1% interest rate, deferred until I graduate or leave college.

* College savings account: around $6k 

* Expenses per month: Around $600 

* Savings: I have about a 3 month emergency fund, and try and put in around $300 per month. 

**Questions:**

Does it make sense at this point in my life to pursue a trade I enjoy, rather than spending another 3 years in college?

Should I put all of the money from my college savings account into my loans immediately if I drop out, and then pay monthly?

Those who have done apprenticeships, do you regret it, or is it the best decision you've ever made? 

Those who have done apprenticeships, what is your course of action after you've completed, and worked with the master who trained you? Did you start your own business? 

Does this course of action seem fiscally responsible? (Being, taking on an apprenticeship as opposed to completing a degree and looking for a job? I know that those pursuing trade jobs are becoming fewer and far between, so I think it might be a good market to get in to, seeing as there are fewer individuals pursuing trade careers?)

**TLDR:** Should I give up on college and pursue an apprenticeship? What's my best course of action for paying off loans?

personalfinance,I recently opened several savings accounts but have just come across a really good investment (UK),"I opened 3 Fixed Rate Saver accounts (1, 2 and 3 year long terms) with Tesco Bank less than a month ago with quite substantial amounts of money in each.

2. Pay off one student loan and either the car or the other loan.  Buy land up north.

  &lt;&gt; Pros:
  
    (a) More hospitable climate for progeny

  &lt;&gt; Cons:
  
    (a) There goes all our investment capability

personalfinance,Best way to consolidate credit card debt?,"So my credit is around 660-710, I have about $2,200 in credit card debt and pretty high APRs (around 23-25%) on my cards. I’m not sure if consolidating with a new credit card or a bank loan would be best and apparently my key word game is way off when I try to find useful information.

Any advice would be massively appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Why I don't make extra payments on my mortgage,"Almost daily, someone asks if they should put extra money (over and above the minimum) against their circa-4% 30-year mortgage.    Ultimately, whether you do or don't depends on your financial situation.   Here's why I don't; your mileage may vary.

1.  My interest rates are low.  I have two mortgages, at 3.65% and 3.75%.  The return on making extra payments would be those rates.   So, that's not super big as these things go.

2. I don't pay PMI.  If someone is paying PMI, that's basically an interest rate penalty, and it increases the motivation to reduce the loan balance.

3.  My interest is deductible; I can itemize, so that further reduces my interest rate by federal + state marginal rates.

4.  I really do invest the money that I would have used to pay extra on the mortgage.   The markets have been good lately; the S&amp;P is up 84% over the past five years.   And while that's not sustainable, I get about 2% dividend yield anyway, so close to the effective interest rate the mortgages cost.  

5.  My payments wouldn't go down as a result of paying extra; there would be no cash flow benefit until the mortgage was paid off unless / until I refinanced or get the payments recast.  

6.  I am not worried about making the payments, even if I had no income for an extended period of time.     

7.  With apologies to Dave Ramsey, I don't mind low-interest debt.  Those calculations showing  six digit interest paid over the life of the mortgage don't scare me, because I see how much more I am making instead.  

So, that's my situation.   Yours might be different.  If you  wouldn't invest the money, or were paying PMI, or just didn't like debt, you might get a different answer.   

Edit: surprised at the vote totals here.  Even if you think the market might dip at some point, that doesn't mean taking the sure 3.x% would have been a better choice for me.  The math doesn't work out like that.",finance

personalfinance,Help Choosing Student Loan Refinancing Options,"Hello Everyone!

So recently I looked into doing a refinancing of my Student Loans. The total in Loans is $37,742 with a weighted Interest Rate of 5.35%.



**I applied for refinancing and I have 3 options:**

5 Years @ 4.00%  ~$690 Monthly

10 Years @ 4.50%  ~$390 Monthly

15 Years @ 5.00%  ~$290 Monthly

I am wondering which one would be best for me to do. They are all better than my current 5.35% weighted total and I can afford to pay off the monthly payments on any of them(the 5 years one would cut into my monthly savings by $300 since I currently have been paying $400 total towards my loans so it lines up with the 10 year one more closely)

Anyways I am asking because sure I could pay it of in 5 years by choosing the first option but I am confident that in my investing (mainly) and raises from work (currently making 67k/yr) that I can pay it off sooner/get better returns investing that extra cash. So what do you guys think? Mainly I am looking at choosing between 10 year plan(basically changes nothing from my current regime except* of course lower interest) or do I choose the 15 year and invest the extra 100$ per month. Or if anyone has a good argument as to why i should choose Option 1 and stop investing those $300 a month then I'd love to hear it as well!

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans- Lowest Monthly Payment or Lowest Interest Rate?,"Hello everybody. So I am currently in the process of refinancing my private student loans (total amount: $45,914) and am unsure whether I should choose a refinance payment plan that has the lowest monthly payment or the lowest interest rate. My private loans were taken from Sallie Mae and have an average interest rate of 10.04%, $712.40 monthly payment, and a repayment term of 10 years. Fortunately I have a lot of options on refinancing due to having a co-signer who has great credit and salary. However, my monthly salary is pretty low (roughly net 1700-1800/month) and I need to lower my monthly payments. I've decided that the interest rates and monthly payments between a 15 and 20 year refinancing plan at various lenders are suitable, but after talking with various people, I was advised to choose the lowest monthly payment due to my current financial situation regardless of the interest rate and repayment term. The reasoning being that when I make more money in the future- the job I'm currently working in is temporary and I am working towards a higher paying profession-I can always just pay more every month to reduce the principal. My question ultimately is what are the downsides-if any-of choosing the lowest monthly payment regardless of the interest rate and repayment term? I am open to and appreciate all opinions and thoughts on my situation. Thanks!

TL;DR 
Loan type: Private
Loan Amount: $45,914
Loan Term:120
Interest Rate: 10.04%
Monthly Payments: $712.40

My question is if I should still use this card, get a different one, or switch up my strategy entirely. Should I use multiple cards? I want to make my credit better so that I can get a house before next June (part of my package is that if I buy a house in the first year the company pays all fees (inspection, realtor, etc) and closing costs).

Rent - $1100/month

Car - $5500 loan, 1.9% interest, paying back at $132/month (dad said to do this to build credit). Car+ins+gas = $350/month (approx)

Credit Score - 760something (from when I bought the car in April, that's what the bank said)

Student Loans - 20k, 4% interest rate (won't have to pay until jan, will probably start paying $300ish/month

I'm thinking that I should totally be able to get a house right? I mean, I pay so much in rent, there's gotta be a way to have a morgatge payment less than that (or the same). Or is it a dumb idea?

Ripple,XRP v. Bank Tokens,"So I've doing some reading for a while to compare/contrast XLM, XRP, and bank issued tokens. Brad recently side-stepped a question regarding how bank issued tokens might impact this digital asset space; I don't buy that he ""doesn't know:""
""What does a fed token really mean? Look at this piece of paper [holds up a $20 bill]—that’s already tokenized—it’s a unique $20 bill with a serial number on it. What does that mean you’re taking that bill an tokenizing it? I don’t know exactly what means. I hear people talk about it but I don’t know."" http://fortune.com/2017/10/23/bitcoin-ripple-brad-garlinghouse/

While I understand the argument regarding the convertible nature of a bank token, it seems to me that if the explanation were that simple then...I did find this part of an article on XLM interesting: ""According to Lund, though, the banks use of Stellar’s digital currency is likely to be temporary. He predicts that, in the next year, central banks will begin issuing digital currencies of their own, and that these will become an integral part of blockchain-based money transfers.""
http://fortune.com/2017/10/16/ibm-blockchain-stellar/  

So if XLM is being characterized as a stopgap for the nostro/vostro issue, why wouldn't XRP serve a similarly temporary purpose(invalidating the basis for a HODL strategy)? It doesn't seem like the use of the market makers for liquidity in the case of XLM is substantially different from the methodology of XRP. Anyone have some more insight?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Forks are so natural. Open your mind and have an unbiased look.,"Ever seen a tree without branches? If no, proceed with me, I will not speak about so called *malicious* forks here, I promise.

&gt; Fork (computer science) **An event where development of some free software or open-source software is split into two or more separate projects**.

We (humans) always try to describe new concepts using terminology from the widespread ones. When software development became a thing, forks and branches and trees started to be everywhere. Being a *software*, Bitcoin is not exclusion. The only difference is that Bitcoin is a *special* software. One so innovative that it gave birth to the *whole new concept*. And soon terminology got messy, distorting perception of innovation.

Namecoin is a fork of Bitcoin (the first fork, to be precise) and *it is a great fork*. Rise your hand one who does not want decentralised domain name system.

And Litecoin was afterwords. Started 'for fun' it's now a third largest crypto-currency (excluding bullshit). And do you know why? Cause the *idea behind* is good, quite good. 'The universe wants one money', of 'one to rule them all', or anything else? Bitcoin alone will not serve the needs of everyone (LN is for 500mln people opening two channels per year not considering segwit capacity increase – good but not enough, not even close). 'We will increase the capacity one day' – sure we can, but do we *really need* to sacrifice a privacy of the main system?

Here is the recipe of a super friendly Bitcoin fork:

1. Shares the whole history with Bitcoin
2. Has sha256 mining algorithm and implements Merged Mining (can be mined simultaneously with Bitcoin)
3. Has the same number of coins
4. Implements SegWit
5. Has strong two-way replay protection
6. Uses different (and not used by alts) version byte for address encoding

Now lets look what we can do with such forks. First, lets make a BitNameCoin. That's basically the same Namecoin, only you have coins in it, the market cap is 100x of current, more miners mining it, more people know about it, the decentralised DNS is here to stay. Then, let's make BitLiteCoin. That's Litecoin without scrypt, with 21mln coins instead of 84mln. Block generation time is 2.5 minutes, meaning that it has 4x capacity of Bitcoin (while blocksize/weight is the same). And don't forget, you have coins from the beginning, you are early investor.

And let's not forget about BitEthereumCoin. Ethereum without enormous premine. Period.

Sidechains? Two-way peg sidechains are likely years away. Federated sidechains are bullshit, as well as drivechains.

The forks described above would have more than 80% of coins distributed in exactly the same way as in Bitcoin (and Bitcoin has the fairest coin distribution out there). With atomic swaps and interoperable lightning networks those forks would be tied so tightly, we will be treating them as **one tree**. One flourishing tree with many-many branches.


Don't take this too serious anyway. I did not want to hurt anyone. Thanks for reading.

P.S. (and edit) and money will flow back into Bitcoin from alts. Cause, you know, free money, huh.

personalfinance,Wondering if I should use my loan with the lower interest rate to put towards my other loan with the higher interest rate.,"Hi everyone!

I've asked multiple people about this in my life and they all have varying opinions. I just recently graduated from a specialized school in which I took out private loans to help cover my costs. My grace period is ending in December so I would love to figure it out before then.

I took out a loan for $8,000 two years ago at an 11.49% interest rate and it currently has $1,900 in interest.

I applied for a $4,000 loan earlier this year and didn't receive it until right before I graduated so therefore I didn't need it anymore and told my school to send it back. However, due to some poor management at the financial service office at my school - that never happened and I just now received a check for $4,000 at 7.49% rate and it currently has $100 in interest.

I was thinking about the avalanche method of paying off loans and was wondering if it would make more sense for me to use the $4,000 loan to pay off some of the $8,000 making my amount to be $6,000 rather than the $10,000 or if I should just pay off the $4,000 loan off completely?",finance

economy,A thought on social welfare in a capitalist society...,"(Really stream of thought, sorry for lack of intro hookers and whatnot :)
Social services ultimately feed big business, which dominates and stifles the majority in an ultra competitive stacked environment, creating the need for social services because the majority of people are the ones where the ""edge"" is being derived for big business to make a profit. So if a limited scarcity bound environment is dominated by large interests, it necessarily keeps the majority circulating in an artificial economic environment to which there is a ceiling and the probability of moving ahead drops exponentially the further you are to the bottom. The largest interests MUST continue to grow as a result of their debt obligations to (shareholders/individuals/institutions), which can be accomplished to a limited scale by raising efficiency via technology but is traditionally done by scalping the sheep that comprise society(combination). Stock operators understand this aspect intimately as it is the basis of stock accumulation and distribution, the very heartbeat of this society. So when technology gets to the point where scarcity is no longer a tangible real world phenomenon, but rather a derivative of human systems it can be said that the largest interests who maintain a certain model of production and distribution are the primary problem causing inequality and social unrest(remembering that centralized banks are the largest businesses of the bunch). Humanity has also developed to the point of being able to understand, if only in limited capacity, what is ""fair"". To the point perhaps where even fed and clothed economic slaves are capable of revolt.",finance

I was left by a roommate to pay for an apartment that we both knew I couldn't afford; lost two cars in accidents because I can't afford a car payment, so I bought what I could afford with the insurance payouts; took out personal loan after personal loan (which now I realize I shouldn't have done), and now I'm left in the aftermath of everything.. I moved from the expensive apartment to a reasonably priced studio for my area, have been staying ""on time"" with payments but only because I have overdraft on my checking account which leaves me paying for my payment plus $34 with every overdraft..

With the salary I can expect to make, what would be considered the most financially wise way to maintain long-lasting stability?

Should I save an allocated percent of my check and not touch it? What bank should I use? Should I open a credit card to establish credit?

personalfinance,"22, making 100k, living at home with parents, what to do with money","I recently graduated and began a $100k job in the Bay Area, where I'm fortunate enough to live with my parents in San Jose. Every month I take home between 4-5k after taxes and other payroll deductions like retirement, and may earn more at the end of each year depending on stock grants and bonuses.

I have 30k student loans and 10k car loan, for which I pay around $900/month. Aside from that I don't really have many monthly expenses—$250-300/month on food, gas, going out, and Amazon purchases. Though I'll most likely spend a few thousand yearly on traveling or toys.

I'm earning a lot more than I spend so I was wondering what else I could do with the rest of the money other than letting it sit in my BofA savings account for $5 interest every year. These are some of my ideas:

* Renting anything is financially inferior to living at home, but my commute is 30-40 minutes each way with traffic and I may want to move closer to work on the peninsula, even though housing is expensive there.
* Stocks? Put more in retirement? Find and join a credit union with high interest rate?
* Pay off loans faster? Interest rates are 4-5%. But building credit.
* Do I wanna buy a house to live in and build equity? House prices here are only going up in the long term, but they're already too high in most of the Bay Area, where $1m is a lower bound.",finance
investing,"Should I ""Tax Gain harvest""? Any downsides?","I'm only working PT so my income is somewhat low this year. Parents can't claim me as a dependant as my income is between $10k-15k, and I'm only PT in college.

Noticed I can take the ""savers tax credit"" since I deposited to a ROTH IRA, so I'll be getting $1,000(not refundable) off my taxes, so basically no federal income taxes owed this year.

While my income is low now since I'm only PT, I expect it to be higher in the future once I start working FT, thus eventually putting me in the 15% bracket for long term capital gains and 25% for ordinary income.

I have a bunch of stocks bought earlier in the year, and I have a ""buy and hold"" mentality in which I just hold and collect dividends. Some have gone up, some have gown down.

investing,UK specific - Is an SS ISA worth it if I am earning less from investments than the capital gains threshold? Are there downsides to SS ISAs?,"I am looking at getting into investment as I have accrued ~£5k since starting my job, and I feel I am just loosing my money as the interest rates are so low (some bank accounts are offering as little as 0.2%, and above 2% is quite rare).

I am in the process of background reading and looking into my options. One of those is an Stocks and Shares ISA. (I will most likely use Cavendish online, as its come highly recommended for people with small pots of money). I was wondering if there are any benefits or downsides associated with an SS ISA?

It looks almost like it doesn't really have an advantage unless you are subject to capital gains tax. And so if there are any catches associated with the SS ISA, then its not worth it.

However on the face of it, it seems that the SS ISA should be like any other investment in a set of shares and/or other investment products such as ETFs, but it is shielded from tax. Is this correct?

In which case I think I will buy a few shares in some large businesses which are likely around for a long time, and produce dividends, with 50%, and the rest in an index linked fund.

personalfinance,(GER) I bought a car (loan) and realized mid-way that it might have been a bad idea,"Hello /r/personalfinance! This is my first post here!

Just some background:

- **What you are about to read will stink of terrible financing and I'm not proud of any of it**.

- I'm 25, not married, no kids.

- Currently living in Germany.

- Working full-time on a low-to-mid paid job (2100€ Gross/month, around 1350€ Net). I know, it's bad.

- I live with my SO and we share all the bills, including the car.

- We live in a very rural region and having a car is basically MANDATORY here. Really, a car here is not a luxury, it is a need. You sometimes won't even be accepted into some jobs if you don't have a car because you'll always have problems to get to work. Public transport is very... lacking.


Here's my story:

My SO and I decided last year (around July) to buy a car. We went to a dealer and decided to buy a car for around 12.500,0 €. 

For some reason, we were convinced (not only by the dealer, but also several friends and whatnot) that leasing was a poor choice, so we went for ""financing"" (I believe you would call it ""loan"" in America? Not sure on this) it over that dealer's bank partner.

The deal we got is something like this:

&gt; 36 x of 219,- € (monthly payment)

&gt; At the end of three years, we have something like 7.500,0 € left to pay, of which we can:

&gt;&gt; 1. Give our current car back, take a new one and start everything over (all the payments and stuff). I find this doesn't differ a lot from a leasing, except maybe the fact that I'm avoiding the hassle of limited kilometers and etc.

&gt;&gt; 2. Give back our car, pay any fees or taxes that there might be and that's it. No current car, no new car.

&gt;&gt; 3. Pay or re-finance the rest of the car (around 7.500,0 €) and keep it as in ""ours, trully"".

&gt; I can't really give more details right now (exact interest rates, for example), but will be able to once I get home (am at work now) and if anyone needs it to help with my case.

I'm very naive and had very little/close to no financial advice during my youth, so I'm now learning with my mistakes. The problem is: I can't tell for sure if buying this car (under these conditions) was a mistake and how should I proceed considering that I already did buy it. As I said earlier, not having a car is not an option where I live.

Thank you in advance for any advice! :)",finance

personalfinance,"Only 20 and feel like my credit, finances, opportunities, and life in general is ruined. Please help.","Hello PF. I need help. I am 20 years old and don't know what to do currently. 

I feel like my life is over before I even got a chance to get it started because of my debt. I realize the amounts I'm about to say do not seem like a lot of money to most people on here but I'll try to give the full scope of the situation.

After graduating highschool I attended a year of private university up at Washington. By the end of the year I had about $20,000 in loans and nothing to show for it. I then headed back down to California, where I currently still live, to do a semester of community college which didn't end well either due to lack of motivation. Luckily that place didn't add any additional loans since it was so cheap.

About a year after that first semester I have not returned to school and have been on and off jobs, trying to pay for everything like car insurance, phone bill, rent, utilities, etc. The problem now is my cool down period for all my loans has ended. I have two federal loans that add up to about $6,000 that are delinquent because I cannot afford the payments. I have my private loan given to me by the university that is soon going to be delinquent and is about $3,000. Finally, I have my $13,000 discover bank private loan that I can also not make payments on. 

So why don't I get a job and pay this stuff off? I am currently working full-time graveyard shift at taco bell and am struggling just to pay my living expenses. I want to go back to school so bad now but have almost no time or energy with my current job. My credit score is at freaking 500 and I'm only 20. My family will not help me as they don't have any money themselves and even if they did they just yell at me for not being in school anymore. 

And there's more. I have two credit cards that add up to about $1,000. One has balance of $750 and the other is at $250. I am trying to pay these off currently but I feel as if the damage has already been done and that the interest for everything I have now is overwhelming at this point for the amount of money I make. My account is constantly getting over drafted so when I do get paid I'm usually losing $100-200 for no reason.

I tried applying for a $3,00 loan with my bank to consolidate all my credit cards and pay off the overdue payments for my loans but got denied instantly because of my ruined credit. 

I don't know what to do. I realize I'm 20 and technically an adult but I have no help and everything is so overwhelming. I can't do anything remotely fun, even with friends, because I never have money to do the stuff they do and I'm always working. And this part also sounds stupid but I feel like I can't even talk to women because I don't want to burden them with what seems like an impossible problem to solve right now. I feel so utterly depressed, stuck, and demotivated which causes me to give up on things which makes the whole situation worse. Please help.

Here are exact details on what I owe:

* Private University loan - Delinquent - **$3,082.36**

* U.S. Bank Student credit card ($500 card limit) - Overdue for 4-5 months - **$750**

* Target credit card ($150 limit) - Overdue for 4-5 months - **$250**

* Food - **Varies ($200-300)** 
* Rent - **$300**

personalfinance,25 years old and 16k in credit card debt!,"Hi,

I'm in desperate need of advice. I turned 25 a few weeks ago and among the other quarter-life crisis moments Im dealing with I've had a sudden awakening regarding my finances. I have approximately $16,500 in credit card debt spread out on 8 cards with interest rates from 20-27%. This does not account for my student loans either. 

I see a net income of $3312 per month and have monthly expenses of $1319 which leaves me with $1993 for the month spread between food, credit card payments, and miscellaneous things.

I tried to get a low interest loan to consolidate my debt, but needed a cosigner and I can't do that. 

I figure if I can pay whatever the loan amount payments would've been spread between my cards I could effectively pay them down but I know it doesn't work like that with my interest rates. 

I'd bitch slap my early 20's self if I could because I'm so disappointed in my financial choices then. How do I fix this? What can I do to get a handle on this debt and effectively pay it off?

Edit:
This is how I'm breaking down my financials. 
Net income $3312

Rent $421
Electric $35-40
Phone $180
Cable $100
Weight watchers $44
Gym $16
Trainer $125
Adobe creative suite: $32
Apple Music $4.99
Netflix $10.69
Car payment $201
Insurance $155

Total $1324

This leaves me with $1987 to use for food, credit card payments, free spending. 
Hope this clarifies my thought process. I understand this does not fill under the typical expenses definition. 

Note: my fiancé covers a bigger part of the rent since I cover 100% of the phone, cable, electric for us. Hence why my rent is only $421 and my utilities are high

personalfinance,Should I focus on building credit for a mortgage or budgeting to be able to pay cash for a house?,"In the past I've been vehemently against mortgages because the idea of a debt hanging over my head has been rather unpleasant when I'd rather be able to move around and spend as little money as possible per year. 

But in the consideration of a ten year plan it may be that rent costs more over the period it takes to raise the cash to buy a house than the interest over the same period it takes to repay the house. 

If I bought a house I could easily repay the interest and then some by renting out the rooms in my house which would also pay for all the associated bills and unexpected  costs but it would also limit my options as I like to move around a lot and for a while at least my career may be more fluid especially for 6 or so years outside of university and possibly after that which will put me at about 28-32 years old by the time I have a stable enough job for a few years. 

Of course the cost of renting, changing interest rates, and house prices all affect it, but which should I be planning for even with that variation? Mortgage or cash?

TDLR; I know very little about debt collectors, medical debt, insurance tricks, and I live paycheck to paycheck while going to college. Please help. 


Hi, r/personalfinance. I am a 20 year old junior level college student living in Seattle, WA. I have found myself in quite a bit of debt and I am living paycheck to paycheck. My biggest concern is paying off my medical debts. I have been quite sick the last three years. My debt looks like this: 


Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan: 5,500 at 4.29% in 2015 

Medical Debt #1: Eugene, OR $2,396.78 (at 9% a year?)

Medical Debt #2: Seattle, WA $1,573.69

Medical Debt #3: Seattle, WA $1,700.00


I currently work about a regular part-time job for 20 hours a week at $13.50 an hour and then a work study job for 15 hours a week at $15.00 an hour. I make about $1800 a month. I had $5,2000 in grants for tuition (which has already been applied towards my tuition) and I apply for multiple scholarships every week. I am currently in the process of getting Washington residency which will cut my tuition from $1,000 a month to $200 a month. I am hoping to get approved in less than three months. If I am not approved I will have to drop out of my uni. I do have my AA, thank god. (Go community college!) Unfortunately, I did have to take a class as out of state this term in order to qualify for deferment. If I don't get instate, I might be able to defer my enrollment at my uni and wait until it has been approved. Worse case is I can't go back to UW until I am 23, because I will be considered financially independent from my parents. I would have to reapply to the UW and theres a huge chance I won't get back in... I absolutely don't want to put my college education on hold as it means everything to me. I have not taken out any loans this year, and I am avoiding all loans if I can. 


Rent: $625 

Utilities: $60

Tuition: $850-$1000 a month 

Phone: $40

Groceries: $150 

Doc Appt copays/meds: $100 

Spotify: $5

(I live with my partner and he helps with some of the costs as he is a recent college graduate with no debt, but I will be responsible for my own finances and he has his own bills to pay.)


I am still on my parent's health insurance until the divorce is finalized this year, and then I will be applying for Washington State Apple Health Care. I currently have All Savers, but I am in-network with United Health Care Choice Plus. I have met my in-network deductible for this year, so I am praying I have no more health issues or costs. 


My EOB's were going to my parents' house so I called this week to have every statement from this year be sent to me. I have resubmitted Medical Debt #1 and #3 to insurance as I believe it was done incorrectly. They noticed they charged me out-of-network when my doctors were in network. I am hoping this brings the costs down. 


In the mean time, the debt collectors will not leave me alone for my medical debt. #1 and #3 have 90 day holds on them because of being resubmit to insurance. I told debt #2 I could not afford the payment plan and they berated me. I told them I was a full-time student and had no spare income to go towards the debt. They said they would take my grants or income wages away. Is this possible?


My questions are as follows:

1. What are my options for getting my medical debt lowered? On better payment plans? Do I have to pay the interest on them? What if I refused to pay the interest? Two of the debts are from hospitals. Can I still go to those hospitals and ask that they cut the bill in half? Any advice on handling debt collectors and lowering these health bill costs is greatly appreciated. 


2. Does anyone have ANY tactics or tricks to triple checking my insurance statements and having free resources for health care? I have health insurance and I still can't afford health care. I feel very depressed and hopeless.


3. I am financially independent from my parents besides the fact that I am on their health insurance. Is there anything else I might qualify for in terms of free resources or welfare? 


4. What are my rights when it comes to debt collectors in WA? I know I can ask them to cease contact with me in writing, they can only call a few times a week and during certain times, they can only garnish wages with a court order, and I don't have to give them my info if I don't want to. And, I should ask them for proof of debt and how it's tied to me. Does this all sound correct?


5. Lastly, my plan right now is just to avoid the debt until I can pay it off. I obviously can't even touch my student loan, not even my interest. Is this smart? What is the best thing to do? Drop out of school to pay off these debts? Or ignore the debts and push through school and hope I get instate? My credit score is 770s right now, so I really don't want this medical debt to effect that. 


Any and all advice is appreciated. Besides telling me to move back in with my parents or move back to that state... It is not possible in the slightest. My partner and I keep joking about getting married to help with the costs of school and health insurance.... joking... ha...

I have no credit card debt, no car payment, no mortgage, and no kids. Basically, the only debt I have is my student loans. 

I have 2 consolidated federal student loans currently totaling $3,966 (hooray for community college!) at 4.41% interest. I’ve been paying $200/mo, at which rate I could pay it off in about 1.8 years. I was finally able to start putting some money into savings about a year ago and have about 6k saved up now.

It seems obvious to me that I should just pay them off, but I am TOTALLY clueless about money and I’m not sure if I’m missing something. If I were to pay it off, I would just put the $200/mo that I’m spending now on loans into my savings. 

I would greatly much appreciate any feedback/advice!",finance
personalfinance,Can some equities be considered quasi-bonds?,"Hey guys, I’m wondering if any of you would agree with this line of thinking in that I am hoping to get away with a 70/30 equity to bond portfolio in retirement versus what some may consider a more traditional 60/40 allocation.
 
My logic for this is in that ‘70’, I have a fair amount of utilities, pipeline and telcos that constitute those holdings.  The reason for this is to give my largely ETF portfolio abit of a boost in terms of income as my goal is to live purely on my portfolio’s distributions (dividends and interest) which will be around 3.2% which as it happens I consider a safe withdrawal rate.
 
Looking back at the last big pullback it would appear that those sectors did indeed fair much better versus the broader S&amp;P or TSX (I’m Canadian) indices.  I also do realize those sectors are more interest rate sensitive in what will likely be a rising interest rate environment, however presumably much of that is baked into the price.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for IRA advice.,"Hey PF. I have a budget and an emergency fund. My employer does not offer a 401(k). So I think it’s time for me to open an IRA (probably a Roth, I’m assuming, I’m young and don’t make much money), and I could use some resources on how to make that step. I know the common recommendations are Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab, but I have no idea how to go about evaluating which is best for me. I want something low-cost and relatively hands-off, though I’m willing to learn more and be more hands-on if it means I’ll have a better portfolio.

Also welcome are any resources regarding common investing fears (market failures, etc.). Somehow I’ve managed to surround myself with people who have a general distrust of markets/the Fed/etc. and I guess it might be rubbing off on me. Ugh.

Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,How to best make use of a crazy plan,"So I have a crazy plan, and I am launching myself into it for better or worse. I just wonder if /r/personalfinance has some tips to make my plan work a little better for my wife(27) and I(28).

The Plan:
I work a Fly-In Fly-Out roster in Australia ex Perth. Instead of flying to sydney or brisbane (5hr+ flight) that a lot of people do to escape the crazy expense of Perth, my wife and I have decided to move to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am flying in and out of Malaysia (5hr flight) every month to work for 2 weeks in Australia. My Wife has a job lined up in KL and has Visa and accommodation sorted through work for next year.

Reasoning:
Perth is one of the most expensive places to live in Australia, following closely behind Sydney. Rent is high, property outlook is bleak and the job market is collapsing with any positions in a technical field being very competitive. In comparison cost of living is much cheaper in Malaysia and the country's economy is growing at an impressive rate, with many job openings available even for foreigners (Sorry local malaysians my wife took yer jerbs). Also Malaysia is an amazing country - no suck up, its the truth.

Budget:
For better community immersion here I'll use USD.
1 AUD = 0.78USD
Monthly:
Pay After Tax: $6100 +$1500 Superannuation

Perth Expenses:
Rent: $2140
Utilities: $411
Groceries: $116
Insurance: $140
Car: $311
Credit Card:$622
Restaurant: $155
Wife: $388
Savings: $1455

Malaysia (I have been here 2 months now so prices are still fluctuating but this is the average)
Rent: $ 944
Utilities: $30
Groceries: $56
Insurance: $180
Car: $ Nil
Public Transport: $50
Credit Card: $622 
Restaurants: $76 (Actually increased amount of times eating out)
Wife: $77 (Spending money reduced)
Flights: $466
Savings: $3000
Conversion fees: $300ish its hard to track
Floating amount; ~$1000 still working out best place to put it. Paying more off my credit card when I can.

Starting June next year Rent, Utilities and Wife spending money will all be $0.

I have a savings account that has a 3.3% interest rate. Only about $15,000 in it at the moment as I had a 2 years off work due to illness.

$7600 Credit card debt at 0% for the next 9 months. I try and put every allocated dollar into savings and use my credit card for un accounted expenses. In 4 months time, I'll start to put more into the credit card to pay it off before the big interest kicks in.

I only have the one savings account at the moment, but I am helping fund a start-up company which if it works will be nice if it doesn't I'll be out of $17,500. 

I would like to move back to Australia in 2-5 years time to have kids but I want to have a decent nest egg saved up by that time so I don't have to work away as much.

I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences moving to a lower cost of living area and making the most of it? I like to think I am fairly frugal, but there are things that sting like conversion fees but i don't know how to get around it.

Any help or suggestions to make the most of being an expat is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"To refinance, or to suck it up!?","Hey Reddit!

So, my wife and I bought our house in July 2016. Yay us! First home.
Here's the story. Our home cost us $235,000. Great deal for a house on a lake in Virginia Beach! We went and spent about $30,000 on renovation. We financed everything through an FHA 203k loan, which requires you to have PMI no matter what, but covers construction costs completed by a class A contractor.  Which is fine, we didn't have 20% down anyway. So, in total we financed $260,432 and have things like PMI in our monthly mortgage payment (an additional $169.24 per month). After a year in our lovely home, we currently owe a remaining balance of $253,551. Wow, interest sucks.
Now, the cool part is that our home is now valued at $328,000! So, for those keeping track at home, we are sitting at $74,449 to the positive (so to speak) on our house. 
Our interest rate on our house really isn't bad at all, sitting at 3.875% on a 30 year fixed APR. My wife and I are both fortunate enough to have excellent credit as well (both in the high 700s).
So- the glorious question- is it worth it for us to refinance our house at this point in time?

Tl;dr

Bought house.
$260,432 and PMI @ 3.875% APR
Currently owe $253,551
House worth $328,000
Do we refinance to lose the PMI?",finance

I am just newly graduated with a masters degree in a low paying field, in a HCL area. I got a job which I love that pays $35,000 before taxes, and just recently got a second part time gig that pays $12/hr and will have roughly 24hrs a week. My car is paid off, and I have zero debt besides this massive student loan. Rent is split between me and fiancé, $600 each. I pay the groceries ~$250 a month, the Internet bill $68 a month, the renters insurance $12 a month. My car insurance is $512 every six months. My commute to work is far, about an hour on the tollway, so I spend on average $200 a month in gas. My fiancé earns $44,000 a year before taxes and also receives the GI housing allowance while he is in school, roughly $1700 a month for 7 months of the year. His only debt is his car, $18,000 left.  
We have toyed around with the idea of living solely on one income (his) and using mine to pay off the loans and buy groceries. His bills consist of $50 gym membership for both of us, $100 phone bill, $550 car insurance every six months, gas and electric, which I am unsure the cost of due to it always fluctuating. My loans are all through the government, with 3.4%-6.8% interest rates. 
Is living off one income feasible for us for two years? We each have roughly $4,000 in savings and want to begin saving for a house/kids, but the thought of paying off these loans for ten years for a grand total of $63,802 gives me anxiety. Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,Not sure how much to spend on a car.,"I've been reading a lot of relevant posts, but I am still pretty clueless how to go about buying a car.

Also, apologies for the long and winding post.

This is my situation:

* Not a US citizen, but currently working in the US. Banks won't give me a loan unless I can a citizen who is willing to co-sign the loan.

* Earning $3600/month (after tax and insurance, rounded down)

* Have $10k in hand, out of which I plan on keeping $5k for emergencies, and the rest ($5k - maybe $7k after borrowing from my family) as downpayment.



My estimated expenses are:

* 1170$ for rent, phone, internet

* 250$ for food

* 200$ Misc

* $1000 Savings

Total Expenses - $2620

Balance - $980


Estimated Car expenses:

* 300$ for insurance (Which is pretty high for a used car, but when I checked online, the quote from Geico was 292$)

* 370$ monthly payments.

Balance - $310

When I spoke to a dealership to estimate my APR, I was told for a 13k car with a 4k downpayment, over 60 months it would be 6% for citizens (which I am **NOT**) and 14.7% for me because because I am not a citizen). 

Assuming a worst case scenario, I have to go with the 14.7% interest rate, and I can't put off buying a car - as of now I am ""renting"" a friend's car (10$ a day~$300 a month).

The cars I am looking at are 2016 models (Corolla and Elantra), no accidents, and cost **$13k**, and have 40k-50k miles on it. and I plan on paying it in **3 years**.


[On a post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/78gaug/can_i_afford_to_buy_a_newused_car_for_2025k/) made 10 hours ago, it was mentioned that it is better to buy a 3-4 year old car which has less than 50k miles on it

Semi relevant information: I've never driven in the snow, and I am looking to buy a sedan with FWD. So let me know if you have any tips/ unforeseen expenses which I might have missed!

Tomorrow I will be heading to the dealership to test drive a couple of cars.

investing,Why has inflation been so low for 35 years? Is there any risk of a global stagflation crisis crashing the world economy?,"Okay, so I know the subject of perpetually low inflation is complicated and has perplexed financial analysts and the Fed for decades. I am wondering--what are the popular ideas as to the cause of such low inflation? Why can the U.S. Treasury issue so much debt without causing as much inflation as if it just ""printed"" money?

I know Keynesian economics says inflation and unemployment are inversely proportional. But of course, the economy has changed dramatically since Keynes lived and become much more globalized. One theory I have heard for low inflation is inflation is actually tied to productivity growth. Historically, domestic unemployment is just a confounding variable. There has been a lot of real productivity growth in the developing world since the 1980s (particularly China and East Asia), and debt monetization ties global productivity growth to the dollar. Developing countries buy up Western debt as a way of giving themselves legitimacy (investors will be more likely to invest in developing nations if those nations have safe assets), which has allowed developed nations (U.S., West Europe, Japan) to constantly issue debt to fund deficits and monetary stimulus without causing inflation or driving up interest rates. Since the global supply of labor and untapped productivity growth is virtually infinite, the only danger to the U.S. economy is a global productivity glut and/or a decrease in demand for U.S. debt. Neither of these is likely in the near future (since new labor is so easy to come by, and since the U.S. is so much more stable than the rest of the world).

Feel free to tear this apart, it is just an idea I heard. The question remains--is there a conceivable scenario where we see a crash in both Treasuries and stocks going forward (i.e. stagflation)? Is it more rational to be afraid about a crash in stocks than a crash in Treasuries?",finance

personalfinance,Overtime issue in California,"Hello personalfinance.  I am a Canadian living in California who works an hourly wage for a contractor in Silicon Valley.  Our work runs on a 24 hr clock and I take on a lot of OT hours.  The problem is with my contractor accounting for my OT hours 

The last two months I have been on a schedule of 6 pm - 3 am and I often work OT from 3 am on.  My contractor states that 12 A.M is the start of a new day so my hours before do not contribute towards OT.  My understanding of California OT law is that any hours worked over your 8 hour shift is considered OT.  
 The problem lies in the way our time cards work.  There is no OT option for when we put in our hours, only ""normal"" ""break"" ""make up"" .  So OT is only accumulated if I work more than 8 hours within 12 A.M till 11:59 P.M. 

So when I work OT into my Saturday I only get the 3 hours I worked after 12 A.M and the extra hours I worked at my base rate instead of time and a half.  So, finally my question is if this is in my contractors legal right? Or am I getting stiffed out of OT hours.  I hope this was straight forward for everyone to read.",finance

BlockChain,Austria starts Blockchain Initiative and Think Tank at Austrian University,"Several months ago, Harald Mahrer, the Austrian Minister of Economy, launched an Open Innovation Process and invited several national and international experts to jointly develop a Blockchain Strategy for Austria. „To become an innovation leader, we must walk down new paths without taboos and cope with technologies that will radically change many areas of our life tomorrow,“ Mr. Mahrer is convinced. He considers blockchain to be one of  the technologies with a high future potential in the future.  

Global Think Tank in Vienna as a Flagship Initiative
The result of the process is a dynamic agenda, which contains a series of concrete measures. As a first step, an interdisciplinary research focus on „cryptoeconomy“ was  initiated together with the Austrian Business and Economics University. The goal is to set up an international network hub that will act as global think tank. The Ministry of Economy will make available EUR 500,000 as start-up funding. Afterwards the topic „Regulatory Sandboxes“ will be on the agenda. Thus, the possibility will be created for pilot projects to have, within a certain regulatory framework in Austria, the utmost flexibility to try out new ideas and work creatively on innovative developments. 

Bitcoin, Etherium and others – only the peak of the iceberg
According to Mr. Mahrer, crypto currencies are only a very small part of the possible applications for blockchain, the peak of the iceberg which is currently visible. Therefore the Ministry of Economy wants to promote the blockchain technology, to inform the broader public on this topic and in particular to raise awareness among entrepreneurs for the manifold application possibilities, including smart contracts. These include the logistics and energy sectors, digital health management, agriculture and in particular public administration, where there are already successful best practice examples in countries such as Estonia or Sweden. 

Mr. Mahrer starts pilot project in public administration
In order to make use of the advantages of blockchain and to show its benefit, the Ministry of Economy will, in cooperation with the Federal Computer Centre, soon begin a pilot project in the public administration sector. Irrespective of the composition of a future government, the measures included in the strategy paper will be actively promoted in the upcoming years and Flagship Initiatives will be supported specifically.  

 „When dealing with fundamental changes, people were often skeptical in the past. I believe we should have courage, curiosity and will to change.  This is the only way to position Austria at the forefront of the Innovation Leaders“, is Mr. Mahrer’s response to the doubters who regard the blockchain as only a hype.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Can't build any savings because something unexpected always happens. [long],"Hi, all. Not gonna lie, I'm feeling pretty hopeless about everything right now after getting some really awful news.

I'm 24 years old. I split bills with my fiancé, so I am currently responsible for my student loans, half of our mortgage, my car payment, half of our insurance payment, and our electric bill. With my honestly amazing pay, I am comfortably able to pay these bills with money leftover, and I pay those bills immediately when I get my paycheck, sometimes up to a full week early, because I like sending that money off quickly so it's all done and I don't risk missing anything. My fiancé can't really take on any more of the bills because he makes lower pay than I do and he's doing his best too.

The problem is....something literally always comes up to drain any leftover money so I can't build up any savings or emergency fund. Some of the things I've dealt with over the past month include...

---Moved out of our apartment into our house? Boom, apartment complex calls with a $530 bill to replace the carpets. They were trying to make me pay $800 until I demanded to know whether they had applied my deposit towards it. Pretty sure they were trying to con me, because that payment came down to $530 paid over 3 months. My fiancé and I split that bill, and I just sent in the last payment for that yesterday.

---And the awful news I mentioned earlier came this morning. I was finally feeling comfortable enough to start playing more than the minimum on my student loans when boom, my TEACH grant apparently kicked in a few months ago and has been overdue for 120 days and I had literally no idea. TEACH grants state that if I teach for 4 years in a low-income school, that loan is forgiven. But I no longer teach. I knew that loan existed, but it was my understanding that the sum would be added to my current student loan payment on Nelnet. Instead, it went to FedLoan. I take full responsibility for this mistake. I should have been more aware and knowledgeable, and I regret that. The $89 payments have snowballed over 3 months in addition to late fees and I now owe over $600. Luckily, that payment is not due until November 13th. My November 9 paycheck will let me pay the mid-month bills as well as this overdue balance, and still have money leftover. I'm incredibly lucky and nearly started crying because I was so relieved. The only way I even knew about the delinquency was when I checked my credit score while considering a credit card and noticed the overdue payment. Needless to say, I'm not even looking at a credit card until all of this is dealt with.

--EDIT: completely forgot to mention that I had to go to the emergency room last week because I had an allergic reaction that was causing my throat to swell. I have never had such a reaction as I have no known allergies and I hadn't done anything differently than I usually do like changing laundry detergent, new foods, etc. The doctors have no idea what caused it. So I'm anticipating that bill to come in eventually...yay USA emergency room costs. I have excellent health insurance through BlueCross BlueShield, but I'm nervous over what the bill could possibly look like. I was there for 2 hours, got a Benadryl IV, and sat on a nebulizer for about 10 minutes.

--The holidays are coming up, and there are multiple family birthdays between now and the end of the year to deal with. Luckily my family is the type to set a firm budget on how much we can spend on each other, so I'm only looking at a hard maximum of $200 for gifts. I limit myself to no more than $30 for birthday presents, and I do handmade gifts sometimes because I'm crafty and that saves some money.

---And of course, on top of all this, I'm trying to plan a wedding too. It won't be until March 2019 or later, so there's a lot of time, but it feels like this looming terror haunting me every time an unexpected payment rears its ugly head. We have a fair estimate of what it's going to cost us, and we've highballed all the numbers just in case.

So...I guess what I'm trying to ask is for literally any advice on what to do. My life this year has been nothing but one unexpected payment after another. I started trying to save in July and only have $200 to show for it. What can I possibly do to make this easier and less stressful?",finance
personalfinance,How do you prepare a monthly budget?,"I am currently a student studying abroad and I am starting to get fed up with my not knowing whether I have the financial flexibility to go out to a meal with friends or to take the day eating meals with my homestay family.

I spent the past summer working and saving up a fair amount of money to use while I'm here, knowing I will not be back very soon and wanting to maximize what I can get out of this incredible opportunity. But I don't know how to apportion it. My biggest question is how much should I allow myself each week? I travel on 75% of the weekends, so when I'm somewhere new I don't knock myself too hard for spending because it can be hard to find a economical/satisfying spot without doing ample research. 

But while I'm in the city where I'm studying, how much of what I have should I allow to be spent here, and how should I split it up per week?",finance

personalfinance,"US, TEXAS unsual overtime paycheck","I have regular hours 80 + 72.33 overtime hours.

My total taxes were 8.7% of the fed taxable gross. 

Previous paycheck:
Regular hours 79.62 + 0.52 overtime hours.

My total taxes were 20.6% of the fed taxable gross.

This got me so confused, all the articles online said overtime pay is not good because we get taxed more, etc. But this seems on the contrary.",finance
personalfinance,"Buying a house with girlfriend, but everything will be in her name because she has better financials than I do. Is this a smart decision for me?","If this is the wrong subreddit for this, just let me know and I'll delete this and post elsewhere. This is the first time I'm buying a home, so I may be a little off on names or processes. 

My girlfriend and I have been saving for the last 18 months to be able to buy a house. To give some background on our financials, she makes about 15k more than I do and has a considerably better credit score (her's is 800+, I'm being told mine is 656). Credit is something that I've been working really hard to fix for myself over the past 2 years (up 130 points). She has owned a home previously, but just recently sold it to clear out some of her debt ratio and get an influx of cash for a down payment. In our house savings, we're probably at 65/35 contribution, with her putting in about 65% of the total. 

We've found a house and started working through the mortgage and financial aspects of everything with our credit union. The skinny of it is that with both of us being on the application, they're taking my credit score as the determining factor, since it's lowest, and giving us a ~4.6% interest rate on a 30 year loan. My girlfriend felt this was pretty high and inquired into what things would be if it was just her. I'm not sure on what her interest rate was, but it would be about 200.00 cheaper per month on our payments. The principal loan payment would be 70.00 cheaper and the mortgage insurance would be 130.00 cheaper. We spoke to the credit union and they do not allow unobligated signers, so this would have to be completely in her name with me not on the deed/mortgage. 

This is a smart move to put it only her name right? It saves us money in the long run and the interest rate is lower than it would be if it was in my name. My hesitation is that at this point I'm no longer a ""home owner"", my credit score won't reflect this mortgage and any tax incentive I would have had for buying a home wouldn't be available. I am reacting somewhat negatively to our current situation and I'm afraid it's just an emotional response and that it makes more sense fiscally to do everything in her name.",finance
personalfinance,"Applying for home mortgage loan, wife's credit score is affected by a paid collection balance (amount was $50) through Comcast. How to fix her score?","Hi Reddit,

As the title says, my wife and I are applying for a home mortgage loan. Her credit score has shown up as somewhere in the 640 range (much lower than we expected). She has great credit history, with the exception of one ding from Comcast, which has tanked her score down to this range.

We learned that it was for a Comcast issue that was handled previously. It was a $50 bill from early 2016 that she initially was not aware of. In November 2016, she started getting contacted by a collections agency, upon which she promptly just decided to pay the $50 and have the debt settled.

Since then, the ding on her credit score is still there, showing a $0.00 balance. From what I've read online, these types of issues show up for 7 years after the date of delinquency. Her credit score would most likely be well over 700 without this issue, greatly affecting the interest rate and down payment we have to pay for the house.

My question is, what can we do to have this removed from her report entirely, and in a rather timely manner? We've signed the contract on the new-build home and essentially have 60 days to figure out all the financials.

I've talked to the collections agency and they agree its been paid, but have said they won't remove it and that only Comcast can do that. I've talked to Comcast every day since last Friday, and that has been no help other than pushing me towards wanting to hang myself talking to them.

I've read about good will deletions and pay to delete type scenarios. Has anyone had any luck with this, and how long does it take?

This is an extremely stressful issue, and it's all due to a $50 (paid) Comcast balance that probably was never valid to start with. She paid it at the time to get rid of the problem, not knowing the impact down the road.

personalfinance,"(UK) Thinking of doing a Debt Management Plan, is it worth it?","I have got myself in to a bit of a cycle with payday loans. At this stage I can just about cover the monthly payments. I have spoken to a Charity called StepChange and they have suggested a Debt Management Plan. 

I currently live at home with my parents, my dad works full time but my mum has recently lost her job. Due to this I am having to pay more in to the household. Which has in turn made it hard for me to keep up with repayments for my loans. 

A bit more info about my finances, I work full time on an apprenticeship course and take home £1000 after tax.
I have to pay 
£100 for transport
£60 phone bill
£350 board to my parents (This is only for the months while my mum is out of work) 

That leaves me with around £500 after everything. 
My current total debt is £2,200, which in most cases I am paying off monthly for the next 6 months, but this increases monthly due to interest being added on top. At this current moment I am going to have to pay out about £550 to meet the minimum monthly payments for my loan. I can cut back on a few things, mainly food and also I might be able to get the board down £250. 

As you can see I am just short, I should be able to pay the installments in time each month but it leaves me with no money for food at work and also to buy dinner for home as me and my dad are taking it in turns while my mum is out of work. 

StepChange have offered me a debt management plan in which they have said I will have to pay £190 a month for 1 year. This would greatly help me cover the costs around the house and also allow me some personal luxuries.

My question is, is this worth it? I can afford the minimum payments but for the next 6 months i will have barely enough money to buy food and general bits for around the house. 

I'm not planning on financing anything or getting anything on credit in the near future, nor am I planning on getting a mortgage any time soon so the negative impact on my credit rating can be buffed out before it has a real impact on myself. 

If anybody has done a DMP how did it end for yourself and have there been any long lasting issues associated with going down this route?

personalfinance,"Recently laid off, looking for planning advice.","I was recently laid off from work as a software developer in California, and I'm looking for an outside perspective to see if I'm missing something obvious.

Quick rundown:

**Debts**

* Student Loans: $11,580 ranging from 3.5-5%, $200/mo
* Truck Payment: $29,300 at 1.4%, $500/mo
* Mortgage: $285,253 at 3.125%, $1,000/mo (House worth around $400k, purchased last year)

**Bills**

* Electricity: Deferred due to solar agreement, currently have a $600 bill for the year that should be offset in the winter. Assuming it isn't, I've got at least a $600 bill due Jan 1
* Gas: $10/mo max (averages around $5)
* Sewage/Trash: $58/mo (required by city)
* Water: $25/mo
* Groceries: Varies, but generally around $300/mo
* Eating Out: ~$100/mo, this is the first thing being cut
* Vehicle Gas: negligible, work(ed) from home
* Vehicle Insurance: $1,350/yr, just paid it two weeks ago
* Pet Expenses: $30/mo
* Upcoming $700 AMEX bill, which I use for personal purchases/fun. This card will stop seeing use for non-essentials.

**Assets**

* $25,000 savings account (general savings/emergency fund are included here)
* $5,000 checking account (bills paid from here)
* $28,000 401k through employer, fully vested
* Truck worth $40,000
* $5,000 account for paying mortgage from, joint between SO and I

Of the debts, I pay $1700/mo. I can reduce these payments a little bit (save about $200/mo). The $1,000 mortgage is my half of a shared mortgage between my SO and I. Of the bills, these are the total costs, split evenly by my SO and I. I might be able to reduce some of these bills. 

I believe the lay off is because the business is performing poorly, and I'm one of the very few remote employees. I don't believe it is performance related, as the company wants to continue a relationship with me as an independent contractor (and my immediate manager has had nothing but positive performance reviews). My salary was $86,000, which equates to roughly $41/hr equivalent hourly rate. Between the loss of benefits (80% match on 5% contributions to 401k, $200 per month medical subsidy) and the increase in tax burden (and probable loss of hours), it seems that I would want to contract for a minimum of $80-100/hr. I spoke with our accounting/hr person and the owner of the company during my official lay off, and they are comfortable waiting for a few days for me to get back to them on the idea of contract work. I plan to search for a permanent position with another company the entire time.

Assuming we can't come to an agreement on contract rates, I intend to seek unemployment in addition to the job hunt. Two question occur to me: If I begin work as an independent contractor, how does that affect my potential application for unemployment if the company decides to stop contracting with me? What does rolling over my 401k into an IRA look like? I don't think I have any specific questions other than what might I be missing. My plan seems to align well with the information in the wiki (essentials only, my job is now finding a job, unemployment).

Additionally, does anyone know of a good tax calculator for 1099 income? I've been able to find simple W2 calculators, and calculators that show your expected social security/medicare taxes, but not something that says ""If you make X 1099 income, you will pay Y taxes that year."" Preferably one that will show a complete breakdown of taxes (income state/fed, social security, medicare, etc).

personalfinance,Do I refinance again to pay off credit card debit? Specifics inside.,"Currently have a $312k home loan at 5% 30yr fixed. Have about $25k in CC debt, most at 5% but about $8k left at 15%. I recently sold some bitcoin to pay off the majority of the 15% that I did have, so this is what is left in debt. 

Cost of the refinance is around $3000 in closing and $875 in appraisal. I am told from the loan officer that I will lower my monthly around $250 if I just refinance from 5% to around 4.25%. I am not going to pay this property off ever, fairly sure we would move in the 5-10 year range. I don't think my interest rate would ever get much lower, my credit is ok and raising and my job situation is stable and good income but that seems fairly low and doubt the future holds lower. 

I do have some more crypto I would consider selling to pay off the 15% cards (and then use the remaining monthly budget surplus to pay off the 5% cards). Not sure I want to part with more as the future looks bright but I want to get that 15% debt gone. 

Likely I can take out another $10-20k in the house if I wanted. I am torn, the figures seem close in terms of what it is going to cost me to refi and how much I owe in debt. If I just save that $3800 and put it towards debt it might be better. Of course I'd rather have mortgage interest than credit card. 

I do also have another $20k in CC debit as business (but under my name personally) that I would eventually like to get paid down but I Need to talk to my accountant as to the best benefit of that. I'd rather the business be paying interest than me personally so I'll pay off all the personal debt first, for sure. But if I can get all debt paid off I would love to start doing some actual saving. 

I know the crypto is the unknown here. If it is more advantageous to hold or not, but I just consider it any other asset and if I want to sell some now to pay off debt or hold. It has been HIGHLY advantageous to own and buy the crypto over paying off the debt so far given the position I was in with debt over the last few years and the gains off the crypto. So unlike stocks or precious metals the market is very ripe for crazy gains but also very volatile. I've done good buying low and selling high, only generally selling to pay off this debt. I feel like the amount I would sell now to pay off the 15% debt is small compared to the gains crypto will make in general and I still have enough that it would be as life changing with huge gains that I hope will come even selling some now.

Now that we've paid off the majority of our cards, and in the last two weeks I've had two Synchrony accounts closed, a Mastercard through Walmart ($6000) and a Toys R Us store card ($500), and also the balance on what used to be an HHGregg card was cut from $5500 to $1500.

I called them and they told me it was closed due to inactivity and high risk (same reason I was given for the TRU card), and when asked to clarify, they said it was because I hadn't done anything with the card in the last 30 days and it was at risk of fraud. Which isn't true, I used it last week and have the receipt, even though that isn't showing online. When I asked if they could reopen it they said it doesn't qualify and I would have to reapply.

personalfinance,(Belgium) Should I/How to maximise mortgage?,"Hello pf,


My parents have decided to offer me 250.000 euros when I decide to move out to help me purchase a place. How I handle this sum is up to me, but I do intend to buy an apartment around this value.


My question today is how to do this purchase the most advantageously long term. I've looked into mortgages a little and from what I've seen, they're ridiculously cheap over here (&lt;2% over 20 years). In these conditions, mathematically my best option seems to be to borrow as much I a bank will let me for the purchase, and stick the balance in an ETF(s).


Without considering rent/mortgage payments, I plan to save at least 50% of my income (currently &gt;75% while living with my parents, main expense being car/gas). I feel comfortable deducting the eventual payment from this savings amount given that the ""loss"" is offset by a lump sum early on. (I might also consider a room mate to reduce expenses).


So the first part of my question is, are there things I am overlooking in this equation? I realise a mortgage has to be paid come rain or shine, but I have a stable job (government) in a highly employable field, and in a pretty safe country unemployment-wise.


The second part of the question is: how should I go about getting said mortgage? I have yet to go to a bank to run the numbers by them. Ideally, I'd imagine stating I could pay cash, and that I'm looking for the optimal down payment/loan ratio while keeping interest as low as possible. However I guess I'm worried that being completely forthcoming might cause me to loose out on the maximum loan or interest rate? I'm not really sure how to negotiate in this situation.


Any advice is appreciated, and please let me know if you need any more information.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is sort of like banks.,"Hi, guys.

I was musing while going around this subreddit; it struck me a very mild but stark analogy, between the two. Banks and Bitcoin.

Now I have a bit of amount invested into BTC too, just to be clear.

It struck me how in banking there is a central authority to handle all the transactions; and it's centralised in a way that they are under a single institution.

Namely the Corporation whose bank it is and then higher up an organ of the State, much like the Federal Reserve Bank in America, under whose jurisdiction it functions and then finally the Government that passes orders and laws.

*Sometime in the favour of the common man, sometimes in disafvor.*

Much akin to this, aren't what some corporations that are adhering to rules such as 'a majority hash rate chain' or 'the chain with the most accumulated difficulty' will gain the BTC ticker after a certain period of time elapses, doing the same thing.

This regardless of the outcome is indeed a terrifying situation. Just because of the sheer level of centralisation this is.

With this they hand over to the miners the power to decide rules governing our transactions, in clout.

*Isn't this what banks already are doing?*

Am I mistaken in thinking that if miners continue to signal S2X, then they will mine that chain starting form the 494784th block, and if this happens in majority, it'll cripple the BTC network since exchanges and consequently 'trade' of this certain commodity will prove cumbersome and futile.

Thus making it inefficient as a method of currency and consequently resulting in a crash?

Now I see with S2X this pushes the centralisation to a whole new level. In the hands of a few **very popular** exchanges, namely Coinbase, and a bunch of geeks selling their custom Bitcoin mining chips (read:ASIC) functioning under a very regulatory state, China.

Satoshi couldn't have imagine this in his wildest dreams.

My musing's were triggered by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/78mys8/slush_responds_to_coinbase_hash_rate_does_not/). 


P.S. I'm like on an [8]


EDIT: I really believe that Bitcoin Gold is a genuine step towards decentralisation, albeit one flawed with severe PR and development issues. Also the vice of greed, supposedly.

But they do give out a very [legitimate and seemingly transparent reasons](https://goo.gl/g1NeUt) for the premine, where in they will use these funds for further development and other PR expenses for the BTG project.

I feel, it is very much like a step trying towards mining decentralisation, acting as a testground for Bitcoin, if ever the need for such aggressive action may occur.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently in my final year of graduate school with a decent job lined up to begin after graduation. I have two dilemmas surrounding the ParentPLUS loans: 1) can I financially afford to consolidate these loans, and 2) should I consolidate these loans?

&amp;nbsp;

* Salary: 100,000 (Post tax monthly takehome ~$5100 but I need to check witholdings)
* Federal Student Loans: $116,000 principal $129,000 with accrued interest. Rates 4.5%-7%. Note: these are my loans for undergraduate+graduate degree.
* Car: 2014 w/ 42K miles. $10,000 remains on loan at 4.99%. $279/mo (seems high?)
* Credit Card Debt: None, paid in full every month
* Rent: 1150/mo 
* Utilities: $100/mo
* Internet+Netflix $88 (no cable)
* Cell Phone $60/mo (will likely consolidate to just work phone in future)
* Car Insurance $500/biannually
* Groceries $380/mo (household of 2 adults)

&amp;nbsp;

My dilemma is that my parents expect me to consolidate their ParentPLUS loans into my name. Based on reviewing my undergraduate university's fee bills total:

&amp;nbsp;

* ParentPLUS Principal: $66,945
* ParentPLUS Refunds: $18,421 (included in principle amount but refunded directly to my parents)

&amp;nbsp;

Any discussion of this student loan debt instantly turns to me consolidating them into my name, literally the week after I graduate (3 full months before I would start my job) because they are ruining my parent's credit, holding them back financially and because ""you're making so much it won't matter."" Side note: I seriously regret caving to the pressure of my mom to tell her how much my offer was for. Now, my parents have no financial responsibility and when I push back on how they're holding them back my mother responds that she wants to buy a vacation home. Don't even get me started on their reaction to me pointing out that a vacation home is most likely out of their budget...

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a brief recap of some of their big purchases recently... During my four years of undergraduate, my mother is an elementary school teacher who was unemployed for over a year and withdrew her entire retirement savings to make ends meet. My father is an electrician with no retirement investments and no savings and no desire to better his job (has literally been offered to take over family contracting business multiple times and refused every time and refuses to work a union job for political reasons even though he would see a 20-30% hourly rate increase).  Also during my undergraduate degree, both of my parents financed three brand-new vehicles (~$36k, ~44k, and ~48k). One of the new trucks was traded in for another new truck a year after purchase because it lowered their monthly payment and was more expensive. They also purchased a new Harley (~$16K). During graduate school my parents have sunk nearly $15k into the $90k boat they financed two years before I started my undergraduate degree. No payments have been made towards the accruing interest on the ParentPLUS loans. I am concerned that a large portion, if not all, of the $18,000 in ParentPLUS loan refunds went to subsidize this spending. 

&amp;nbsp;

Conservatively, the outstanding loan balance on the loans is $196,000 + interest on ParentPLUS loans. SoFi calculator pegs this at $2,000-2,300 per month with a 10-year term. After graduation, my financial responsibility for household bills will likely increase as my girlfriend returns to school full time (she's been working while I was in school to help make ends meet and reduce student loan debt). I am concerned with being able to afford the ParentPLUS payments on top of my own student loan payments (PLUS loans are $1,000/month by themselves) while saving for my retirement. I also want to purchase a house in the next 5-7 years along with a proposal+wedding which will require considerable savings. My parents do not understand/care that taking on these PLUS loans would greatly hamper my ability to start my own life off. 

&amp;nbsp;

What boggles my mind is that as a public school teacher my mother is eligible for PSLF and ICR if she consolidates the PLUS loans in her name. If she were to do so, I have offered to make the payments, including any tax liability, but she adamantly refuses this option. Any discussion turns to her yelling at me about the PLUS loans being for my education and that I need to take responsibility for them.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I consolidate these loans immediately after graduating? I would prefer to wait at least until the grace period expires (parents claim my first payment for the PLUS loans is due in June) as I do not start work until September. I do not know how I could make these payments without emptying my savings.

&amp;nbsp;

Would PSLF/IBR for the PLUS loans be a good option to give me greater flexibility in my budget so I can save for retirement/house/wedding? How can I demonstrate to my parents that this is a win/win for both of us and still has me taking responsibility for my (somewhat dubious, see above) education costs.

&amp;nbsp;

If they refuse to consider anything short of me immediately consolidating the loans, what happens if I don't? I know there will be family fallout but I am not too concerned about that.

personalfinance,Am I on the Right Track?,"Like the title says I'm just posting to see what others have to say about how I'm currently managing my money. As it currently stands on a normal month I receive two paychecks (some months 3 depending on pay period) each pay check is about 1450 pre-tax and 950 post-tax and Roth investment. Of the 500 difference 60 goes to Standard 401k, 60 to Roth 401k, and 80 to employee stock option. Another 20 is extra I request to be taken out in Fed taxes and the last 280 is City Tax, State tax, Social Security, and Health insurance.

With the two checks I receive one goes to debt/bills which is broken up as follows: 200 Credit card 1, 200 credit card 2, 200 to student loans, and the last 300 to Utilities (gas,electric,water,phone). The other goes to my mortgage(665), gasoline, and recreation.

Food and savings is handled by my fiance who makes about 700 post tax per check.

Debt Balance is pretty simple: Credit Card 1=1200, Credit card 2=2500, Student debt= 15,000. As I'm still in school the student debt is not incurring interest and my job covers tuition up to 3500 per semester.

I feel pretty good about where I am financially and our home is in an area where the estimated market price has risen by about 40,000. To some this might seem like bragging but I'm looking for honest opinions on whether I'm allocating money correctly.",finance
stocks,Worst possible outcome for silver and gold tomorrow (26 Oct),"Tomorrow (26 Oct) is going to be a big day for USD and therefore, since there's been an absence of fresh geopolitical risks, also a big day for silver and gold.

Two events will define USD sentiments tomorrow:

* European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decision

* US House votes on Republican budget

Well, the worst possible outcome for silver and gold:

* ECB decides to not ramp up tapering (the popular expectation out there in the media is that ECB will taper QE from €60 billion to €30 billion).

JOB
I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Political Science a little over a month ago, and plan is to wait a couple of years and go to graduate school for a Master's Degree in Political Science. 


My job right now is $12.50 per hour, full time, 40 hours per week. My monthly income is $1700 after taxes. The job has no PTO, no holiday pay, and no vacation time. I took this job because of some difficulties with family, and I intend to begin job hunting again very soon. I would like to work my way through a Office Assistant job, preferably something around $15 an hour.

Rent: $625
Electricity: $10
Wifi: $25
Car: $0
Laundry: $20 (this is because we have a washer/dryer set in our apartment building, if we venture outside, one load of wash is $3.25).
Gas: $100 (includes at least one drive home each month, my parents' home is about 300 miles away)
Food: $100


Food can swing from month to month since my roommate’s mother sends us $200 every other month to buy food with, which we usually use to buy meats in bulk, since we already have a 20lb bag of rice. It’s not really possible to lower this: I had a gastric bypass in January and have to limit the amount of carbs I eat and increase the amount of protein. Currently, other than the essentials – 60 eggs for $8, milk, bread, cream cheese, various small snacks from the dollar store – we buy chicken from Sprouts at $1.99/pound for chicken breasts (not organic) (it could be lowered but we would prefer not to buy Foster Farms chicken as it is unethical, $0.67/pound for pork chops (special), and tilapia, and usually a pound of shrimp – our most expensive item, around $8. We also bought ground beef for the first time, for about $6, and for some nice fancy food – a beef round for about $6 (for about 2 lbs worth?).
                We also buy our produce from Sprouts – the non-organic – and prices are very cheap. We can usually get about a week and a half worth of veggies for about $20-$25, depending on what we buy.
    Since this is the first month we have had our roommate's mom send money, we haven't actually spent anything on groceries this month, I anticipate that we may be more around $50-$75 a month in total, since we go to cheap places to buy food and I occasionally need a calorie bomb, which is supplied with cheap pasta and cheese.
    This food is also shared sometimes with a secondary roommate (who does not help pay for it), and my other roommate's boyfriend, who brings us beer (and a lot of it) on the weekends, so we end up very much in the positive.

 
Restaurants: $30 - I don’t really go to restaurants at all, mostly to bars and such, which are in their own category. I would estimate this amount, it includes about twice a month where I buy $3 6-inch subs from subway. This also includes taco trucks, where tacos average $1.25/taco. This ends up for me as $5 (a little less) for 3 tacos and a drink. I can start buying canned soda to cut down that $1.50, but I'm also not willing to spend $8 on a box of Coke with money that is supposed to be being used for essentials.


Bars and Going Out: ~$100 depending on how often we go out. Usually only about 2-3x a month, at about $25/night. We go to bars with $5 shots, and go to clubs with no cover charge. We also pre-game like crazy.


Emergency Contraception: $40 made a dumb mistake this month and ended up forking over $40 for generic Plan B. Am going to Planned Parenthood sometime in the near future to stock up on condoms and try to get an IUD.


Everything that isn't being spent in the above categories is being spent to pay off credit card debt. After having surgery, I put many expenses on the credit card as I could not go to my labor-intensive job and had college expenses. I made one payment of $800 to the Chase credit card earlier this month.


Credit Cards: 
Chase: $1500
Clothing Card: $500
Capital One: $460
 

Phone and Car Insurance paid for by parents.


Chase Card: $1600 balance
            APR: 19.99%
    Starts On: 11/25/17
                I've made a payment of $800 to this account last month (Lowering it from $2300), and plan to make one more significant payment, this time most likely of around $600. After this next payment, I will be paying $200 a month until the balance is paid down, which will take five months. In that five months, I will pay a total interest of 43.63. I know that's about 4 hours of work for me, but I currently do not have any emergency fund money and am considering not making the large $600 payment at all.


Capital One: $460 balance
            APR: 25.99%
            Min: I will be making a monthly payment of $75. The total interest will be $39.07. The card will be paid off after 7 months.

Lane Bryant: $500 balance
            APR: 25.99%
            Min: I will be making a monthly payment of $75. The total interest will be $45.99. The card will be paid off after 8 months.


STUDENT LOANS: Balance: Around $31,000
My student loans go into repayment on 05/18. As I see, the minimum payment will be $315. I will apply for income-based repayment, if I qualify. I am going to pay down the two smallest loans first, and then the rest as they increase in size, until only the $7,000, $5,500 and $3,000 ones are left, at which point I will pay the $7,000 one, then continue on to pay off the rest.

ROTH IRA:
    I also want to start a Roth IRA by the end of this year. I would like to use Wealthfront, and can use their service for up to $10,000 managed free, or get a code for up to $15,000 managed free. The account requires $500 to open, and I would use a Christmas bonus (of maybe around $300) to help open it, and I would have had one paycheck's worth of emergency fund saved up. I may do this after the New Year as well, and figure out how to apply the Roth IRA to 2017 instead of 2018, which I have read is possible up until April of 2018.


EMERGENCY FUND (I have no savings at the moment, paycheck to paycheck)
(So far I have received two paychecks from this job)
    I would like to build an emergency fund of at least $3000, which I would put into an Ally bank account bearing 1% interest. This would take place over several months in the beginning of 2018, with $800 saved by December of this year. This makes me very nervous, as my financial goals are very important to me but I would prefer to have a sizable emergency fund first. I may decided to use one of my two checks for both November and December to build a fund of at least $1500.

personalfinance,"This has all been said before, but Dave Ramsey's ""arguments"" against credit cards drive me up a wall","I take issue with the claims that ""There is no good reason to have a credit card,"" and more specifically that ""responsible use of a credit card really doesn’t exist."" And yeah, I get it: this advice isn’t for me. This advice is for people who are already in debt. And for those people, it's probably not bad advice. I’d be totally fine if he would say to them “responsible use is possible, but you won’t be ready to try it for a long time.” But he doesn’t do that, so I’m compelled to write this rant. Ramsey tells us ""responsible use"" doesn't exist. An extraordinary claim that Ramsey declines to even try to present evidence for, being content to point out lots of ways credit cards could hurt people when misused and leave it at that. 

[Alright, it actually doesn’t look like this article was written by Ramsey himself, but I’m still taking it as representative of his views, it’s on his site and linked to by many other posts.]

Early on, the article anticipates the objection ""I can pay my credit card off each month. So what’s the big deal?"" and counters with “There is no positive side to credit card use. Even by paying the bill on time, you’re not beating the system.” And then goes into talking about how much credit card debt the average family carries and something about “you’re likely to pay thousands of dollars in interest over the years as you carry a balance.” What does this have to do with the person saying they can pay off their card each month? This bit is a total non-sequitur. The next sentence returns to the possibility of paying the card in full, and we’re informed that with one missed payment “your interest rate skyrockets, you get slapped with fees and it dings your credit.” Come on. Interest rate doesn’t matter if you never carry a balance, and Ramsey and Co. don’t believe credit scores matter (says so later in this article.) So that just leaves fees, but electric bills and rent also have fees for late/missed payments. Adults need to learn to pay bills reliably. This isn’t an argument against anything. 

The next bit about cash-back cards is less an argument, than a shitty attempt at a gotcha. It’s basically: “You think you’re getting this money back, but what about the fees you’re paying? Bet you never thought of that ever!” And if you don’t pay annual fees, this means basically nothing. Look, I don’t doubt there are people in this situation, not realizing they’re getting ripped off… but this isn’t an argument against credit cards, it’s an argument for doing some really freaking simple math before getting one that has a fee. As for rewards in the form of miles, I avoid them myself because it’s less immediately obvious how much what I’m getting back is worth. And I’m afraid travel-specific rewards would incentivize me to take more trips than I should, rather than cash-back which goes into my regular money pool. However! I’m not assuming every person using them is enough of a dullard to not know what they’re getting. Once again, the writer demonstrates that misuse exists (or rather, that misuse is possible) and believes that supports the claim that responsible use doesn’t exist. 

I’ll admit, the bit about credit cards making you spend more is a little fuzzier. Personally, I can demonstrate that I’m paying nothing in interest or fees. I can’t conclusively prove that I’m not spending more than I would with cash or debit only. But I will say the bolded admonition that **“You will spend more if you use credit cards.”** is without support. The evidence that this is even a trend on average is IMO somewhat questionable, but the evidence that this is in effect for every person without fail is non-existent. The article confidently assets that “When you pay cash, you can feel the money leaving your hand,” and that “Flipping a credit card up on a counter does nothing to you emotionally,” which is an extreme oversimplification of the issue. And if it were true that simple, then immediately recommending debit in place of credit makes no sense. Wouldn’t flipping a debit card on the counter also do nothing to me emotionally?

Anyway, thanks for reading. Again, I know this advice isn’t for me, but I still believe it could do good for more people if Ramsey learned some nuance and stopped mixing crappy logic and baseless assertions in with the legitimate stuff.

I am a 21 year old college student desperately needing to move out of my dad's place. I have a potential roommate and we are looking to move in the summer of 2018. 

Here is where my issue is at. Normally, I would have a lot of money in my savings, *just* for this kind of opportunity. Well, my first year away from home for school and I blew **all** of it. I mean I went from 5k in my savings and several hundred in cash to about $400 in my savings and zero cash. I could try to explain it, but all I've got is I'm dumb and this is my life now. 

This summer I had a decent job, but again, blew the money. Plus, I spent about half of it getting repairs done on my car because I got into an accident. And I was depressed so spending money helped me feel better. 

I now have a steady-ish job as a lifeguard. I am making $9.31 an hour, but without consistent hours, I am having a hard time figuring out what my legit income will be a month. I may be up for a promotion soon, and that will make me significantly more money (I hope), and therefore able to free up some cash for saving and paying off a debt to a friend. It's been close to a year since the friend loaned me the money and I need to pay him off ASAP, in addition to saving enough in a decent amount of time to potentially move out this upcoming summer. 

I have an account on Mint, and I used to be good about keeping up with it. I have a credit card from American Eagle, and I know it isn't the best in interest rates, etc., but I know I need the credit, and since it is a Visa, I figure I can use it for gas, turn around and pay it off. No different than if I were to use my debit card, as I'm treating it as if the money is still just automatically coming out of my checking account. 

Is there any tips you guys have for saving up? I am angry with myself I have let it go this far, and I'm desperate to get my finances back in order. Budgeting is important, and since I can't forsee (for the love of God) any big things coming up that will need money, I am mostly looking for ways to keep as much money in my accounts instead of watching it fly out. 

I'm mostly looking for any tips and tricks you guys have found to work well, besides just saying ""budgeting."" It's obviously key, and I get that, I just am looking for any information that can help me sort things out. Is there a way I can be able to calculate how much my check will be after taxes?

* Allocate 50% of income to it until April, so it's filled ~11k of 18k for 2017 (or maybe a little more? not sure how to compute this)
* Scale back the percent with a target of maxing out the 401k for 2018
* Meanwhile slowly pay down student loans. I don't feel any urgency here since 4.5% sounds low after adjusting for inflation, but maybe I am missing something?

Bitcoin,Question about bitcoin and credit markets,"Hi guys,

I recently caught the cryptobug and am getting pretty excited - almost at 1BTC! I've been reading a lot of Andreas and watching videos, reading faqs, etc. 

One question I have, though, is about what a future move toward cryptocurrencies would do to the credit markets. The reason why banks can lend people money at relatively low interest rates is because they hold people's monies for even lower interest rates. If banks don't hold deposits, then they can't make loans. If they can't make loans, many folks can't purchase homes, automobiles, refinance student loans into lower interest rates, etc. That might not sound like a problem now since if we really do make it to the moon, we might not need to take out loans (haha). But assuming bitcoin is adopted on a mass scale and the price stabilizes, people will still need to borrow money. 

One argument might be for peer-to-peer lending, but I don't think this is going to be a viable solution for a couple reasons: (1) the interest rates are pretty high, because the folks who go to peer-to-peer lenders are people who don't have access to traditional lending/loans. Furthermore, because the providers of capital are taking on more risk (since they're not the ones who are doing the underwriting), they'll demand a higher return. A bank that has done its own underwriting and has access to secondary markets can offer a better rate. (2) Who would make loans to people at 4-5% when you can HODL and make more? 

I know there's a lot of hate toward banks, but one thing they do well is to aggregate and provide capital. Without a central institution holding deposits, how will bitcoin replace the credit markets?

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is kind of like a Bank. (x-post r/Bitcoin),"Hi, guys.

I was musing while going around this subreddit; it struck me a very mild but stark analogy, between the two. Banks and Bitcoin.

Now I have a bit of amount invested into BTC too, just to be clear.

It struck me how in banking there is a central authority to handle all the transactions; and it's centralised in a way that they are under a single institution.

Namely the Corporation whose bank it is and then higher up an organ of the State, much like the Federal Reserve Bank in America, under whose jurisdiction it functions and then finally the Government that passes orders and laws.

*Sometime in the favour of the common man, sometimes in disafvor.*

Much akin to this, aren't what some corporations that are adhering to rules such as 'a majority hash rate chain' or 'the chain with the most accumulated difficulty' will gain the BTC ticker after a certain period of time elapses, doing the same thing.

This regardless of the outcome is indeed a terrifying situation. Just because of the sheer level of centralisation this is.

With this they hand over to the miners the power to decide rules governing our transactions, in clout.

Am I mistaken in thinking that if miners continue to signal S2X, then they will mine that chain starting form the 494784th block, and if this happens in majority, it'll cripple the BTC network since exchanges and consequently 'trade' of this certain commodity will prove cumbersome and futile.

Thus making it inefficient as a method of currency and consequently resulting in a crash?

Now I see with S2X this pushes the centralisation to a whole new level. In the hands of a few **very popular** exchanges, namely Coinbase, and a bunch of geeks selling their custom Bitcoin mining chips (read:ASIC) functioning under a very regulatory state, China.

If I could change the headline a little to incorporate more what I was trying to say I'd write:* **""Okay reddit, let's talk about using Series I Bonds as (at least part of) an emergency fund.""**

*****

I decided to write this, this morning, because in this environment if I'm able to encourage at least one person to buy safe low-risk individual savings bonds where they wouldn't have before, I'll feel like I've done some good.

If I'm like most of you, a lot of us have come of age in a very low-interest-rate low-inflation environment. Even for those of us who haven't, it's hard to remember what a high-interest rate / high inflation environment is like. 

Combined with changes in how government bonds are issued, it's not surprising that there is little if any discussion of government bonds either here on /r/personalfinance or /r/investing (not to mention the YOLO culture of /r/wallstreetbets that has started to permeate everything, including /r/cryptocurrency).

Government bonds are not sexy. They come with names like Series I and Series EE that I still have to look up every time to remember what each does (and I'm not even going to get into marketable government bonds that individuals and institutions can buy and sell to each other, which are probably more safely invested in for most of us through low-cost ETFs). Even worse, now they also mostly have to be bought through a [wonky and non-user-friendly treasurydirect.gov website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/). 

Still with the stock market and home prices at historical highs, and people gambling with money left and right as if there's no tomorrow, I think it's worth strongly considering what has historically been one of the safest places to park your money: U.S. government-backed individual savings bonds. 

Again a lot of people are invested in marketable government-backed bonds through ETFs and mutual funds, but the government also gives any resident with a social security number the right to buy up to $10,000 in Series EE and $10,000 in Series I bonds a year ($15,000 if you [use your tax refund to get up to $5,000](https://www.irs.gov/refunds/using-your-income-tax-refund-to-save-by-buying-us-savings-bonds) in paper Series I Bonds), both of which give you benefits you're unlikely to find anywhere else. 

[Series EE bonds have a guaranteed rate of at least 3.5% if you're willing and able to hold them for 20 years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcprosser/2012/03/22/how-to-earn-3-5-on-a-us-savings-bond-2/). I personally think that's a pretty good deal for an investment with that low a risk, and I've been buying more of them as the stock market continues to climb. Still, if you don't think you'll be able, or are not willing, to park your money away for that long, I can understand why folks would decide against it.

Series I bonds are a different story when you combine them with an emergency fund. One of the biggest worries about holding a lot of cash, most folks should know, is that you're generally losing out to inflation when you do so, not to mention the opportunity cost of investing it somewhere else. Most folks accept those losses when it comes to their emergency fund because they want to be able to access it without the risk of losing it that would come with trying to beat inflation. 

[Series I Bonds are one of the best places to keep at least some of your emergency fund](https://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2016/06/16/why-i-use-savings-bonds-to-fund-my-emergency-account/) because, being indexed to inflation, they take a big part of that worry away. You will have to hold I Bonds for a bit before they're liquid (You can redeem them after a year losing only the last three months of interest and penalty free after 5 years) but you won't lose any of what you originally invested, and then they'll protect you against inflation for decades. 

As long as you're beating the crap interest most savings account pay (1.3% at the highest range, where my Series I bonds are currently at ~2%) you're golden. The best part about it is you don't have to worry about banks changing their interest rates, or them nickel-and-diming you on other stuff. These bonds exist for individuals' benefits, no one else's. 

If I may say, I think that's a big reason this isn't talked about a lot. No big institution profits when we buy individual government bonds, as opposed to a lot of the other savings or investment vehicles most of us use. The only people who profit from this are those who buy these bonds (that can be you!), with the government assuming all of the risk (there's a reason these bonds are capped at $10,000/year). Added bonuses include things like the interest being tax-free if you use it for educational expenses (different than an emergency fund, I know). 

Are I-Bonds the silver bullet emergency fund solution for everyone and everything? No. For example, in a low inflation environment, it's possible to beat Series I bonds in a regular savings account for at least a little while. Putting some of your money away for a year can also be hard. Myself personally? I've experimented with Betterment's emergency fund feature (a mix of 60% bond / 40% stock ETFs that's a bit too risky for an emergency fund IMO), and I've also got about half of mine in a rewards checking/savings account.
 
Still, individual bonds are a government benefit not enough of us with a social security number take advantage of, in my opinion. If the government is willing to pay us money and assume all of the risk, why not take advantage? Seriously, [go to treasurydirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/), navigate that monstrosity of a website, and try it. You can start in increments of as little as $25 

The only way you conceivably lose is if the U.S. government fails. While I know that's more and more of a worry for a lot of us in these times and under this administration, be honest with yourself. If the entire U.S. government goes down the last thing you're going to be worrying about is the $25 you experimented with to buy I Bonds.",finance

personalfinance,Credit card/score advice,"So just under a year ago I had a nearly perfect credit score however that has changed over the past 12 months and I am now down at the halfway mark, just below average. 

Around 12 months ago I got myself a credit card that gave me a £5,000 limit which I thought I would never use and was just going to have it for emergencies and to build my credit rating further. 

However all of a sudden myself and my boyfriend needed to move out of my parents house, and this incurred costs that were unexpected, going up to nearly £4,000 with deposits and rent in advance etc. 

However then our credit card provider increased my limit to £8,000... An additional £3,000 i thought no i could never spend that because i don't need to. 

Then we needed to buy furniture for the flat (plus other stupid small things that add up), so it's getting close to maxing out again. 

We are collectively paying off about £300 a month and also present interest rate runs out and about 12 months time. This credit card is in my name alone so my partners spending does not affect his credit score so it's only my credit score that i'm concerned about. 

I realise that £300 a month is not enough to clear the debt totally before 12 months is up... 

Our original plan was to get a 0% balance transfer card once our 0% purchase card had expired. However, I'm now starting to panic that because my credit score is so low now that the offers will not be available to me or I will be rejected for anything that I apply for. 

I have been offered a credit card that has a high interest rate, I've been pre approved for it so I have a 100% chance of being granted this credit card. Now if I did go for it I would not be using it I would just be applying for it to have it so that my overall credit limit was higher and therefore my percentage of credit used would be lower. However, I don't know if this would improve my credit score as I would hope... or if it would make it worse because I'm applying for credit again. 

And that is why I'm looking for advice because I told myself that I wouldn't get into the same situation my mother did but it appears the apple does not fall far from the tree, and we've had a certain set of circumstances that have forced my hand with using the credit card much much much more than I originally anticipated and wanted to. 

If I have not thought of anything that would be a better idea please let me know. 

I would like advice on whether I should go for this high-interest credit card at this point in time if this would likely improve or destroy my credit score further. 

It isn't feasible for us to pay any more than £300 a month between us because my mental health has made it so that I need to switch from full to part-time work and so what was easy for us to pay off is now the limit for us really. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated, and I look forward to hearing any theories or advice that can be offered. 

Thank you in advance.",finance

I'm currently in the middle of a move that should lower my cost of living (dramatically lower rent, but a slightly longer commute, should still come out on top from what I've figured). The debt I have is a car loan with $12k to pay off  and student loans with $33k to pay off. My current plan has been paying minimal payments on car and expediting student loans, as they have a higher interest rate.

Now, onto my question. I've been informed that come November, I'm going to retroactively get a pay increase, which is going to give me a nice little immediate infusion of money as well as decently larger paychecks (about 20% pretax larger) moving forward. The timing is fantastic with my move and the holiday season quickly approaching.

My current plan for the cash influx is to replenish some of my savings that was eaten in the move, and give myself a small treat of a nice night out with my girlfriend. Even so, I should have some left over. What should I do with the remaining? Increase my savings, put it towards debt, or put it in retirement? I'm leaning towards savings and use the raise for student loans going forward, but putting a couple month's worth payment towards student loans sounds so satisfying.

Moving forward, I'm planning to try to live as frugally as I have been, increase what I'm putting towards retirement, and try to pay off my debt faster. Is it a better idea to expedite paying off debt, or should I focus more on increasing savings?",finance

From May until the end of July, I earned $5,175.25, on which $709.67 was withheld in taxes (OASDI/Medicare/Fed/State).

On August 1st I moved back to Tennessee where I have been earning $4,000/mo as an independent contractor working full time with a startup. The company itself is not particularly secure funding wise, thus I have never known if next month's income is a guarantee. Because of this, I have struggled to determine how much I need to prepay for estimated taxes. I also received a $3,700 stipend for this semester from the university I attend which I believe is taxable since I do not pay tuition.

I did some research on [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/small-business-taxes/estimated-taxes-common-questions/L1luHqVdl) to determine that I already missed the payment period for the $4,000 I earned in August, but I guess income from September through December is due on January 15th.

Should I pay some amount for the previous period now? If so, how would I calculate this on my income? Will I have to pay a fine because of this delay? I assume for the final period I can just complete my taxes and pay exactly what I owe?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my wife's student loans now or wait?,"I got happily married about a year ago and since then my wife and I have been merging finances. We put her student loans on autopay for what was suggested by the website (Nelnet).

We are both in our early 30s (no kids and no plans to have kids), own our own home, no credit card debt, and have a few personal loans along with her student loans.

Unfortunately her student loans total at about $39K. Right now we are paying $314.16 a month at an interest rate of 5.625%. I'm not sure if my calculations are right, so I went and did an online calculator which told me it would take 16-17 years to pay off, and we would end up paying about $20K in interest over the span of the loan. Is this correct? Man that seems like a lot of wasted money.

Right now I have about $110K in a RothIRA and about $30K in a 401K through work. We went through a bit of a rough patch recently since she lost her job and it ate through all of our savings. Now she has found a new job that we are hoping will turn permanent after about 6-8 months.

Now my personal loans total about $18K with no interest, and we pay only about $400 a month on those. I realize this is low but our parents are very understanding of our situation, and as long as we're paying them monthly they are fine with it.

My thought (which I don't know if it's good or not) is to use my Roth to pay off all the student loans to help avoid a lot of the interest. That would free up some money (and the weight off my mind) to help pay back faster on our personal loans.

The other side to this coin is that I haven't been able to max out the Roth every year. Now that she has a job, I'm hoping we can build back up our savings some and start putting more money into the Roth account.

I guess my dilemma is, do I wipe out the student loans for good at the cost of my RothIRA? If I'm able to max out the Roth every year I think that would get it back up relatively fast.

My husband and I have been living with my parents since January to save money and pay off debt (mostly student loans). 

However, because of some issues we have been told we need to move out by the end of the year. 

Our plan had been to stay here to finish paying off debt, and then save to buy a house. 

However, this puts a little kink in the plans. 

We’ve looked at places to rent in the area, and have been having a lot of trouble finding somewhere with a garage/shed/workspace for under $1800.  My husband has to have the work space for his job. 

We have a dog and two cats as well, and many of the apartments have monthly pet fees ($50-$100 per animal per month).  A lot of the homes we’ve looked at don’t have that fee, and also have the work space. 

However, if we rent we will never be able to save enough money to buy a house. 

My thought was to take a loan from my 401k for the down payment/closing costs, and use the money we have in savings for an emergency fund if there’s anything that needs fixing. 

What would be the downsides of this? My job is pretty secure. I have zero concerns about the potential of losing my job.

We have about $6,000 left on a credit card that we stupidly used to pay some debt from an accident my husband was in last year, thinking we’d be reimbursed, but never were.  Student loans are 5.55% interest rate and credit card is 4.25% (promotional apr that expires at the end of the year before bumping up to 19%). I’m really gunning to pay off the credit card by the end of the year. 

We have about $5,000 in savings. I know it’s not enough but it was wiped out because of the accident and we’ve just been slowly building it back up while trying to pay off other debt.  I don’t want to touch that unless we have to. We have about $1,200 in a “car savings” fund, again which I’m trying to keep. 

So, this leaves us about $2,800 each month to throw at the debt. We’ve been doing this so far this year and have paid off a lot of debt, and I’ve been feeling really good about our situation until we got this move out notice.  We will of course try to see if we can work things out but I want to have a plan done if/when we actually have to move. 

When we move, I figure our expenses will add the following:

Rent: $1,800 (+$300 for pets?)
Utilities: $200-300
Renters insurance: $50

And then when the babies are born and I have to go back to work in six weeks we will have child care expenses. 

The least expensive quality option I’ve found is about $800/month. 

This completely wipes out that extra $2,800. Plus I’m not even figuring in extra costs for two babies which I’m sure is at least $200/month. 

Really that puts us under $450/month. I’m sure there’s place we can cut spending or ways to make up that extra (like my husband picking up side work) but again, would just have us breaking even. 

I don’t see a way we can save to ever buy a house that way. 

However, if we did a 401k loan, the mortgage plus PMI would be about $1,500/month for the areas we’re looking at buying, and those homes have been showing a drastic increase in appraisal value over the last three years, with projections only increasing further. (Homes that we’re selling for $80k three years ago are now $150k, homes that were $150k are now $300k, etc. I know they won’t continue to increase that much, but they will a bit)

We’d still have the other same costs, but at least we’d be exactly breaking even at the start, and any spending cuts or side work we’d do could just go towards continuing to pay off the student loans, and once those are done it’s $500/month freed up. 

Is this a terrible idea? What are the downsides I haven’t thought of? Do we have any other options?",finance
personalfinance,How I recovered my credit from a 440,"This is strictly my experience but if it can help anyone it'll be worth me writing it out. 


To start things off, I had a lot of debt go into collections from my own bad decisions and helping out my family before I took care of my own responsibilities. So I'll add that as my first step because the amount of ""family member did XYZ and now I'm paying for it"" on this sub is absolutely unfortunate to say the least. I'm going to write this as if I'm currently writing to my 18 year old self.


1) Take care of you first as much as possible. I was helping my mom, my sister and my ex wife live a life style none of us could afford. I guess 1a can be live within your means, which I feel should go without saying but I'm going to say it anyway. 

2) Get a secure credit card. What's that? You give the bank money, and however much you give them is your line of credit. I have one with USAA for $250. I use it for things like gas, I don't exceed 30% of my credit limit, and I never miss a payment. This is the foundation for my current credit score. MAKE SURE THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY REPORTS MONTHLY. Company's can report as frequently as they want. If you make your payment every month and the company only reports quarterly or annually, your credit score will only go up 4 times or once respectively. If you pay your bill every month make sure you get credit for it (pun absolutely intended). 

Once your credit score hits about a 515 you'll start to get offers for other credit cards. DO NOT TAKE THEM. 

Edit: I used USAA specifically because I already bank with them. Another user recommends Discover since it can graduate to an unsecured card.


3) Pay your debt. We're going to do this in a few steps after you get your credit report (it's free to check your own credit and does not hurt you to do so. Use credit karma or similar sites):

Edit: for debt that has not been sent to collections, pay off debts with larger interest rates first. If possible, consolidate under one debt with a very small interest rate. For debt that is in collections, use the following:

3a) For smaller debts (&lt;$500) dispute them. Credit Karma let's you do it right through the app. Most companies won't put forth the energy to fight it and will just let it go. Also, dispute claims you know are false. I had about 2 on my credit report.

Edit: okay a lot of people are commenting on the moral implications of this. Yes, lying is bad. So is predatory debt collecting. If you're debt is with the original account holder this won't work to begin with, and you should try to resolve with a payment plan before it hits collections. However, once a debt collector has it that means they paid pennies on the dollar to try to squeeze out as much as they can from you. Sometimes they'll be alright with writing it off, and other times they'll settle for a smaller amount. 

3b) For larger debts (&gt; $500) call the debt collector and see if you can settle for a smaller amount. Be prepared to pay all at once. A $3,000 debt can turn into a $1,500 debt. 

3c) For debts that can't be lessened or disputed (student loan debts, etc) set up a payment plan. Make sure it's and amount of money you can afford. $10 a month is more progress than $0 a month. The debt collector will try to make you make larger payments. Don't. This debt is already in collections. It can't get worse. Pay what you can. If you're able to pay it off, do so. But don't make ridiculous payments at the expense of your well being. 


4) Once your credit score is above a 640 apply for a personal loan. The less money the better. Do this and make the minimum payment. Ride the payment out to term. This will develop your credit history. You WILL pay interest, but it's a small price to pay to improve your credit. If you're smart you'll leave that money alone and it will pay itself off, minus the interest. 

This is important because credit card debt only applies to about 30% of your total credit score. A personal loan will make up the rest of it.

DISCLAIMER
A vehicle loan is considered a personal loan. DO NOT finance a vehicle at this point unless you absolutely have to. Your interest rate will be outrageous. Take the bus, bike, walk, car pool. Do whatever you have to to keep that car payment as far away from you as possible. 

5) Save save save. Save as much money as  you can while you're doing everything else.


If anyone with more experience wants to add to this, please do. I'll edit as appropriate.


Edit: I've addressed some issues in this thread, mainly moral implications.",finance
personalfinance,Tired of money stress all the time,"Hi everyone,

I need help. I start out each paycheck with a good amount of money, but by the end of my pay period, I'm into negative numbers in my checking account. I need to learn to adjust my budget to 

I'm 26. I have a pretty well paying job ($80,000 per year), I live in the bay area but found a pretty good deal on housing ($1400 a month for my dog and I, just a little over a 1/3 of my take home each month). However, I was dumb in college—I ran up my credit card and let it spiral out of control.

I just recently took out a personal loan to alleviate the situation. Cut the interest rate significantly, but it's added a $380 bill to my monthly commitments, on top of a $270 student loan bill, a $150 auto loan bill, and various home utilities.

What's the worst is that because I have almost no money left over from my paychecks, I have to buy groceries on my credit card. You see where this is going.

So now I'm stuck in a cycle of trying to pay off my credit card as fast as possible (One of which is already approaching $3k) and then being left with no money at all. There's a little light at the tunnel, with my car payment being completed in a few months, but I still just don't make enough to cover my commitments.

I'm drowning. I don't have a savings account. I barely have an investment account, just because my company has employment perks with a financial investment group—and I just started that this year, and I only put $100 a month toward it. I put money into my 401K, which I guess is silver lining. But I honestly just want to put a bullet in my brain every time I see my checking balance boomerang from $400 to -$85 because a few bills hit during one week. And since I have so many obligations, trying to space them out has been a fruitless gesture in the past.

The common sense feedback is ""just spend less money,"" but I don't know how I can do that. I already don't go on trips that all my friends go on because I'm short on money. I ditch out on friends' expensive birthday dinners because I can't afford it. My girlfriend and I never do anything, or so she tells me all the time. I buy groceries and cook at home every week. I've foregone a gym membership because the extra expense is too much. I have a budget, and even cutting out all unnecessary expenditures (even with cutting my grocery bill in half to $80 a month, which is absurdly low in this area), I'm still left with a -$45 net income. I honestly don't know what I would spend less on.

What can I do? How can I fix the staying awake with the dread of my finances? How can I find a moment of solace without the crushing weight of all my debt dogpiling on me?

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,I need some advice with inheriting debt.,"My mother is dying with Alzheimer's. I'll be inheriting her house but apparently also the debt attached. She got scammed by a Solar Company about five or six years ago in her early stages of Alzheimer's for $30,000 to install solar equipment that to this day doesn't do anything and never did. At about 18% interest rate there's still about 17,000 outstanding. Since the loans taken out (2 for 15k) we're for improvements to the house I guess they can put a lien on the house which is why I say I would be inheriting debt. Other than just paying the $17,000 off to avoid paying these ridiculous interest rates what are my other options? If they would settle for a certain amount of cents to the dollar to payoff the loan how do I go about negotiating that and for what amount? Would it be smart to just open a new line of credit in my name that has a low interest rate? I have an 800 credit score but I don't have $17k laying around. I'm assuming there's some other ideas that are probably even better than what I can think of which is why I'm here asking for advice.",finance

gaming,Issue with poor customer service from UbiStore with Assassins Creed Preorder,"This was the message I sent Ubisoft after I got fed up with all their stalling and excuses with what was happening with my 130$ preorder and why it is late for Assassins Creed Origins. :
                            

 Hello, Back in Early this year of the month of June, the Assassins Creed Origins Preorder was announced along with all the bundles and different ways we can preorder the game. Back then, I was a huge Ubisoft fan/supporter because I love the franchises/games you create like Assassins Creed. So, when ACO came out, I jumped on the bandwagon to buy my physical copy of the game early, the Gold steel book edition to be specific. I could’ve easily bought the game anywhere else from Amazon, BestBuy, etc. But Because I was thankful/wanted to support Ubisoft and their content creators/developers, I preordered the game directly from the UbiStore. And I’m sad to say it turns out that was a big mistake on my part. 
                        

  A week ago, I started hearing from people that early shipments of the game were being released in places like Australia, UK etc. I was very excited and thought maybe I would get my copy of the game early. Especially since the invoice/receipt for my order said the estimated delivery date was set to 10/26/2017. That turned out to be a complete falsehood. As the days started to pass by with the official launch of the game inching closer and closer, I checked my email as well as the UbiStore to see what the status of my package was. 
My situation is a little dire because I’m having this preorder to be delivered to my brother in Illinois while I’m here visiting. And I’m scheduled to leave abroad for studies by the end of this month. I was hoping I could get the game on time to spend some time playing it with him before I leave, which it turns out may never happen.
                 

  When it was the 24th and I had still not received a confirmation email of any kind or a tracking number I became very very worried. I contacted UbiSupport around 4 times on separate days asking for any kind of information. What’s the status of my package? Is the Order even going to ship out on time and be delivered on or before launch day? When can I expect a tracking number? Basic and reasonable questions like these went on unanswered by all the many Ubisoft employees I contacted, and I received no information on my preorder. I was essentially left in the dark with no knowledge of the delivery since June of early this year to this day as I contact you. I paid around $130 for a “pre-order” from the UbiStore to receive my package on time and to support the company/devs that I appreciate. But in the end, I will not receive my order on time nor was I given the common customer courtesy of knowing where my package was, how to track it, and if it was going to come delayed. 
             

  In any other situation or with any other company/business that respects its customers enough to admit when they are in the wrong or made a mistake, they would reimburse the customer in some way with either a coupon, discount, free code etc. In this case, places like Amazon, BestBuy are giving customers whose orders are being delayed free digital copies and even free gold memberships for online gaming. That Is the excellent kind of customer service that I would also expect of Ubisoft. But I’ve already read the return/refund policy on the site and It seems that I will not be having the same kind of respect/courtesy. 
I Didn’t want anything free out of this. I only wanted to get the game I PREORDERED months ahead of time to come delivered on time free of hassles, confusion, and anxiety so I could play it with my brother before I have to Leave. But Instead I wasted months of my time and a good amount of money to pay for a service/game from the developers only to have the game unnecessarily delayed and given no indication/knowledge of the status of my package. 
                

 At the end of all this, it seems that unless some type of complimentary service is given to salvage the relationship I have with Ubisoft for this entire horrible experience, I believe I can never in good faith continue to stay a supporter. If I should ever need to buy a game, it seems that I need to rely on the services of more reliable companies with better customer friendly policies like Amazon. No one should have to go through such a frustrating and deceptive time when they’re paying for a service whose whole point is to be delivered on time ahead or on schedule.",technology
personalfinance,About to Drop 75k on Flight School. Advice?,"Long story short, in my early 30's, I've got both a bachelors and masters degree in aviation and have worked in the airlines for the past 5 plus years, loving almost every minute of it.  Recently tried something outside the airlines that I didn't enjoy, so I quit last week and decided to just go to Flight School in January.  I needed a couple months to relax anyway.  

Flight School for Private Pilot/Instrument/Commercial/Multi-Engine/Flight Instructor = $65,500 + Examiners Fees + Equipment (headset, charts, etc) + potential costs overruns, I'm looking somewhere in the realm of 75k.  Before anyone tells me how dumb I am for going to flight school, read the news story below and see the link for Air Wisconsin's FO salaries.  If they're this desperate now, they'll be more desperate in 2 years.  

https://www.flyingmag.com/costs-training-time

http://www.airwis.com/content/pilots/PilotBubble.pdf

The 75k figure of course does not include living expenses, and as I won't have a salary, it will be more difficult to live than usual.  Thankfully I've got some decent assets, but I can't figure out the best scenario for my situation. My assets/plan for this are below.  Feel free to tell me where I'm being an idiot.

Assets and Debts

•	Inherited Ira – Just under 200k.  – Planning to take out 100k to pay for half of flight school and living expenses.  Since I start flight school in January, I’m planning to take all 100k out in December.  I’m going to have to pay for my own healthcare, so I think I might be eligible for an ObamaCare subsidy if I barely have any income next year

•	Student Loan 1 – Approved for 38k for a private student loan at 8.8% fixed over 10 years for flight school.  I know this rate seems high, but most lenders won’t finance a private flight school loan anymore, and essentially this is a “certificate” program that is not associated with any college or University.  My plan is to use around $33,000 of this amount to pay for part of the training costs, although I’m not sure, since I have alternative means of paying available.
  
•	House 1 (Primary Residence) – Have about 40k in equity, payment is $975 a month at 3.63%.  Don’t want to deal with setting up a home equity line of credit.  I have 2 extra bedrooms I believe I can rent out for $550 a month, so I would essentially be paying my mortgage.  (Current roommate pays $500 but is leaving next month).  After flight training I will likely sell it, the market here only seems to be getting better.  If I used the student loan, I would use the sale proceeds to pay the student loan off.  

•	House 2 (Inherited Residence) – Own half a house with my brother.  My share of rent is approximately $400 a month.  

•	Car - $435 a month payment.  Paid off completely come January

•	401K – Approximately 28k between a Roth and Regular Account

•	HSA - $6.5k balance

•	Checking – Approximately 10K or so.  Probably 7-8k after paying bills

•	Credit Cards – Traditionally have paid off all in full every month

o	2% back Card - $12k+ credit line - $0 balance – 14.99% Interest Rate - $0.00 AF

o	Card 2 – 23k credit limit - $0 balance – 16.99% Interest Rate - $450 AF reduced to $150 after Travel credits. 
 
o	Card 3 – 5% rotating categories – 4k credit limit - $0 balance – 16.99% interest Rate - $0.00 AF

o	Card 4 – 2-3% category – 13k credit limit - $0 balance – 12.24% Interest Rate (Received offer from issuer to reduce interest rate to 6.99% for 1 year, which I think I’ll take) – AF $0.00

o	Card 5 – Applied while still employed – No Rewards but 0% purchase APR for 18 months – 10k+ limit – Haven’t activated yet - $0.00 AF.  I plan on shifting most spending to this card during flight school, carrying a balance, and paying the minimum payment each month.  Interest rate is 14.99% after promotion period.  

My main questions are

1) Should I still take the 100k out of the inherited IRA in December so it will count for this tax year?  

2) Should I take the student loan? 

3) Is it ok to use the 0% interest card for normal expenses during flight school while making the minimum payment?  

4) Any other suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,Is interest rate in debt factored into total debt owed?,"I have 5 loans totalling $12000 right now with an average interest rate of 3.5%. I use Navient. My monthly payment is 144 dollars. If I were to pay off one of those loans in full, would that loan’s interest get knocked off with the loan? So instead of going down to $120 a month, it’d go to like $115 or whatever that interest rate is? Thank you for any answers concerning my question. 

Edit: also if the total is 12000 in the books, is it actually 12000 not including interest? And that interest is calculated into my payment? So if I payed off the whole thing it’d be like paying $130 something dollars a month instead of the 144? Sorry if I’m vague I’ll try and answer any question anyone has.

I then automatically deduct a monthly payment of $400 into a Capital One savings account at 0.96%. 

The result was reducing my student loan balance by $5,000 at a rate a little over 1% vs. 6.96% for 12 months and continued to make my minimum payment as scheduled. I received another offer for the other card I do not use and am thinking about doing the same thing. It appears as if I am going to pay a lower interest rate in small chunks. I realize the risk is I don't pay the advance off in time, but have budgeted and been used to paying the extra $400 per month. My question is, is this dumb? Should I just apply the $400 per month to my loan? If it saves me some interest, I can get the two highest interest loans at 6.96% paid off by 2019.",finance

personalfinance,Should I ask for a raise? (Non-profit),"I started working for a non-profit as a grant writer.  When I started, my goal in 2015 for new grants was 250k.  In 2016 that goal increased to 500k, and was to remain there for an undetermined number of years.  That was determined before I took the job.  At the end of this calendar year, my goal as stated when I took the job would be to have reached 1.25M in grants.  As of today I've brought in 3.92M in grants, with a good chance of adding 300k to that next week when we hear back about a fairly sure thing grant.  I make 51k a year, which means that my employer's current cost: benefit ratio is about 3:100, meaning that they receive $1 in grant revenue for every 3 cents they pay me.  The company has no 401(3)(b) match. 

The company has no 401(3)(b) match.  I got a small cost of living increase (company wide) in 2016.  Aside from this I recently started working from home 3 days a week.  I live an hour away.  My wife and I have a child and I am able to watch him those three days, which has saved a lot on child care.  The option to work from home was presented to me very early on, but I'd not taken advantage of it until my son was born this year.  I estimate that it has to be saving me at least 5-10k a year, not to mention fuel savings.  

Anyway, I am not sure if I want to press it.  I am saving a lot of money working from home...and a penny saved is a penny earned in this case.  I am also not the only person who makes the grants happen.  My role is fairly limited to reviewing requests for proposals (federal, state, county, foundation) and writing the proposal.  I view what I do as some combination of a writer, information collector, and project manager.  Relationship building, for example, is done by someone else.  I have a hand in program design, but I mostly stick to making sure I understand what needs to be communicated in a proposal and making sure it comes across well.  Some of my proposals take a week to do and are really short, others are 100 page month long nightmares.  

I've had 2 or 3 performance reviews, in which both say something to the effect of ""meets expectations"" which is 2nd to ""exceeds expectations"".  I think the difference is that the latter one has to ""anticipate needs of others/organization"".  I figure though, my job is somewhat unique in that there is a very simple metric to which I can be measured...the almighty dollar.

We have $100K in liquid savings and 100K in retirement savings.  Existing mortgage on rental home $92K at 4.5%.  Student loans $30K at 2.5%.  No other debt.  Income is $400K, with contractual raises coming for the next two years, $540K in 2018, and will level off around $620K in 2019.  

We are DINKs (double income no kids) who live a very frugal life, our current budget which includes debt servicing, insurance, food, gas, car maintenance, charity, fun, and travel is $5,000/month.  We do hope to have children in the future.  

We do not wish to completely deplete our savings on a down payment.  We are afraid the house is going to sell because it is a steal for what it is, so we do not want to wait until we have additional savings, plus we need a house to move into where we will be starting work across the country.   I believe closing costs will be between $12K and $15K if my estimate is correct.  This leaves us a little short on having 20% down.  We have a few options to pick from including a physician loan with no down payment or PMI, with a slightly higher interest rate of about 4%.  I understand another option is an 80/10/10 loan, or a 7/1 ARM.  

After moving in, we would focus on rebuilding e-fund/savings back up to current levels, fully fund 401k each year, and aggressively pay off the house/save.  Maybe we are being overly cautious, it just seems crazy to us to spend nearly half a million dollars, both growing up in families that had a hard time scraping by financially.  This house is in a very rural area where the average home cost is $82K.  We have both studied for a very long time practicing delayed gratification, and it feels wrong to reward ourselves by purchasing what seems like an extravagant home to us. Would love to have any advice the PF community has to offer!",finance

personalfinance,Hello from r/personalfinancecanada! Can you help me understand 30/60 day accounts with interest?,"I am building a house and have set up 3 accounts for different types of materials I needed. All the accounts are either on 30 or 60 day net terms, with interest on an outstanding balance after that time. Interest is from 1-3%. I will be getting the funds from my mortgage. 

As always. Some extra costs have come up, small things that I never included in my quotes and other small problems along the way. 

What I’m asking is, if I owe company X $10,000 and after 60 days I only have $7,000 from my progress payment, is the outstanding balance just charged the said interest rate and I pay it off next month?

If this is possible it would save me a lot of panic and credit card or other high interest debts. 

For an example, here is the terms of one the accounts “I agree to pay all Invoices in accordance with the terms stated herein net 60 days, including finance charges of 1% per month on the amount of any overdue balance”

Bitcoin,"Investing in Bitcoin monthly, what is the easiest and cheapest way possible from abroad?","I'm a US Citizen living outside of the US but my job and all bank accounts are in the US. I'm looking for a way to purchase a set amount of bitcoin every month ($250 maybe) online with the least fees and best exchange rate. What would be the best way to go about this? I'm also interested in cold storage. It doesn't need to be an automated setup just looking for the best way to buy bitcoin online, with my US bank accounts, online. Thank you.

Ended up going with Coinbase as Kraken doesn't support my state. I've already linked my account and ID's and purchased $250. This cost almost 4 bucks in fees then the rate seems lower than market.

Anything I need to watch out for with CB? I guess the long time to clear the money (8 days, will it come sooner?) is fine since I'm trying to invest long on BC, but it does kinda suck. Buying with debit card seems to be a rip another 2.5% + the high fees and shitty rate + a Cash Advance fee. I have a card with PenFed with no Cash Advance fee, and you can make an immediate payment to avoid interest, would this be a good option?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,HELP consolidating credit cards,"So recently I found out that my Dad is awful with finances. He is within 20 years of retirement and I'm pretty sure he has no money in savings outside of the equity in his home.

After attempting to commit suicide a couple days ago (over many relationship problems, financial problems, and job loss), this has all begun to come out. He has $5k in credit card debt @ 13% interest rate. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure his credit score must be awful because he seems to have no concern using credit cards like cash and constantly takes out new ones after eventually paying off old ones.

I'm a finance major so ofcourse this comes as a shock to me and I'm going to take extra effort to educate him on how to budget, invest, and make realistic goals towards retirement.

He's in this mindset where credit cards are nothing to worry about, he also has insane goals of taking out a $2m mortgage for a 10 bedroom house and he will rent out most of the rooms to pay it. He loves buying lottery tickets, spending money on useless things, etc.

I can educate him but how can I convince him to change his ways?? He is seeking help from a therapist so I think he's ready to change but I don't know if he's even being totally honest with me or if he will change. I also don't want to make him feel too guilty seeing as he's a bit mentally unstable right now but I want him to know how much stress this has on our family.

Furthermore, what are our options to get a lower interest rate? Are there any cards we can transfer this balance to for a lower rate (bare in mind his awful credit)? This is in Canada btw. Thanks for any help.",finance
personalfinance,"Sister asked me how much I'm saving. Looked at my finances, I need to get my shit together. Any advice?","So backstory, my younger sister and I were talking about possibly taking our parents to a cruise either this Christmas or summer 2018. We then started talking about our finance and she was asking how much money I was saving a month because she wanted to figure out if she was saving enough. That's when it hit me that I'm too careless with money. 

I lied as I was ashamed. My sister looks up to me and I didn't want her to think any less of me. I do know that I need help though. I told her I was putting in $500(but in reality I am not) a month and she asked why it was so low (we both know how much we make annually). She saves $1,500 a month living in New York. I know I basically fucked myself for spending way too much money. Money I don't even have by maxing out credit cards. I'm slowly paying them off but I feel like there's a more efficient way in doing so. I'm thinking about consolidating all my loans through a federal union as they have low APR.

Thoughts on how I should approach this?

Breakdown of monthly expenses: https://imgur.com/a/WHy7m

I have way more expenses than on the picture but starting this week, I will do my best to stick to a budget. I will also start writing down all expenses to ensure I can hold myself accountable if I end up spending more than my budget. 


EDIT: 
I get paid twice a month. Thus the frequency next to it = 2. Sorry about that. 

Car situation: I moved to the US roughly 6 years ago. Went and finished school here for about 3 years. We needed an extra car at the time because of schedule situation.

personalfinance,Anyone willing to offer me some career/financial advice?,"Okay here it goes. I'm posting on mobile for the first time so please excuse autocorrects that don't make sense!

I'm in my early 30s, married, engineer. I'm currently faced with three very different paths and torn on which one to take.

**Path 1**: stay at my current job. My husband works remotely and earns right around six figures. I make a comfortable six figures. However, I hate my job, we live in an expensive place (SF), and my company just announced layoffs (I'm about 85% sure I will not be laid off).

**Path 2**: go back to where my husband's company is, he takes a promotion. We own a home there, it's fairly cheap to live there. Main downside is that there isn't any work for me there (I have a PhD, so the only real option for me there is giving up my work and turning to academia -- ick -- or figure out a way to pivot into a completely different industry). Also, we'd have to pay for relo ourselves but it would probably be around $5k out of pocket.

**Path 3**: go to the other side of the country for a job I love. My husband continues to earn around six figures and works remotely. The downside is that it's a federal job so it's about a 50% pay cut for me, brings me back to a GS12 step 1 (so I lose all my gains from work experience) and we'd have to fund our own relo (to the tune of about $10k -- we would have to ship our stuff, we couldn't just really a uhaul). They are saying pay and relo are non negotiable.

Path 2 makes the most financial sense but on the personal side suuuuucks. My husband doesn't love his job, he works to earn money and provide but that's about it. He would rather retire early but that counts on me having a job. I'm really passionate about my work (I love my technical work here but my company is terrible and my boss is a creep) but I am geographically restricted. If we choose that path I think we'd be fine in the short term but unhappy in the long term.

Path 3 is the most palatable to me career wise but I just can't swallow taking THAT big of a paycut AND blowing a hole in our savings. I would earn less than my husband did when he was fresh out of grad school with no work experience...10 years ago. 

And path 1... Well I can't keep working here. When they announced layoffs my first instinct was to hope it was me. And then I was pulled aside with a few others and told not to worry, we're overtasked as is but we'd probably lose our overtime and bonuses. I was actually sad that my head isn't in the chopping block.

I am working on a path 4 but nothing has panned out yet.

Any advice? Anything I'm overlooking?",finance
personalfinance,Am I saving the best way for grad school?,"Some background: currently make a little less than $60K/year, no debt. I'm planning to go to business school full time in two years, so I have been saving for that in a Navy Federal savings account. Currently have about $50K in savings, $15,000 in 401K (contributing 10% from my pre-tax salary). Is there any better vehicle for me to be saving rather than just a savings account? I do know that I'm going to need to pull this money out in two years, so wasn't sure what my options were for the best return that would still be accessible for withdrawal so soon.

Also, I don't currently have any other retirement accounts other than the 401K. Would it be better to max out an IRA each year and have $11K less saved or wait until after I graduate? Alternatively, I could also increase the 401K contributions (for reference though - I am 24 years old, so my contribution % is already fairly high for someone my age). Appreciate any advice or input.",finance
personalfinance,How will my taxes change with a child?,"Hi Everyone,

So up until my wife and I got married in 2015 we both claimed single 0 and got fairly sizable returns each year on our taxes (I know stupid to lend the government money at 0%, but we just considered it a nice lump sum on savings).  Anyway, when we got married in 2015 her employer switched her over to Single 1, and mine stayed at single 0.  We make a combined $112,000.  I think because she got switched over our return went way down and I think we only got $1,200 or so back between state &amp; federal.

We had our daughter in June this year and I was wondering how we can expect this to change our taxes?  I still claim Single 0 and she claims single 1, we file married joint.  Should I be saving daycare information, etc?  Just trying to figure out exactly how to approach this.

Also, one last question.  Right now it is me and my daughter on my health ins policy.  I plan on purchasing her own policy through the ACA during open enrollment (it will be a big savings).  Right now the health insurance is pre-tax, but that changes if I purchase her a policy on the open market right?

personalfinance,Thinking ahead,"I just created a ""finance vision board"" for some of my goals and would like some feedback. 23F. In the next month I'm paying off my Invisalign ($3k left). In the next 6 months I would like to have my new car paid off (5% interest rate, about $8k left). I've got my Roth maxed out for the year at $6k (just opened it a few months ago). I had to dip into my savings for the car purchase, which was sort of an emergency, so that account is at $7k currently.

Now, I'm not sure if I should be contributing to my Roth in 2018 while paying off car debt. If all goes according to plan I'll be done with the loan in March/April. Should I just put every extra dollar toward the car, then focus on maxing out the Roth? Or should I still contribute $458/month to Roth for dollar cost averaging, and take an extra month to pay off the car loan with a little bit extra in interest?

After the car loan is finished I'll be focused on replenishing my savings back to $12-15k. After that, I'm not sure if I should be saving for a down payment on a condo, which I REALLY want to own, or if it's beneficial to invest elsewhere before that. I don't get a 401k at work so I only have the Roth. As much as I want to own my own condo, I don't want to screw myself over and I also know I could withdraw from my Roth for a first time home purchase, correct? This next batch of saving (whether for down payment or other investment) would probably take me 2-3 years, but it's good to know what exactly I'm working towards.

investing,Municipal Bonds: Market overreacting?,"For those not in the know, interest payments from municipal bonds are exempt from taxes. Residents of high tax states (CA, NY) purchasing bonds issued in their own state are often triple exempt - exempt from local, state, and federal taxes, which can significantly increase the net-rate for those in the higher income brackets.

Over the last few days NY bond funds (e.g., NRK, MYN) have seen some large drops over fears that congress will eliminate or limit the tax advantages of municipal bonds. My thought is that even if Congress eliminates the real estate tax and state income tax deductions, they'll likely make an exception for municipal bonds.

What are your thoughts on municipal bonds right now? Is the market overreacting, or are they onto something?",finance
personalfinance,I bought a car. It was a bad idea.,"So in 2015, I had just gotten a promotion at work. It was literally double what I had been making. I'd already been in the market for a new car. I knew what I could afford, but with the new job I could definitely afford it. A friend of mine who's wife is a loan officer who got me approved at a $10,000 loan. I don't remember the interest rate. I went car shopping, and I found a car I really wanted that was more than $10,000 by a little bit. Another friend of mine has a brother who works at a local car dealer. He told me that they do their financing through the same bank as I had done, and that he could run the numbers to see if I could get approved for the new car. I figured why not. He got me approved for the total amount of the car at an interest rate of 10.49%. Gee. Zus. Well I knew my credit wasn't great, and I'd never financed anything. I was only 23. Things kinda get worse from here on out. My ex had me on her auto insurance so I could get the car financed, but then didn't tell me when she removed it. So I was without insurance for a while. Next I lost the job that allowed me to afford my car payments. And finally, the bank realized before I did that I didn't have insurance so they put forced placed insurance on the car at $3,000/year. If I don't get insurance on my car by next year, they'll add it again, and at my interest rate the $3,000 alone will take me 10 months to pay off. I just want to be done with the car, but I now owe $18,000 on a car that's probably worth only $9,000. Help?",finance

personalfinance,Extended - Graduated Repayments,"Just finished grad school in May. My FedLoan Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are about to go into repayment, totaling ~37k. The payments are going to kick in next month and will be $450. I can get a graduated extend repayment plan that turns the plan into a 30 year repayment instead of 20, and will make my payments start out at $204 for two years, then every two years it is graduated (the person I spoke with told me it would be about +$40 a month, but wasn't sure because it would be based on income.)

My wife and I have been very good at paying down debts since I got a post-grad school job, and we could afford the 450 if we had too, but we could also use that extra 200. In every scenario, I plan on paying back all my student loans in the next 15 years.

We're trying to pay down other higher-interests debts and save money to have a baby next year, so this would be a life saver in the short term. Don't know if it makes sense in the long term, but like I said, expect to pay these off early no matter what (have a solid plan to do so.)",finance

personalfinance,Feeling guilty about making purchases,"I'm a recent college grad who just began his new job back in June. I'm making $62k a year, and after all of my expenses, I manage to save between $800 to $1000 a month. I have roughly $58k in student loans and I have a $12k car loan. My car was in bad shape and I recently bought a newer used car since I could afford it. I am already putting $800 a month to save towards a future down payment on a home, and I am paying an extra $200 towards my private loans with higher interest rates. 

My problem is that when it comes to spending money on 'fun' things, I always feel guilty. I budget $200 a month for fun money. I stick to that pretty well. But I never really splurge or get myself anything big. One example is that I put off buying a new $10 water bottle even though mine was broken because I didn't think it was really a need. Recently, I really want to buy a Nintendo Switch. I have 800 in a separate account that I save up for vacations and big purchases, but I can't bring myself to spend any money. I always think, I should just put everything towards my loans, or I should save this in case of an emergency. I just can't break the habit of not wanting to spend money to make myself happier.

Bitcoin,Anarchocapitalism for Ordinary Man: Mining in a High Inflation Environment,"Venezuelan Bitcoin miners demonstrated how ordinary people with a modest capital investment (such as a cryptocurrency-mining rig) can survive and prosper under monetary fascism. Before cryptocurrencies existed, inflation almost exclusively benefited those who cause it (which is why it exists in the first place) - usually the government and those who ""own"" the government.

But armed with a miner or six, now a person can easily borrow a significant amount of energy from the State (a state-owned or state-regulated power company) every month, without having any collateral. 

And in high inflation the said miner doesn't even have to be competitive. Normally he or she would have to earn more than it costs to pay for the electricity, hardware depreciation and other operating and capital expenses. 

However, if the rate of inflation hits 15-20%, even slightly unprofitable miners can become profitable because they get effective state subsidy from the fact that they pay their bills monthly. The higher the inflation in a currency territory, the more of its citizens can profitably mine cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin mining is more competitive and requires dedicated hardware, but it's not out of reach for ordinary people in the West. Other currencies can be mined on regular PCs (with a GPU card). 

After years of ponderous money printing, central banks cannot stop or begin to raise interest rates. Despite their proclamations, money printing will continue until inflation ultimately gets out control. 

This time though, due to the existence and popularity of decentralized cryptocurrencies, inflation will grow much faster and ordinary people (with a computer) will finally be able to profit from it. In 2019, when ""opinion leaders"" begin to strongly promote the idea of ""universal basic income"" (aka Helicopter Money), buy some mining hardware.

We all know it's gonna happen sometime in the next few years, with a state here and there legalizing it until the big federal legalization.

I think America will eventually legalize marijuana on the federal level as more and more states are legalizing it each year. It's only a matter of time before the marijuana growing business really takes off. One can imagine the possibility of the weed industry becoming as mainstream as the alcohol industry, and the profits that would come to those that figured it out first.

Bitcoin,Why I oppose Segwit2X. And why you ought to.,"I don't oppose Segwit2x on the grounds that 2MB blocks are too large. I don't think anybody seriously opposes it on those grounds. I oppose Segwit2x on the basis that this ought not to be the way that we upgrade the protocol. Perhaps contention and controversy is inevitable. But there ought to be widespread community consensus that, excepting critical flaws to Bitcoin, technical changes which threaten to cripple Bitcoin ought to be eschewed.

This hasn't been about blocksize for a while. Anybody who has been paying enough attention to the ebb and flow of arguments back and forth, and thought about the way that the Bitcoin system as a whole is defined and operates ought to have realized that. No, this is about how upgrades to the protocol are introduced, implemented and adopted.

------

### History

So let's take a step back and root ourselves in the history of the project.

-  Bitcoin is a software project started by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008; the network came online in January 2009. Satoshi disappeared in 2010-2011. While Satoshi was around no one questioned that as the author of the software he had the right to alter the protocol as he saw fit. No one had to accept his changes (except for the fact the alert system he built into the software allowed him to basically force upgrades) but essentially he owned the Bitcoin trademark (I'm not aware he ever asserted such rights) and could have altered the software as he saw fit.
- While Satoshi was around, he assembled a group of developers to which he handed effective control of the project before disappering. He transferred control of the repositories to Gavin Andreson who became the maintainer (decides what code gets committed) of the Bitcoin project.
- This group of developers eventually became Bitcoin Core and the source code of the ""official"" (uncontroversial at the time) Bitcoin client was eventually moved from Sourceforge to Github. On April 7, 2014, Gavin Andresen stepped down from the position of Core maintainer and nominated Laan as his successor ([source](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wladimir_van_der_Laan)). Wladimir van der Laan became and is the current maintainer of Bitcoin Core.

All of the above is objectively true. Over the course of these shifts in the maintainence of the Bitcoin project--from Satoshi to the community, from Satoshi to Gavin to Wladimir, from Satoshi to sourceforge to github--there has been a great deal of continuity.

----

### What is Bitcoin?

People spent time to think though the existential questions of Bitcoin:

- What is Bitcoin? Who gets to define it?
- How are changes to the protocol decided upon? How are they decided upon? Who gets the final say?
- Who ought to have the right to answer the questions above?

People quickly realized that nobody except for Satoshi had an unimpeachable right to answer all of the above (because he [would] owns the Bitcoin trademark): to define what bitcoin is, to make changes to the protocol, to dictate processes to facilitate the same, essentially to create an organization with the power to do all of the above. This is a common problem in Open Source projects. Who gets to decide what the software is and how to update it? There are different models, but there is a tendency toward [Benevolent Dictators for Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). Satoshi was surely aware of this and he chose, wisely I believe, not to answer any of the above questions. I'm not sure these questions have good answers for a system which is intended for global adoption, in which it is a vital property that no one be able to unilaterally change the system. He disappeared, refusing to bear that burden or to allow people to expect him to. And very importantly forcing people to answer these questions for themselves.

(BTW people moan and groan over the apparent existential crisis that Bitcoin is having as if its a flaw, whereas I believe its part of the intended design. Think about it. Bitcoin is on a path to become something like an intenternational reserve currency/asset. Does anybody on this sub understand how crazy that is? No project or system run (defined/controlled) by an organization which *can* be coerced gets to be in a position like that. The only assets which have gotten into an even remotely similar position in recent history (creation of the Fed) have been Gold and the USD. But I digress.)

-----

### Bitcoin is Software

Bitcoin is, primarily, two things: an open source software project and a permissionless decentralized cryptographically secured ledger. If we are going to say that Bitcoin is permissionless, then it must immediately follow that nobody gets to dictate who or even what software interacts with the Bitcoin network. In this way everyone is always free to define what Bitcoin is for themselves, to run whatever software they like and call it Bitcion. But as a community, it must be very clearly said that no person has a greater inherent right to dictate what Bitcoin is or isn't.  And we must understand this, realizing simultaneously that in order for Bitcoin to be a useful system it must have a clear definition. It is for this very practical reason that, in that absence of a formal specification, what was the Bitcoin-Qt client and what is the [Bitcoin Core client](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) is referred to as the reference implementation of Bitcoin.

It is important to note the continuity with which this has been true. This continuity is the reason why despite much gripe and grumbling about the status quo, the status quo has persisted. This resistance to change is the reason why Bitcoin is anything at all. If this resistance in the face of controversy is relaxed, the markets may or may not respond adversely in the short term, but in the long term disputes over which Bitcoin-derivative is ""the real Bitcoin"" will destroy any hope of widespread adoption as a ""hard asset"".


In the light of all of the above, and without directly or definitively answering any of the questions asked thus far, the Bitcoin reference implementation has continued to be developed as an open source project. Along the way, those developing and maintaining that project have developed processes to allow anybody to contribute subject to review and cross-examination before inclusion into the reference implementation. The broader Bitcoin community has things such as the BIP process to facilitate discussion of changes to the protocol and of standardizing schemes across the Bitcoin ecosystem; etc. .

Now in order to reduce controversy and to minimize existential strife, the Core team has been extremely conservative with regards to what might be considered 'coercive' changes to the reference implementation. By this I mean changes which break or alter Nakamoto consensus and therefore force other people to accept or reject the changes at the risk of fracturing the network. Hard forks are exactly this. The most important part of Bitcoin is necessarily its definition. If the publicly agreed upon definition of Bitcoin is meaningfully and persistently fractured then the network might not die (though it might be temporarily disrupted), but the usefulness of Bitcoin as a global standard might.


--------

This is the most important reason that I oppose Segwit2x. Not because 2MB blocks are too large. Not because the 2x software which has been released is unreliable. But because changes to Nakamoto consensus must only happen when there is sufficiently broad community consensus for the change so as to make it unambiguously and unimpeachably uncontroversial. Otherwise we, as a community are jeopardizing the future success of the project.

----

**EDIT:**

People have pointed out lots of things wrong with my post that didn't occur to me when I wrote it. Was a bit tired. I don't feel it makes sense to address most of them--the post is its own thing now--but there was one point which I think I ought to clarify.

When I said that nobody seriously opposes Segwit2X on the grounds that 2MB blocks are too large, I did not mean what I said. What I said I still believe is correct. 2MB blocks aren't a seriousus issue. But I forgot that due to the way that Segwit works:

- Blocks with transactions not utilizing the witness discount are capped at 1MB
-  Average block size should be 2MB with Segwit (if everybody uses Segwit? not my analysis) accounting for the witness discount on normal transactions
- Witness-only blocks are capped at 4MB max blocks

Segwit2X doubles all of the above numbers. I do believe that 4-8MB blocks are too large. At least before we have better solutions to get the growth in the size of the UTXO set (the real bottleneck to scalability) under control.",cryptocurrency

I used the IRS tax calculator and it shows that I will be owing about $4600 if I do nothing. It recommended that I switch to zero exemptions and withhold $960 until the end of the year. What does this mean and what should I do? I want to owe as little as possible, preferably nothing at all.

A little background info. I’m a single 26 year old with no dependents and I figure I will make about $52k this year before taxes. I get paid biweekly. I contribute to a IRA and will have paid about $400 in student loan interest.",finance
personalfinance,Moved states and income tax is significantly higher: Help me understand the math.,"I've recently moved from Illinois to Missouri and am struggling to understand how I'm paying almost 8% more in income tax than my previous job. Here are sample paychecks from both jobs ($67,600 old vs $81,000 new):

Old job - paid weekly, no overtime:

$1300 gross - $195 401k contribution = $1,105 taxable

* SS: 80.60 (7.3%)

* Medicare: 18.85 (1.7%)

* IL: 41.44 (3.8%)

* **Total tax: 263.76 (23.9%)**

New job - paid *bi-weekly*, no overtime:

$3115.38 gross - $389.67 in combined benefits (186.92 401k, 135.21 medical, 50 HSA, 12.57 dental, 4.97 vision) = 2725.71 taxable

personalfinance,Paying Off Outstanding Loans vs. Average Account Age (Credit Score),"Hello!

I am currently in a position to entirely eliminate my car loan. I currently pay 1.4% interest on a $4400 loan, which has ~$2200 balance, and a $97/mo payment. I've had this loan for 2 years. It is not in any way, shape, or form taxing my financially to make this payment. However, because I do not own the car outright, I have to have full coverage insurance. I have taken advantage of this policy once when someone punched one of my windows out, and as a cautious person I might consider keeping full coverage, meaning, as I understand, no insurance benefit to owning the car outright.  

I also could eliminate one of my four student loans, which currently add up to a payment of $131 monthly cumulatively, and are the oldest standing credit account I have at 6 years. They have 4.5%-6.5% interest rates. This monthly payment is also not financially taxing or difficult for me to make. 

My issue lies in the fact that my credit score is racing towards 800 (781 currently), and the biggest issue with it according to Credit Karma is the average age of my accounts, and the number of my accounts (7). I fear that paying off a loan/my loans will drastically affect my credit score negatively, as the next oldest accounts to my auto loan are 2 credit cards, one a year old and the other about 3 months old. 

With the interest being borderline negligible on my car loan, and my student loan not being a difficult payment to make, is there any advantage to paying either of these off? It feels like eliminating these debts will have the opposite effect on my credit history than what I want. Should I just keep paying them until they run out on their own? Will it affect me more when they run their course in the next 2-5 years and drop off my account than if I pay them off now?

Thank you!!",finance

btc,I would like to share with you my current set of beliefs regarding Bitcoin.,"I would like to share with you my current set of beliefs regarding Bitcoin. It’s up to you to believe it, take it at face value, refute it or discuss it below. 

- Bitcoin, not Blockchain, is the innovation. The components allowing for distributed concurrency control have existed for decades now.  

- The only innovation in blockchain is the tight coupling between the business problem and its technical solution. 

- Bitcoin is not immune to attacks. Specifically, social and censorship attack. 

- Bitcoin itself is an experiment. Designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. The original design document explicitly describes Bitcoin as a cash-replacing currency.

- Nakamoto entrusted a small group of people with the source code; he trusted game theory and miners’ greed to protect the network forever, and he left.

- The original design of Bitcoin included no cap or limit on block sizes. Financial incentives of the experiment were explicitly described. The cap was introduced later as to protect against attacks on the network.

- The design by Nakamoto carefully balances the incentives between all the participants. There was no way for non-miners to make satoshis, there was never a deviation from the miners’ incentives to protect the network. Until segwit was introduced.

- I believe that segwit is a poison pill fed to Bitcoin Core’s implementation of Bitcoin. Segwit changed and misaligned incentives among the network participants.

- Segwit is a solution to a problem that does not exist. The block size limitation was temporary. And even if segwit was a genuine improvement, it would still be a separate experiment from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.

- I stress the previous point again. Bitcoin is an experiment designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Segwit and the Core team have deviated from the original experiment.

- A hard fork driven by the part of the community who wishes to protect Nakamoto’s experiment took place in August. The hard fork is known as Bitcoin Cash.

- Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Nakamoto Experiment

- Everything else you hear is noise. The Segwit vs. Segwit2x debate is only important because it takes away control from Core(Blockstream). But it doesn’t really remove segwit, and neither version is the original experiment designed by Nakamoto. 

- There are many coordinated attacks. Core actively called Bitcoin Cash as “bcash”, among other astroturfing tactics. 

- Every new fork based on core’s implementation already has the segwit poison pill and is therefore compromised.

- Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Think of Bitcoin Cash like you would think of an older public network like DC++. A network that many clients can connect to, with many different implementations. There is no central authority. There are no twitter profiles with “no2x” and “uasf” and other nonsense as part of the network.

- The current attacks on Bitcoin include the many Core-advertised forks (Gold, Silver, etc), pumping Bitconnect and other useless networks as to create the illusion of “Which one is Bitcoin, if any?”.

- Bitcoin Cash is the ONLY fork that continues the original experiment design detailed by Satoshi Nakamoto in his white paper.

- Nakamoto was very careful in his technical choices. Even in selecting the elliptic curve cryptography protocol, he opted for one that could not possibly be compromised by any intelligence agency (he chose secp256k1 instead of secp256r1). Changing anything related to his technical choices is a direct attack on the original experiment. Schnorr or else, it’s garbage. 

- The original Bitcoin experiment allowed for instant transaction verification (whether for small or large amounts, transactions propagated to the network can be trusted, but only small transaction amounts should be instantly accepted from a risk-offset perspective). Once transactions propagated, as a merchant you did not need to wait for the next block and you can accept such risk for smaller amounts. Blockstream and Core killed this key feature by introducing “replace by fee”, a trust-breaking “feature”. Bitcoin Cash reverted that change, removed “replace by fee” and returned the experiment to its original design allowing for instantly trusting propagated 0-confirmation transactions. 

- Blockstream and Core has direct control over the following: Bitcoin.org, BitcoinTalk Forums, r/Bitcoin, r/Bcash, BitcoinMagazine.com. BS/Core also actively censors discussions on the Bitcoin Github repo, Bitcoin Wiki, Bitcoin Dev mailing list, and of course the Core slack channel. All these sources of information are compromised and controlled by people with direct financial interests in crippling Bitcoin down to a settlement later and selling side-chains/lightning networks.

- Blockstream, financed by AXA among other financial institutions, has publicly announced their direct financial interest in selling sidechain solutions to their clients for profit. Crippling Bitcoin down to a 1MB settlement layer is a direct requirement for their success in building and selling such a solution. The original Satoshi Nakamoto experiment does not allow for such financial schemes. This is a direct conflict of interest between those entrusted with Bitcoin’s source code and what the original Bitcoin experiment is.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation loan through bank,"My partner and I have been offered a debt consolidation loan through our bank with a significantly lower interest rate than our credit cards. We would be able to pay off the loan in 5 years just making the payment. My plan is to pay the amount we are paying now on minimum payments on the loan or more and hopefully get it paid off faster. I have no problem not using my ccs and but I’m worried about my partner. I think if we got the loan and all the cards were at $0 balance my partner would do better at not using them. I have them now all hidden away. 

I just need to hear some pros and cons of debt consolidation loans. From my prospective as long as we don’t use our credit cards and we stick to our budget this is a win win situation.

personalfinance,"Reddit, how am I supposed to pay for college with virtually no help?","I'm 17. I'm an international student looking to study in the US. My mom is unemployed, and my dad only makes ~$30,000 a year even though he works 12 hours almost every day, so we're a low income family. My parents are not the smartest financially (spending money that they don't have on things they don't need). They have no college fund for me. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

As of today, I've been accepted into 3 colleges for Spring 2018. I'm still waiting on the others, but the average cost will look something like ~$30,000. (I have applied to a few community colleges as well and I am waiting to hear from them)

I've obviously tried looking into jobs (I've been applying since last year!) however unemployment is a huge issue in my country and as a 17 year old with no experience, I'm pretty much out of luck compared to the 20-somethings with degrees. It's basically a game of who you know, or which connections can land you a job (again, out of luck). I was very humbled and grateful to land a summer job, however it only earned me several hundred bucks, which would have to be spent on my student visa and enrollment deposit, etc.

I've tried looking into scholarships, however as an international student, I'm automatically not eligible for the FAFSA, Pell grants, Federal Aid, etc. so I don't know what to do. So I've started looking into international scholarships. I've only discovered a few international scholarships so far, and while I am incredibly grateful, some of them require you to be a US citizen (which makes no sense) and the deadlines have passed for others. Is there some hidden international scholarship database that I don't know about? 

I'm sorry if there is some substantial financial option that I'm missing out on here, but keep in mind that I have no mentors, advisors, etc. so I'm basically alone in the college process.

Reddit, I'm at a loss for words. Dealing with the college process in addition to my own personal problems have left me feeling tired of life. It seems like every path I take, I reach a dead end. I'm incredibly desperate, and I just wanna give myself a better life and opportunities. What do I do? How do I pay for college? It seems like I've tried everything and yet have gotten nowhere, and it's incredibly frustrating and confusing.",finance
personalfinance,Save more for retirement or buy a car?,"Hi! First time poster, long time lurker. I have been thinking about my financial situation and I need a sanity check that I’m making the optimal decisions. 

I’m 23, a year out of college and working, and I make $66k a year gross, closer to $70k with overtime. I can expect a 13-16% bonus every year (which I don’t depend on, but it’s something I want to know how to deal with). I live in Texas. 

My take home at a minimum ~$3500 which is after these deductions:
*  8% pre-tax into 401k to take advantage of my employer’s 8% match
*  $54 into an HSA
*  Health/vision/dental

In addition to that, I save:
*  $210 - Roth IRA (comes out to 4% of my gross)
*  $100 - joint travel fund with my boyfriend
*  $450 - possible down payment for used car?

I have a $10k emergency fund and $5k saved towards a car. I live with my boyfriend who makes the same amount of money as me, so our rent/living expenses are split. Even after allocating money for food, bills, eating out (I allocate money for this bc my boyfriend and I enjoy it), and a personal trainer, I have about $1000 leftover to spend on whatever.

Right now, there’s nothing really wrong with my car. I drive an 09 Accord that I’ve had since high school. But I’ve been wanting a nicer “luxury” car (used, of course). I think I could pull a good interest rate with my credit and would have $10k saved if I change nothing by the end of next year (which has been my goal). In addition to that, I was thinking of using part of my bonus to bump that to $15k, but I don’t know if that’s a good decision. I also have $7k-$9k in my checking account which usually doesn’t dip below that every month when I use to pay for things. 

I have also been thinking about saving more for retirement, perhaps maxing them out, as I have about 12% of my gross going into 401k and Roth IRA combined. 

My question is, am I in the financial position to get a car not out of necessity, but just because I want to? Or should I be dumping more money into retirement to try to max out both my 401k and Roth IRA, then waiting until I make more money? I am expecting a promotion and raise early to mid next year, but I’m of course not using that to calculate anything. 

I understand having a nice(r) car is not for everyone and some will always say save more, but I would like to know if I’m being super illogical or only a little. Thank you for reading!

personalfinance,Student Loans - Standard vs Extended Repayment,"This might be a simple question, but I just want to make sure that I am not missing anything. I fully intend to pay more than the minimum payment on my student loans. Is there any sort of penalty for choosing a longer repayment option (25 yrs) vs the standard (10 yrs), but paying the same amount?   
For clarification:  
    -Standard repayment: minimum is $420 for 10 years. I would pay $500 for 8 years.  
    -Extended repayment: minimum is $240 for 25 years. I would pay $500 for 8 years.  
I feel like the Extended repayment is a better option for a few reasons.   
1) If a financial burden occurs, I would be able to pay less with no penalty (other than accruing more interest).   
2) I would be able to target my higher interest loans and pay them down quicker because I would have a flexible $260/mo vs $80/mo.  
3) My amount that I actually pay and interest rate would not change, so it would be essentially the same thing, but with less risk.",finance

personalfinance,"With no debt, what would you do with $1000/month in savings to grow it into as much money as possible in 5 years?","I'm mainly interested in learning about strategies in general for any end goal, but if you want to cater it for my situation, here are some details: 

- End goal is to contribute to the downpayment for a house. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so that probably means around $100-200k, unless there are different ways to qualify for a mortgage with &lt;10% downpayment without PMI/really high interest rates (piggyback loans? I'm all ears). I could live in it, but I'm mainly buying the house for my mom (she's in Florida, I want her to escape like I did). Ideally, I'd buy property that has multiple units on the lot (or an in-law unit) for rental income that'll hopefully help with mortgage payments, but I know they're difficult to come by at &lt;$1 million. Even if my mom didn’t want to move to California, I would rather dump a chunk of my income to my own mortgage than to someone else’s.

- I'm using my college degree and the relevant skill set for my full-time 9-6ish job, which pays decently well and is probably the highest paid per hour job I can get with my current abilities. I'll hopefully climb the ladder and have a much higher salary in a few years, but for now with all my expenses I can only save $1000/month for this goal. I'm not sure what other skills I have that can make money on the side, but my main job requires some travel so I can probably only take jobs that would allow remote work or flexible scheduling (I was thinking about a tech-related job since I know a little Javascript and am down to learn more, but I haven't done a lot of research into that industry). Open to any side job suggestions!

- I have savings/investment plans and fortunately don’t have any debt, having worked my way through college. Almost everyone I know who owns real estate in the Bay Area was able to buy/mortgage it because of their company stock options. I have equity in a few startups that I'm hoping will be worth something (we can dream, right?) and will probably get some more stock options in the next 5 years, so this is a backup plan while I’m growing my cash savings.

personalfinance,Anyone buying a house w/ crappy credit due to Student Loans?,"Hello. My husband and I are wanting to buy a home in the future. But we're facing a big mountain of student loan debt on his side, which has caused significant issues with his credit. Here's the story..

My husband now has about $137k of student loans debt that he has at a loss of how to pay. His privates ($58k) are in charged off status and his fed's are in deferment. He was never at a place financially where he was able to pay for his student loans. He went to school at ITT tech. 
Fast forward to now. We met after the fact. My credit is excellent. We have had to use my credit for everything because his is in such poor shape. Mine, on the other hand, is healthy. 
Well, we are wanting to buy a house. Tired of renting. I've done the math, and my DTI is still not sufficient enough to support a mortgage on my own credit. Which is unfortunate because combined, our DTI would allow us to have up to $1650 a month mortgage.  
We are facing some options with the student loans that might show some solution but it wouldn't be evident until possibly several years in the future. I'm going to make a second thread on that; I don't feel like adding too much to this one. 
So we're here. His credit score is 658 - his feds are in deferment, so once that goes away, it'll go down to 553. Mine is 790. Combined household income is around $70k. 
At the current rate, we can have $22,000 in savings by the end of next year but can easily make that significantly more by possibly taking on small projects for pay, making cuts in spending, etc. We wanted to buy a house after our lease is up in March of 2019.

I guess the question here is - Is there an option out there for people like us? We have income to support purchasing a small house, and one of our credit scores are great. Both would be great if it weren't for the student loan defaults. 

Any tips are greatly appreciated. If buying a home is not in our future..fine. But we want to see it happen one day.",finance
personalfinance,"[Windfall] Receiving windfall, complex financial situation, looking for advice","Hey folks,

Throwaway for reasons that’ll be clear in my few other reddit posts. 

I’ve read the windfall FAQs on the site and they’ve been very helpful.

In essence, I’m receiving $25000 as a ‘gift’ from a parent.

My current situation:
1. Married male in early 30s with a 1.5 year old. My spouse cares for our child full time.
2. No CC, vehicle debt
3. $155000 left in mortgage on house, purchased 1.5 years ago for $170000 ($10k down payment was a gift from parents + in laws with monthly payment (plus tax/insurance) of $998. Interest rate of 3.375% no PMI
3. Every other week take home of $1528 (after health insurance, 403b)
4. Am a medical resident with this year and four additional years of training (graduated medical school in 2015) where my income will be pretty similar to what it is now, increasing maybe 4% per year 
5. Medical school debt of $158000 at 6.8%, and $40000 at 7.2% that are using income based repayment federal plan (more on this below) leading to $138/month at current plan
6. Liquid savings of $2500 
7. Company 403b (not matched) at $8300
8. All of our monthly spending beyond this comes out to close to $1800.

Right now we’re not saving a lot and that has to do with our spending habits. We’re working on making a tighter budget and paring back some unnecessary spending. Our monthly spending since starting I be more careful has come from $1800 to $1600 in the last month.

My plan for this windfall is:
1. Add to emergency fund by $4000 - any advice for the vehicle for this beyond standard savings account?
2. My medical school debt is huge, but par for the course. The income based repayment plan still accumulates interest. However, with the federal public loan forgiveness plan, after 10 years/120 payments the balance of debt is forgiven. That’s why I don’t want to put more towards that debt. By the time I finish post graduate training, I’ll have 7 years of payments at a low income rate, then live ‘like a trainee’ despite a higher salary for three years until my loans are forgiven. This does assume the program will be around. Most higher education financial counselors think that either a. It will be capitated at $50000, or b. Cancelled, both possibilities not being good, but the predominant thought being those in it now will be grandfathered in. 

So beyond a larger emeconomy emergency fund, I’m not sure what to do. Perhaps some initial college savings for my child? I’m not sure the utility of home improvement investments beyond quality of life for us.

Bitcoin,Would you lend your bitcoins?,"It seems most people holding bitcoin are keeping the coins themselves, and not investing then in any way. However, theoretically it seems perfectly possible for people holding Bitcoin to lend them out, for example to some financial institution. This would yield the coin holders some extra coins due to interest. Of course, there is always the risk of the party borrowing the coins defaulting, but sufficiently high interest rates could offset that. Lending out Bitcoins obviously means giving up control over your private keys, but that's basically the same as the risk of the counterparty defaulting.

btc,"Segwit2x Futures, what am I missing?","Segwit2x futures are trading at 15% of a full bitcoin on Bitfinex. The New York Agreement doesn't want to implement replay protection and the 1MB chain isn't really supposed to survive the ordeal in their vision, it's supposed to die out.

Roughly 90% of the mining capacity belongs to organizations that will follow the New York Agreement and force the community to upgrade to 2MB. If they stick by their plans, which they have every reason to do, they'll eliminate the 1MB chain and what we call Segwit2x today would simply become the new bitcoin.

The majority of Bitcoin users are not aware of this. They use a censored subreddit controlled by a cartel that wants to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer. They mistakenly believe the New York Agreement is falling apart, because they're fed disinformation. As an example, [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/795898/charlie_lee_gbminers_25_of_total_btc_hashrate/) you are led to believe a mining pool dropped the NYA, whereas they actually simply didn't signal it for 2 blocks. If the majority of Bitcoin users are fed misinformation, I expect them to make bad investment decisions.

So here's the mystery: Am I missing something, or should Segwit2x futures on Bitfinex be worth more than 15% of a bitcoin? Sure, the New York Agreement might fail, sure, Bitfinex is a sketchy exchange, but even then, surely these futures must be worth more than 15%? It looks to me like the market is irrational, making trading decisions based on emotions and feelings, rather than on probable outcomes.

My hypothesis is that I can scoop up Segwit2X futures for 15% of a bitcoin and end up with  what the community will eventually be forced to recognize as an actual bitcoin, even if the Core fanboys don't like it. But I'm missing something. I've made easy money before, but this is really easy. It can't be this easy. What am I missing?",cryptocurrency

I think there will be short term interest raise on corp bonds of those companies and overall Russian bonds,  but in a year of two they will get back to normal.

Some are saying I should pay off aggressively as I can, and the others are suggesting budget correctly so I will pay my loans off in time (say a few years) and still have some money in savings. I don't want to drag these loans for years, but for some of the fed loan payment plans I'm seeing are saying the loans being forgiven after 20/10 years of payment.

&amp;nbsp;

My initial plan was to pay off Sallie Mae now with the 8K I have, and build up from there. I'm torn whether this is a smart move, for I'll be left with 1K in my checking. For the Fed loan, I don't know which plan will be the best for me-- my organization IS a non-profit, but I won't qualify for the PSLF program as of now since I'm only part time. I don't know which repayment program I should enroll -- preferably one that will give me the least amount in monthly payment so I can have a better control over how much I can pay if I could afford to pay extra for each month. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm actively looking into picking up extra shifts at my job and/or find a second job (as a new nurse the job market isn't too kind) to increase my income. But as of now, I need a direction.

&amp;nbsp;

I know my debt isn't too bad compared to others, but financial issues are one of the biggest fear &amp; anxiety inducing factors of mine. I was never properly educated/guided on these matters  since I was young - I'm looking to change this now. 

&amp;nbsp;

Please help me. I appreciate the help and this sub for existing from the bottom of my heart. 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: My sallie mae's interest 8.7%, and my subsidized &amp; unsubsidized loans are looking from 3% - 6%.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm 21, should I buy a house?","So my roommate is probably not going to renew at my apartment. I currently pay 350 a month for a 2 bedroom for my half. If he doesn't renew I'll have to pay 600 a month cheapest for a 1 bedroom. I've looked at houses around here, and there are decent ones for 75-95k. I make $15 an hour and usually 916 a paycheck. 

I currently only have 6000 in savings. I have $2200 left on a secured loan (67/ month, I pay 100). I have federal student loans for 10k (from freshman year, haven't taken any since). Besides that I have no other monthly bills besides utilities and food and gas. I plan to be here for anywhere from 3-6 maybe more years, and I live in the fastest growing part of my state (house prices are currently rising everywhere). 

Would I be able to get a mortgage? 

Would it make sense to do it in my situation? 

I have a month until my lease is up and I can go month to month after that for as long as I needed if I had to. My dad could also cosign a mortgage for me.

What reasons should I have to not buy a house this young?",finance
Bitcoin,If by pairing he can't decide... Craig Wright has lied! (again),"Today [Wright claimed on twitter](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924242722810195968) that the elliptic curve group used by Bitcoin is a  pairing friendly curve as part of his ongoing effort to fake being bitcoin's creator by pretending to have special knowledge about it.   (Then he went on to further embarrass himself by saying that he would somehow patent this 'fact' and make it available exclusively to his scammy BCH cryptocurrency...)

Unfortunately for Wright he has again blundered into making an easily proved claim.

On each line below are three secp256k1 public keys: A, B, C.

Exactly half of the lines are of the form A = aG, B = bG, C = abG;
The other half of them are of the form A = aG, B = bG, C = H(a)G.

If you can compute a bilinear pairing in the secp256k1 group then distinguishing the two sets is trivial due to the definition of bilinearity:

The relationship e(A,B) == e(C,G) will hold only for the members of the first set, so you need only perform two pairing operations and check if they match to tell which set each line belongs in.

Wright claims that secp256k1 is compatible with bilinear pairing. He can prove his claim by simply identifying which 64 of these 128 examples the bilinear relationship holds for, something that would take only a few milliseconds of computation if his claim were true. This holds for _any_ bilinear pairing, not just the weil pairing, it is a definitional property of bilinearity itself.

After he gives his answer I can prove or refute it by publishing the a and b secret keys behind each example and everyone can verify for themselves if wright got it right.  His answer would reveal nothing about the methods he used to get the answer, only that there was some truth behind what he already claimed in public.

It's time for wright to show us if he's got a pair().

A correct answer would look like 00100110001111001101011001000111111000111101000000101010101100101011010100101000111000011100000110010000000100111111111101110111   (as an example)

The sage notebook used generate this challenge is [available](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/secp256k1_ddh_challenge.sage).",cryptocurrency
btc,If by pairing he can't decide... Craig Wright has lied! (again),"Today [Wright claimed on twitter](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924242722810195968) that the elliptic curve group used by Bitcoin is a  pairing friendly curve as part of his ongoing effort to fake being bitcoin's creator by pretending to have special knowledge about it.   (Then he went on to further embarrass himself by saying that he would somehow patent this 'fact' and make it available exclusively to his scammy BCH cryptocurrency...)

Unfortunately for Wright he has again blundered into making an easily proved claim.

On each line below are three secp256k1 public keys: A, B, C.

Exactly half of the lines are of the form A = aG, B = bG, C = abG;
The other half of them are of the form A = aG, B = bG, C = H(a)G.

If you can compute a bilinear pairing in the secp256k1 group then distinguishing the two sets is trivial due to the definition of bilinearity:

The relationship e(A,B) == e(C,G) will hold only for the members of the first set, so you need only perform two pairing operations and check if they match to tell which set each line belongs in.

Wright claims that secp256k1 is compatible with bilinear pairing. He can prove his claim by simply identifying which 64 of these 128 examples the bilinear relationship holds for, something that would take only a few milliseconds of computation if his claim were true. This holds for _any_ bilinear pairing, not just the weil pairing, it is a definitional property of bilinearity itself.

After he gives his answer I can prove or refute it by publishing the a and b secret keys behind each example and everyone can verify for themselves if wright got it right. His answer would reveal nothing about the methods he used to get the answer, only that there was some truth behind what he already claimed in public.

It's time for wright to show us if he's got a pair().

A correct answer would look like 00100110001111001101011001000111111000111101000000101010101100101011010100101000111000011100000110010000000100111111111101110111   (as an example)

Hi my recently married wife and I are in the process of setting up our repayment plans for the future of our student loans.... (exploring refinancing options from Sofi). Which of these would YOU choose?...
DOOR 1: (refinance majority of loans w/ Sofi, keep some gov't loans) 
- Refinance majority of loans to sofi and pay $972.02 per month w/ sofi for 15 years. Total loan amout $118,962 at 5.5% 
- $70 per month payment to nelnet for about 17 years for remaining loans not refinanced because of lower interest rate. Total loan amount $11,111 at 3.95%

   grand total: $1050 / per month payment 

DOOR 2: (refinance less of a majority of loans w/ Sofi, keep some more gov't loans than Door 1) 
- Refinance part of loans with sofi to pay $882 per month. Total refinance is with Sofi 108K at 5.5%. This differs from Door 1 because I don't include about 10K of Perkins loans. 
- [same as Door 1] $70 per month payment to nelnet for about 17 years for remaining loans not refinanced because of lower interest rate. Total loan amount $11,111.52 at 3.95% 
- $161 per month payment w/ Perkins loan (5% interest rate, $10k total)

   grand total: $1114 per month

DOOR 3: (Don't mess with that boi Sofi) - I don't refinance at all 
- $161 per month payment w/ Perkins loan (5% interest rate, $10k total) 
- Pay rest of that money to the DOE (Don't Owe Enough ... Depart. of Education/NELNet): $116,999 total, 6.05% weighted average. So we pay $1K per month, done in 15 years.

  grand total per month: 1161

Bonus, further info: 
Currently the qualified loans are under IBR. My wife makes ~40K per year and all loans are her right now. I make ~100K so I'm anticipating they min payment will go up after we file jointly this year. PSLF not on the table, currently.",finance

personalfinance,"Advice on school loans, please!","This is my first post on personal finance. I’m a long time onlooker! 

Spring will be my last semester in graduate school. I am prepared to pay for the semester out of pocket (all of my school loans are from undergrad) but asked about the current loan rates just in case. 

Right now, I am approved by the school to take up to 10,000$ at 4.45%

My current school loans are 

$3905.69 at 4.5%
$4747.57 at 3.4%
And $4080.34 at 6.21%

Would it be worth while to take a new loan with the intention of paying off the 4.45 and 6.21 interest rates and have a lower rate? 

I current have 111 months left of my undergrad payments. I think taking This would make it 120 months again. I’m not completely concerned about that as I’m going to try and pay them down much quicker.

CryptoCurrency,Confido - Awesome ChainLink use case,"Edit: Feel free to join the Telegram to talk to the devs directly! They are very responsive: https://t.me/joinchat/GB_OvkRMT0F4YkU-nz4y-g

Hey all, I've done some research on Confido and really, really liked what I found. I'm going to outline my findings here on an upcoming ICO called Confido. 

Key take aways are this: 

1.  Lowest marketcap I've ever seen for an ICO. There is just an insane amount of upside for this if you are able to get in the ICO or get in early. ($400,000) 

2. Real problem and use case being solved. Even if you don't invest, you'll likely want to *use* the product to transact with people online using Crytpocurrencies. It actually just got featured in a Huffingtonpost article here: [Huff Post] (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-cryptocurrencies-to-keep-an-eye-on-that-are-not-bitcoin_us_59d22c36e4b034ae778d4c32)

Basically, with Confido you don't need to trust someone to ship you a product after you pay. You send money to a smartcontract that only releases to the seller 24 hours after the item delivers. 

Lets say we want to buy a new Ledger Nano S for $70 from someone on Reddit, and you want to pay with Bitcoin. You don't know eachother, so there is a serious trust factor involved. Instead of sending him BTC/ETH and just hoping/trusting he sends the item, we use Confido to create the smartcontract that spies the FedEx shipping number, using ChainLink as the Oracle that informs the smartcontract when to release the funds. You don't need to deal with eBay or Paypal or any centralized corporation that takes a sizeable cut and that doesn't even accept Crypto anyway. Your escrow is literally a trustless SmartContract! 


Why is this just being created now? Well, remember the ""Oracle problem?"" There have been Oracles out there but they were difficult to implement and - of course - they were centralized. Now with ChainLink, we can create SmartContracts that trsutlessly read external data - in this case, FedEx/UPS data (through a ChainLink) so it knows when to release funds. The Alpha sandbox version will use the centralized ""Oraclize"" service, and then then Public Beta and Final Release will use ChainLink. 


**Here's how it works**

You, the buyer, put $70 worth of BTC in the Confido smartcontract. The seller is then notified that the funds are in escrow and prompts him to enter a shipping number. The seller then ships the item, gets the tracking number, and plugs it in to the prompt. The smart contract then observes the shipping number, and 24 hours after the item is delivered, the funds are released to the seller!

My first thought was: ""well what either party commits fraud?"" Confido has a really clever solution to this built into the smart contract. If you receive a box of coal instead of a ledger, you as the buyer can just freeze the funds in escrow. That way the funds don't get released to the seller. This creates a huge disincentive for fraud from the seller's perspective because they won't get paid, and they waste money on shipping. Once a contract has been held up by the buyer, only the buyer can release those funds to the seller. 

But what if the buyer commits fraud - can I just claim I got coal instead ledger to get my money back? No you can't - once you freeze, your funds are in escrow, and you don't actually get your money back unless the *seller* authorizes the refund. Thus, there is zero incentive for either side to commit fraud, short of pure spite (there is just no tangible/monetary benefit you can receive by trying to defraud each other). For the .00000001% of buyers or sellers that truly are spiteful despite zero benefit to themselves, Confido will be implementing [Kleros.io] (https://kleros.io/), directly into the smartcontract which is an awesome dispute resolution/voting jury blockchain, as an intermediary. 

**Why tokens?**   
I know what you're thinking - why the hell do we need tokens for this? This part is really cool. First I need to explain that the cost for using this service is 0.7% of the transaction cost, which is so SO much lower than centralized escrow payments that charge 5%+, and the cool thing here is that you don't actually need to pay using Confido tokens! I believe you will be able to pay in most major blockchains, but certainly Ethereum at the very least. Now, that 0.7% fee goes to the token holders! The tokens entitle you to a divident payment from all the people around the world using Confido. The second use for the tokens is the ability to use the service without the 0.7% fee! 

Overall, its a really cool concept that doesn't have much downside given how low the market cap. They are only raising $400,000 in their ICO. If you read their whitepaper, they talk about how they think the ICO space is messed up and abused, and they are only asking for what they need. The devs aren't rockstar, YCombinator-backed, venture capital millionares getting even richer - they're just dudes our age living the dream by trying to solve a real problem for real people, and I think they found a good one to solve. 

Here is the [Huffington Post article] (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-cryptocurrencies-to-keep-an-eye-on-that-are-not-bitcoin_us_59d22c36e4b034ae778d4c32) 

Here is a quick video run down of the product: [Confido Intro] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SX0buv4bCc)

Here is their [whitepaper] (http://confido.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Whitepaper-v0.2-1.pdf)

Like I said, there isn't that much downside. If you got in the ICO, the cap is only 2 ETH. I will be putting my personal cap, and I plan on buying much more when it is released on EtherDelta.

Bitcoin,How the US government will regulate Bitcoin - just turn the miners into 'financial institutions',"[This article](https://www.ethnews.com/the-building-americas-trust-act-may-affect-blockchain-based-currency-issuers?platform=hootsuite) appeared a couple of weeks ago. It describes how the ""Building America's Trust Act"" (S. 1757) would change the definition of a 'financial institution' in the [U.S. Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code) (the compendium of Federal laws) to read: 

(2) ‘‘financial institution’’ means—.....(K) an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of travelers’ checks, checks, money orders, prepaid access devices, **digital currencies**, or other similar instruments;"" 

It seems like this would turn every US miner and probably any US-based organization creating a digital currency into 'financial institutions' who would have to comply with all the related laws. It's also not clear whether 'other similar instruments' would include tokens, and how a distinction would be made as to which were securities and which weren't. 

For those who want to look this up, here are links to: [The text of S.1757](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s1757/BILLS-115s1757pcs.pdf). Scroll down to section 409(A)(1)(A) on page 250; and [Section 5312(a)(2)(k) of the U.S.C.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5312)

CryptoCurrency,Why I invested in iExec (RLC),"First of all I wanna say that this post isn't a shill neither an investment advice as I firmly believe everybody should do their own research. I wanna share with you guys this token as it caught my attention and I wanna show you guys why I put 80% of my portfolio in it after I discovered this hidden gem. 

Iexec is a fully distributed cloud for blockchain based distributed applications running. It is built as a Dapp working on the Ethereum blockchain. In short it’s a decentralized network allowing users to buy or sell processing power for their applications.

During the Devcon 3, iexec will present the V1 that will enable Dapps running on the Ethereum Blockchain to access off-chain computing resources. It’s the first product release of the team. Golem and SONM are the main competitors but none of them have the expertise or the recognition of the iexec team, the struggle of Golem to deliver the brass compared to the undelayed release of the V1 proves that there is a sharp competence gap between them. The team knows the tech better than everyone else.

 The first thing that caught my attention is the fact that the team consists of 5 members with 5 PHD's (https://iex.ec/about-us/
). I've been reading into the background of the CEO, Gilles Fedak, and he is already almost 20 (!) years working on distributed data computing. You can find his work on right here for the curious one's (https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=8UEfrTEAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr).

When we look at the iEx.ec team its pretty impressive.. When it comes to grid and cloud computing I don't think you could have found a better team. It almost feels like Gilles Fedak, Haiwu He, Oleg Lodygensky, and Mircea Moca were born for cloud computing. (http://iex.ec/our-team/)

Gilles (Co-founder) produced pioneering software and algorithms in the field of Grid and Cloud Computing. Co-editor of ""Desktop Grid Computing"" (Available on Amazon).


Prof. Dr. Haiwu (Co-founder) is a 100 Talent Professor at the CNIC (Computer Network Information Center), Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. His research focuses on P2P distributed systems, cloud computing and big data.


Oleg (CTO) is the main developper of XtremWeb-HEP, the open-source software for Desktop Grid computing used in production at Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics.

Mircea is the founder of eFast and has worked on many different projects related to distributed computing with Gilles and Haiwu since 2010.

After looking at the skills, abilities and aspirations of the team, i'd say achieving short-term and long-term goals is looking very favorable. iEx.ec is an incorporated company and the headquarters is located in France. They also have a subsidiary at Tsinghua University X-elerator in Beijing, China.

There are a lot of new ideas for blockchain applications right now, some have already proved their utility but the vast majority is yet to demonstrate not only that they have a tangible application but that there is a market for them too. iexec doesn’t have this problem, the cloud computing is a booming market and fueled by a growing thirst for processing powering in various domains ranging from scientific research to game servers. Cloud computing is anticipated to represent a 162 billions $ market (!).

Lastly, the product release at Devcon is an huge milestone. The team is working hard to deliver a good presentation and I like the fact that they are active in the slackchannel (https://imgur.com/a/3t6ob) after the fact that they had a lack of marketing couple of months ago. It seems like the train is slowly going to start soon and this is why i'm fully convinced by this project!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I start an investment account or pay off student loans?,"I graduated with a professional degree several years ago with heavy student loan debt, over $200,000. I have refinanced that debt at a variable interest rate that is just under 4% right now with five years left to pay off.  The balance is $125,000 right now.

I have $50,000 in 401k, $20,000 in checking/savings. Another $10,000 I put in crypto (that is $25,000 today but fluctuates highly of course).

Would it be a terrible idea to start a fidelity account putting in $1,000 a month, rather than throwing that $1,000 to student loans? 

If I am laid off, I would feel a lot more comfortable with access to money rather than a low student loan balance, given that I could refinance those at a longer term (say over 10 years).",finance
personalfinance,Where do I go from here? No financial experience &amp; have put this off for too long.,"First of all thank you everyone that assist people on all their issues that come up here. I'm a 31 yr old male and even though I don't have a problem not spending money (definitely been called cheap by more than one person), I don't know what to do with it. My family is notoriously not good with money/saving and in return never learned anything from them. I've been a long time lurker (have taken some insights and applied to my life as well!) and have honestly just been nervous about putting myself out here like this. However, it's time to take control and hopefully attack this head on with your help.

Here's my current situation with bills, income, investments, etc.;

Current Bank Balance - 8k, no savings account

Income
60k a year with potential, comes out to 3.5k a month after 401k contribution and taxes. I also have a possibility of a 20% bonus at end of year (last two years I've received the full bonus, but this year looks like 16%). 

Investments
-401k: Company currently matches at 3% so I put in 3%
-Roth IRA's: Had a financial adviser friends set me up on two different target retirements; T Rowe Price 2055 and Vanguard 2055. Since then I've done barely anything since my initial investment of 1k each, currently 1.5k in each 

Bills
-Rent: $1400 of $2300 flat (bay area, GF pays her percentage based on both our incomes)
-Car: $260 (13 months left to pay off, need for work as I have to travel locally quite a bit)
-Car Insurance: $133
-Cell: $35 (down from $70 since work reimburses $35)
-House Bills (water/gas/garbage/sewer/internet): Roughly $120 a month
-Tax Issue: $50 a month (stupid contractor story, that i forgot to save for)
-Groceries: $200-$300 a month (I try to cook at home as much as possible)
-Gas: $80 a month
-Bridge Toll: $25 a month (thank you carpool app Swoop and free riders to pickup to get the carpool lane and cheaper costs)
-Entertainment (dates with the GF, netflix, moviepass, drinking): No set amount here, but looks like to be between $400-$600 each month. We still eat out and drink too much, but I also still need to treat my lady to dates and have an active life.
-Student Loans: $420 a month, IBR plan and more on that now...

High End Bills Total -$3423

Debt (oh boy, here we go)
-Student Loans: 75K from undergrad and grad school and is now up to 92k after paying on the IBR Plan (income based repayment) for 6 years. I really thought this was the way to go because t thought that as long as I repay this for 25 years the rest would be forgiven. At first it was only $170 a month because I was making so little in the bay area so it didn't seem that bad, but now it's $420 a month or just over 5k a year and over the next 20yrs of repayment I'll be paying way more than the 92k currently owed. I've seen on here that everyone says to attach the loan with this highest interest rate first. Is this still the best course of action? What do I do with the other loans? Just pay the minimum? Is there any of all the new student loan companies that would be worth looking into or are they all scams? This is obviously my biggest headache and I just don't know what to do.
-Medical: Just had to get knee surgery and owe about 7k since my insurance took care of the rest. This was the max out of pocket I would pay. There's no interest and I will be making a call this week to set up a repayment plan.
-Credit: Luckily I don't have any here and have been good about paying these off very quickly.

I hope this is enough information for some advice/tips moving forward. Anything and everything is very much appreciated. I just want to get a grasp on my financial life and begin the process to improve myself.

If you need any more information please let me know and thank you all in advance once again!",finance
personalfinance,Does it make sense to contribute to a 401k with no match before paying off loans?,"Next month I will be eligible to contribute to my companies 401k plan. They do not match contributions as they pay out through and ESOP. I have around $65,000 in student loan debt and about $8,500 in an IRA from my last gig. I keep reading that at 28 years old I should be contributing to my retirement but I'm not sure that makes sense while in debt with interest rates of at least 6% APR. Also we participate in an HSA which adds a layer of complication to the game. Where should my money be going?",finance

personalfinance,Can refinancing save me?,"Dear /r/PersonalFinance,


I've been struggling to keep my head above water the past six months due to unforeseen medical expenses above what my insurance pays. The only solution I have available to me is the equity in my home, but I am hesitant to even consider it. If my health stays this way, I'll have no choice.

A previous (medical) bankruptcy falls off in 11 months, but I don't think I can wait that long.  Yay American healthcare, right?

Your input is appreciated. I have no idea what's what. Never done anything like this before.

ethereum,"Introducing Ethereum Vega, continuation of ethereum with decentralized governance (and no POS)","This is a re-upload with no-upvote buying on it. Sorry for that.

Description: Ethereum Vega is a split from Ethereum with a protocol upgrade, enabling decentralized governance with sustainable, immutable monetary policy.
This will be a fork of the Ethereum block chain, 1:1, no-ICO (it is like a full airdrop)]

New Features_

1.	Sustainable monetary policy
Following previous issuance policy, Ethereum Vega provides scalable, immutable monetary policy with no harm from inflation or centralized governance, 3rd party interference.

2.	Strong replay protection
A new chain_id value provides replay protection, improved hardware wallet security, and elimination of the quadratic hashing problem.

3.	Difficulty adjustment code
This version will enable changing default chain_id for main-net and test-net. Therefore, if you use higher version than 1.9.0 you will be safe from replay-attacks. (This also ensure that EVA is different from ETH.)
4.	Decentralized governance
Since the upcoming dev teams will be raised by premine stake, there is no risk or concern for paused or discontinued development.

FAQs_

1.	What is “Ethereum Vega""?
Ethereum Vega is a monetary platform based on block chain technology. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.

2.	Is “Ethereum Vega” different from “Ethereum""?
Yes! Ethereum Vega is the continuation of the Ethereum network with decentralized governance. It is a fork of the Ethereum block chain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow to grow and scale.

3.	Is “Ethereum Vega” a competitor of “Ethereum""?
No. Since Ethereum is currently switching to POS, Ethereum and Ethereum Vega will be likely to have a different ecosystem. Therefore, Ethereum Vega is not in competition with Ethereum over limited resources.

4.	How can I earn “Ethereum Vega""?
The Ethereum Vega (EVA) initial coin distribution method is exactly the same as that used by Bitcoin Cash(BCH). All Ethereum holders who possess ETH private keys on the block number 4369999 will receive Ethereum Vega on the rate of 1 EVA = 1 ETH (If you have 20 ETH you will receive 20 EVA). You need to control ETH private keys in order to make Ethereum Vega transactions.

5.	Why was a fork necessary to create ""Ethereum Vega""?
While Ethereum network is planning to switch to POS, however, there was a need of POW chain with the latest Ethereum protocol. Therefore, Ethereum Vega has born at the turning point of POS, aims to be a POW network with the latest Ethereum protocol.

6.	Which Development Team is in Charge of ""Ethereum Vega""?
Unlike the previous situation in Ethereum, there is no one single development team for Ethereum Vega. There are now multiple independent teams of developers.

7.	What is the ticker symbol for ""Ethereum Vega""?
Ethereum Vega is represented by a number of different ticker symbols depending on the service or wallet. EVA/ETV are the most popular tickers, with XEV being used to meet the International Standard for currency codes (ISO 4217).

8.	How can I run or handle my ""Ethereum Vega""?
The Ethereum Vega full node client with signed prebuilt binaries is available for download at https://weth.ethereumvega.org and the source code can be found at https://github.com/EthereumVega/weth.

9.	Why do you post this at ethereum community? You need to upload this at your subreddit.
Since Ethereum owners are holding more than 98% of Ethereum Vega, it is our duty to announce you about VEGA.

personalfinance,Keep 20k in investments or pay off student loans?,"I have about 20k in student debt right now at a 7.5% interest rate. I have about 22k in investments in a vanguard account that I established and put money into before I realized I would have to pay off student loans. I haven't put anything in the investment account since then and have since been putting everything I can towards paying off the debt. 

My vanguard account says I have been getting 12% returns, but obviously that could change widely. Then if I sold most of my investments I would have some tax to pay on that.

What would you recommend? Keep the money in the investment account, or sell most all of it and be debt free?",finance
Bitcoin,Transfer from Revolut to Coinbase... where to put Coinbase reference?!,"Hello

I'm just starting out and trying to transfer funds from Revolut to Coinbase. I've just done this for a tiny amount, however, I forgot to include Coinbase reference number and Coinbase state if this is not included, the deposit won't succeed. What happens now? Will I get notifed when it's rejected? How long until money is returned to Revolut?

I've just gone through the Revolut process again, but there is no option to include a reference number, just the IBAN and BIC. Where can I include the reference number please?

How long does it usually take to transfer funds as Revolut stated it would take 48 hours.

Bitcoin,The banking system is a scam. Their own worlds tell the story.,"I think most people who think bitcoin is a scam don't understand how the current banking system works. 

Here's a list of quotes from Presidents, politicians, and bankers talking about how the Federal Reserve, and Fiat currency are a complete scam.  



""All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation"" — John Adams 

“Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.”  — Sir Josiah Stamp, Director of the Bank of England (appointed 1928). Reputed to be the 2nd wealthiest man in England at that time. 

""The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it's profits or so dependant on it's favors, that there will be no opposition from that class."" — Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863 
“The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole… Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world’s money…” — Prof. Carroll Quigley renowned, late Georgetown macro-historian, author of Tragedy and Hope. 

""Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes it's laws"" — Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild 

“Bankers own the earth; take it away from them but leave them with the power to create credit; and, with a flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again… If you want to be slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let the bankers control money and control credit.” — Sir Josiah Stamp, Director, Bank of England, 1940 

""Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce... and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate."" — James A. Garfield, assassinated President of the United States 

“In the United States today, we have two governments. We have the duly constituted government and then we have and independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the Federal Reserve System operating the money powers which are reserved for Congress by the Constitution.” — Rep. Wright Patman, 1893-1976 

""In November of 1910, some of these vultures came together at the Jekyl Island Hunt Club on Jekyl Island, Georgia. What were they hunting? The biggest prize of all, the absolute and complete control of all the money in America which means control of all America and with it the power to make slaves of all the people.Those who attended were: Senator Nelson Aldrich (Nelson Rockefeller's maternal grandfather); A. Piatt Andrew, Economist and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; Frank Vanderlip, President of the National City Bank of New York; Henry P. Norton, President of Morgan's First National Bank of New York; Paul Moritz Warburg, a German who was partner in the New York banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Co.; Benjamin Strong, an aid to J. P. Morgan. Paul Warburg was credited as the architect of the bill which was passed by Congress and signed by traitorous Woodrow Wilson. It was entitled the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. America once again had a central bank but this time they had placed America under an absolute dictatorship… The Federal Reserve was incorporated in 1914 and has been creating a completely unnecessary national debt ever since."" — Dr. Ken Matto 
Former Congressional Candidate, 6th District N.J. (www.scionofzion.com...) 

""The financial system has been turned over to the Federal Reserve Board. That Board administers the finance system by authority of a purely profiteering group. The system is Private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money"" — Charles A. Lindbergh Sr., 1923 

""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies . . . If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] . . . will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . . . The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."" — Thomas Jefferson, The Debate Over The Recharter Of The Bank Bill (1809) 

“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” — President Franklin Roosevelt, Nov. 21 1933 

“You are a den of vipers! I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.” — President Andrew Jackson: 1829-1837
“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” — President Woodrow Wilson, 1916 

""We are completely dependent on the commercial Banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash or credit. If the Banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible, but there it is. It is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon."" — Robert H. Hemphill, Credit Manager of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, wrote in 1934 
""The invisible Money Power is working to control and enslave mankind. It financed Communism, Fascism, Marxism, Zionism, Socialism. All of these are directed to making the United States a member of a World Government ..."" — American Mercury Magazine, December 1957, pg. 92 

""I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move on Washington; they would not wait for an election....It adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States!"" — George W. Malone, U.S. Senator (Nevada), speaking before Congress in1957. 

""The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power--Political, Monetary, Intellectual, and Ecclesiastical."" — U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater from his 1964 book ""No Apologies"" 

“For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” — David Rockefeller, memoirs, 2003

personalfinance,21 y/o male with no credit history seeking credit building loan,"I've always paid everything with a debit card. I have a steady income ($15,000 a year part time and a single gig this year for roughly 8-10k that i wont be doing again), have nothing on credit karma except for a hard credit inquiry from Verizon from when I got my own phone plan. 

My parents (who I live rent free with) don't want me getting a credit card (but I will anyway if you say to). What exactly is a credit building loan? How high could I expect to loan? Interest rates? Monthly payments? Is it a good idea to get the loan from the same bank that I have all my money and debit card in (Chase)? 

I have a recently truck in the shop in need of major repairs (as well as my regular commuting car). I have a few grand in the bank but I'm afraid the repairs may rack up a lot.

personalfinance,"I'm still learning... and progress is being made, but now I need a little advice.","Hi, my wife and I are working towards recovering from a relatively rough period after I finished graduate school. I make 100K, she stays home with our two boys (pre-school age). Our objectives are just to get stable. We have invested some in our home and it's in good shape. We have only about $1000 in savings at the moment and we've just made a couple decisions that will lower our monthly bills so we can start contributing to more of a nest-egg.

* We own 1 car (owe 12,500 @ 5.89% for a $300/mo payment,  probably worth 9K) on a loan we got on my credit when it was poor. 
* We own our home - we owe 140K on mortgage w/ interest rate of 4.25% for a $1,041/mo payment- home was appraised 1 month ago at 220,000 
* We also have a 30K HELOC at prime +1 which we got a couple months ago and have used to pay off 10K in credit card debt and invest in some deferred maintenance in our home. The payment is 1% of total for a max payment of $300
* I am already putting 5% into my work retirement account. My company matches the first 3% and then matches half of the next 2%... meaning I contribute 5% and they match that with an additional 4%. 
* My wife has essentially no credit. She's been a cash business basically all her life. No negative marks or anything, but no activity either. She now has a bank account and has applied for a starter credit card to at least get her credit moving.
* After paying off my credit card debt, my consumer credit score has risen to above 750 (as reported by FICO and creditkarma). I also have a $10K (less taxes) bonus coming at year end which I've already been guaranteed.

**Question 1**: Should I be considering refinancing any of these loans with improved credit? If so, which ones... all?

personalfinance,"Which is better, immediately dropping money into my student loans or investing and then paying my loans with the interest I gain from investing?","My father recently passed away and I was named on his life insurance policy to the tune of $25,000. It’ll be a while before the money is in my hands, but I figured I’d get y’alls opinion on this. 


I have about $32,000 in student loans. About $28,000 of those are public with the other $4000 being Perkins. I’m currently on an IBR and my payments are $0 for the fed loans because I’m poor. That will change because I just got a new job though. 

Every month I pay $50 into the Perkins and before the IBR $230 into the public loans. So a grand total of $280 but I don’t mind paying the $50, it’s the $230 that hits me. 

Would I be better off just slapping the whole thing down on (first the Perkins loan followed by higher interest public ones) all of my student loans or sticking it in a bank account like Ally that gives 1% interest and using that to cover the payments?",finance

Jihan looked at the code and used his knowledge of hardware to build a machine people find useful. It's frustrating to hear people talk like this is malicious behavior. 

Blaming him for the Chinese government is pretty stupid as well. The guy didn't choose to be born in an authoritarian government, any more than Americans chose to be born in a Federal Reserve controlled warmongering empire. I have my doubts about Roger Ver and even more doubts about Craig Wright, but Jihan is just a brilliant engineer who built the right thing at the right time.

politics,"Megathread: Manafort, Gates told to surrender to federal authorities","Paul Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates were told to surrender to federal authorities Monday morning, the first charges in a special counsel investigation, according to a person involved in the case.

The charges against Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Mr. Gates, a business associate of Mr. Manafort, include conspiracy against the U.S., multiple counts of money laundering, failure to report financial information, and providing false or misleading statements to financial bookkeepers. These indictments represent a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over the president’s first year in office.

I do have a few questions for those of you that actually do claim crypto gains at the end of the year.

1) How are you tracking your realized capital gains and losses?  I am using a spreadsheet that tracks every single purchase I've made treating them like a stock.  This is fairly simple to do for most.

2) Can you effectively account for expenses due to transaction fees?  Ex.  Moving money from Coinbase to a ledger causes a loss in BTC.

2) When are gains considered taxable?  Obviously if I turn my BTC into USD, at that point it's taxable.  But what if you trade BTC back and forth 500 times between different coins?  Is the trade only considered a gain when I turn it back into USD?

3) We have some real awesome and intelligent people here.  Does anyone have a spreadsheet they are willing to share for this very purpose?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Position Eliminated - Now What?,"Well, today was unexpected. 

Our company has underperformed this year and I found out approximately twenty minutes ago that my position is being eliminated (there are several others leaving as well). 

They have offered me 5 weeks severance pay as well as a payout of my remaining PTO.

My last paycheck will land 12/31/17.

I have never been fired, and I'm in shock. I will work on update by my resume this afternoon, and we'll be switching benefits to my husband's company. We do have savings, but we can't weather this forever. 

What about unemployment? Is this something I file for immediately? Or once my severance stops paying? I hope I can find another job and this won't be necessary, but I don't want to disqualify myself somehow.

Any guidance would be appreciated. 

ETA: 

 I appreciate the responses so far, to fill in some information -

   I come from a varied background in Marketing, Finance, and HR. I've also been an EA for C-Suite Executives. 

  Job market in my area is strong, and I have a host of positive recommendations from previous employers, so I'm sure that something will come along, but things tend to slow down around the holidays and that's where I'm starting to panic.

   We have about $40k set aside in savings and operate reasonably well on a budget, but our income has just been cut in half.

    We have small children in school so my hours and options are limited. This position was both flexible AND virtual, so basically the holy grail. 

Expenses:

Mortgage - $1700/mo 3.5% interest rate, $500k value and just under $200k owed

Car - $650/mo, 0% interest (we could have paid cash, but there was no interest or fees associated so decided to just make payments. Owe $17k.)

Insurance - $330/mo (home owners, and auto policy for three vehicles. Farm truck is liability only)

Utilities - $850/mo (majority of this is electricity, units in house are old and inefficient, $7k to replace them) 

Cell - $115/mo for both phones

Internet - $64/month 

Income:

DH - $4k/month
Me - $3k/month until December 31st",finance

personalfinance,Conflict of interest between mortgage company and required appraisal company?,"**TR;LD:** Mortgage lender Officer has ownership interest in appraisal company chosen to reappraise my home to consider removal of PMI. 

We are in the process of removing private mortgage insurance (PMI) from our loan ($165/mo). We purchased the property late last year and made significant improvements. I am just getting around to requesting the removal of PMI, because life. My realtor ran some comps and I feel pretty confident that my house will be at 75% LTV with a reappraisal when they take into consideration the renovations made. I am going this route vs. refinancing because the current interest rates are higher than I obtained last year.  

I requested removal in writing to the lender, including an itemized list of upgrades and my credit card information. I received a receipt today from the appraisal company that was selected. I do not recognize the company, so I google the company and come across this statement on their website:

*This is to give you notice that HomeBridge Financial Services, Inc. DBA Real Estate Mortgage Network (HB DBA REMN) has a business relationship with a settlement services provider.* **An officer of HB DBA REMN has an ownership interest in Mortgage Management Consulting, Inc., which is an Appraisal Management Company**. *Because of this relationship, this referral may provide HB DBA REMN financial or other benefit.*

I am wondering how this isn't a conflict of interest? I was already worried about the appraisers being biased towards the lenders, especially since they're the one's hiring them. But this? I am not sure if there's anything I can do. I was thinking of writing the mortgage company and expressing my concern over them using this appraisal company? How can they ensure their independence? This just doesn't make sense to me. 

I will say that my loan was sold or transferred to Fannie May (I believe) early this year. This lender just continued servicing. Not sure if that has any implications. But I am going through this lender for the PMI removal.",finance

personalfinance,Father-in-law financed my wife/brother-in-law's college tuition with one joint ParentPlus loan. Now my wife's 6 mos. of deferment are almost up and the balance owed on that loan is the combined amount. How do we best address this?,"Continuing where the question left off, here's a breakdown of the situation:

* Before we were dating, wife decided to transfer from community college to out-of-state school to finish the last 3 years of her degree.

* Father-in-law and wife went through FAFSA but she only qualified for partial federal student loans. They decided to bridge the (kind of large) gap with Parent Plus loans.

* 2 years ago, brother-in-law starts attending different university, also out of state. Same financial situation, student loans, big gap.

* Somehow, (since I don't know how Parent Plus loans work) father-in-law is borrowing to pay for both institutions' tuitions on the same loan. It shows up as multiple smaller loans paid out to each institution, however there is one lump sum total and one VERY LARGE monthly payment.

* Wife graduated with her BS degree in May (yay wife! proud of you!) and her 6 months of deferment are ending.

* In trying to consolidate her loans to one monthly payment like I did mine, we realize the PP loan is lumped in with her brother's.

Can we go through the loan servicer to get the balance separated, and since the loan is in her father's name and he has the login information for it, how would we add me/wife as payers on the loan?

I've got a lot of frustration at my FIL for the way he handled this, but in his defense, he didn't know when figuring all this out that his daughter would end up marrying the boy she just started dating.

As it sits now, we cannot afford the monthly payment of her loan as it is, and neither of us think it's fair to shoulder the responsibility of paying the entire amount simply because part of it is what we owe and her brother is still in school, so his sub-loans should still be in deferment.

Could anybody explain what this means? Is it completely untrue and just a scam? Will it destroy my credit?

Anyways, I'm not that bad with economics, but I still think it's going to be difficult to get this loan paid back, even if I make very good investments (stock, mutual funds, forex, etc.). It will be nice to work directly with money and skip the middle-man (a boss), as well as the idea of perhaps going on a vacation, but one or two good months could mean six months to one year of regret.

Some Background. 

I used to work and make 75k a year. I'm still looking for a job and hope to get back near the amount. I've been living off my Credit cards and longtime GF for help. 

My Debt

* Capital one Personal CC 23.90%-2500 owed
* Cap one Big Business CC 21.99%-5000 owed
* Cap one Small CC 23.99%-500 owed
* Barclay CC 21.99%-6150 owed

* Penfed CC 16.99-5000 Owed Same above. 
* LMCU CC 15.75%-3000 OWed
* DCU CC 16.25-1000 owed
* Tidewater/Home Depot CC 29.99%-930 Owed

* 2 months behind my car payment which is 450
* 1 month behind on my cell phone bill 250

* I also borrowed about 13k from my GF. I would like to pay this back first, however, she would take whatever I gave her. I would like to at least give her 8-10k


I've read that I should pay off my highest interest first then work my way down, however, some of these are very small debts and I could wipe clean quickly. Some of them are personal cards and a few in the business name. All of them are caught up currently I believe, except the Penfed.

Looking forward I believe I can handle a few credit card payments totaling 200-300 a month for a few of them however the personal loan at $480/ Month would really make things hard. I'm already looking at selling my car for a cheap one and removing or drastically lowering that monthly payment, And me and the GF are moving back home to help with financial stability with family. 

Since I'm a few months behind on the penfed loan, is there an option to settle that for a lump sum? I know you typically have to be way behind before they consider that, but not sure if that's worth a shot or not. My Credit scare has already dropped from 700 to low 600 from this and I know I'm going to be in a rebuilding time for a while. 

Any advice on what best to do with the money to help me in the future would be great or any programs or any other advice is also welcome.

I would have graduated with just $30,000 in student loans if I kept my scholarships. However, I didn’t do very well in my engineering classes, so I lost my scholarships and switched to the pre-nursing track at the end of my junior year. I’ll finish my prerequisite classes by the end of the spring semester and have two more years of school after that. If I stay in school, I’ll graduate with $60-70,000 in loans with an 8.8% interest rate. That seems way too risky to me.

I’m tempted to drop out of college to join the military. My plan is to join the army under the 68C MOS (where you work as an LPN in military hospitals). I can use the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to force the banks into lowering my loan interest rate from 8.8% to 6%. I won’t have to pay for health insurance, rent, or most of my meals.

Hey guys, I started doing some crazy research and I came upon this company called Overstock.com, basically its a competitor to Amazon but unnlike its competition it also has been accepting Bitcoin since 2014.

""IN FIRST DAY WITH BITCOIN, OVERSTOCK DOES $126,000 IN SALES"" (https://www.wired.com/2014/01/overstock-bitcoin-sales/) 
at around 500 per bitcoin now they are worth now around 1.5m. It then increased to 300k sales per day in Bitcoin. This guys says he was keeping only 50% (I think he was keeping all of it)

This company stock has doubled in the last months, but their valuation is still way off (It has Amazon potential). Backstory: the CEO Patrick Byrne (comes from an ""honorable"" family, he has a PHD in Philosophy, 3 time cancer survivor) got fucked by corporations like Goldman Sachs during 2008, (he later sued and won against most of the financial coporation that fucked him). He came out explaining the method of how Wall Street(Goldman Sachs and co) manipulated the market by using a technique called ""Naked short selling"". 

Its worth investigating!
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A its an 8min explanation, what he says really puts into perspective how crooked this people are) (Also SEC verified that this does happen and a lot) https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm

Basically what they did is put a straw in the financial system that they can suck to get money whenever they want by fucking over smaller companies. Needless to say the press came out saying he was crazy, that it wasnt true, classical defamation campaign by the way, but to be fair he said that a Sith Lord was orquestrating all this (Now I kind of believe him)

So this guy was really fucking pissed and when he heard about Bitcoin he went balls deep! I researched a bit and Overstock investing company ""Medici Ventures"" has been developing blockchain applications that are incredibly well developed and serve enterprise needs (this are the companies that big investors and companies will use).

You will have a hard time finding this story on the news since they mostly hate Overstock and describe it 
as a ""obscure ecommerce platform"" (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/traders-bet-on-overstock-over-bitcoins-blockchain-technology.html)

If Bitcoin/Ethereum/cyrpto performs like we hope, this is one of the companies that could make Bitcoin and blockchain go mainstream and also hit back real hard at the financial system. (Patrick Byrne personal vendetta)

What do you guys think? 


TL;DR:

Overstock stock is worth looking into and basically Wall Street are treacherous pigs that will stop at nothing to get money from anyone weaker than them.

Also, after reading how Wall Street really fights (hard, dirty, illegal and fast), everyone should keep their REAL money in a hardware wallet!",cryptocurrency

My partner and I are looking at buying our first home in the next 18-24 months and will approved for lending of up to $500,000. My partner works as a mortgage banker so we are very fortunate in the fact we wont need a guarantor and will only have to put up a 10% deposit. We will also get better than market average interest rates, the nitty gritty of which I’m not too sure as he is the literal expert. 

At the moment we have a combined income of $130,000 (both in our mid 20's) and live in an area (wider area and immediate area included) in which houses average over $800,000 as of the last financial year. For those wondering where in the hell we live where house prices are that damn high the answer is Australia. Our current combined rent is $1,600 per month, which is about $400 below market average for where we live. The only debt we have is mine, which is a $10,000 student loan back in my home country of New Zealand. I have very recently increased my student loan repayments to $1,000 a month, which with the conversion rate will mean that I have it paid off by June of 2018. We live comfortably within our means but don’t begrudge ourselves luxuries such as yearly holidays and indulging in fulfilling our wants like new clothes, makeup, expensive dinners etc. 

My questions for you all is should we max out our purchasing budget and buy a $500,000 - $550,000 property an hour out of the city (we both work in the CBD) where would have to buy a car (gas is $5.16 a gallon, yes you read that right) and have the added expense of commuting or do we look at buying something well below our budget within the city and inner suburbs that will most likely (if not definitely) end up being an apartment. You can pick up a small apartment for a little as $350,000 and we wouldn’t need to purchase a car or have any additional cost of commuting.

Please peruse my information and offer any insight you can give r/personalfinance. Thanks!

I am a soon to be 29y/o registered nurse living in Chicago and let’s say I average ~70k/year income varying a bit depending on overtime and such. My weekly take home is approximately $1600-1700/week. Below are my expenses:

Rent: $833/month
Insurance/cell phone/etc: $135/month
Student loans (more below): $570/month
Car payment: $294/month
Utilities: ~$100/month

Outstanding debt:
Car loan: $16,985 @ 3.74%
Student loan: $6,995 @ 4.37%
Student loan: $12,617@ 9.67%
Student loan: $12,558 @ 7.42%
Student loan: $8,415 @ 6.8%
Student loan: $9,222 @ 6.8%
Student loan: $7,925 @ 6.8%
Student loan: $5,325 @ 3.86%
Student loan: $6,978 @ 3.86%

*I know it is a lot for student loans, unfortunately my family did not have money saved for myself to go to college and indecisive me got a bachelors in biology before nursing. 

My savings balance is approximately $55k in a chase savings account. 

My thoughts on a plan: My plan after the end of the year was to pay down the student loans that have high interest, most likely the 9% and 7% loans and then maybe a 6% with the highest principal. That leaves me with about 20k in savings. At that point I’m not sure where to go. Maybe consolidate the remaining loans together into a lower interest rate? Keep them as is and continue making my same payments to pay them down faster? Take half of what’s left in savings and invest? To note: I’m currently making no contributions to my 401k as to keep my take home high. Clearly I have extra money to pay groceries, fun, etc., but keep those expenses as low as possible. 

Also to note: my plan is to apply to school this upcoming year to become a nurse anesthetist greatly increasing my take home pay in the future, starting at roughly $140k a year. This unfortunately will put me in a tricky place in the meantime as I will likely have to take out loans for school and cost of living since the program is full time and doesn’t allow much for work. 

Thanks so much!",finance

personalfinance,Paystub question regarding relocation,"I was looking at my 2016 paystubs when I noticed something.

Here are my last 2 paystubs from 2016. Notice how the relocation offset amount changes, as well as the actual relocation amount. Any reason why this would change?

Some background, I moved mid year from a state that has state income tax to a state that does not. Around September, I received a paystub regarding the relocation offset in the amount $5339.61 as seen in the earlier paystub. Then the last paystub of the year, it reduced to the $4K number which also reduced the federal witheld tax.

gaming,(Spoilers) Stranger Things/Last of Us,"Disclaimer: I don’t think this similarity is intentional but, I felt like I had to point it out. 

After finishing season 2 of Stranger things one of my favorite things is the relationship Jim and Eleven have developed. I was so attached to it but the attachment felt familiar. After thinking about my favorite Daddy Daughter pairs i remembered Joel from the Last of Us. The relationship is very similar and i want to point out the similarities. 

Joel/Jim - 
 •Other than the fact that both of their names start with the letter J they both have the same kind of attitude about the world.  They both seem like they are really fed up with everyones shit.
•After the death of both of their daughter Sara and....Sarah they kinda gave up on their happiness. Hopper in season 1 is a bit of a slacker and doesn’t really give a shit anymore  
•They both wear flannels
•They both are the protagonist/hero of the story in same way or another. Obviously in Stranger Things the whole group is important but, Hopper most definitely brings a lot to the table

Ellie /Eleven
•Both their names start with the same two letters 
•They both have a very untrusting attitude when confronted with new faces but, after a while they learn to trust
•They both are “Special” in some way or another. Ellie being special because she cannot get infected and Eleven being special because well, she is Charles Xavier 
•They both go through a character arc where they are alone and have to hunt for food in the winter which is interesting
•They both are not necessarily the main character but definitely the catalysts of their respective mediums

Like I said I don’t think this was intentional just a interesting coincidence. As you know Elevens name isn’t Eleven so that also disproves me a little. I was just watching this season and it made me curious",technology
economy,Unintended Consequences of Easy Monetary Policy,"Easy monetary policy from global central banks has done a lot to help the global economy grow after the downturn of the Great Recession. Although the economy has continued to grow, it is not without consequence. This grand experiment that central banks have done is exactly that, an experiment. No one really knows what the consequences  will be with such a policy, and no one really knows when it is time to stop the experiment.

The monetary policy is simple to understand; keep interest rates low, and liquidity high. Interest rates are a tool that central banks have to either help boost an economy or slow it down. Typically, central banks will lower interest rates to help spur economic activity, while they raise them to slow it down.

In theory, lowering rates should help spur economic development because it makes it easier for people and companies to borrow money. They then use this cash for economic activity. Vice versa, if interest rates are raised, it makes borrowing costlier and thus slows down economic activity. Since the Great Recession was so drastic and harmful to the economy, interest rates were brought down to extremely low levels and for an extended period of time.

Not only were interest rates lowered to unprecedented levels, quantitative easing was used to increase the money supply. Quantitative easing was another response to the damaged economy from the Great Recession. In order to decrease interest rates in bond markets, central banks began to purchase large quantities of bonds through the open market. This in turn lowered rates along the yield curve, and increased the money supply. With more money in the system, it increases the supply and lowers the cost of borrowing. This in turn should increase the demand for cash, using simple supply-and-demand theory.

Now, all of this easing is bound to cause market reactions. For one, there is artificial demand created by central banks in the bond market. There is also a massive amount of liquidity in the market because of the large amount of money supply. And lastly, suppressing interest rates for such an extended amount of time can also pose a problem.

Artificial Demand for Bonds

Artificial demand for bonds means that the prices for bonds have raised, and investors have gained from it. With the central banks around the world inflating the asset, they are also drawing more demand for the asset because they know the central banks are helping the returns. It is like having insurance on your investments. In the beginning the Federal Reserve was basically guaranteeing that rates would go down, and your investment would rise in value. All of this demand for bonds pushed prices up, and made them more expensive.

This has also helped raise the prices of stocks that have higher dividend yields, and stocks that are linked to interest rates. For example, demand for utility stocks have grown and pushed up their valuation. When interest rates are low, utility companies have less costs associated with running their businesses and this helps grow their balance sheet. When interest rates are higher, they have more costs, and their balance sheet weakens. So as interest rates lower, the stock prices go up, but when they rise, the stock prices lower. Also, since these companies typically pay out a dividend, investors are looking to these companies to supplement the lack of income they are receiving from bonds.

When the artificial demand goes away, it will inevitably lower bond prices, raise interest rates, and cause losses for bond holders. What is worrisome is that there are now products that guarantee daily liquidity for an illiquid asset. Bond ETFs can be a problem in a time of panic. Why might there be a panic in the bond market?

A 30 plus year bond bull market may be coming to a halt. In 1981, the 10-year treasury rate was above 15%, and in July of 2016 the rate fell to 1.49%. Because of such a long market run, a lot of investors may not know how to handle a fall in their bond investments. With the inclusion of ETFs, investors can jump ship much easier than traditional bondholders, so they are more likely to do so. This will make their impact swift and painful, causing larger losses. Seeing large losses on bonds can make the other investors jump ship as well. As investors start to jump it will raise interest rates more and more until demand comes back.

For stocks, the higher interest rates are going to hurt the utility companies, and it will cause lower stock prices. The increased demand for dividends will also shrink because investors will eventually want to leave the higher risk asset class in stocks, and they will want to move back into fixed income.

High Liquidity

Higher liquidity has helped push all asset prices higher, stocks and bonds. When this liquidity starts to vanish, it should have the opposite effect, and prices should lower. This should mainly effect the bond market though since central banks are using it to add cash into the system. The stock market does have high valuations, but they are not inflated like the bond market. Sure, utility stocks will likely take a hit as well as inflated dividend stocks, but the strong economy makes an argument for the above average valuations in the rest of the market.

Suppressed Interest Rates

In the Austrian school of economics, suppressed interest rates are seen as a terrible thing. The idea behind it is that since interest rates are so low, investors and companies are willing to take on more debt than they otherwise would. This in turn will cause bad investments because borrowers have such an easy supply of cash. Eventually these bad investments, which would not have been funded during a normal interest rate period, will fail and harm the economy in the long run. Now central banks say they are being careful, and do not necessarily see a lot of bad investments taking place. However, a look into auto-loans shows an eerily similar picture to the financial crisis.

Millions of cars have been sold over the last few years. In fact, there have been record breaking sales numbers over this time period. However, when you look into the loans themselves, there are an alarmingly large number of investors that did not qualify for the loans. These sub-prime loans were the cause of the housing crisis, and now there is a buildup of them in the auto-loan sector. Sure, this time it may be different, for one cars are not as big of an asset as housing, but this does give some sense of how persistently low rates can lead to bad investments.

The Unintended Consequences

In the end, all we can really say is that interest rates are going to go back up. Unfortunately, we cannot claim that they will go up fast, slow, or somewhere in between, and we cannot predict exactly how policy normalization will affect the markets and the greater economy. Using our assumptions though, there are two main takeaways. One, bond investors are going to lose money as rates go up. This could cause panic, especially now that ETFs have become a factor. Two, utility stocks and dividend paying stocks are likely to take a hit from the rise of interest rates as well. Utility companies will lose profit from the rise of rates, and dividend paying stocks will falter because bonds will eventually look more attractive to income focused investors.

Only time will tell if the low interest rates will cause bad investments, but this experiment of easy money will be looked at for generations to come. Just like the Great Depression, the Great Recession will be looked at for its faults and its glories. Economists will look back at this time period and will decipher the causes and effects of all of the policies that have been implemented, and whether or not the outcomes were worth the risks. Just as the Federal Reserve and economists everywhere learned from the Great Depression, the Great Recession will hopefully prepare us for the next large economic downturn.

gaming,I don't Know why but I prefer console over PC,"I think something is wrong with me to be honest.

Some context first, I have a very beefy pc, gtx 1080, i7, 1440p monitor, blablabla . I also have a xone, a ps4 à 3ds and a switch.

And...I prefer playing on console.. Rather than on pc.
It doesn't make any sense regarding to comfort, I play both pc ans consoles on the same monitor, in my chair, at my desk.
I also don't have friends neither on PC nor console, so that's not the fact I follow my friends (and I barely play online anyway) 

But I realy enjoy myself more with a console. The things that come to my mind that could explain that are not directly related to the games themselfs, making the whole thing even more stupid.


For exemple, I love the social aspect of console gaming. Having friends online, direct chat, compare trophies, etc.

Also, I love the community aspect of console gaming. I truly feel I belong to a community when I play on console. You have conferences to keep the hype up, you can exchange with other players that play the same console. You follow a brand, with its figures like crash Mario, alloy, etc... 

I know nothing prevents me to exchange with strangers on pc and try to integrate a community but I don't know, there is not much that federates players, imo.

I also like the whole console experience, simply booting it, putting a CD in the console, browsing the stores, checking on your friend's trophies, games, etc. It is very hard to explain, because all this I can do on PC aswelll.but it's not the same..

Also, I noticed It takes me more time to tweak my games than playing them... 

To end about the pros and cons, pc has the advantage of having a lot of games, but now you have so much games ported to console that were pc exclusives, that this argument doesn't stand anymore. From pubg to smite, Overwatch, a lot of indies like stardew valley.... 

It realy saddens me, my pc is like 2500euros worth, and I don't like playing on it.

At this point I just want to sell it, buy an average pc to play the pc exclusives (but let's face it they are so few now) and buy an Xbox one x and a great TV for my every day gaming, and keep playing Sony and Nintendo for their awesome exclusives..

To sum it up, I think console gaming has the soul and feel pc lacks. 

I don't know what I expect from this thread, I just feel like I had to write it down. I know I make a big deal of little, it's just a hobby, but it really matters for me because gaming is truly a passion.

I’m a 22 year old mom of two, I’m still with my kids dad - and yes, I know that I made my own bed and I have to sleep in it.

I grew up in a rich family and was never taught any sort of budgeting skills and now that I’m on my own I’m literally f***ed, I’m so spoiled, I don’t wait for anything - it’s always been about instant gratification - and my depression often pushes me to shop.

Does anybody have any REALLY good money saving tips? Or budgeting tips? I haven’t slept in days because I’ve been stressing about this. Nobody knows it’s as bad as it is because we just got back from vacation... but in reality my family paid for the whole trip.

$10k/month income


If considering that there is about 4 years worth of coverage for the mortgage (i.e. if no income tomorrow, can cover 48 months of mortgage and living expenses comfortably)

After all of that there is about $200k surplus cash.

Should the $200k be:

* Thrown at the mortgage and take the outstanding amount to $660k or

* should it be used to invest in ""safe"" aristocrat type shares (J&amp;J, procter&amp;Gamble etc) shares that could pay out some dividends confidently at say 3-4% yield.

The intention here is to use the dividends to overpay the mortgage.

Considering overpayments are allowed without penalty, how would fellow redditors approach this scenario?

CHICAGO, Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace, today announced it intends to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of 2017, pending all relevant regulatory review periods.

The new contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.

""Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract,"" said Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  ""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.""

Since November 2016, CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd. have calculated and published the BRR, which aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a calculation window into the U.S. Dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4:00 p.m. London time. The BRR is designed around the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks. Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken are the constituent exchanges that currently contribute the pricing data for calculating the BRR.

""We are excited to work with CME Group on this product and see the BRR used as the settlement mechanism of this important product,"" said Dr.Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities. ""The BRR has proven to reliably and transparently reflect global bitcoin-dollar trading and has become the price reference of choice for financial institutions, trading firms and data providers worldwide.""

CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd. also publish the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI) to provide price transparency to the spot bitcoin market.  The BRTI combines global demand to buy and sell bitcoin into a consolidated order book and reflects the fair, instantaneous U.S. dollar price of bitcoin in a spot price. The BRTI is published in real time and is suitable for marking portfolios, executing intra-day bitcoin transactions and risk management.

Cryptocurrency market capitalization has grown in recent years to $172 billion, with bitcoin representing more than 54 percent of that total, or $94 billion.  The bitcoin spot market has also grown to trade roughly $1.5 billion in notional value each day.

The website for the app is at [http://taxgraphs.io](http://taxgraphs.io).

The different graphs available are:

- State Comparison: compare overall effective and marginal tax rates between states
- State Breakdown: view all individual effective and marginal tax rates for a state
- Take Home Pay: view net income amount and percent for a state 

Each graph can be set to display data for a specific state, tax year, filing status, and income range. The tax data can be adjusted with the standard deduction, personal exemption, dependent exemption, and the Saver's Tax Credit. The graph can also be adjusted with a log transform for viewing larger income ranges. The main things still missing from the options are Alternative Minimum Tax, Earned Income Tax Credit, and tIRA deductions - these have percentage phaseouts which require significantly reworking my current data model, so I'm currently trying to figure out how to incorporate them.

The graphs should otherwise be mostly accurate based off the feedback I had received from the prior [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jdku7/i_made_a_web_app_that_graphs_effective_marginal/), and I fixed reported issues with using federal taxable income for certain states like Colorado, plus applying state deductions and their income phaseouts. But there's a ton of graph variations for the tax data, so I can definitely look into any other data inaccuracies.

Also want to note that the app will remember your graph settings so you don't have to re-configure them the next time you visit, but this is done locally in the browser and nothing gets sent to a server. The code is also open sourced and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hermantran/taxgraphs) if anyone wants to take a deeper look.

Hope this might be useful, and I appreciate any additional feedback and feature suggestions!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Rehabilitation Program Advice Needed,"This is embarrassing. Insert the usual ""I was stupid and irresponsible in college"" story here.  I learn something every day from this sub, and I can't thank you all enough.  Today it's my turn to ask for some advice.  

I have several FFEL loans dating from before 2008, and as a result of long-term unemployment they have gone into collections.  Trying to get back in control of the situation, I'm in the loan rehabilitation program with the servicer, National Enterprise Systems.  I know they're shady and generally not very nice people, but I'm trying to do my homework so that I know exactly what to expect and how to best manage the situation.  I'm fortunate enough that once the rehabilitation is complete I'll be able to start making regular payments again.

My biggest concern is about what happens when loan rehabilitation is over.  The documentation says that the collections fees will be capped at 16% of the outstanding balance.  Can I make additional payments to reduce the balance during the rehabilitation term and avoid some of that cost?  I also know my loans will potentially be sold to a new lender, but what will happen to the interest rate?

I'm nervous about whether this was this even the right move. Did I get scammed by a debt collector?",finance
Bitcoin,I think its time to call the B2X movement what it is - An attempt at regulatory capture.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture

&gt;Regulatory capture is a form of government failure that occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead **advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.**[1] When regulatory capture occurs, **the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public**, leading to a net loss to society as a whole. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called ""captured agencies"".

In this scenario, we have 2 groups colluding to capture the regulatory capabilities of bitcoin. Bitcoin works by having separate groups working in harmony to the economic benefit for themselves and for the network and its owners/participants.

The miners, who's duty it is to order transactions and timestamp, do not have very much power over bitcoin as an individual group. They will not mine at a loss for any long period of times and the users of bitcoin via market mechanisms determine the price, and therefore the profitability of miners hashing.

But if miners collude with centralized financial hubs, e.g. exchanges, fiat bridges, market makers, etc, then this collusion presents a real regulatory capture attempt upon the bitcoin network. If exchanges refuse to process bitcoin transactions, or if large entities claim that bitcoin is not bitcoin and that the non-incumbent challenger is bitcoin, then this suppresses free will and free market mechanisms from naturally occuring within the marketplace and can have drastic effects upon outcome.

I ultimately believe the attempt will fail, but there is no guarantee that there will not be massive damages done to the ecosystem as the result of the takeover, just like when a country rebuffs an invasion from a hostile army, they do not come out of the war without wounds both physical, mental and socioeconomic.

I have been around this sub reading since late 2012, and participating since 2013. I have watched Jeff Garzik talk about bitcoin core being the modern version of the church, claiming that we are just trading Monarchs for ""cabals of priests"".

Except now Garzik has been elected the Pope of that church (B2X), and the parliament (DCG/Silbert &amp; Friends + Miners) has been corrupted to support his actions, building a populist movement against science and academia. He is now the **single developer** of the B2X codebase and is so incompetent that he could not even get a single line code change correct without help from core, let alone [rebase 0.15.x codebase to b2x, blaming non-existent bugs to hide his incompetence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/78u066/the_b2x_developer_does_not_have_the_time_or_skill/). And this is the same guy who just announced a [20% premined ICO for a altcoin that has even B2X supporters confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/78jqgk/jeff_garzik_announcing_his_ico_right_before/). Oh, and who invested in that premine? Yup, you got it! DCG Group! 

So wait, the DCG group is funding a hostile takeover of the bitcoin project to install a single developer to control the codebase, colluding with a majority hashrate of miners to attack the network, without replay protection, **all while funding a competitor?**

Now, as we dig a little deeper, we find out that [the majority of B2X proponents are funded by DCG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/74vn2u/is_segwit2x_the_real_banker_takeover/), and DCG itself is basically a bankers cabal. Lets also not forget that DCG funded coinbase! 

So we now have the largest financial $USD bridges that are operating as the platform to bridge bitcoin to $ colluding with centralized mining pools to *force invalid rule changes upon the network*.

Let us also not forget the [multimillion deal between bitpay and bitmain](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-partners-bitmain-multi-million-dollar-agreement/) and that bitpay used to be pro-core before this takeover.

Guys, this is so blatantly the biggest institutional driven threat bitcoin has ever seen. They are engaging in classic regulatory capture behavior attempting to centralize control by colluding with multiple factions that would normally balance each other. This is not very much different from the ""Pillars of Democracy"" (Federal, Executive, Judicial) balancing each other out for the best interests of the public. But just like democracy, a decentralized system *can and will* be captured if we allow [complacency and apathy to dominate our behaviors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ncpsm/complacency_is_much_more_dangerous_than_fatalism/).

Say what you will about Bitcoin Core and Blockstream, at least they adhere to cypherpunk principals. At least they engage in open and transparent actions and give users the free will by providing opt-in open source code.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Bittrex holding bitcoins and not verifying my account!,"Ive used Bittrex for several years now without any hiccup. Three weeks ago I was given a notification that the account has been limited to a .025 withdrawal limit per day until I further verify the account.

I did the basic verification, had 2FA enabled and then proceeded to  do their Enhanced verification. Went through their automatic wizard at midnight and it just sat there stating validating. Eventually, after 5 mins or so I restarted it thinking it goofed. Same thing, 15 minutes later it says I need a manual verification.

I've created three support cases the first two were set to resolved without any meaningful reply. They copy pasted a block of text on how to do enhanced verification. I've provided every document requested but it seems that Bittrex is hell bent on not replying and forcing me to withdraw with ridiculous fees each time for the max daily limit of 0.025.

personalfinance,Roth or Traditional 401k?,"Hi Everyone,

I am 24 years old, making $85,000 pre-tax, and single. As a result, I fall into the 25% federal tax bracket. Although I am trying to ultimately decide which kind of 401k option (Roth or traditional) I am going to contribute to, I also want to know what factors I should consider. 

I have already done some research and tried using an investment calculator for both the Roth and traditional 401k and the difference seems negligible. Any input, opinion, and advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Is Debt Consolidation right for me? (27F, $15k)","Hey everyone,
I am trying to figure out if debt consolidation is a good option for me. I have about $15k in credit card debt currently on 2 cards (16.24% and 15.24% purchase APR). I have brought it down from closer to $20k by paying more than the minimum and watching my spending each month. I have a steady job and I make around $80k/yr. 

I never used to hold much of a balance on my credit cards before, my previous MO to be paying the balance in full every month. Unfortunately it’s been a year with unforeseen expenses for myself (accident that put me out of work for 5 weeks), my live in SO (periods of unemployment/underemployment), and my dog (surgery)... I’ve been chipping away at the debt, but the interest freaks me out. I never really considered debt consolidation before, but happened to open a piece of mail offering me a loan at 9.99% fixed interest rate for 36-72 months. Not saying I’d necessarily jump on the first thing offered to me, but it did get me thinking about my options. 

As I’ve never had to do anything like this before, I have some general newbie questions...

1) Would this affect my credit? (Positively or negatively) I currently have excellent credit (738)

2) What kind of loans are out there? Is 9.99% really good or could I find better? What about waiting periods (“no interest for the first xx days”...the one I got in the mail said 45 days)?

3) I can still pay it off faster than whatever amount I were to choose, right? Like even if I chose a 36 month loan, I’d be allowed to pay it in a year and avoid interest? These may be dumb questions, I just have never had any loan besides credit cards before. 


Thanks!

We are also figuring out how to allot this money. We have debt, and normally I'd put everything on there because I hate interest. BUT, we have found we're not able to have children without a ton of (expensive) help, so we want to put some of the money there, as well.

How have other people dealt with this type of thing? How do you deal with wanting to do the ""smart"" financial thing, but also wanting to have children? We looked into loans for these services, but most of them require a matching amount or have super high interest rates, so it seems smarter to use this...

personalfinance,[Auto] Car Loan Question,"I currently have a 2016 Equinox. I got my loan when my credit was poor at a 9.9% rate through Wells Fargo at 72 months and $499 a month. I recently inquired about a new loan with a lower rate. I still owe $22,771.47 on the original loan with 57 months left.

My credit score is now 690. The new rate would be 7.45. Still not great, but better. The payment drops to $399 a month BUT they want to extend the loan out to 72 months. The paperwork says the new total for this loan, financing fee and everything comes out to $28,308.24. So... $5,635.77 in interest.

I don't particularly like extending the loan out again to 72 months, since it means I have to go another year and 3 months before it's paid off, although I could continue just paying $500 a month and clear it out sooner at a lower interest rate. I was originally going to decline but the sales person was stressing that they had to work to get me the loan since the trade in value of the car was something like $18,000.

I guess I'm just looking for other opinions... Is this a good deal? I know the loan is upside down for now but theoretically it'll catch up at some point, correct? Any advice?
