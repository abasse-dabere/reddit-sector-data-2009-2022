personalfinance,"Current vehicle is on last legs, need to look at getting a used car. No savings - Bad credit is giving me a high interest rate. Any advice?","My current vehicle is about to hit the 20 year mark and has seen some better days. I plan on either driving it until it dies or selling it privately after I get a different vehicle. I have an ugly credit score in the 500s. I am fully aware I should not look at anything fancy or expensive.

I have requested for auto loans of around $10-$13K online from nearly 8 different banks/credit unions and have been denied. The 3 credit unions I tried and got denied by were local - would I get a better chance by meeting in person?

The only entity that has approved me is CapitalOne with whom I recently got a credit card from about 6 months ago, however they provided me with a 12-20% interest rate depending on the vehicle.

I'm aware it's a very high interest rate, but due to my poor/lack of credit is my only choice to bite the bullet and lay in the bed that I made?",finance
personalfinance,19 y/o student looking for financial advice,"Okay, so I've been lurking a lot lately and now I'm looking for some more personalized advice on what I should do with my money.  


I'm a full-time student going for a B.S. in Biotechnology with a focus in pharmaceutical design.


I have $15,700 in Stafford Loans and $10,250 in loans from Discover. However, I transferred to a school where my 4.0 GPA gets me a full scholarship from my school (minus the initial standard $3k or so in federal loans) &amp; my Stafford loans cover my rent.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

I just got a job making $10/hr full time (vs $8.00 part time before).   


Expenses:  
*$33/month for car insurance  
*$100ish/month for gas  

&amp;nbsp;

When I turned 18 I got a Discover It Chrome Student Card. I was really good about it for a while, but at some point I got a little swipe happy and I've kept a pretty high balance on it - about $600 on a $750 credit limit (awful, I know).  

&amp;nbsp;

I've been using Mint for the last few years but it leaves a lot to be desired for me. Discover tracks my FICO score (currently 679), but I just started using Credit Karma, too (TransUnion 641 &amp; Equifax 648). I also downloaded YNAB for the free student trial but I haven't started it yet.  

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, here are the things I'm looking to accomplish.  
*Pay down my credit balance   
*Improve my credit score  
*Create a general savings account (I guess for rainy days/emergencies)  
*Create a savings fund for car expenses (oil changes, tires, repairs, etc.)  
*Make &amp; stick to a reasonable monthly budget    
*save $300 spending money for an otherwise paid-for trip to Canada in early July  

&amp;nbsp;

I also want to apply for a new credit card because I'm not super obsessed with the rewards on my Discover card.   


I considered going the secure card route, but I don't want something that will be obsolete in a year when my credit improves/turns into a mediocre unsecured card that I won't want to use (but won't close due to the credit hit). 
However, I don't want a hard inquiry for a card that might not get approved &amp; I don't know when is a good time to open a new card with everything that's on the Discover card right now.    

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone has some advice on to what I can do to really maximize my financial situation, I'd appreciate it ton. I'm trying to get everything sorted out ASAP, and I love the feeling of getting things done/hitting goals &amp; I want to build good financial habits early so I'm really excited to get started on this!

Bitcoin,Do people realize bitcoin was created by an american libertarian?,"practically all the cypherpunks were american libertarians.  even dorian satoshi nakamoto.

the whole premise of bitcoin is based off libertarianism.

we're talking ron paul libertarianism.  the guy that should've won the republican nomination in 2012.  he ran in 2008, too.

i find it funny that the chinese and european folks (European Union) who have this socialist/communist culture/mindset (whether it's full blast or lingering still) think they know what's best for bitcoin.

most bitcoin is bought and traded by americans.

the white paper is in english and again probably created by an american libertarian.

and notice how the BU folks are mostly EU/Chinese communist/socialist shills which is the TOTAL opposite of bitcoin?

i also find it funny the democrats (widely popular in california/silicon valley) think they know what bitcoin is all about, even coinbase seems to have that left-leaning perspective.

ever notice how bitcoin unlimited is all about centralization?  which reflects remnants of chinese communist and European Union culture (the EU which is DEAD and la penn will win).

i mean, seriously, guys.  bitcoin is a libertarian movement.

i just find it funny that hardcore bitcoin folks don't realize this.

libertarianism is about FREE MARKET, FREE CHOICE, SMALL SMALL GOVERNMENT, INDEPENDENCE, LIBERTY, FREEDOM. not NAZI dictators, not commies and socialists telling you what's good for you/etc. 

i also find it concerning that a lot of n00bz in bitcoin (yes even the american ones) don't even realize this concept of decentralization and freedom from centralized dictators which is what jihan/ver are trying to be.  fuck that.  it is OVER for them.  communism DOES NOT WORK.  socialism doesn't even work!  so most of these n00bz go into alt-coins cuz they think they know about true crypto.  bitcoin is true crypto.

yes, bitcoin was created to be a peer-to-peer cash system BUT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  meaning decentralization, that is the main part.  it was created because the federal reserve (which is as federal as federal express and NOT a government entity) could print dollars out of thin air causing inflation stealing YOUR wealth.  it wasn't created primarily just to be peer-to-peer cash system like paypal, the whole point is DECENTRALIZATION.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,GF 150k student loan debt. Need advice please!,"My gf has racked up 150k of student loans between undergrad and grad school. This is spread out over 16 Federal loans, with interest rates ranging from 3.86% - 7.2%. She is working in a nonprofit and plans to stay in the nonprofit world for at least 10 years (she currently plans on doing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness). She currently makes about 50k with room to grow in a few years. Originally, she budgeted about $800-$1000/month to go towards loans. She is about to start making payments (just graduated) and is automatically enrolled in the graduated repayment plan, which is approximately ~$800/month to start. If she were to do the standard repayment plan, the payments are ~$1200/month.  To qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness she would need to consolidate her loans and enroll in income based repayment. This payment would be around $400/month. I'm concerned because this payment doesn't even come close to covering the interest payments and I'm not too sure about the future of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. My worry is that after paying less than the interest for many years, the program will end and she'll be stuck with a ton of debt. I've read a lot about the debt avalanche approach and I'm leaning towards that. The downside to doing the debt avalanche is that theoretically she could have her loans forgiven in 10 years on PSLF and unnecessarily pay way more than she has to. Should she consolidate and do the PSLF and pay way less than interest and bank on getting her loans forgiven? Or should she attempt the debt avalanche approach? She is currently paying down all her CC debt but she needs to make a decision on this soon.

Budget info:
Income/month: $2900
All expenses per month (food, rent, CC debt, etc): ~$2100-$2400

technology,Message from my old representative about his stance on the FCC,"TL;DR: More of the same misdirection. To those uneducated on this subject, this may actually sound like a good thing. This makes me angry. 

""Wicker Encouraged by FCC Action to Support a Free and Open Internet

Obama-Era Rules Deter Investment, Hurting Broadband Expansion and Consumer Choice

The Internet has revolutionized our world over the past 25 years, and it has done so within a regulatory framework that allowed for unprecedented growth and tremendous breakthroughs. Unnecessary interference from Washington only threatens to disrupt this successful equation.

I support the recent announcement by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to roll back the misguided and overbearing regulatory structure imposed during the Obama Administration.  Access, choice, and low costs are important to American consumers when it comes to high-speed Internet.  That is not what the Democratic-led FCC achieved with the reclassification of broadband service under a burdensome, utility-like regulatory framework. 

Instead, the short-term effect of giving the federal government broad control over the Internet has produced exactly the opposite results.  In a recent speech, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai noted how big and small Internet service providers have been negatively affected, with plans for investment and innovation curtailed.  When that happens, consumers lose out on better services and options.

Rules Needed for 21st-Century Broadband Landscape

Closing the digital divide is a top priority of mine as chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee that oversees Internet issues.  To do so, Internet service providers need the confidence and certainty to invest in our nation's most rural areas.  A restrictive regulatory framework that chills growth and jeopardizes investment could hold back our underserved communities, stifling the potential for jobs and economic development with it.

Moreover, the Obama-era decision by the FCC to classify broadband service as a ""common carrier"" under Title II of the ""Communications Act of 1934"" simply does not make sense.  Title II is supposed to apply to telephone and utility companies.  It was intended for the Ma Bell monopoly of the Great Depression – a market much different from the broadband landscape of the 21st century.  A heavy-handed regulatory structure does more harm than good in an environment that has succeeded because competition was allowed to flourish there.  Simply put, the FCC's party-line vote to adopt Title II amounted to a government takeover of the Internet.  

This is not to suggest the need for a completely hands-off regulatory approach.  For example, protecting consumer privacy is of the utmost importance.  In addition, Internet providers should not be able to block legal content or prioritize certain network traffic.  But a light-touch regulatory system has created the online experience Americans enjoy today.  The FCC's proposal to restore this light-touch framework is a sensible move.  This was the regulatory framework that existed under both Democratic and Republican administrations until 2015.

Time Is Ripe for Legislative Solution

The FCC's action also offers Congress an opportunity to do more to ensure a free and open Internet for all Americans.  This is a non-controversial goal, and one that has been touted by Republicans and Democrats.  Lawmakers from both political parties can agree that broadband Internet should be accessible, affordable, and reliable.  At the heart of the issue is how to put a free and open Internet into practice while protecting consumers and their online experience. 

The FCC's announcement that it seeks to reverse the utility-style classification lays the groundwork for a legislative solution.  The time is ripe for Congress to find a way to balance proper regulatory oversight without stifling the freedom of Internet service providers to grow and innovate.  Republican lawmakers have already put forward constructive policy ideas as a start.  I am hopeful a bipartisan majority will agree that a legislative solution is the best way to ensure certainty, where rules are in place to protect consumers and promote innovation for years to come.""",technology

I made a lot of irresponsible decisions over the past few years, namely racking up credit card debt. I also finished my undergraduate degree just last spring. I have maintained two jobs over the past two years, one full time and one part time, but due to poor budgeting and, well, just a LOT of credit card bills, I haven't been able to keep up.

This year, due to me messing up my taxes, I owe the feds $2,000! In addition to that, my student loans are now due, with income based repayments estimated at $250 a month! 

I start a new job in a week that's a pay bump, but due to a new tax bracket, I'm making about the same. While I HATE it, I'm obviously not opposed to working another job to get out of this mess. I have created a budget but there just doesn't seem to be enough money. Help!

Income: 

Job 1: $37, 752 ($18.15/hr, 40 hours a week ... this is the new job)....take home, if I calculated this right after taxes: $1,113

Job 2: $16-17 an hour, variable shifts, just pick up as needed (average 1-2 shifts a week)

All of this in my budget and I'm not including personal money or any misc. expenses. I have NOTHING in savings and I am behind on my bills. I am tired of getting the calls.

Ways I'm trying to help myself: I'm familiar with Dave Ramsey's snowball debt method, and I plan to use it, but I simply don't have enough. I have met with a consumer credit bureau in my area and I'm discussing options. I met with my credit union to see if they will give me a personal loan to consolidate and my debt to income ratio is too high. They were willing to negotiate if I had a co-signer, but I don't. I am trying to call my creditors and negotiate terms. I have two jobs. I am selling some of my stuff (bike, nice camera, guitar) in order to try and pay down the IRS. I'm willing to donate plasma.

I don't want to file bankruptcy, but with everything all at once, I am just so overwhelmed and not sure what to do.

I only have a debit card and I don't have a credit card or any debt/loans. I thought I had savings bonds, but my father cashed them before I turned 18. 

I currently work retail and make $9hr. I try to get scheduled for 30-32 hours every week but they will not give me more.

The application also asked for two $25 fees but it didn't give me an option to pay for it after I put in my FAFSA information.

I don't have a phone because I'm trying to save money otherwise I would call. I don't know what to do. 

I don't know how much I'm getting from the FAFSA. Is the Pell grant a monthly thing? These were the results of my application:

I don't have my license or permit and I need to purchase a car so I can have transportation. I looked on craigslist and they're cheaper than the dealership but everyone keeps telling me to not do it? There are some cars for $800-$2400 and I can buy it right now and have that part done. Your sidebar recommends saving up $5000 for a good car but I don't know why when there are cheaper cars? Is there something I'm missing?

I don't know how to get an apartment. Part of my father's letter states I must take my pets with me, so I'll also have 3 small housetrained pets. Will this hurt the lease? Can I setup a direct deposit with the apartment's landlord so I can pay my bill on time?

I am currently in the process of getting the permission to work from the US government. Once I receive the permission to work I will immediately start looking for a job.

personalfinance,"Should I repay the card, or put it in my emergency fund?","Hi guys, I've got a situation for which I'm struggling to work out the best course of action.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been working for some time to get my financial situation under better control, due to some financial difficulties at university, and repeatedly making small mistakes over time whilst I tried to get other things in my life on track, I have a reasonable amount of debt racked up in a few places. That debt breaks down as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

* £14,900 left to pay on a personal loan (over another 4.5 years at 8.6%) which I pay £253.22 a month for

* £11,800 0% PCP finance contract for my car (which I pay £180 a month for, and have almost the full 3 years left)

* £2000 free overdraft (my account is still a graduate account, so this doesn't cost me yet)

* £740 0% finance for a purchase I made (I pay £82.50 a month for that and have about 9 months left)

* And lastly I have £2500 outstanding on a credit card (16.9% APR interest rate)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm handling the debt fine right now, I make good money and make all my payments comfortably with money to spare and am starting to make more concerted efforts to lower my debt faster and more efficiently. My first port of call has been to start building up an initial emergency fund, which I'm intending to be £1800 (~1 month of expenses, as per the advice from this: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics, as I do have debt with an interest rate higher than 10%, which is the credit card in question).

&amp;nbsp;

The situation I'm struggling with is this. I went on a business trip recently for which my company required me to front the cost of my accommodation and meals and get reimbursed after the trip, this is fine and I have the money back. Whilst I was abroad I used my credit card for these expenses so as I wouldn't get charged foreign currency fees. So now I have this position, I can either put the £1200 that I've been reimbursed back onto my card, or I can put that cash into my emergency fund. Putting it into the emergency fund will mean that I hit my £1800 and the fund has enough in it to start putting more money into the credit card to pay it off, (I think I can fill in ~£500 a month on a standard month, more if I have on-call work). 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like following the flow charts correctly means putting the money into the emergency fund, and then work on paying back the card afterwards is the right call, but given the money came off the card in the first place it's left me feeling like maybe paying it straight back is the right call.

&amp;nbsp;

Which brings me back to the question in the title, should I repay the card or put the money towards my emergency fund?

personalfinance,Loan interest rates vs. investment interest rates,"I recently learned how loan interest is calculated, which led me to thinking about how it compares to investment interest.

Essentially, the total cost of a $1,000,000 loan at 5% after 30 years is $1,932,557.84 (according to an online calculator). The value of $1,000,000 invested at 5% for 30 years is $4,321,942.38. In fact, even at an interest rate of 2.3%, the investment would earn very slightly more than the cost of the 5% loan.

Do things actually work this way? If so, why is this not better known? I frequently see advice saying that if your loan interest rate equals or exceeds your investment return, then you should pay down the loan first. As far as I can tell, the worst annualized return the S&amp;P has ever had over a 30 year period, is a little below 8% and that's if you invested at the height of the market, just before the Great Depression. Seems that if you had a loan rate below this, it would rarely make sense to pay it down first (obviously depends on your personal financial situation).

How does inflation affect this? Am I thinking about things the wrong way?",finance

personalfinance,Banks for non-US citizens worth applying for.,"Currently I bank with a Chase in California. Since I don't do anything special with it, aside from the usual deposit then spend actions, I thought they were pretty okay. Wells Fargo and BoA kept acting retarded when it came to customer support and overall service. 

However, I have found that Chase doesn't keep my expenses up to date nor in order of date of transaction. The end result is having all my expenses come out at the same time, and getting overdrawn. 

I acknowledge all my purchases, however, not having accurate data leads me to believe I have money when I really don't. Chase offers a Low Balance Warning Notification system, but it stops reporting once I make a deposit. My money is not in my bank account since it's being processed, and the warnings stop. Chase tallies up my expenses, gets ready to charge an overdraft fee, then it tallies up my deposits. 


It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it throws me off my budget and pisses me off. I relied heavily on Gwallet, but that's gone. PayPal does most of the same things, but it won't allow for check deposits. Alliant, Navy Federal, and even Simple won't allow me to get an arcing with them because I'm not a US citizen. I'm here on a work permit with valid SS card and DL. 

I'm turning to you guys for suggestions on online banks of brick and mortar banks who are more reliable than Chase.

personalfinance,"(US-NJ) My fiancee and I are looking to purchase a home in 6-12 months. In 2-4 months, we will both be moving from MD to NJ and getting new jobs.

I've read that switching jobs can be a liability when applying for a mortgage.  This brings me to two questions:

1.  How much will it impact our borrowing ability and interest rate if both of us have only been with our new employers for less than  6 months?

2.  Is it worth getting pre-approved for a mortgage while we both still have jobs with a long job history with our current employers?

personalfinance,Newly married with $9k credit card debt. Are we in trouble?,"Hi all, 

I haven't posted in here for forever but a lot has changed since I did.

In October, my now-husband and I bought our first house. We got an incredibly low interest rate and our mortgage payments ended up being about $350 more/month than what we were paying in rent (that kept increasing each year), so we went for it. In March, we got married and are now in the process of joining our bank accounts and coming up with a concrete plan to pay off our debts. He is 26 and I'm about to turn 26, just for reference.

We have about $9k combined credit card debt. Both of us have done balance transfers so we currently are not paying interest until March 2018. We are both in grad school getting our Masters with him finishing in December and me finishing in 2019. Once I'm done, we'll have about $68k combined student loan debt. He has $25k which we will need to begin paying next summer. I suspect those payments will be about $300/month. His program will allow him to hopefully get a job paying $10k more/year right off the bat. I'm in marketing so having a Masters for me is a great resume boost, but it doesn't have a clear-cut salary increase. However, I'm at a great company with endless growth possibilities and if all goes as planned, I'll be making $70k/year here by the time I'm done with school (but hopefully sooner).

Here is where we're at currently:

Husband: ~ $2200/month after taxes
Me: ~$2900k/month after taxes -- this changes month to month because I'm technically hourly (even though I'm given a salary and am guaranteed 40 hours, it's weird). I get overtime which averages about $250/month. I also get ~$600 commission and $3500 bonus/year but don't like to count any of that into our extra money because it's not guaranteed money.

**=$5100/month income after taxes**

	- Mortgage: $1655
	- Cars: $700 (fresh out of college, husband bought a car he couldn't afford and we're upside-down on it. My car is $266/month and is a lease so there's not much we can do right now about our cars)
	- Car insurance: $230
	- Cell phone: $85
	- Electric: $135 on average (sometimes it's $100, sometimes it's $170. We live in FL so we're always running the AC)
	- Water: $45
	- Cable/internet: $100
	- Gym: $100 (which I'm planning on cancelling and going somewhere that's about $40/month cheaper)
	- Parking: $65
	- Tolls: $100
	- Gas: $270
	- Groceries/dog food: $500
	**= $3985 bills**

This leaves us with about $1100 extra a month not taking into account my overtime. This also doesn't take into account any ""fun"" or ""extra"" expenses. We have this is we literally don't leave the house or buy anything but the bare necessities. 

Are we in a horrible position given our debt? We don't know whether to save or pay down credit cards. We have $5k in savings right now, but that is supposed to go back to my dad (who helped us with our down payment on the house) when we build up that savings on our own. So I don't like to count it. 

We have about $4k of extra money coming later this year from a few different things (homestead tax overage check, husband got a raise and will get back-pay, and I'm getting a refund from school because I switched programs and the new program's tuition is cheaper). 

Let's say we put $500/month away. Is that enough? Should it go to savings or credit cards first? When we get extra money like I mentioned above, where should it go? I have about $80k of open credit, so I know if we didn't pay off our full balance by the time our interest-free period ends, I could do another BT. But I know that's just moving debt around and delaying  the problem.

Really any input and advice would be great because we're not sure where to prioritize.",finance

personalfinance,8 Month Review of Consumer's CU 4.59% APY Checking Account,"If you aren't familiar with CCU you can check out their [free checking rewards here](https://www.myconsumers.org/personal/checking/free-rewards-checking).

I opened a CCU checking and credit account about 8 months ago.  I mentioned it somewhere on Reddit prior to that and a lot of people assumed it was a ""scam"", saying either they would drop the interest rate or change the requirements after a few months.  I wanted to provide an update and mention how some of the requirements are more difficult to meet than they might seem, but so far, no scams or requirement changes have taken place.

First of all, you must make 12 credit transactions with the check card per month to qualify.  These transactions need to be made AND cleared between the 1st and 28th of each month.   I've found that most transactions take between 8 and 10 days to clear.  So basically you need to make those 12 transactions in the first ~20 days of the month.  Any transactions that don't clear by the 28th will not be carried over to the next month.  So the best thing to do is to get those 12 transactions done as soon as possible in the first few weeks, then switch to using the credit card to help bring that credit up to the $500-$1000 minimum for the max APY.

Which brings up my next point, the minimum credit card balance.  If you have a $1200 credit card balance and decide to pay off $800 on the 27th, then you will not qualify for the 3.59% or 4.59% rates.  I think this is pretty shady and I don't see it mentioned anywhere in the fine print, but unless I'm not doing something correctly, this is how it works.  So wait until the 1st of the month to pay the credit card off to maintain the maximum amount owed on the 28th.  Also this only counts credit card transaction made and cleared between the 1st and 28th so carrying a balance month to month isn't going to help at all.

Next is the direct deposit/ACH requirement.   I've had ACH transactions held for 2 weeks+.  I'm not sure which side of the transaction issues the hold, but I've found it best to just make the payment on the 1st along with the credit card payment.  I try to keep all my bills lined up to be able to be paid on the 1st so I can do everything at once anyway.

So far I have been paid $287 in dividends and charged $0 in fees.",finance
personalfinance,24 YO needing advice on Debt Consolidation,"Hello All,

First time posting to /personalfinance, so here we go:


I am a full time teacher with two long-term part time jobs who needs some advice on debt consolidation.  I made some dumb mistakes when I was younger and am still working on those.  I have a husband who has a part-time job, but does not make enough for full, financial support, so a lot of financial responsibility is put on me, which I am okay with.  Let me break down my life for you:


Take-Home Monthly Pay = ~ $3,150


Expenses:
Rent - $350
Car Payment - $379 (will end August 2019)
Car Insurance (multiple cars) - $200
Electricity - $~$80
Internet - $40
Amazon Credit Card Payment - $50 ($600 remaining)
Capital One Payment -$100 ($2,700 remaining)
Wells Fargo CC - $50 ($850 remaining)
PayPal Credit Payment - $50 ($1,230 remaining)
Wells Fargo Line of Credit - $100 ($3,800 remaining)
Lending Club Personal Loan - $240 ($4,100 remaining/will end October of 2019) 
Student Loan - $170 (will end August 2019 due to Teacher Forgiveness Program)
Phone - ~$100


The remaining is spent on food, gas,
miscellaneous purchases, husband's bills, etc.  I try to put $100 in savings monthly, but I just had to use my emergency fund for an emergency, so that does not exist anymore.


I feel like every time I make a payment, it means nothing to the overall balance.  For example, I pay $100 to WF line of credit, but only $50 goes to balance and the other to the principal.  I get that I have way to many accounts open (like I said, young,dumb choices were made).  I know that I can pay more down on the overall totals, but it just seems impossible with all of my financial responsibilities.


I have an option.  At first, I thought Lending Club was sketchy, but I was desperate and my rate wasn't that ridiculous.  I have been offered a loan from them for $14,000 at a rate of 11.39%.  Monthly payment is $460.94 for 36 months with no penalty for early payoff/larger payments and that rate will stay the same for the whole payoff time.  If I take that loan, I can payoff ALL of my credit cards, close most of those accounts, and the other Lending Club loan.  It would lower my monthly expenses to credit cards by about $150 and if I have extra money come in, I can pay it towards that overall principal balance.  After making that payment every month, I would have more wiggle room and can add more money to the emergency fund.


I know replacing debt with debt isn't the best option, but I'm just stressed with the amount of bad interest rates from my precious choices.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Ideas?  Help!  Thank you all.

I was thinking id focus on the navient loan first since its a private loan with a high interest rate. Was thinking of shopping around to get it refianced to hopefully around 3%-6%. Was wondering if that would be a good idea to refiance that navient loan and focus on paying that before making larger payments for the federal loans?

The interest rate is 2.8%  My husband and I want to purchase a house.

He has now proposed we hang onto the condo and rent it out.  We could likely rent our property anywhere between 1200-1500 and our mortgage with HOA is just under 1000.  He has mentioned borrowing money against our current loan to use as downpayment.  We are going to talk to our financial institution about this, but I wanted to throw out the question to this audience.  On one hand, it would be nice to have a steady income from that property for as long as we like.  On the other hand, I am very hesitant to go into a new loan on a house with little downpayment OR with taking money against the condo and thus furthering the life of that loan.",finance
personalfinance,First time home buyer in Virginia looking for advice,"Hey everyone, thanks for looking! Some quick details:

I'm 27M from VA, making about $43K per year pre-tax. I currently have about $17K in my savings and $14K in my ROTH 401K while contributing 25% and receiving 6% match from the company (only 20% vested currently, will be going up 20% every year in October). Additionally, I receive $7-10K per year from an outside venture.

So what kind of programs and credits am I eligible to take advantage of as a first time home buyer in this state? I understand first time buyers are often given the opportunity to only put 10% as the down payment rather than the traditional 20%, which is nice but also sounds like it would be bad in the long run due to interest payments.

From my understanding of my 401K, I'm allowed to loan myself up to 50% of my savings, maximum $50K, to help pay for a house and have 10 years to pay it back with a 1% interest rate that I pay to myself. Maxing out on this (whatever that number happens to be at the time) seems like a no-brainer, right?

I'm not looking to buy in the immediate future, I know I don't have the assets on hand right away. Luckily my current living situation is free. I live in an expensive area and will be lucky to find a decent 1,200 sq ft. condo/town house in the low $300K range.

personalfinance,Which loan to payoff with tuition reimbursement?,"I have about 50k in student loans that I am working on paying off. I have ~29,000 in (mostly) subsidized federal loans and ~21,000 in private loans which I refinanced through SoFi/mohela.

Of the 29k in federal loans, 7k are from classes I am currently taking which my employer will reimburse me for once completed. My question is if I should take the 7k and apply it to a loan other than the loan it is intended for. The 7k loan is a PLUS loan and has the highest interest rate (6.31%) but it also is in deferment and seems to have placed my other subsidized loans into deferment also (which I believe means I pay no interest since they are subsidized?) I'm not planning on taking any more courses after this so I think the deferment will only last another six months, but it seems like I should take the 6 months without interest while I can.

My thought is I should apply it to one of the refinanced loans:

Type	Amount	Interest Rate	F/V  
Refinanced	11700 5.74%	F  
Refinanced	9600	5.50%	V  
Subsidized 	3500	5.60%	F

personalfinance,Is refinancing Student Loans through SoFi worth it if I am going from a 7.25% Variable rate to a 6.74% Fixed rate?,"Hi PF,
**Background**: I am 2 1/2 years out of school and with $108K in student loans from both private loans (Current Balance $76,860 @ 7.25% variable), and Fed loans consolidated through Nelnet (Current balance $32,120 @ 5.125% variable). My current minimum payments for my PL are $582/Month and my FL is 198.99/ Month; though I am paying 644/month (actually 161/week) and 250/ month respectively so I can whittle away at them quicker than normal. I was lucky enough to find a great job right out of college and have been fast-tracked into a position I truly love, even though the pay is slightly less than I was hoping at $58.5K/Year. I am steadily working on building my credit score back up from the aftershock of my loans, some small credit card debt (&lt;$4,500) from terrible spending habits, and the overall lack of age in my credit history. There are no missed payments, no derogatory marks, and I always pay more than my minimum payment (usually double it), but I got into the poor habit of carrying a balance that I am chipping away at now. Credit Karma says i have a 677 from both Burrows and Mint reports a 740 from Equifax. 

**Main Question**:  I am finding that as life moves forward the payments are holding me back from saving as much as I want, so I would like to decrease the payments slightly, but still want to pay as much as I can. I have seen have seen and ignored so many mailers from SoFi that its borderline ridiculous, but I finally opened one to see what the big deal was. I went through the steps and was pre-approved for a rate of 6.99% fixed with auto-pay taking it down to 6.74%. I only looked into refinancing my private loans as to not lose the benefits of the fed loans, where my payment should be 577 month, but I would likely drop my FL payments to 200 a month and keep paying 644 on the refinanced loan. My two questions are: is it worth it to go through the process of refinancing for .51%, and if I do so will it hurt my credit score to a point where I'm doing more damage in the near future than good?

....enough backstory lol, let me get to my dilemma. I think this money is getting to my head already and I don't even start working for another few weeks! I currently have just about $1000 cash to my name...I am leasing a 2015 honda civic right now for about $220 a month and paying the insurance on it as well which is about another $200. The lease is ending in 8 months. I currently have $28k in student loans, all federal with pretty low interest rates. My monthly expenses are pretty much going to be non-existent as I will be living at home not paying any rent, my mom claims she will continue to pay my cell phone bill and not charge me a dime for rent or food; however I plan on throwing her $500/month to not be a total mooch. I plan on contributing to my 401k to get my companies 6% match; my minimum student loan payment is $150/month but I plan on paying faster for sure. I know I need to build an emergency fund and whatnot...However when my lease ends in 8 months I am not sure if I should buy this Honda Civic out for ~$12k which would probably drive me around with very few problems for many years. However, looking at my monthly income and very low expenses, I am very tempted to lease a new Mercedes-benz for around $325/month with about $3500 down in 8 months when my lease is up. Here is how I look at it:

monthly income before tax:

* $5833
* (I am not sure about my tax rate as my mom says I can claim my disabled older brother as a dependent, anyone know any truth to this?)

* $500 to help my mom out for being a saint and absolutely amazing parent (my dad sucks)
* $500/month to aggressively pay down loans
* $300/month to 401k (pre-tax)
* $110/month to health insurance premium and HSA (pre-tax)
* $1000/month to savings for E-fund until I hit like 15k at least
* $750/month to live off (eating out, gas, drinks, entertainment)
* $400/month for car ($220 for lease currently and $180 for insurance)

This all adds up to about ~$3250 and that's aggressively paying off student loans and saving $1000/month. And allotting $750/month in entertainment which I believe I won't even come close too; I think more like $400/month.
I know I am crazy and probably have no business doing this, but do you guys think I can do this?

personalfinance,Keep money tucked away or pay off high interest credit card,"Like the title says I've got about $12,000 in my Thrift Savings Plan that I got when I joined the military. Currently I am out of the service so I cannot add anymore to my tsp but I also have a credit card debt of $9,000. My tsp is in an l50 fund so I'm not supposed to touch it for the next 50 years. My question is do I withdrawal the money early taking the penalties and taxes into account to pay off an 18% interest rate credit card or continue to make payments on my credit card while keeping the tsp fund going on its own? Keep in mind I work for a corporation that matches up to 4% for my 401k and has stock options that I can apply the money that would have gone to a credit card payment into those funds to help me diversify my portfolio.",finance
personalfinance,Reducing credit card interest rate,"I currently have a credit card through a major bank with an interest rate of 20.74%. I'm trying to reduce this since my credit is 779, I've never been late/missed a payment and I feel like 20.74 is a bit excessive regardless. There was a 0% interest rate promotion when I first got this card last year, which will expire this month. My credit limit on this card is $6000 and I'm only using about 4% currently. I just spoke to a representative inquiring about reducing the 20.74% but she said here are no promotions available for me. I'm wondering if this is the only way to reduce your interest rate? I asked the lady this and she said yes but I've always heard/read that you can ask and they can just lower it without it being a ""promotion"" at the time. Will they not lower it for me since I'm a somewhat new card user? Does this rate seem high to you all--specifically to those who have experience with this type of thing. 

Any input appreciated! TIA",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Doubts about building a 3 GPU rig (x-post buildapc),"Came across /r/machinelearning and realised you guys might know better :)

After a lot of research and reading around, this is what I understand and have a bunch of doubts.

* Applications I'm running thrive on GPU memory. Cost-benefit analysis makes the Titan overpriced for an extra 1GB. The STRIX 11GB with 3500+ CUDA cores seems like a better value. Is there any other suggestion here? 

* A 4 GPU board requires a 40 lane CPU (i.e atleast 6850k), which I'm knocking down to a 3 GPU board, hence the Taichi X99. I get 28 lanes  (6800k) and with 3 GPUs (8/8/8), will this be alright?
P.S. I know an older Xeon with 40 lanes is an option, but I may need to do CPU intensive stuff in the future, so the 6000 series seems to have better per core clock speed.

* I know the 1080 Ti doesnt officially support 3 way SLI, but I don't need the cards in SLI. I just need to access the 11GB memory for each card. I hope there wont be compatibility problems.

* The 1080 ti takes 2.5 GPU slots, would this be a problem when pugging in 3 GPUs into the Taichi X99 board?

* Cases are hard to come by where I'm getting my parts from (India) and most components are overpriced. Its a bit of a puzzle, but sourcing is possible with some delay. I've decided to go for the Air 740. Its got ample room for air cooling (avoiding water cooling altogether). This PC is going be kept in a closed room and accessed over LAN, so looks dont matter. Im not sure if this case is overkill, I'm open to suggestions.

* Adding storage later on, for now network connected.

Is there something I'm missing out on? 

Also, this rig converted is around $5000 with 3 GPUs in my area and thats around my total budget. I know it sucks, but no other choice really.

personalfinance,Switch to Ally Bank,I have been thinking about opening both a savings and checking account with Ally because the interest rates on my current accounts are minuscule. Is it a good idea to have all of my funds under that account or should I keep money with a different bank to be safe?,finance
technology,"A call to create the political change we need and why it starts with Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.","The last fifty years has demonstrated the weakness of our current governing structure: A confederation of fifty states under a powerful central government with a parallel corporate power structure that is in control of “messaging” to the masses.  The result of this structure is an unabated transfer of wealth and benefits of the country (and the world) to those at the top of the food chain.  During this same fifty year period we have seen spectacular advances in technology that progresses at a very predictable rate.  The exponential nature of technological advance means that we will soon see it becoming the dominant driver of political change.  Until now the rise of technology has only increased the size of the fortunes being amassed at the very top.  In the coming years (10-20-30?) technology will quickly erode the means of support for many at the bottom of the economic system.   

What we need is a new system and we need to start working on it now.  Obama and Trump were both elected as agents of change.  The masses know the system is crashing and they are looking for a way to avoid it even if it means destroying the existing system and starting over.   Obama was not able to deliver on the promise and neither will Trump.  We need a new approach and we have maybe twenty years to get it done.  I think this is our best option:

1. Instead of fixing the current system lets develop a new parallel system and schedule a “switch-over” for a date in the future near 2040.
2. Everything is on the table:	
    * How can we organize our education and information dissemination systems for best effect without giving up our heritage of free and open discourse?  
    * How can we separate the social issues from the operational ones?  The current system seems to push social issues into separate ends of the political spectrum along with the operational\economic issues. Many times this is done just for political gain and in a hypocritical way.  This erodes our ability to trust the system as a whole.
    * How do we “fix” the horrendous wealth gap between the top and bottom of society?  How do we survive as a society when work becomes superfluous? 
    * I think a trajectory of increasing literacy rates and educational attainment levels is a good thing but it should be discussed and a plan put in place to attain concrete goals.
    * Do we really need 50 states with fifty parallel systems?  Maybe there is a better way to organize this without giving up local autonomy? 
    * What is the best voting system for the future: “winner take all” has many flaws and alternative systems could have a very big impact on how we rule ourselves.
    * Add your own to this list.
3. Who should develop this new system?  It seems obvious that we need to have this at least start inside the major technology engines of our time:  Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Tesla, etc.  Sounds scary but here are the arguments for this…	
    * Technology is going to disrupt our political system in a big way in the coming years and who has a better handle on technological disruption than these guys?
    * If you look at the opinions of the general public (especially younger generations) I think that these companies garner a lot of trust along with their high market share.  We already trust these companies to handle our banking, personal correspondence, privacy, etc.  I believe that this trust level exceeds by a very large margin the trust we have in our state or federal governments. 
    * The coming political unrest caused by technological disruption is going to threaten the business of all of these companies.  As a stockholder I want these guys to prevent a meltdown of the system to protect their bottom line.
    * The heads of these companies: Gates, Bezos, Musk, Zuckerberg, Case, etc seem to want to change the world. What better challenge than to deliver the change we all know we need.  They seem to be motivated in the right general direction. 
4. How do we start?
    * A lot of these companies have internal universities.  Make sure each one has a robust political science program that is focused on the coming need for change.
    * Make sure that no significant political faction is excluded from this effort.  Liberals and Conservatives, Right and Left must work together on this if we are going to be successful.  We are designing a system not necessarily a specific solution.  
    * Use the technology to make the process as transparent as possible.   Make sure that trust is never compromised and when it inevitably is then deal with the fallout in an effective manner.  
    * Try to bootstrap the process by using the “beta” system to make progress on the design of the final political system.  Get something up and running, test it out on a small scale and iterate before the scale up and switch-over in 2040.",technology

personalfinance,"30F with 29k in variable student loans, moving out (again), what would you do?","Hi PF,
  This is a throwaway, but I am a longtime reader of this sub and have learned so much from this community. While I think I have a pretty good understanding of the basic elements of financial health, I still struggle with the best approach for my own finances. I would love to get other people's perspectives on my situation. 

For the last 1.5 years I have been living at home to save money and pay down graduate school loans.  During this time I have paid off ~ 25k. I do have some undergrad debt as well, but my parents have graciously agreed to handle that. 

When I took the loans I opted for the variable rate because I was willing to gamble that I could pay them off before rates rose too high, which so far has worked out. However, I am moving out back on my own in about a month and will not be able to throw quite so much money at my loans anymore.  I have gone back and forth as to the best path forward and would appreciate some input. 

Details:

*70k salary at a stable government job (will increase to 76k by November 2019 at which point I will max out the current salary grade)

*7k emergency fund

*$37,000  in retirement accounts 

*15% of salary currently split between employer 401a (12%) and roth ira (3%)

I pay most things on credit cards that I pay in full every month and have an 800 credit score

Debts:

*$29,234.75 @ 2.75% variable rate

The loan started at 2% interest a few years ago and has crept up slightly as interest rates have gone up. 

Other relevant info:

My car (2012 model) is paid off. I use YNAB to budget monthly for things like car insurance/maintenance, vet visits for my dog, gifts etc. and generally feel like I have a good handle on my expenses. I can post a more detailed budget if necessary.

My plan has been to keep aggressively paying down the loan. I estimate that I can have it paid off by Dec 2019 by throwing at least 600 month at it, plus my two extra paychecks each year. However, this leaves me with very little room for additional saving each month. 

Some questions I am wrestling with are:

1. Should I be so aggressive on paying down these loans? 

2. Should I be putting more into retirement?

3. I am starting to consider home ownership much more seriously that I ever have before. I estimate that I could get a decent place in my area for around 200k. I have an apartment lease that runs through June 2018, and while I am definitely not  committed to buying a home in a year,  I also don't know if it makes sense to throw all of my extra money at the loans for 2.5 more years and still only have 7k in savings if/when I do decide to more seriously pursue home ownership. 

So pf, what would you do in my situation?  Do you think I am overall on the right track?",finance

I'm not really sure of the best way to pay for this. I have just under 10k in savings, which isn't enough! I'm thinking that the best way to pay is going to be a personal loan of some sort, but I don't really understand, or know what my options are.

personalfinance,Need help with a plan to pay off roughly 120k in private student loans in 10 years or less.,"I currently have no debt other than our home and 1 car which we have around 25k in equity in.  My wife however has 120k in private student loan debt and another 80k in federal.  We both have good to great credit.  I am really only interested in the private loan debt at this point as it is the biggest burden.  Currently we bring home 6k a month total after taxes and 401k etc.  We have 8k in our bank account and a $0 balance on our credit cards.  We have 2 vehicles 1 paid off that she drives every day and 1 with 15 months left that I drive which is $300 a month.  I have analyzed our finances and think we could cut back and create around $1000 extra a month that I could put towards the loans that are through Navient.

Loan4-  35,000 10.5%
Loan3-  30,000 6.5%
Loan2-  22,000 4%
Loan1-  20,000 4%

We would like to get a bigger home because we have 2 kids that share a room in our 2 bedroom home and that is the biggest stress in our lives besides these loans.  

So what would be the best plan of attack for accomplishing the goal of paying off all of these loans in 10 years, but the 10.5% loan ASAP and purchasing a bigger home.  I had considered selling our home and buying the bigger home via FHA and using the equity that we made from the sale to pay down the largest loan.  So we would go from currently 95k @3.75% in a home loan to around 180k in home loans but we would have eliminated the 35k loan @10.5%.  This is about as far as I have gotten but any ideas would be most appreciated.  It is such a hopeless feeling looking at those balances that I cant wait any longer and must do something about them. Currently Navient has us on a plan that will basically keep us paying $800 a month for the rest of time while never paying down the principal of any of the loans.",finance

During the time when I will refer to as 'FirePfenix loses her ability to budget and realize that she does not have all the jewels in Christendom' and got an Amazon store card. From Synchrony. Who while I don't think is the devil, has proven to confound me.

During this time, I got a letter from Synchrony saying that they were closing my Amazon card, which is no big deal, it does make it easier for me to control my spending without it. They say I had been late numerous times, even though my credit reports don't reflect that.

While this is occurring, my bank decides to now start returning bill payments, except on my student loan and car payment (good guy bank?) which makes me fall behind on Synchrony, since it took me a damned good while to sort it out with the bank and find the technical error.

Synchrony sent the Amazon card to collections, but today took out a payment from my bank account, which put me in the red.

Can they do this? I have the letter from the collections company along with the amount that they'll settle for. I'm just confuse, because unless traditional logic failed me, once it was sent to collections, they couldn't continue to attempt/ get payments on the card.

personalfinance,(CAN) Looking for advice on whether to go with Floating or Fixed Interest For 22k Student Loan?,"Hey there,

personalfinance,Unsure how effectively I'm paying off one of my loans,"I have a decent amount of student debt, about 30k in lower-interest direct loans, and 16k in two private, high interest loans. I was fortunate enough to land a well paying job, and after accruing enough savings that I feel I could reasonably handle most financial emergencies, I started putting all my extra income after bills towards my loans.

I was able to use both the snowball and avalanche method, as my two highest interest rate loans are the two 8k ones. One had an 8.5% interest rate and I have managed to pay that one off in full. I am now about to start on the other 8k private loan with 8.25% interest rate. 

I decided to look over April's billing statement, which only included the $155 minimum auto payment (I have never yet paid more than the minimum on this account). The loan summary stated the total dispersed amount, current principal, and unpaid interest and fees ($11.28). It then goes on to state the paid amount ($155.44) and the accrued interest ($58).

I was really confused as to what the interest and fees might be so I pulled up my March billing statement. On this, the interest and fees are $11.41, accrued interest is $53.74. The difference in current principal was only -$96.5 from March to April, with a payment of $155.44. 

I'm not very experienced with anything financial, and I can't logic out these numbers. I'm not sure where all my money is going, how quickly I'm gaining interest, if that interest is compounding and I'm accruing more interest every month, and what these fluctuating fees might be from. I have had the auto pay set up for months and have never been late on a payment. Does anyone have any idea of an answer to these questions, and am I paying this loan back in a problematic way?

personalfinance,How can I get a student loan if parent doesn't have a SSN?,"Hi everyone! I'm making this post for my friend because we literally have no one else to ask. 

My friend got into NYU Shanghai (yay!) and was offered a really good financial aid package compared to others. All in all, she has to pay $11,112 per year and the school is offering federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans to cover that cost. Unfortunately, she is unable to even accept this money because her mom (single-mother household) doesn't have a SSN. We read online that a tax ID could work but she just filed to even have one and her deadline is coming up. Is there anything she could possibly do to attend Shanghai but without this loan? Is there a bank that will help her? 

TL:DR: Friend can't accept federal loans because mother is undocumented. Is there another way to pay this money?",finance
personalfinance,Pay down mortgage or refinance,So I bought a house last year with 3.5%. Payments are around 1800 a month as I do bimonthly payments and add a few extra dollars per payment. My interest rate is 3.25% and I have perfect credit. I  have money saved up and I am continuing to add to it every paycheck but I don't know if I should up the monthly payments or save up and refinance. Currently of the payments I make about 1100 is principle and interest. The rest is escrow and insurance on the loan. And before anyone mentions it. I already put roughly $25k into a 401k and investments each year.,finance

personalfinance,How is this possible?,"So I took out an Auto Loan in December of 2015 through USAA, I had zero credit history and got a very high interest rate, 14.99%. Now it's over a year later and my credit score is at a 651 and I have a pretax income of over 44k and have never missed a payment and have I fact always paid greater than my monthly payment. 

I went to refinance my loan and even had a cosigner who has virtually perfect credit, 90k in pretax income and owns his house, but when I looked into refinancing my bank offered me a higher interest rate, 24.99%. 

They said it was because I have very little credit history, but why would my interest skyrocket when I'm making a fair amount of money with a ""fair"" credit score, my cosigner has excellent credit, plenty of income and assets and have never missed a payment. I understand my credit score isn't great, and I have very little credit history, but this makes very little sense to me.",finance
personalfinance,"Any guides to calculating this withholding business?

And second, this is just a thought.  But I owe quite a bit of credit card debt, and the lowest interest rate on it is 8%.

I should be able to pay it all off with just a few months of pay at my new job...but...what if I set my witholdings to zero?  That's another 15% of my pay into my check every month, letting me pay it off faster.  Apparently, the IRS underpayment penalty is 0.5% for every month you owe them money, so that's effectively 6% annual interest.  Less than my credit card debts.

personalfinance,I want to buy a house within the next 5 years; is it possible?,"Hi reddit,

I'm hoping to buy a house within the next 5 years. Currently my financial situation is as follows:

•	$40,000 of student loan debt, have tackled 20% of original amount in a year (started at $53,000 in December 2015); on track to pay off by 2020. Rates range from 3.4-6.8%, using avalanche method. I pay $500/month towards my loans, and family contributes $250/month. My monthly payment under IBR is around $150. My student loans are currently paid ahead to January 2018. My highest interest rate loan is slated to be paid off by July 2017.

•	$11,000 on car note, 2% interest rate. On track to pay off within 4 years. I pay $226/month for my car.

•	$1,900/month income (edit: after taxes and mandatory withdrawals!)

•	I will be making an additional $5,000 before taxes this summer due to extra work I am picking up over the summer. This money will be used strictly for savings and aggressively paying down student loan debt. This brings up my bi-weekly paychecks from about $950 to $1,500 bi-weekly for a two month period. I did this last year, and lived off of my regular $950 bi-weekly income (with an occasional personal splurge), and used my additional pay strictly for extra loan payments and savings.

•	I do not have to pay rent. Housing and utilities are covered by my job. I am contracted with this job until summer 2022 (though not a ""stay here or face penalty"" contract; people in my role are allowed to remain in it up to six years), but may leave at some point during 2021 to move home for work.

•	Monthly expenses are: $80/month for health insurance, $70/month into a mandatory pension plan (no 401K), $15/month for a mandatory union fee, $250/month on food for one person (including eating out and groceries), less than $100 on gas, and $100 or less a week for ""fun"" expenses. I also pay $116/month for car insurance, but this will be down to $70/month starting this month. I also have a $10/month Netflix membership. These are my only regular expenses.

•	Total expenses per month (including my regular student loan payments): $1,377 

•	Total savings per month: $400-$500/month

•	Total at the end of the month out: $1,767-$1,867

•	Total left over: $23-$123

•	I currently have $5,250 in a .75% APY account. It gains around $3 of interest each month; not a lot, but good for where I’m at right now!

Within the next five years, my student loan debt should be eliminated, as will my car note; I will still be keeping my current vehicle, as long as something catastrophic doesn't happen. I would also be moving back home permanently, where I could find a good sized home for $250,000. Property taxes are manageable in the areas I'm looking, as are utility costs. I have a lot of people in my family good at construction (like my dad; loves taking on renovation projects!), landscaping (my cousin often does great work for various family members for free or deep discounts), and other specialties, so maintenance and renovation costs would be reasonable. I would also be making close to $50k-$60k at minimum. If I am able to keep up my savings goals, my savings should be close to $45,000 or more by 2022 (not factoring in interest, bonuses, or unexpected windfalls), pending no emergencies.

personalfinance,"27 Married with 3 kids, 42k in personal debt and drowning - Need help! (AUS)","Hi guys, I need some help/advice.

As it says in the title I am 27 have 3 kids and am married. I make 85k a year before tax so it comes to like $2500 a fortnight in NET. My wife has an income of about $500 a fortnight NET so in total $3K. 

I had to change jobs due to redundancy 6 months ago and have taken a slight pay hit. Not much maybe $150 a week tops. But just after changing jobs took a holiday (I needed it) that cost me more than anticipated and on returning my car died and had to buy another. I burnt through all the cash I had left over and made more debt. I now have 5 individual debts totaling $42K with various interest rates with a minimum repayment across the board of $1400. I am absolutely drowning and can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

So I spoke to my bank as they were offering me an insanely low rate on a consolidated personal loan of 5.25% and over 5 years this would have made my repayments $800 which is a HUGE reduction and would have helped me catch my breath but have just got news that I am ineligible because of a few missed payments in the last 6 months. They want to see 6 months of clear credit history before they will revisit.

The issue is I don't know that I can keep one for the next 6 months with the way I am going. I am not sure what to do and don't know enough about this stuff to make my next move. I turn to you reddit for help.

Edit as a request for more info:
Other expenses include the following.

Rent - $2000/month
Groceries - $1000/month
Utilities - $600/month
Cars - $400/month

They are the main things I can think of right now. Very rounded off of course but very close.

**EDIT 2:**

Been getting some great advice and am feeling a lot better today after a good hard think about ways I can improve spending. But just remember I am in Australia and some of the advice doesn't apply. Also $1000 a month for groceries with 3 growing boys 1 of which is going through puberty is actually a bare minimum. My wife is great at making cheap food seem more exciting.

I looked into YNAB which seems awesome but doesn't do bank feeds for Aussie banks. Looked and found PocketBook which for the most part seems to do mostly the same things but with Aussie bank feeds which I will try out for now. It's also free which is another bonus. 

It seems that I have been very unaware of what was costing me the most money each week and eating out was destroying us. Like some have mentioned convenience is a luxury I can't afford right now. Making sandwiches before heading out on a day trip might be the better option rather than finding something once already out.

Please keep the advice coming. But for those that offer one line answers like ""Stop having kids"". Please stop being ignorant, you have no idea my circumstances pertaining to that part of my life.",finance

personalfinance,Having a great account earlier vs Greater quality of life,"Hello, /r/personalfinance! 

I am a 20 year old brazilian, employed on a full time job and finishing university (here you can do both at the same time - and yes, its really exhaustive). I earn about 4,800 BRL/ month. That translates into 1,540 USD, but in perspective to the local spendings is a really good salary to have by this age. 

I have a university loan, which is about 90,000 BRL (~ 29,050 USD). I already have 39,000 BRL ( ~ 12,580 USD) saved into an investing account, with an interest rate of ~ 0.7%/ month. (interest rates in Brazil are among the biggest in the world). The debt loan is pretty much my only future cost and I will start paying it in mid 2019. I also pay a french course, which costs 500BRL/month (161 USD). I need this course to graduate at university, since its mandatory to know 2 foreign languages to be able to graduate. So, put my general spendings, I could invest/ save up to 3000-3,500 BRL ( ~ .950 USD) / month.

If I continue with my life this way and don't mess at my job, in one year I could have all the money of the debt loan, and leave it in the investing account until I begin paying it. 

However, I haven't been happy with my life for the past 3 years because of a number of reasons. I don't think I chose the correct degree in university, and the quality of life here,generally speaking, is really bad. I lose about 4-5 hours a day on public transportation. Its really stressing and is really impacting my life, since I cannot find anytime to exercise or even relax a little in the week. I also don't like my job (I know, not liking your job is one of the most common things), it doesn't give any perspective of growth/development. Another thing that worries me is about retiring. The Brazilian Congress is probably going to approve a law which, objectively speaking, only lets you retire when you're in your 70's ( since the minimum age is 65, but you would need to start working at 16 and not stop until 65 to be able to retire the earliest possible). 

Besides, as a 20 year old I would like to try and enjoy other things other than just studying and working. I've never been abroad, and I consider moving to a developed country with a better quality of life a possibility to escape the life I'm living. I thought going to Canada might be a good idea, once the migration process is about to become easier. I thought of this possibility: Using the money I've saved of the debt loan to start a short college degree there, before the payment date. Programming and IT would probably be my choice, since its a growing market. And after finishing the course I would pay the debt receiving a salary in CAD, although I would have the costs of living to deal with. 

I think I am still young, and sometimes I just would like to have a bit of risk in my life, you know? Specially because, although I have a steady job, I would like to try achieving something better than what I have now, specially in terms of quality of life. And I know I will have to work for the rest of my life, I would like to travel more, know myself more and discover other things. I know the first years in another country are not going to be easy, but neither its here. The currently situation doesn't give me this opportunity.

financialindependence,UPDATE: State taxes for FIRE,"This is an update to my post from last week [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/678t0b/state_income_tax_spreadsheet_for_fire/). I had calculated what state income taxes would be with a FIRE strategy of doing Roth conversions up to the standard deduction + personal exemption limit, then long-term capital gains up to the top of the 15% bracket, for $0 in federal income tax.

As I mentioned in that post, there were probably errors in the tax calculations due to the complexity of each state's rules, but I figured they were in the ballpark. After posting that, I got motivated to take it a step further and actually use tax software to calculate the exact amount for each state. This is a highly manual process so I only ran the numbers for a couple (if anybody is really curious I can do them for a single person as well).

Note that county income taxes (Indiana and Maryland) are taken into account but not city income taxes. For the most part the agreement is fairly good with my previous post, with a few notable outliers being Arkansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and South Carolina having significantly lower taxes than estimated, and Indiana and Maryland being significantly higher due to county income tax. Nebraska has an interesting rule that your state income tax can't be higher than your federal, and since your federal is $0 with this strategy, that works out pretty well.

One thing this analysis doesn't capture well is the effect of dividends. This should be fairly minor, with the biggest change for New Hampshire and Tennessee which only tax interest and dividends. If you assume a $500,000 taxable portfolio yielding 2% annually, it works out to under $500 per year in taxes for either state. If there is interest and we can come up with typical numbers of dividends, qualified dividends, and foreign tax paid for a FIRE couple, I can recalculate the taxes.",finance

I'm now in a situation where I am about 14 months into a 75 month auto loan, with around 20k left on the note. My abysmal interest rate is over 11%. I had no idea buying my first car on my own, and I still don't really understand how the interest rate affects me.  I make 52k a year before taxes, and my finances are as follows:  

* Rent - $450/mo 
* Car Payment - $410/mo
* Insurance - $150/mo
* CC Debt (totalling ~$6000) $300/mo w/ various interest rates
* Storage Unit - $95/mo
* Gas ~$140/mo (60 mile round trip to work, 5 days a week)
* Groceries/Misc - $400/mo  


Which leaves me about $1000 a month to hold onto.  
 

My credit score is slowly climbing up from the depths of a negligent, uneducated youth, but it is still in the low 600s.  

My question is this - I FEEL like my best course of action here is to get my car paid off ASAP, while still focusing some on my CC debt, but primarily focusing on the car. With my current living situation, I will be putting away around $1k per month, and could have the car paid off in roughly 1.5 years if I dedicate most of that to the car. But what would be the best way to accomplish this?  

I'm completely ignorant to these kinds of things, and I know it's my own fault that I'm here for not doing better research, and being impulsive, but alas.   

At this point, the note on my car is still higher than what the car is worth, so I can't sell it to get something cheaper. 

Would I be better paying it down until I could sell it? Given the circumstances I find myself in, what would you do? I feel very stable and secure in my job, and with my current living situation, and I would love to start building my security fund. But I feel like I need to shed some of this debt first.

* **I will be withholding payroll taxes for my nanny (7.65%) as required. Do I NEED to submit quarterly returns and remit this payment quarterly? I seem to have read things online that suggest as long as my annual tax withholding covers the total amount of payroll taxes I would owe in the year for my employee, I don't have to do any quarterly filing and can just remit the payment with my yearly tax return via Schedule H. Can anyone confirm? If so, I can simply adjust withholding with my own employer to cover this extra amount**

We will not be withholding federal income tax for our Nanny and she is ok with that approach as she will make estimated payments. 

Is there anything I'm overlooking here? I don't want to pay a payroll service to do this since they charge exorbitant amounts of money for this service, and once I get above questions clarified the rest is pretty easy.

personalfinance,"Where to put 40k (into mortgage/refi, or investing elsewhere)","Quick backstory:

Beginning of December I bought a new condo for 300k.  20% down (60k).  30 year fixed @ 3.625%.

Old condo sold at the beginning of March.  Long story short I have about 40k that I would like to invest somewhere.  Current payment is $1094/ month.  Does not include escrow for property tax which I don't do anyway, I just pay it myself.  Either way that has to get done and I don't think is relavent.

Option 1:  Put it into my mortgage as is, will lesson my monthly payment,  take down the amount of interest I'm paying per month, but not make a huge impact I don't think.

Option 2:  Look into a 15 year fixed refi with 100k as the down payment.  Not real sure on the rates at the moment or if this will be a gain in the long run.  

Option 3:  Leave the mortgage alone and invest elsewhere.  Maybe a combo of stocks and bonds for some lower risk lower yield and some higher risk potentially higher yield.

So, between a 3.625% interest rate, the deduction I get each year on the paid interest, and the potential for earnings elsewhere Im not real sure what my best option is.  

Edit:  I realized I didn't include this, but other than the mortgage I have no other debt to pay down, and if the mortgage payment goes up or down a hundred or 2 I'm not in a bad spot there.",finance
personalfinance,"I am a 29yo immigrant, spent the last 8 years at junior colleges doing classes in biotech engineering, just got rejected from universities -- I need some guidance","Hi everyone, long time lurker here. As the title says, I am a 29 yo US immigrant. I just got rejected from the universities that I applied to and now am not sure what I should do next. I apologize beforehand for any mistakes I will make in this post because English is not my first language. Also I am a bit distressed and uncertain at the moment so I want to apologize for that too if my post seems all over the place.

First a little background, I moved to the US 8 years ago and spent the first 4 years in another state before I moved to California. A lot of things (even traumatic stuff that I had never thought to prepare for) happened during the first 4 years and I was severely affected by those events -- took me a few years to deal with the emotional consequences with those events but thankfully I can say I am no longer as effected as I used to.

I moved to California for a change in life in late 2013 – early 2014, I have been living with my parents since and have worked odd jobs while waiting to return to college again. At the moment of this post I was trying to finish a degree in biotech engineering, and I just got rejected from the universities that I applied to. I knew the writing was on the wall anyway after last semester when my GPA went down hill to sub 2.9 because I made the mistake of being impatient and taking more than I could handle. I didn’t fail any class but got a B, C, and D respectively. I took the risk and now I have to bear the consequences of it.

It wouldn’t be a problem if I was younger. The problem is I am 29 years old now and failing yet again makes me seriously consider if I should keep going with this biotech engineering degree. Coming from an Asian country there is always this subconscious burden in my mind that made me aim for prestigious professions and universities because you know good schools good degree good money, that kind of stuff. Even though I have tried so hard to distance myself from my old culture for the past 8 years after coming to the US, I guess I can’t shake it all away in the end. Or maybe it’s because I tried hard to abandon my heritage, too hard, that I am where I am today in this mess. I am not sure anymore.

Anyhow, fellow Redditors I would like to ask for your advice on what to do next. To tell you the truth, I am afraid. I have tried so many things but I always ended up failing at the end so I am not sure about what I am going to do anymore.

Right now I have 2 options:

* Continue taking a few more classes and reapply to more reasonable universities in 6 months. Then if I get accepted, another 2 years to finish the degree. Or,

* Take the electrician fellowship route. I did a bit research and found out they have apprenticeships in my area.

To be honest even the military is a tempting option for me at the moment. I just want to get away from all this school stuff and do something else. Join the military, keep my head down, do what I’m told, learn a trade and after 4 years discharge and live a good life with the disciplines I learned from the military. Sounds better than withering my miserable life away in schools. I just need something anything that is substantial, that I can make money off of. I’m fed up with living with my parents, having not enough money to do anything for myself, having no meaningful social connections.

I guess you could call it sunk cost fallacy that I still want to keep going with the biotech degree. I spent so much time with it already, might as well finish it right? The problem is universities in the US is so expensive. I will have to take out loans and then have to pay them back later. Even if I get to the finish line I am not guaranteed to get a job anyway. With the military at least I don't have to worry about health care, I get paid and get to live far away from family for some time.

I don’t know. I’m not sure about anything anymore. Please any advice is welcome.

**EDIT** -- thanks for the kind responses! I want to clarify that I am going to a local community college. I know /r/personalfinance always recommend taking classes there for maximum savings and that's what I've been doing for the past 2 years since I returned to school in 2015. I have the option to file for graduation (associate's degree). What I am not sure is whether that will prevent me from taking more classes at the community college.

Also I worked for Uber during the summer last year and saved up quite a bit money because I knew I wouldn't have enough time during the academic semester Fall 2016. I stay with my parents and don't have to spend money on a lot of things so money isn't a very pressing concern right now. Well except for the future maybe, where I am stuck as a miserable old student.

**EDIT2** -- I guess I can only blame myself for not being more conscientious enough with my tasks and goals that I got myself into this mess. When I started out I promised myself I should only focus on learning instead of the grade but last semester was kinda a wake up call. I took Physics, Calc 3 and C++ which were more than I could handle. I still don't regret that I didn't drop any class because I don't believe in dishonesty about my grades. And I learned a lot from those classes too but still...

**EDIT3** -- Thank you everyone for the replies. It is a lot to take in right now, I'll read them and think more carefully over the next few days. All your help mean very much to me, I appreciate it a lot.",finance
personalfinance,Mother is gifting me 7K from retirement funds,"Hello r/personalfinance. I've read a lot of great advice and guidance here and find myself in a position to ask for some myself.

As the title states, Mom is gifting me 7K and I'm not sure what approach I should take to make the best of this situation in taking the correct approach.

My current personal debt:

*8K credit card debt over 3 years life *Edit* - The interest on this card is 15%

*$3,300 Home Depot 0 interest if paid before next April ($300 payments are split between wife and I each month and are on track to having this paid before April)

*$1100 revolving credit balance for Home Depot with 17% interest rate.

*Auto loan for newly financed 27K truck. $405/month

My 1st initial thought was to take the entire 7K and wipe off the credit card debt but from what I've read here before, that might not be the best approach. I would prefer not to use any of the 7K for anything that isn't credit card or Home Depot financed but again, I don't know how to disperse this money correctly.

Previous advice would state to pay off the least amount of debt 1st, have money saved as well, and not pay off a large sum of debt at once.

personalfinance,Need advise on finding a reputable credit repair firm in Florida,"TL;DR  first:   I need recomendations for reputable credit repair firms that can do the work needed to improve my credit.  I dont have the time and frankly, I rather pay a professional to do this for me.   I will keep learning but I need this done now and I need it done well.


I just went through a very rough patch in my life that lasted a few years, but I'm rebuilding.  Currently doing a Short Sale of my home in NJ, moving to Florida with a big raise in salary.

I have several federal and state Tax Liens against me which I'm working on removing. I have payment plans in place.

No credit card debt and soon, no mortgage. I plan to rent in FL.  Most CC debt was settled for less than I owed back in 2011/2012.

I just pulled my credit report and there are a lot of these old accounts which I settled back in 2011.  There are also a few things that dont make sense such as an account which I closed paying in full and was never late, but that shows under the derogatory list.

At any rate, with no debt and adjusted way of life Im currently able to save a good amount of money each month and I would like to rebuild my credit to eventually buy something in a year or so.  Id like to get started right away as the fact that my credit is ruined weights heavy on me and is the only thing lingering from my old life.  I want to hire a professional to help me.   I would like recommendations of someone licensed to work in Florida, I dont mind if its expensive as I consider this a very important investment in my own future.

personalfinance,Working 2 full time jobs- worth it?,"Hey guys. This is more to get a secondary opinion because all my friends are telling me it's not worth it but obviously they're a bit biased.

My question is, should I take a second full-time job to effectively double my income? The goal would be to get rid of my personal loan, credit card debt, and a good chunk of the student loans while growing my efund to ~6 months of expenses. After a year or whenever I get to high levels of burnt out, I'd probably quit the second job and begin applying to higher paying positions within my field. As a fresh grad, I need to stay with this current company for a year or so for a reference.

The upsides are fairly obvious in that I'd be able to pay stuff down much more quickly. The downsides are also obvious in that I'd have no life and probably experience significant sleep deprevation and/or mental strain working 80 to 90 hours a week. Are there any factors I'm missing? If not, any tips or advice are appreciated.

Personal breakdown

Income post-deductions (full benefits, 401k, emergency savings):
$47.5k salary equating to ~1.4k every 2 weeks
The theoretical second job would be $~40k additional.

Debts:
$70k federal student loans ranging from 3.8 to 6.5% interest, currently paying interest on IBR until grace period ends.
$3.5k credit card debt from a move, prioritizing this payment first
$900 no interest loan from grandpa

Recurring monthly costs:
$900 rent
$250 utilities including Internet and phone
$150 auto insurance (just got my license, this won't be lower for some time)
~$200 gas (this will be going down soon, trading my car for one with almost double mpg)
$100 personal loan from my grandpa
$~90 minimum payments on cards
$~300 minimum payments on student loans starting in July
$25 entertainment subscriptions
$250 food/personal care

Assets:
$650 emergency fund, add in $50 a pay check right now. This will stop once it hits $1k until I have a better handle on my debt.
$1.5k in my checking
$~3k in a 4% + 3.5% employer matched 401k
$2k vehicle I'm about to trade for a less shitty one of similar value.

My assets are so low because I keep having ridiculous situations pop up, like medical emergencies etc beyond my control. Hopefully the worst is behind me and I can grow a bit of savings.",finance

personalfinance,How will outstanding student loans impact buying a home?,"I'm a home owner, but when my husband and I purchased our current home, only he was on the mortgage application and paperwork. My name just went on the deed. 

Considering I have a fairly large amount of student loan debt, if we were to go through the process again, would adding me to the mortgage approval process help or hurt our ability to get the best interest rate/terms/limit/etc? 

My student loans total about $47K total and just recently came into repayment.

I have $50K in available credit, but the balance of most of those credit accounts is zero amounts that could be paid off at any time. So essentially no other debt aside from student loans (zero credit card debt). 

My credit score is decent (760 and rising) and my annual gross income is approximately $110K and I've worked for the same company for nearly a decade.

My husband can afford a mortgage on his own and you can make the assumption that both his income and credit score are higher than mine and that he also carries zero debt with the appropriate cash savings to be considered an ideal borrower.

So my question is would adding me into the mix when buying a house be a positive, negative, or net neutral move?",finance
personalfinance,Credit card debt payment methods,"I've lurked on this sub before and I remember seeing people discussing/debating different methods of paying off credit card debt.  I don't remember the specific names for what the methods were (I think one might have been called the ""avalanche"" method?) but they involved either paying all the debts off simultaneously and gradually vs. paying off the higher-interest rate debts first in larger lump sums.  And I guess the debate was over which method was more effective in saving money over the long run by way of avoiding as much interest as possible.  So I am hoping someone would be willing to give me a synopsis of the various methods that are out there, the pros and cons of each, and what you think might be my best option considering my situation.  I am guessing this is a topic that gets addressed frequently, but at the same time I feel like there are probably a lot of people on here who like talking about this stuff anyway so here goes:

I have just over $16K debt, all of it spread over 5 different credit cards (wells fargo, capital one, citi, discover, barclaycard).  The latter four of those have higher interest rates between 17-21%, whereas the WF card has a relatively lower rate of about 11%.  The WF card carries the most debt of the five at close to $6K, with the other four averaging about $2.5K apiece.  Since my debt peaked at $20K about 8 months ago, I have ONLY used the WF card (and only for utilities and other bill-type things where I have to use a credit card) while focusing on shaving down the debt on the four high-interest cards as much as possible by only paying and not spending.  I have one full-time job and two part-time jobs, making my monthly income about $3300.   I would say that nearly all of my disposable income over the last 8 months has gone toward paying off these debts.  I'm making slow progress but I can't help but feel like there might be a better way.  A friend of mine floated the idea of consolidating all of my credit card debt with a personal loan at fixed interest from my bank- what do you guys think about doing something like that?  

I am pretty young, just finished college, never really learned anything about personal finance from my parents or in high school/college (probably why I got myself into this mess to begin with) and I am getting my ass kicked so please forgive my naiveté and any advice from your experiences is much appreciated.

investing,"""All the President's Friends: Political Access and Firm Value""","&gt;Using novel data on White House visitors from 2009 through 2015, we find that corporate executives’ meetings with key policymakers are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. We also find evidence suggesting that following meetings with federal government officials, firms receive more government contracts and are more likely to receive regulatory relief (as measured by the tone of regulatory news). The investment of these firms also becomes less affected by political uncertainty after the meetings. Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms. Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.

personalfinance,"Paying down debt aggressively, attempting to rebuild credit, and save money.","Background - I work full time for a startup company with an annual salary of $45k. Car payment is currently $390, Rent is currently $775, and utilities are roughly $300.

Less than a year ago I walked into a dealership and purchased a car on pretty good credit (4.84% interest rate, at a ~740 credit score). Going into the summer I picked up some summer work to make some extra and put a lot of my purchases on my credit cards which I had intended on paying off with my money from my summer job. Long story short, I was stiffed on that money and never received it which would have amounted to roughly $12k on top of my salary.

As a result of not getting paid during the summer, I was stuck with the debt totaling around $10,000 which put my credit score in a complete downward spiral. The lowest I saw it was 524 which was when I discovered I was denied on a loan for a scooter which put me in a new position to aggressively pay down my debt. Over the following month, I paid down about $2000.
Over the weekend, I took my car back as part of a settlement and received a nice settlement which I intend to pay off my credit cards and use as a down payment for a new set of wheels to replace my last car.

I was approved for a loan for 12% interest loan with a credit score of 580 which was a pretty shitty feeling knowing I had destroyed my credit and the really scary part was when they asked for friends numbers in case they had to reposes my car! 

With that back knowledge, this morning I paid off 2 credit cards with my settlement money (one card with $600, the other with $4,500). I still have about $4,500 to go until I have canceled my debt which I think I can do in about 2 months.

With that my questions are;

1. How fast can I expect to see my credit score rise and will I see the 700's again?

2. When should I look at refinancing my car once my debt is paid off?

personalfinance,Smaller downpayment to invest the rest?,"Hi all,
I am not very financially literate so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.
I'm 22 and am lucky to be able to purchase my first apartment! I live in Montreal where housing prices are low.

The initial plan was to purchase an apartment for 230K, with a down payment of 100K and a 5 year fixed rate of 2.49%.
Amortizing for 20 years would make my monthly principal+interest payments lower than my current rent. 

One apartment, however, will only allow me to place a downpayment of maximum 50K. The plan is to invest the other 50K of my downpayment savings at an interest rate similar or higher than the mortgage interest so that I'm not paying more interest in total.
Is this logic sound?

Now I'm thinking, even if I can downpay the whole 100K, is it wiser at this interest rate to invest a big portion of it instead and downpay the minimum?",finance
personalfinance,"My wife and I got into some debt when we were younger, and we are just now able to work our way out. Help/advice on our plan?","Hi guys. As the topic indicates, my wife and I did some dumb things when we were young, and we accrued a good bit of debt because of it. My wife also lost her job that had pretty good benefits and decent pay, and ended up taking a job where I work, for less pay. The benefits are also pricey so we got hit doubly there. Anyway, most of the debt on our credit reports has been charged off, and are floating around in collections. We have a home with a mortgage currently, and we have been talking about selling and buying a new home, since ours is pretty small for our growing family. We know we need to get our credit situation worked out, as it's pretty abysmal (mine shows as 499 on creditkarma and hers is 420). 

We have no active credit cards currently, and the only revolving lines of credit we have are our car and house payments. We recently worked with our mortgage company to get a loan modification to lower our payments since my wife was out of work and we risked losing our home to foreclosure without it. We also fell behind on our car payments by a couple months. The reason for this is, along with my wife losing her job, we are also paying $600 per month for it. The interest rate is 24%. I know, it's ridiculous and we got bent over a barrel when we bought it. However, our second child was on the way and the car we had at the time would not have fit all of us + car seats + stroller + misc. baby items. I regret it every single time I make the payment. I recently worked with them to get a modified payment done to bring the account back to current. So those two accounts are current now for the first time in a long time, which is a big weight lifted. I'm going to provide a breakdown of what we earn and pay monthly, so that it's easier to see where our funds go and what we're trying to do: 

I get paid 1500 biweekly gross, and all benefits come out of my paycheck, which totals almost $600/month, so my biweekly paychecks end up being around $950 net. My wife gets paid $1000 biweekly gross, and about $750 net. So we net roughly $3400/month. Here are our monthly expenses: 

Mortgage: $610 

Car: $600 

Electricity: $150 

Water: $25 

Daycare: $500 

TV/Internet: $120 

Cell phones: $90 

Car insurance: $150 

Gas: $100 

Food: $300-400  


That leaves us with $655 for the month. I pulled my credit reports and found some stuff on my credit that I think can be worked off pretty quickly. I have 3 credit cards that are in collections/charged off, however the accounts are nearing the 7 year mark and two have fall-off dates of May and September 2017, and another March of 2018. The rest are open collections that have totals that look like this: 


$1004 

$858 

$512 

$480 

$271 

$260 

$223 

$136 

$109  


Prior to this, we had no savings. I recently opened an Ally savings account and started by putting $50 in it from my last paycheck. I'm wanting to start working on my credit by getting a secured credit card. I also want to contribute regularly to the savings account, but I'm not sure how much I should put back. I have a lot of questions but I feel like I'm rambling so I'll just list them:  

1. Should I just put the entire amount left over after bills/food/other obligations into a savings account? Do people keep money on hand to pay for small stuff or just throw everything into savings? 


2. Do these charges affect my credit score much, and will they help my score go up at all if they're older? The youngest account there I believe is 3 years old.  


3. How should I attack those debts? Should I go from smallest to biggest, and just save until I have an amount that can pay the smallest off, then save until i have the next, and so on? Or should I save until I have enough to start from the top and go down?  

4. The car payment is huge, and I can't figure out a way to get out of it. We owe way more than it's worth, so the only way to get out from under it is to roll it into a new loan, which wouldn't really help with our payments. Is my only option to just keep paying on it? We have 4 more years left on it, which just kills me inside.


5. We set a goal date of 5/1/2018 to be absolved of the debt and hopefully have our credit to a score that may allow us to sell our house and look towards buying a new one. Is this realistic?

personalfinance,"23(M) with a 10.5k (10,500) debt seeking for answers; Loan or Debt Consolidation ?","Good afternoon, I'm in need of help and advice, i hope you guys can guide me through this as I'm clueless as to what to do.
I'm 23(M) who lives in New Jersey, U.S. Throughout the last 3 years I've accumulated a debt of 10.5k (10,500 dollars) within 3 credit card:

American Express :5000  (19.74% APR)

Chase: 2800 (23.74% APR)

Personal Loan (Wells Fargo): 2700 (15% APR)

I work full time with a hourly rate of 12.28 dollars (roughly 720 dollars every 2 weeks, after taxes, 401k , dental plan , vision plan and health insurance). That is roughly 24.000 dollars (with bonuses) yearly (before taxes)
The only expenses that i have are:

Cell Phone bill :265 dollars ( I pay for my mom's and sister's phone bill)

Cable &amp; Internet : 110 dollars

College transportation: 100 dollars (roughly)

I do not pay rent however i usually give 100~180 dollars to my mom (monthly)

I've recently came to the realization that my spending habits are out of control. I buy stuff that I truly don't need, superficial stuff. All the debt that I have accumulated is because I'm an idiot and not good with my money. The 3 credit cards that i have ran out of the ''special'' 0% interest. Now I'm usually charged 45 dollars monthly (per card) for interest rate, and this quite hurts me. I've decided to ask for a loan from Lendingclub to pay off all my credit cards but I'm not sure whether this is the right option or not. I have also called National Debt Relief and they have offered me to do a ''consolidation debt'' which they explained is consolidating all the debt into 1 monthly payment:

252 dollars monthly for 33 months = 8,316$ dollars total

They said that their ''fee'' was already included within the 252 dollars and that the only downside to a ''debt consolidation'' plan is that it will impact my credit score greatly, but overtime it will get better. This honestly scared me, because I know in this country a good credit score is the most important thing a person can have.

So my question is it better to do get a loan, or go forward with the debt consolidation? or is there anything else I can do ?

I guess I should also add that within the last month I've been more careful as to where and how i spend my money, I'm excluding myself from buying anything that I WANT rather than NEED (I dont know if this matters but I've recently got my Associates on Business Administration, I'm looking forward to go Rutgers Business School and get my bachelors)",finance

personalfinance,Student loans vs 403b/IRA/Roth IRA,"Hello r/personalfinance! I am an about-to-graduate dental student who is doing a one year residency next year. My first year salary will be $50k.

My student loans total about 170k, and range in interest rate from about 5.5-6.5%. For the first year I will most likely be paying off my loans with the PAYE plan since my income won't be able to support a 10 year payment plan. 

My question is about whether it is better to use any extra money I have leftover towards paying off my student loans, or if it is more advantageous to put that money in a tax deferred account. My residency will provide me with a 403b plan. I do not know if they do any employer matches. 

I also want to know if there is any advantage at all to using a roth IRA during this year as opposed to putting money towards paying the student loans off.

My goals are to save aggressively for retirement so FIRE is an option. I already have some money put away in VTSAX and would most likely put any extra savings into this fund, or a similar index fund.

personalfinance,529 plan for international study - currency question,"I'm a US student planning on getting my bachelor's degree in a Canadian school next fall (if it has an IRS ""Federal School Code"", it should be eligible for 529 plan usage, right?).

However, while the price of my school in CAD is unlikely to change, the USD:CAD exchange rate seems like it could be relatively volatile in the next 4 years - and is fairly high right now.

personalfinance,"7 Months Pregnant, health insurance terminated my coverage suddenly","Hi there - First off, thanks for reading my post, I appreciate it. 

I am located in the state of Missouri. I own a business with my husband (we are an LLC) and therefore we have to provide our own insurance. Since we found out I was expecting in early December, my only option for maternity coverage was to sign up through Healthcare.gov. We had CIGNA coverage, but changed to BCBS. BCBS coverage would start in March.  

Monday evening, ( May 1) I open our mail that I allowed to collect on my desk for a few days.  In the small pile was a notice from Blue Cross Blue Shield and the LETTERHEAD dated April 18th. They notified me that I was behind on a payment and that my coverage would be terminated (no date of termination was given) ( I assume that I received this letter on Thursday 4.27 when we left town).

 I opened this letter after hours on Monday, I wanted to make sure that I could speak to a customer service rep on Tuesday morning (5.2) After several phone calls, I finally called and asked for a supervisor with BCBS. 

This is what I found out during our discussion:

BCBS payment is due the 1st of each month. Once coverage has been terminated, BCBS is not allowed to re-instate it. Since my coverage started March 1, I called in February and payed my first premium over the phone with my card ending in *5679. The representative notified me that this functioned as a one time payment, and I agreed. I asked how to set up automatic payments and she recommended I do so online. I decided not to and wait for a bill in the mail. When April 1 rolled around, BCBS attempted to charge an old card *8482 that was linked to my OLD health plan with BCBS in 2015 and 2016. My plan at that time was set up as auto payment. I did not authorize my new health plan to be set up on auto payment in any way. The supervisor tried to pawn the blame back onto me that I did not follow instructions when told to sign up online with auto-pay. I responded that I did not authorize card *8482 to be used with my current plan. The supervisor let me know that all plans must be paid within the month they are due, yet my plan was canceled on Friday 4.28 after they tried to run card *8482 again. 

I told him that under federal regulation, an insurance company has to give me 30 days notice before termination ends and they basically said ""No, we don't."" 

My husband and I routinely pay our bills on time, so a consequence this severe is new to us.

I'm looking for some advice in reducing CC debt and improving overall financial health. About me; I'm a 36 year old man with a wife and 2 kids. We have accumulated almost $50k in CC debt over the past 5 years after moving into a new home, making renovations, and a myriad of impulse purchases.  

I have created a monthly budget but have not been able to stick to it. I have also tried tracking my spending habits using YNAB, but not consistently. I'm not currently having problems paying my monthly bills, but I never seem to have anything extra, and periodically have to dip into savings.  

My current situation is as follows:  
* Monthly Net Income -$6,400
* My wife also nets aprox. $4,000, but we have separate accounts
* Savings -$10,000 ($6k allocated for Disney vacation)  

Monthly Bills:  
* Mortgage on primary home - $1,800  
* Credit Card Debt - $1,100  
* Mortgage on rental property - $765  
* Truck payment - $365

I also have several store cards with zero balances. My total utilization is 53%, but the cards listed above are at 70% or higher, so I'm thinking about applying for another card, to move some to a 0% card to avoid the high interest rates, which are 19-20% in some cases. I have received ""pre-qualified"" offers from Wells Fargo and Amex. I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations for these or other cards, based on my scores? I'd like to maximize my initial CL for balance transfers, so I'm most interested in a bank that will be easy to work with if I need to request an immediate increase.  

I have about $9,000 in an investment account that I want to withdraw and pay off my truck ($7k owed). I would then be able to put that $365/month toward CC debt going forward. Is this a good idea, or should I apply it in some other way?  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**: The interest rate on my truck is low, 4.99%. I realize that my idea of paying off the truck to put an extra $350/month toward CC debt was a flawed plan. I will plan on using that money to pay down my higher interest cards first.  

Our financial situation is dire, but we did gross $150k last year and live in a fairly low cost area. Obviously, most of the debt was accrued before we were making this much. So now that we have a substantial income stream I'm looking for advise on paying down that debt quickly.  

Disney, Disney, Disney. Wow. So much emotional turmoil over a vacation. Just to be clear, we haven't booked it yet. I know it's expensive and I know it's a frivolous expenditure, but I would rather take an extra 6 months to pay off our debt than disallow my kids a great childhood experience like that (they are 6 and 3). ** I understand that earmarking that money now doesn't make any sense, so the $6k will go toward CC debt.**  If we can diligently save enough over the next 6-8 months, we may still go.",finance

Additionally, my total loan balance did drop by about $250.  I'm super confused about this -- if the total balance dropped, how is it possible that only $12 was applied to the principal?

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**

I'm 27 years old, own my car, single, no kids, with a Business degree.

After working an average of 45hrs/wk during high-school and community college, and saving what I thought was a decent chunk of money, I decided that I didn't want to work while I finished the final 2 years of my degree. I moved out of my parent's house in a VERY high priced area to a very reasonable city close to my new school and hunkered down for a lot of studying.

While I tried to be as frugal as possible, 2 years is a long time and I wasn't as good at budgeting as I had thought. Also, while very fun and beneficial, my year of studying abroad didn't help the wallet. Thanks to the ease of Student Loans and Credit Cards, I was able to accomplish what I set out to do but definitely with a price I knew I would be dealing with for a while.

I graduated about a year and a half ago but failed to line up a job right out of college. I moved home to live rent-free (CCard min payments tho) while trying to start my life and figure out how I was going to tackle this mountain of debt. At the 6 month mark with no job, the student loan repayments started to come and I needed to make some money fast. This is when I turned to the ""Gig Economy"" such as Uber and got stuck. I rolled into a depression that stemmed from my debt and lack of job in the sector that I worked so hard for. Ultimately, because I could barely get myself to leave the house, I don't put much time into working or consequently paying down my debts.

As of now, I'm getting some help from a therapist and trying to take the steps to straighten things out. This comes from the fact that relationships have gotten a little tense at home because I have not found a job. The parents think I am just being lazy and have no motivation to find a job, but they don't understand EVERYTHING that's going on with me and have requested that I move out.

Since there is no possible way of affording anything in this area I'm planning to move back to my college town where it is cheap and I have a much larger professional network that might help me land a position.

I did some research and have read that I can call my credit card company that has a high-interest rate and ask them to work with me and lower it to allow me to make more than just the minimum monthly payment. Is this possible in my situation? Or do I have to have non-payments on my account for the CC company to see that I can't make payments?

&amp;nbsp;

**Roth IRA**

I have roughly $23k locked up in a Roth IRA that I opened when I turned 18. I've made less than $10k in post-tax contributions (working on getting an exact number) and the majority of growth has come from very aggressive stocks suck as Apple and Tesla. The plan for this account has always been less of a long-term retirement account and more of a place to park my money until I am able to purchase my first home. (Up to 10k worth of growth allowed to be withdrawn for first-time home purchases without penalties iirc) Also, I have no issues partially liquidating this account if it makes sense to use it to pay off my CC debt (as long as I still have enough for my 3.5% down for FHA).

&amp;nbsp;

**Home**

Since I am moving out of my rent-free place, from an investment standpoint, I find it VERY wasteful to pay rent (haha, rich coming from me). In the area I'm moving to rent would be about **$600**/mo.

The plan for my first home has always been to purchase a multi-family dwelling (du/triplex) using an FHA loan and my Roth IRA withdrawals. Live in one unit, use the rest to cover my mortgage/expenses and potentially live rent free while building equity in something that could provide for me long into retirement.

$350,000 property with the potential of 2k/mo in rental income.

Unfortunately, with my lack of long-term employment, it would be impossible to qualify on my own. I believe someone in my family would be willing to step-up and help my qualify by co-signing, but obviously, nothing is for sure.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other**

My credit score is just south of 700.

My only other expenses are insurance (**$50**/mo), and gas which correlates with how much I work (I don't leave the house much if it's not for work).

Earning Potential: When I can get myself to try, it is relatively easy to make 3k/mo. Or, about $20/hr.

personalfinance,"Dad is thinking we buy a condo in the city my college is in, but I'm unsure it's the best move.","We have been looking for a place for me for a while now, the deal is that he plans on paying my rent or the mortgage to a place I'd stay in while I'm attending college.

So we found a condo that is pretty nice and has a great view and all that stuff, and it costs 296,000.

We're pretty far in the process now, so here are the numbers for the loan:

The down payment at $57,000 and the loan amount is $236,800. And then add a 5.125 % interest rate on that. 

Including hoa fees and taxes and other expenses, the total amount we will have to pay monthly is $2600. 

Other relevant info:

In the past 5 years the place appreciated $130,000. (26000/ yr)

Then we would pay $32,000/ yr. To own the place.

These numbers seem pretty extreme to me at first.

BUT

First of all we'd be renting out one of the rooms to either one of my friends or a random from Craigslist for $800-$900 a month.(we'll use 800 for calculations)

And if we weren't paying the mortgage, we would still be paying about $900 on rent for me anyways.

So with the extra roomates income added, only $1800/m ($22,000/y) would be what we had to pay. And with what we would pay on rent anyway factored in, that would drop to $900/m extra($11,000/year) extra.

So if we look at our extra expense for buying a house and subtract that from the avg. Appreciation,  it looks like this could be a good buy.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!

Am I missing anything? Do you guys think it's a good call? I'm getting anxious, but my father is all chill about it.

I'd also like to be saving some money each month, while also preventing myself from being extremely upside down on the value of the car vs the loan.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage?,"Hey PF,

I bought a co-op studio apartment in Fort Lee, NJ (right outside NYC) about 4 years ago for $58,000 (who says living in the NYC-area has to be expensive?)

Anyway, I have about $40,000 left on my mortgage. I'm getting married in September and we plan to live in the studio for another couple of years to save money before we buy a house.

Does it make sense to just pay off the balance of the mortgage? My interest rate is 5.375%

We will most likely sell the apartment when we move out and buy a house.

personalfinance,"What exactly is auto-loan refinancing, and how would it benefit me?","So I bought a car from a dealership last August, and because I had no credit score (not bad credit, NO credit score because I never used credit in the past) I was able to get the car, but my interest rate is around 14% and my payments are around the $340 per month range.  I can afford this very easily. 

Fast forward to last month.   I have been focusing on improving my credit score, and as a result, it has shot up to almost 700.  

Recently, during a call to my bank about an unrelated subject, after I had been helped, the person I was speaking with asked me if I had an auto loan.  I siad yes, and she asked me the interest rate and such, and I provided it.  She said I should really consider refinancing the loan through them (my bank).  But, as I was in a bit of a hurry, I didn't have time to go into detailed questions about the process, and most importantly, how it helps me.

personalfinance,Student Loan Payment Advice,"Hello,

I recently graduated college and I am making $80k per year. I graduated with some debt (roughly $35.5k). Some of the loans have terrible interest rates. You can see my open loans here http://imgur.com/a/PHCDH

I have an emergency fund saved up and my only monthly payments are rent, food, car insurance, and my retirement account which all comes to about $1,100 a month. I plan to pay this debt off as quick as possible and I want to apply this inherited $10k to these loans immediately. What would be the best way to apply this money to my loans? Should I use it to pay off the three accounts with the highest interest? Or divide it out evenly?

ethereum,How might legacy financial institutions respond to or attempt to subvert Ethereum?,"*TLDR; I'm imagining what the conflict might look like when industries are faced with ""porting"" themselves to Ethereum or other block chain technologies vs. going out of business. Many industries which already deal in virtual assets seem vulnerable to this threat in the fairly short term, and banking seems like the one with the best tools for fighting back by attempting to subvert and control the behavior of crypto currencies.*

I've been thinking this evening about the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and some of the corporations involved in it - particularly JP Morgan.

Having recently read G. Edward Griffin's ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"" - an excellently researched history of the Federal Reserve system in the United States and the involvement of J Pierpont Morgan and some of Europe's most influential bankers in both its creation and its manipulation of the political landscape to the financial advantage its owners, I have to confess that I am a bit concerned about their participation this early in the growth of the Ethereum network.

Why, you might ask? After all, even if they buy in to the platform, that doesn't mean they can dictate how it behaves, does it? I think they might have an incentive to try.

But before we talk about that, let's talk about why they would want to dictate how the network behaves.

Since the invention of banking, bankers have competed with and cooperated with corporations and political figures to reserve the best role in the world economy for themselves. They own the money store. And since the advent of fractional reserve banking, that essentially means they have a license to print and sell imaginary credits in exchange for loan collateral - real things of value.

So they trade an inherently worthless set of numbers (not even cash or coin these days - just numbers invented by selling debt to a government) for fees paid in the same scrip which only has value because people don't really understand how the game works. And then they also have the chance to acquire fabulous prizes both by spending the large fees they make for administering the scheme during the good times and by picking up assets at fire sale prices after the debt they issue crashes the system and the only ones left with money are... the ones who can print it at will.

And even better, if you can convince politicians to set things up so that even the members of the cartel who get caught standing when the debt bomb explosion ends the game of financial musical chairs don't get hurt because the taxpayers who suffer the most due to the monetary debasement the system uses to reward its elite are forced to pick up the tab.

Good work if you can get it - and they spent a lot of time and effort getting it. They don't want to give it up. But Ethereum is a technology which lets people build more efficient and more trustworthy versions of banking, governance, and corporate services. The global socio-economic network of central banking and the politicians and corporations who serve and benefit from that network were built on horse and buggy era collaboration technology. By comparison, blockchain technology is the automobile. 

These aren't stupid people (well, not all of them). Some of them understand this. They realize that not porting their business to the blockchain isn't any more of a realistic option than not porting to the web was fifteen or twenty years ago. If you don't do it, then someone else in your industry will, and the capabilities and economies of the platform will allow them to take your market share away completely - eventually.

The rules of the game are port or be ""Amazoned,"" or in this case, ""Ethereumized."" The platform capabilities it provides adopters are too disruptive to compete against in a marketplace of services. For service providers, it's a case of evolve or die.

So smarter bankers should realize that:

1 - The legacy system they have benefited from for so long is showing its age and is now a house of cards, ready to fall under the increasing stress of the debt load we are piling on top of it.

2 - An industry of ""horse and carriage drivers"" doesn't have a profitable skill set to offer in the age of the automobile. In other words, when everyone can trust their bank because they are their own bank, and we don't need 3rd parties (especially ones who have abused their position in the legacy economy to disproportionately benefit themselves) sitting in the middle of transactions to make sure strangers don't cheat each other - then why do we need bankers?

After all, banks don't really need to manipulate anything tangible in order to function. In the age of electronic fiat money, they already exist in virtual space - it's just a private virtual space in which they control the rules - the primary ones being the rules that allow them to invent new credit into existence.

So if another platform can manage that virtual space in a provably fair way, without the overhead of paying a bunch of bankers, then all you need is the right set of deployed smart contract code to completely virtualize the industry and to free it from the private ""reserve"" the bankers colluded with government regulators to create as their engine of profit.

Uber's business model is also at risk for the same reason. Though Uber does manage capital assets - the cars their drivers use to transport customers to and fro, those assets are provided at no cost to Uber by their labor force. Again, nice work if you can get it.

But Uber exists in the legacy economy. It's a .com, not a .eth. So it spends a lot of money trying to not get sued. There's an address and named ownership which can be censored because the organization is centralized, and so it spends lots and lots of investor money trying to survive and spread into tightly regulated markets.

Decentralized ride sharing won't have that problem. Once you finish virtualizing the industry into code and allowing the providers of the labor and capital - the drivers - to maximize their earning by running the best ride sharing code on the blockchain, and you offer customers the most convenient service technology can deliver at the best price, then why do you need an Uber anymore?

See the trend here? Any company which deals in a market artificially protected by regulation (including governance itself) is extremely vulnerable to decentralized virtualization because the Dapp version of that service should be strongly preferred by rational consumers. Industries which do manage tangible capital assets may be able to resist ""porting"" for longer than their 'protected virtual' comrades, but eventually crowd-funded Dapp's will accumulate the capital required to ""Ethereumize"" those industries too.

So there are a lot of industries that are facing an existential decision right now, and I suspect that many of them know it, because the people running those industries didn't get to where they are by being stupid. So what is the strategy a rational, survival and profit seeking corporation would choose?

For those industries which can ""port"" themselves onto Ethereum, I think the optimal strategy is to get there first. Companies in industries which aren't yet easily automated via smart contract and robotics will be able to operate with tremendously more efficiency when their ledgers and supply chains are managed via smart contracts, and the ones who make that transition first and are well managed will have a great chance of dominating their industry and benefiting from its eventual monopolization and commoditization via automation and virtualization.

But banks and governments and some corporations are already done for from an evolutionary standpoint right now. Any day, the ""right"" Dapp might get uploaded and transform their segment of the economy so radically and so rapidly that the legacy versions of those industries simply disappear. What if you opened a bank and no one showed up to ask for a fiat loan? What if you threw an election and no one voted because the institution was no longer relevant? For those entities, the rational decision might be to fight. And how would they fight? By attempting to control and then subvert the network.

Here's where proof of stake comes in. The market capitalization of all crypto currencies are, in early May of 2017, still minuscule compared to the cash reserves of some of the world's largest corporations, not to mention the fiat resources central banks could bring to the fight if they decided to, which we might imagine (or to be safe, should imagine) they would.

How could they deploy that capital to disrupt and gain control over crypto currencies? In the case of a proof of work network, they might try to bribe or more subtly influence developers, miners, or users to support courses of action which could stall development or make the network vulnerable to takeover.

I'm not saying that AXA is doing this to Bitcoin via Blockstream, because I think [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) may be sufficient to explain the impasse in Bitcoin's improvement. But then again, if that were what were happening, I also wouldn't be surprised, because what sort of future does a multinational insurance company see for itself in a blockchain based economy? Like banking and ride-sharing, insurance is another industry which is almost completely virtualized already. Decentralized prediction markets can and hopefully will quickly become the ""automobile"" to the insurance industry's ""horse and buggy."" So who knows? I certainly don't.

Once Ethereum has transitioned to proof of stake, what concerns me a bit is that banks and governments might at some point be tempted to offer insane amounts of fiat money to secure enough stake in the network to subvert or censor it. The amount of money they have available vs. the amount of money which would cause the head of just about every crypto investor to swoon with the thoughts of the windfall profits they could make by selling for fiat seems to balance in favor of bribery for control being a viable option.

If a central bank were to initiate buys of Ethereum starting tomorrow with sufficient volume to drive the price of each coin to $1000 or $10,000, I don't know about you, but I would personally have a hard time 'hodling' my entire stack. If $10,000 per token were a high enough fiat price to gain a controlling interest in the stake - perhaps a central bank (or a cartel of them) would be willing to throw a little less than a trillion dollars at the problem.

Or maybe not. Of course, bankers might realize that this strategy won't work, because as soon as they try to censor the network or stall its development, the community could just fork away. But that also might be disruptive, so I'm wondering if there might not be a way to allow the protocol to exploit a would be 51% attacking coalition's mutual distrust among its members.

I haven't really though through the game theory of how that might work, but I think it's something interesting to contemplate.

Oh, and incidentally, since the ability to fork makes a hostile takeover of the Ethereum blockchain by banking interests a strategy not likely to succeed, what is the optimal strategy for the financial elite at this point, one might ask?

My best guess is this: for the wealthy and powerful members of the legacy economy the best strategy for preserving their wealth in the next economy is to buy in early, heavily, with their personal assets - then buy in via the commercial, financial, and political organizations they control.

Just relax and let this happen. More thoughtful management is taking over. Thanks for getting us this far, warts and all, but we've got it from here. Resist if you'd like, but by doing that, you won't just end up on the wrong side of history, more importantly, you'll end up on the wrong side of the fork.",cryptocurrency
btc,"Despite the scaling controversy, I think we are in a win-win situation.","The unfortunate thing that I think not everyone realizes is that the price of bitcoin is tied to the price of transaction fees. Even with the same amount of users we can't increase the price 5 fold without also increasing transaction fees to enormous levels. The only way to sever this link is to increase the base layer transaction capacity (Which is necessary for the revenue of miners who secure the network anyway). (note: an astute person might realize that you can't increase the price much without also increasing users but to be fair you can sort of increase the users without affecting the base layer because of centralized services like coinbase who could store these users assets off-chain).

But even as it stands bitcoin is serving to protect the world from two harmful forces: The thievery through the underhanded method of inflation from regular people which economists say isn't a big deal because prices change to offset this thievery (here is a hint: It is a big deal because of the universal law which is that ""nothing is free"").

And the second oncoming threat to all of us: The future additional and mandatory tax of negative interest rates forced upon us because of the widespread ""war"" against cash. As if all of the taxes and economic injustices we face aren't enough. Now we have a new one to sap away at the fruits of our labors.

It's hard to say what the price of bitcoin would be today if we had already increased the base block size to 2 MB instead of 1MB. Or even activated segwit. I think the price would be higher with either of those situations. WIth that said the ""small blockers"" do have a tiny point. The resistance to change of the bitcoin program could be an asset and encourage investment. But at the same time it can also be a weakness. Some things are stronger because they can bend without breaking.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Taking out a personal loan to pay 39k in federal tax debt,"Hello all. I owe roughly $39000 in federal taxes for 3 prior tax years (2010,11&amp;12).

I got the amount down to under 50k by living frugally and basically giving them 75% of my paychecks over the course of 1.5 years.

personalfinance,"Should I put 10%, 15%, or 20% down?","Hey guys. Going to try to make this brief.

Age 30. Married. 2 kids. Mother is going to be living with us. Live in NJ. Expensive area, but with my trade (hair stylist), I need to live in a high-end area, and the salon I'm with now is highly regarded. I make good money for my trade. About $60-$65k, pre-tax. My wife works part time and is at around $35k, pre-tax. So close to $100k, combined. 

Renting now. $1800 for a 3 bedroom, head and hot water included. Extremely cheap for the area, but it's deceiving. The place is falling apart. We have mice (more than normal, above a business). The floors underneath the laminate are asbestos (I know, it's not a big deal unless you remove them). The building is 120 years ago and we have a new landlord. Between him and the old landlord, nothing is done. I have no idea the water quality/what we're breathing in. It's probably fine, but it's unnerving. We just want to move.

Comparable renting rates are $2400-$2500 a month. However, they are extremely few and far between because the market is boiling hot right now. Houses are going after being listed for a few days. Interest rates and all that.

With a mortgage on a $350000 house (starter home here -- though we plan on staying for a long time), our mortage, including taxes, insurance, etc., would hover around $2100 a month. $2200-$2300 if we go 10-15%, +$80-120 for PMI. any which way you look at it, it's cheaper than renting. Using the Times calculater, it would be worth it to own after just 1.5 years. It's a no brainer. And I say this as someone who doesn't mind renting. I'm not dead set one way or the other. But with limited options, and no desire to move (town is amazing, great schools, great location, kid loves her school, etc.) buying seems the right move.

- $15k in emergency fund.
- $5k in old 401(k)
- $5k in Roth IRA that I just started last year. On pace to put $5,500 (each, both me and my wife) in this year, including rent/mortage, etc.
- No debt.
- 800+ credit scores
- $265 car lease. 

Here's a huge caveat: I worked in the restaurant industry for a very long time. I've saved a considerable amount of money (enough for a 20% down payment on a $350k house + closing fees), and have always kept cash in a fireproof box. I know it's dumb. My mother is a single mom and I didn't get a ton of education when it came to finances for almost all of my life. My mother was afraid of banks (first generation, her parents were awful). It's only under my own accord over the last few years that I've smartened up. That money is mostly taxed (seriously), but it's over 10+ years of savings. I can't proove it's taxed because I don't have all the tax returns for it. I've spoken with the bank and they were great about it. Told me to sit with them, desposit it, and deal with the red flags.

Now, assuming I get through all that without getting gouged, what would you guys suggest for a down payment? I've been thinking 15% ($52k, opposed to $67k, which evaporates a good amount of my money). It allows me to have closing fees and keep some cash for liquidity. I don't mind paying the PMI for a few years. It wouldn't be that much or that long. It's worth it to me to get the interest rates being offered now opposed to waiting another year or so and then being stuck with a 5% interest rate.

We've been pre-approved for $400k, but I'm not spending that much. A $350k house keeps us at around 25% of our monthly take home, which is great. My wife will also be going back to work full time in 2 years once the youngest child is in school, which will bump our salary up a bit. Maybe another $10-$20k. But I'm not counting that.

personalfinance,"Get an additional student loan, or pick up a second job and save religiously?","I feel like this definitely requires some backstory:  
I'm 21 and in my third year of college. I'm studying engineering, and should graduate in May 2019 (so two more years). I was accepted into school with a full ride scholarship, but in order to pay for the other expenses of college, I took out 2k federal loan (all of my current loans and interests rates will be listed below.) Unfortunately, after my first year, bad decisions and bad situations meant losing my scholarship. So in order to continue with school (which wasn't really optional, in my eyes) I had to take out more loans then I ever really planned for.  
So for the past two years, I've been maxing out my federal loans. However, I go to school three semesters a year, as per my program, so the standard unsub loans offered do not cover the full costs. In order to cover tuition in full, I've had to take out two additional loans, that are still federal, but have higher interest rates and are in my mothers name.  
The next two years of my education will actually be slightly cheaper than the previous two, because two of my next semesters will be full-time (paid) internships, rather than class. I still pay tuition for these semesters, but it's significantly cheaper, and I'm making good money.  
So my dilemma. I've crunched the numbers, and for my last year of school, I'd need to takeout **an additional loan for about 5.5k** (likely the same as my past additional loans, with an interest rate around 4.3%, federal, unsub, in my mothers name) or **save** 5.5k by then. So why am I torn:  
I'm about half way to 5.5k in savings already, but my boyfriend and I are trying hard to save for a home. We want 20% down, and we know that'll take a while. Plus, in the meantime it serves as a really good emergency fund.  
My boyfriend is a recent engineering grad, and though he makes money, he is in a lot more debt than I am. His totals about $75k, and has much much higher interest rates. The more I'm saving, the less I'm helping him with out expenses, and the less money going towards his loan payments (we live solely off his income, with about 1.5k saved a month, give or take).  
I feel as though after I graduate, we'll be in a significantly better place than we are now, and fully capable of playing off my loan payments, which are in reality, pretty minuscule compared to what my bf is paying now. So my question; **is it worth it to take out an additional loan when I have the means to save and pay out of pocket?** 

My current loan information:  
$1,980 (1.072%)  
$6,432 (1.073%)  
$11,486 (4.29%)

I'm single, no kids, mid-30's, and live off of my own income from work (no other money coming in).  In 2013 I was established in a great job with solid benefits, had a 401k and money in savings, and had just bought my first home.  Less than 6 months after settlement, my employer announced that they were closing the doors and everyone was laid off.  Despite 4 years in my profession with solid references and performance reviews, my job hunt dragged out for close to 2 years, including a few months downtime due to a serious injury. 

I was granted max unemployment benefits for 26 weeks, which was still very little income.  I had to zero out my savings and 401k to keep going.  I made the situation worse by resorting to credit cards when my funds ran dry, so the cards that were previously low or zero balance were now carrying several thousand in debt.

As soon as I was cleared to return to work I was able to get a 24-month contract job in my profession, which I had anticipated would turn into a permanent position.  I spent the first 12 months playing catch-up on my most urgent items (mortgage, HOA) but it was a real ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" situation, since I'd get one thing caught up as something else fell behind.  I have several accounts that were flipped into collections, with one creditor seeking a wage garnishment order.

Without getting into many details for privacy's sake, I lost out on a hiring opportunity to a diversity candidate.  After that the company went through business model / organizational changes, and any other chance at being hired went right out the window.  

My contract has since ended and once again I'm out of work.  I've had a few strong job contacts and interviews in the last 3-4 months, but the positions ultimately went to other candidates.  

At some point 8-10 months ago I consulted with a bankruptcy lawyer, but couldn't bring myself to commit to filing.  Family members begged me to not do it, because they know people who filed bankruptcy and it's haunted them well into late life.  If it's worth mentioning, those are people that were financially careless to begin with.

WHERE TO GO NEXT
****************

TLDR; Should I seriously consider filing bankruptcy, or is there a better option for me?

Ouch.  I reflexively want to write things like ""until I lost my first job, I had everything together!"" but that's neither here nor there.  I recognize that some things I write here are essentially whining.

I've had some suggestions that I sell my home and find a cheaper place.  At &lt; 5 years into the loan I don't have equity, and due to changes in the local market I would have to sell at a $10,000+ loss.  I'd likely have to take out a loan just to sell the place.  I have a modest 1-bedroom home, my mortgage is comparable to the monthly cost of a 1-bedroom apartment in the general region, and really I don't want to give up the home I worked so hard for.  I previously lived in a low-income neighborhood where I was afraid to walk around outside, prostitutes on every corner and crime was rampant.  I don't want to go back to that.

I've looked into taking ""smaller"" jobs while hunting for suitable/regular work, but in most cases the unemployment pays more.  When I was younger there was a point where I worked 2 jobs while attending school, but since then I've been diagnosed with depression/anxiety that impacts me when under severe stress.  My current situation really isn't helping, but I also can't see myself keeping up with the physical and mental toll of 2 jobs at this point in life.

I'm currently scheduling some time to talk with a credit counseling/non-profit in my area.  I don't know if they can offer any help.  

I've already filed hardship paperwork with my bank/mortgage lender, they will most likely approve me for a hardship program during my unemployment.

The other stuff, I'm not sure where to begin.  My phone rings off the hook from unknown numbers (most likely debt collectors) who won't leave a message.  I need to get my HOA fees caught up before they shut my water off.  The agency who holds the $1700 collection debt is now threatening to look into filing with a local legal office. I NEED about $1200 worth of work on my car, 100k+ maintenance.  I own a Honda that I expect to last me for years to come yet, but I need to get that 100k maintenance out of the way. 

The idea of filing for bankruptcy terrifies me, mostly because close family I've discussed the idea with have me convinced that it'll be the end of the world.  The lawyer I spoke with previously said I'd get to keep my house and possibly wipe out the past due HOA debt, allowing me to get current and move on with life.  I have no idea how sound this is, though the lawyer was recommended to me by a friend so at the very least, I don't feel like they're being shady. To some degree it sounds too good to be true, so I know there's a trade-off in here.   

I was turned down for a job I was considered for recently due to my current credit history.  At the time, the recruiter mentioned that another person they'd head-hunted had been in bankruptcy and was hired on by the same company right after they discharged.  I worry over how my current credit situation will continue to affect my job hunt.  I have professional credentials and references to vouch for my trustworthiness.  I'm the person who finds a bag of money and returns it to the rightful owner (this happened during my first unemployment).  But I understand that this is all worthless when talking to an employer who is judging me by my credit history.

I'm at a loss with where to go.  Thank you for reading all of this, and again, many thanks for any advice you guys may have.",finance
personalfinance,Dad is thinking of buying a condo while I attend school so I can stay there. What do you all think? (I revised numbers because they were wrong earlier!),"We have been looking for a place for me for a while now, the deal is that he plans on paying my rent or the mortgage to a place I'd stay in while I'm attending college.

So we found a condo that is pretty nice and has a great view and all that stuff, and it costs 296,000.

We're pretty far in the process now, so here are the numbers for the loan:

The down payment at $57,000 and the loan amount is $236,800. And then add a 5.125 % interest rate on that. (Considered an investment property)

Including hoa fees and taxes and other expenses, the total amount we will have to pay monthly is $1900

Other relevant info:

In the past 5 years the place appreciated $130,000. (26000/ yr)

Then we would pay $23,000/ yr. To own the place.

These numbers seem pretty extreme to me at first.

BUT

First of all we'd be renting out one of the rooms to either one of my friends or a random from Craigslist for $800-$900 a month.(we'll use 800 for calculations)

And if we weren't paying the mortgage, we would still be paying about $900 on rent for me anyways.

So with the extra roomates income added, only $1000/m ($12,000/y) would be what we had to pay. And with what we would pay on rent anyway factored in, that would drop to ~$100/m extra($1200/year) extra.

So if we look at our extra expense for buying a house and subtract that from the avg. Appreciation,  it looks like this could be a good buy.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!

Am I missing anything? Do you guys think it's a good call? I'm getting anxious, but my father is all chill about it.

Thank you for any input

personalfinance,"Trying to make decisions regarding summer job income, student debt, taxes and savings","I am a second year law student (law school is three years long) who has to make some decisions regarding between student loans, savings, taxes etc. I will be working this summer at a job that pays $3,500/week. I have good reason to assume that I will be making $180,000 after I graduate. I have some financial support from my parents and they would be willing to help in case of emergency.


***Questions:***

What should I do with my summer income? My current thinking is I should put it in retirement savings accounts since my current student loan interest rate is low and I can get a similar rate for my loans next year.

If I am saving what kind of account should I use (401(k), Roth, something else)? I am paying a pretty low tax rate so it seems like a 401(k) wouldn’t have much of a benefit.

What kind of stocks or mutual funds do you recommend for my situation?

Is there any way I can reduce the amount that will be withheld from my taxes without doing anything illegal? 

***Information***

**Current Situation**

 *Student Debt*: ~$50,000 (3% variable rate, 5 year term, currently making monthly interest payments tied to LIBOR 1 month rate)

*Cash*: $9,000 

I am planning on looking into refinancing my student loans once I graduate.  

**This Summer** (Expected):

*Income*: $35,000

*After Withholding*: ~$22,000

*Expected 2017 Tax Return*: ~$8,000 

My understanding is my tax withholding is done as if I was making 180,000/year so I am going to have a lot withheld and then get a pretty large refund. 

**Next Year**:

*Expected School Expenses*: ~$75,000 (I can get a similar rate for my loans next year)

*Income from on-campus jobs*: $12,000",finance
personalfinance,College financial aid (pell grant),"Hello,

Regarding the federal grants - pell grant in particular, does anyone know what happens to the pell grant if a student graduates early? 

Example:

Student enters in year 2014 fall semester
Student graduates in 2017 spring semester
Student has taken summer courses each semester (10 credits and 5 credits respectively) and only qualified for federal loans in each semester.

Student has taken pell grant for SIX consecutive regular semesters. 

What happens to the students 4th year worth of pell grants? Are they allowed to take these in the semester before graduating to pay off debt? Are these move-able to the students graduate studies?

I tried googling around but it seems regulations are constantly being updated and its hard to find a credible regulation that is still up to date.

personalfinance,[Question] Considering purchasing a rental property...,"I'm specifically concerned with the feasibility of obtaining a personal loan to purchase a $55k rental property.

From the research I've done, it seems to be too low of an amount for a mortgage lender to waste their time on. However, interest rates for personal loans of that size are in the 9-10% range for a seven year loan, which makes me cringe. I currently have about $25k in cash, but I'd like to minimize the amount that I contribute upfront for the investment. Are their options I'm just not seeing? Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan has been slowly raising rates. How could I get my original loan info to see what the mechanism for this is?,"Hi Folks,
Obviously this is a lesson in diligently looking at statements, and if I had been doing this - everything would have been prevented :). 

Anyways - I have two student loan accounts with let's call them ""Bank 1"", paying them off for a few years now. Going into my account to make a payment, I'd noticed that my interest rate was not what I believed it to have been....

I checked back to the three years of statements that I have available online and the rate has been creeping up in small increments: 

4-28-17: increase of .25 and .25
12-29-17: increase of .25 and .25
7-29-16: increase of 00 and .25
12-29-16: increase of .25 and 00

My original loan was made with a now-defunct bank which was merged with ""Bank 1"", and it was about 7 years ago. I don't recall getting any notice of increases - just a letter once that my monthly payment amount changed. I found it odd but didn't think much of it - clearly it was related to this.

My questions:
- I'm pretty sure that the rate should have been fixed, and it hasn't fluctuated much during loan servicing (I believe just these 4 instances), however this is what I need to find out and not sure how...
- It 'may' have been pegged to a %+LIBOR - would this explain the fluctuations?

- Am I able to ask the bank to send me either the original paperwork or any paperwork around the time of the merger and their takeover of my loan?

- How do I properly verify what my rate 'should' have been, and if there's any mechanism for verifying it?

personalfinance,Advice about some post-graduation finances,"Hi PF! Throwaway for obvious reasons. 


I'd just like to hear some of everyones opinions on my current situation as I can't really decide what to do. 

I'm about to graduate from a large university and have been lucky enough to secure a position starting in June with good pay (55k entry level, so around 3k a month take home pay after taxes+401k etc.) As a graduation gift my grandparents have offered to purchase a car for me, or give me some money to pay off my loans. They're really against used cars and would want the car purchase to be new, and they would most likely pay in cash. So far they really like the Honda HR-V, which I believe range between 20-25k or so. If I don't take the car I would guess they'd give me about 20k or so to put towards loans. I can't decide if I should take the new car from them or the money gift, and I'd like some advice. I'm extremely lucky and fortunate for this and it's a really good problem to have. 


I have about 30k student debt in my name (with interest rates ranging between 4-6%) and my parents have about double that in their name which I really hope to help pay off eventually but probably don't have to worry about just yet. I believe my student loan payment plan is about $370 a month over 10 years, but I plan on paying it off quicker than that. 


I also have about 10k in savings, and my rent is going to be 450-500 a month starting in August. 


If I take the cash, I'd have to put some(or most) of this savings towards a used car. I guess I could keep some of the cash gift for an emergency fund, but the goal of the gift would be to pay off my loans as soon as possible. I would look for decent used cars with maybe 40-50k miles and a handful of years old-- I want something that can last me a decent amount of time, not a garbage car. 


Which do you think would be the better option? Is a new car a good enough investment to warrant having a higher loan balance? If not, does anybody have any good recommendations of affordable used car models that hold their value and can last me a decent amount of time, I'm not a car person!

personalfinance,Cancelling my whole life policy at 24 - my Financial Adviser is a close family friend. Looking for some advice on how to handle the relationship moving forward.,"Hey /r/PF!

So, like the title says, I'm cancelling my Whole Life policy and looking into a Roth instead for further down the road after I pay off the debts I have with the highest interest rates.

Some info on my financial situation before: I'm a 24 year old social worker in the US making ~40K per year. My take home every month is about $2200. I have another job officiating sports that brings me in another $4k per year. I have a 401(a) through work with ~12K in it already. I also have health insurance through work and a term life policy automatically for $100K.

I have 19K (6.4% IR) in student loans, 11K (4.1% IR) due on my vehicle, and $4500 (some stupid high IR) in CC debt. 

I've already taken the steps to start paying off the credit card debt. I'm balance transferring to another card with a 0% IR and this summer (baseball season) I'm putting half of my officiating money toward the Credit Card balance and the other half straight to savings because I made the mistake of falling in love and am wanting to get engaged soon. 

I pay the following monthly:

Rent - $600

Misc Bills like TV, netflix, internet, utilities - $310

Car - $285

Student Loan - $253

Phone - $70

Car Insurance -$80 

Gas - $80 (because I have to get to both jobs).

And the Whole Life Insurance - $227

That leaves me with about $300 per month before my Credit Card payment (minimum $125, I try to exceed it every month).

I'm planning on cutting my TV ($116) and the Whole Life ($227) to give me some extra income.

My goals are to get rid of the CC debt as fast as possible, stay current on my other bills, and hopefully get engaged to my girlfriend, whom my entire family loves and is also pressuring me to get engaged to. Apparently my reverend grandpa really doesn't like that I'm living in sin. But, it's important to me that I keep her around.

So, based on my goals, the good advice from here, and other friends in finance and business, I've determined that whole life is not a good thing for me financially right now. I am planning on meeting with my adviser next week to cancel the policy and potentially move on with something else, maybe a Roth.

Now the problem, my adviser is a close family friend. When I signed to have the policy (250K if I die), I did so with my dad who also purchased a plan for himself, my mom, and my sister. I felt pressured by my dad to buy it, and, my financial guy being a good salesman, convinced me that it was worthwhile to buy. But, after a real world kick in the face, I've realized that an extra $227 would help out a lot.

After finding out that the Whole Life Policies come with a pretty sweet commission, I felt a little screwed by somebody that I trusted had my best interests at heart. After lurking around here for a while and doing my own research, I don't see how anyone can think that, for someone making crap right out of college, a Whole Life policy is in my best interests. 

Since I bought the policy in 2014, almost immediately following graduation from college, I've paid $227 every month for 33 months. That's just shy of $7500. As of two days ago, the policy's cash value is $1020.16. And, like I said earlier, I've determined that it's not in my best interest to continue paying for this.

So, FINALLY, to my questions.

First, the relationship between our two families is important to me and I don't want to sour anything. How do you think I should/can I go against his advice (or sales tactic) calmly and politely and maintain good rapport? It is more important to me to have this policy gone, and I know that I can't keep everyone happy, but I'd like to find the most positive outcome for myself and the family's relationship to ours.

Second, what are some good ways to deflect the sales pitches to keep clients on Whole Life policies? For example, ""If you keep paying into it, the dividends will eventually pay for it and you just need to keep paying!"" or, ""You're just not looking long term and I know it's tough to keep paying for something you don't see immediate results for."". 

And finally, after some time on here, I've read to ask whether or not someone is acting as a fiduciary or as a salesman. I think the answer to that question might be the real kicker on how the relationship continues, but I think that should be the last question that I have to ask. Or should it be first?

Any comments, advice, other concerns about my situation, etc. are welcome. Thanks in advance for taking the time!",finance

I was not offered any federal loans, I think because I had taken one when I was in a teacher credential program a few years ago that I did not finish. I will still be working full time as this is a 100% online masters program.

I thought maybe I should apply to multiple banks to find the best rate, but will that hurt my score each time? Should I apply to multiple banks on the same day? Should I apply to the same bank that I already owe $28k to? Are they more or less likely to offer me a loan at a good rate? What banks should I apply to?

personalfinance,Best Option to Finance my MBA,"Hey all,


I was fortunate enough to be accepted into a top MBA program starting this fall. I'm wondering what the best course of action would be. I'm 26 and single.


I'm expecting tuition + fees + housing + food + healthcare + fun money to be around ~$100k per year. 

Currently, I have:

* Cash: $65k (Will use this to fund all pre-MBA shopping and trips)

* 401k: $55k

* Taxable Investments: $50k

* IRAs: 25k

* Debt: $0 (Paid off 40k in Student and car loans a couple years ago)



My options for financing are:

* Federal Loans: $20k @ 5.31% + 65k @ 6.31% with a 4.5% loan origination fee 

* Private Variable Loans: Starting at 3-4% but with rising interest rates this seems risky

* Private Fixed Loans: ~6% but there is no loan origination fee



Currently my plan is to apply for a private loan just to see the rate I get compared with the Federal Loans. However, I am leaning towards financing my MBA with 100% private loans right now, and drawing down from savings for fun items (travel, parties, etc.). 



However, my other idea was financing the first year of my MBA with full loans (~$85k cost of attendance + $10-$15k of fun money) and then pay it off at the end of next summer once I know my recruiting status post-MBA. Ideally, I'd like to pay off my first year loans when I know where I'll be working post-MBA ($40k cash + $40k investments). I'd also dump any money from an internship + signing bonus directly into the loans.



Since the graduate student loan interest rates are so high, I'm not sure it makes sense to sit on my investments hoping their growth outpaces my student loan interest rate. My cash + investments could substantially reduce the amount of loans I'll be accruing interest on. 



Does anyone who has been through this have any advice? I'd be especially interested to know if people have any advice on taking federal vs. private loans for graduate studies.",finance

personalfinance,Should I try to negotiate a lower APR on my credit cards now or later?,"Hi guys.

I have three cards that I'm going to pay off in full in two months, maybe three if things don't go my way. I was reading some threads about negotiating lower rates and it seems like the idea is to point out that you could transfer the debt to a different card with a lower interest rate, or you'll resort to closing it. I'll keep these account open, and I'll keep paying the balances off in full each month from here on out so I don't plan on paying interest anyway, but I want to negotiate the rates down anyway in case I ever end up resorting to putting larger balances on them again. 

It seems like I'm giving up my leverage by paying off my balances, so I need to do this now while I still have cc debt? At the same time, it seems like these conversations come up in this sub when we're talking about people who are looking at paying off large balances over a longer period of time than I am, so maybe there's a side to negotiating lower rates after the debt is paid off that I just haven't seen.

These loans ($41k) are from undergrad and 80% of my Master's (one semester left). I am getting married in June. At that point we will have a combined income of about $60k per year. He has 0 debt. We also will not be paying rent, no car payments, and low monthly expenses in general. My fiance knows about this debt and we will tackle it together, but I still feel bad about it. I also have about $4k in credit card debt on a Cap 1 and Gap card that I am working on. I recently paid off one credit card (Chase). Additionally, I'm stuck with paying my company back $5k due to some bullshit. However, with this new job I am starting soon, I am recouping that cost and it is the right career move.   

Anyways, I have not paid on my student loans since I have been in grad school. I made/make (until August) about $20k a year, and figured I could work on my other credit card debt while I had the chance to defer. Are these different groups significant at all? Why do some have higher interest rates? When I paid, I paid in one lump sum per month, and it seems that amount was distributed into these groups automatically. Should I try to change anything by calling, or is this a typical set up?   

Also, it says there is a due date of July 2018. I'm not sure where that came from, as I finish school in December 2017. Clearly I won't be finished paying this in a year. Should I try to get that changed?   

Last question - my fiance's family is wealthy. Very wealthy, but frugal. I'm pretty sure they have no idea I have this debt, unless my fiance told them, but I doubt it. Would it be worth it to swallow a hell of a lot of pride and shed some tears to ask them for a loan to decrease the interest I will have to pay in the future, and to pay them back instead of the loan companies/bank/whatever? Obviously I would talk to my fiance about this. And it would have to wait a few months since they are shelling out big bucks for our wedding and new apartment (tbh they could still afford all of my loans and then some, I just would like to have a little tact).  

What I think is best is to pay off as much of this $5k work thing and my $4k of CC debt before it's required I pay my student loans again. Am I correct or being stupid?   

Any advice is appreciated, thanks. I guess total I'm about $50k deep. Shit. Trying to be positive and I think after a couple of years of hard work it will be a blip in the radar. But damn. 

A FEW ADDITIONS: 

I'm American, fiance is from and we live/will continue to live in a Middle Eastern country. All loans/credit cards/the company I have to pay back are US based. 

I have about $6k in a 401k. Fiance has about $4k saved. I have about $2k saved but a lot of that is going to summer expenses due to not working/traveling/helping my mom with our second wedding in the States. The last few years I have not worked for 2 months over the summer (due to my job, not my personal choice), so basically any money I had saved (not much) went to those summers.

science,"Science AMA Series: Hi, I'm Matt Hourihan and I analyze bills--like the recent omnibus--for their impact on science and technology research and development funding. Ask me anything!","Hi, I'm Matt Hourihan and I run the AAAS R&amp;D Budget and Policy Program, where we follow trends in federal science spending and analyze legislation--like the recent omnibus--for its impact on science and technology budgets. We've served for 40 years as a source of info for policy makers and the science community. Ask me anything!

After months of waiting and weeks of negotiating, the Republican-controlled Congress finally released their omnibus bill to fund government for the next several months, and they did something many scientists weren't expecting: they completely diverged from President Trump's blueprint. As part of their [historically difficult science budget for 2018](https://www.aaas.org/news/trump-administrations-science-budget-toughest-apollo), the Trump Administration also recommended a set of steep cuts to take effect immediately in the current fiscal year, on everything from basic science at NIH to technology programs at the Department of Energy to climate research at NOAA. But [Congress pretty much ignored these in their 2017 bill](https://www.aaas.org/news/congress-rejects-white-house-approach-pursues-targeted-science-technology-boosts). According to our current estimates, the omnibus bill would increase federal R&amp;D by five percent this year, with increases for basic and applied research, development, and R&amp;D facilities funding. Among science agencies, there were a few clear winners, while most managed to avoid the sorts of cuts sought by the President.

The bill has passed the House and looks set to pass the Senate today, per the latest update (knock wood). How does the bill shape up? Does it tell us anything about what might happen in the next funding debate, just over the horizon? What kind of say does President Trump have over all this? How does the federal budget process even work?? Ask me anything!

personalfinance,"Receiving ""around $100,000"" from an inheritance this year, had some potential plans... first place to ask? Reddit, of course.","Hey there /r/personalfinance...

My uncle recently and somewhat suddenly passed and I was made aware that I would be getting one-third of his estate, which in itself was rather unexpected. Now that some of the numbers are being finalized, I know a few things:

1. His IRA was valued to be worth ""around $120,000""

2. His apartment, when sold, would be worth ""around $180,000""

Which would mean I would probably end up with ""around"" $100,000, not counting any applicable taxes. I'm also not sure of the other portions of his estate, since I'm not the executor of the will and I don't have access to those numbers and I don't want to nose too much into it, and I believe the executor to be pretty trustworthy. The executor mentioned in passing that his stocks had to be liquidated, but I'm not sure if they're part of his IRA or what.

So here's me:

* Recently graduated college, currently one year of professional experience in video production, $49k student loan being paid off with income-based repayment (about $70 a month because I'm not making very much).

* Working in an extremely low-income area in one of the most impoverished cities in the country, making $26k (~$12.50 an hour) a year doing professional video production &amp; post-production. I'm know that I can be making well more than twice this amount in different locations.

* Driving a car from 1997 with nearly 100k miles.

* I'm **absolutely desperate** to move out of my state (PA), preferably to an apartment or something near NYC since it's not *that* far and so I can chase jobs there.

* I've basically never had greater than $1k in my bank account at any given time since I'm pretty much living paycheck to paycheck.

So I'm not really sure what to do once I get this money. Can I move? Should I get a new car? Should I pay off my higher interest rate portions of my student loans?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,$80K Inheritance - what to do?,"My mom recently passed away.  She was a teacher and not a lot of savings, however, we each have gotten somewhat of an inheritance in the amount of $81K.  I'm pretty sure I know the answer on this, but we have around $21K in car loans at 2.99%, home equity loan of $23K at 4%, and around $21K in student loans at an average of 3%.  Paying these each month isn't a stretch as we live very simply, so we could continue chipping away at them.  With them being mainly tax deductible loans, as well as low interest rates, would it make more sense to invest the money, possibly earning 6%, or pay off the loans?

Also, we are receiving this from a portion of life insurance, retirement account, and mutual fund account.  My dad is also writing us a check as a gift from another life insurance policy.  Are there tax implications on any of this?",finance

# Description

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a financial holding company. The Company is engaged in investment banking, financial services. It operates in four segments

* The Consumer &amp; Community Banking segment offers services to consumers and businesses through bank branches, automatic teller machines (ATMs), online, mobile and telephone banking. 
* The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank segment, comprising Banking and Markets &amp; Investor Services, offers investment banking, market-making, prime brokerage, and treasury and securities products and services to corporations, investors, financial institutions, and government and municipal entities. 
* The Commercial Banking segment provides financial solutions, including lending, treasury services, investment banking and asset management. 
* The Asset Management segment comprises investment and wealth management.

## How big are these different divisions?

|Companies|Net Revenue|Net Income |Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Consumer &amp; Community | $45bn | $10bn | 18%
Corporate &amp; IB |  $35bn | $11bn | 16%
Commercial |  $7bn | $3bn | 16%
Asset Management |  $12bn | $2bn | 24%
Total (inc. Corp &amp; Adjustments) |  $96bn | $25bn | 10%

Gawd, I hate looking at banks... how does a business with 4 operating divisions having returns of 16% to 24% end up with a 10% return after corporate and adjustments?

## Recent financials 

On a 5 year view, little has changed at the topline and from a return on equity perspective. With a good buyback program the EPS has ticked up nicely. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $96bn | $94bn | $95bn | $97bn | $98bn|
|EPS | $6.19 | $6.00 | $5.29 | $4.34 | $5.19|
|RoE | 10% | 11% | 10% | 9% | 11%|

But as you'd expect, banks everywhere in the world are being forced to have more capital and less leverage. So there's like improvement in the return on assets, as capital ratios tick higher.

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Return on Assets | 1.00% | 0.99% | 0.89% | 0.75% | 0.94%|
|Total capital ratio | 15.5% | 15.1% | 13.1% | 14.3% | 15.2%|

## Competition

Unsurprisingly the competition is everyone, according to their 10-K / annual report.

&gt; Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. 

And they think it can only get worse:

&gt; It is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the Firm’s businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the Firm does not provide.

If we look at a few banking ratios, specifically returns, old man Morgan ain't the worst the investment bankers, Citi and BAC get that prize. But the competitors who are lite on investment banking are substantially better, i.e. WFC and USB.

|Companies|Total Capital Ratio|Return of Assets |Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. | 15.5% | 1.00% | 10%
Bank of America Corp |  14.3% | 0.82% | 7%
Citigroup Inc |  16.2% | 0.82% | 7%
Goldman Sachs Group Inc |  17.8% | 0.8% | 9%
Morgan Stanley |  22.0% | 0.7% | 8%
U.S. Bancorp |  13.2% | 1.34% | 13%
Wells Fargo &amp; Co |  16.0% | 1.16% | 14%

# Wall Street thinks?

So, what do the brokers, who don't work at JPM think of them? Well, these navel gazing professionals on Wall Street have a $93.24 target for JPM and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That's despite a pedestrian upside of 7% to their target.

# Valuation

With a forecast 6% yield and a generous buyback program, it's hard to worry about them. And the valuations via PE ratio look bunched.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/jpm/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
JPM | $309,094M | 13x | 6% | 2% | 6%
BAC | $236,557M | 13x | 9% | 2% | 4%
C | $166,556M | 12x | 6% | 1% | 4%
GS | $90,024M | 12x | 12% | 1% | 0%
MS | $80,541M | 13x | 12% | 2% | 2%
USB | $88,403M | 15x | 5% | 2% | 7%
WFC | $274,462M | 13x | 8% | 3% | 5%

But let's raise two flags

* JPM has traded between 9x and 15x earnings
* Today's market value of $309bn is substantially higher than pre-crisis high of $180bn, when the stock price hit $53. i.e. substantially lower than today's price

I just don't get why any financial institution today is worth more that at the top of 2007/2008, when it was the go-go years of finance!

# Dividends
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.08 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.90 per share. That is a 9% growth. 

The forecast dividend of $2.08 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.70. i.e. leaving plenty of room for buyback.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. i.e. the recent 1Q results have left the stock price and fundamentals flat. That's despite the 6th earnings beat in 6 quarters!

To me it keeps like the Trump Runup, with the idea of a looser regulatory straight-jacket is already in the price. Plus the Fed's outlook on increasing rates is also well know. The net effect is that JPM looks like it can add $0.80 to $1.00 to earnings each year. Which clearly benefits the stock.

So, to me it's a solid, quality stock, but hard to see any catalyst that will propel the valuation higher.

personalfinance,Refinancing auto loan,Has anybody ever refinanced an auto loan? We recently bought a used jeep and have a rate of about 3.5%. State Farm who I have insurance through would give us a rate of 3% as well as include gap insurance for free. We currently owe 17k on the grand Cherokee with a value of 26k. Credit score is about 800. I think the interest rate savings would be minimal but BBT doesn't have an automatic payment feature unless you bank with them and that annoys me more than anything. Is there any negatives for refinancing? Any thing that could hurt credit besides them pulling credit scores?,finance
personalfinance,"Based on my rent, income, and quality of life improvements. I'm wanting to buy a home, but I'm also terrified at owing someone money for 30 years. Anyone deal with this?","So when I run the numbers on a modest mortgage decently below the max I can afford. It makes perfect sense to buy a home... yet I'm having a hard time with the thought of owing money for possibly 30 years. 

Quality of Life Upgrades - The homes in my area will offer me a bit more space (don't need too much more because I'm single, Childfree), a yard, a garage, and more freedom from neighbors talking louds, banging on walls, etc. I'll also be able to have the space and no restrictions to get 1-2 large breed pups which I always wanted!

Low Interest Rates and Home a bit below value in my area still - So homes are rising, and I know you can't predict the real estate market, but they still seem to be on the upswing of recovery. I'm worried if I wait 5 years I'll be totally screwed. 

Basically my modest 1 bedroom apartment with garage is costing me $1250 a month. The homes I'm targeting after tax/utility increase/maintence factors, are all ending up on the conservative HIGH side like $1400 a month. They are a SERIOUS quality of life upgrade though, to get hardwood floors or another bedroom in my apartment I'd have to move to a place costing $1500+ a month in my area. Basically it seems to make sense economically and from quality of life.

Also I'm just starting out my career after long time in grad school... So hopefully (can't predict) but I'm literally at the low rung in terms of position and pay. So an investment in a home now would be paid off faster than expected I think. With a home purchase around $160,000 my Debt to income is only 28% with my current salary. 

Anyway... I guess it's less a money question, but anyone struggle with this? Likely I'll pay it off well before 30 years, and enjoy a life of quality living (and finally be able to get that dog!), but the idea of just having that amount of money owed to someone is troublesome.",finance

Does this mean that if my account is hacked --for example, [this scenario](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/03/hackers_fire_up_ss7_flaw/)-- my credit union does not have to cover my loss?

Don't want people who know me to know my business! I'm looking for a little help here please. Long time r/personalfinance lurker; first time poster.

Well after a financial roller coaster through my 20s: college, law school, and having a number of more temporary jobs and living situations, I have FINALLY settled into a place where I have consistent monthly income and expenses. Before, my personal finance strategy was essentially trying to spend less than I took in any given month. It worked, but it made it very difficult to keep to any kind of budget in the spirit of this sub.

For the next year and a half (I'll be working for a judge), my income will be ~$4,000/month post-tax. 

""Hard"" Expenses:

* Rent, inc'l insurance: $1000
* Student loans: $600 minimum (want to be aggressive)
* Fuel and auto insurance: $120 (estimated)
* Food: $200 (estimated)
* Health insurance: $60 (God bless Tricare)

So that leaves me about $1900 to play with for my IRA, 401k, and student loans. 

If my average student loan APR is 5%, what would be the best way to allocate this? (Note: I plan to consolidate my loans into a private loan at a lower rate when I start my permanent job in 1.5 years--unless the Fed goes 1980 on us--but let's keep that discussion out of the scope of this question for now.

Also, does anyone have a good spreadsheet for this? I can't seem to find it in the sidebar.

personalfinance,"Has anyone ever been scammed by a ""federal"" debt collector?","Hi PF!

So a few months back, I received a call in regards to one of my retail credit cards saying that I owe a debt and that legal action will ensue if I do not settle over the phone. I chose to not settle, because I did quick research and most people said that it was a scam.

Fast forward to this morning, I get a phone call to  my workplace saying that I will be served papers, because someone has filed a complaint about me. 

Of course I got scared because she started stating all of the charges which were along the lines of breach of contract, grand theft 3rd degree, and intent of something instrument. When I asked her what does the instrument statement mean, she said she didn't know because she's not an attorney.

She said that a locator or sheriff has already been assigned to my case to deliver my papers to either my workplace or my home address, but we can settle this for the amount of $436.46 or a payment plan which will equal approximately $800 by the end of the 90 days. I asked her if I had a grace period to decide if I want to pay off the settlement amount, and she said no - I needed to decide while on this call what I want to do. I've been working hard on repairing my credit from my stupid younger days and I actually had the capability to pay the $436, but I just didn't get a good feeling from this. Then she said she had to be in court all day, so I couldn't call her back with my answer. With the attitude I sensed in her voice because I was on the phone saying ""uhhhhhh...."" contemplating what I should do, she disrupts my thinking by saying ""Ma'am, I have a high volume of calls today, I need you to decide."" So i just told her I will refuse to pay, and she wished my luck in court with such a *joyous* attitude. 

NOW, I looked at CreditKarma. I do have 3 accounts in open collections but they were all from 2 years ago from medical bills before I got health insurance. I'm working on paying those off.

As for the retail credit card that this call is related to, this is the information that shows up:

personalfinance,Need advice for keeping my 2012 Ford Fusion,"Hi guys,

I definitely fucked up. I haven't been making on time payments to my car loan for my 2012 Ford Fusion and the bank now has threatened repo on it. It is about 120 days past due (I've had a lot of financial problems in the past 6 months) but now I have a good job and I wanted to work them to get the loan back on track. They won't work with me to allow me to catch the payments up and they want either the car back, a  $6500 settlement, or me to go refinance the car through another bank. 

I would like to keep the car. I told them today that since they are not working with me that I will hide the car until I have the $6500 settlement (since they won't wait until I have it). I have budgeted it out and figured out I can have the 6500 on July 1st. 

Most importantly I don't want a repo on my credit report. If I have to give the car up fine. Refinance is not an option because due to the financial distress I've had, my credit took a large dip (489 is my current score) but is it possible to find a creditor that will refinance my car for 6500 with an astronomical interest rate? I could then pay it all off in July to the new creditor.

Selling the car gets complicated. I need to have the right mirror fixed and a new radio put in (I had to sell the dash system that I bought for it because I was running low on cash). The interior is also not in the best shape.

Looking for advice on what to do with the car.",finance

I'm currently cash-out refinancing my 4-Plex which will allow to me take out all of my initial cash I've invested. I'm currently debating whether to pay points (a percentage of the purchase price) to lower my interest rate. Considering I approach all of my investments with FI in mindset, I'd love to get your feedback on which option might be best. 

See the below spreadsheet for the detailed analysis:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIInn6mXx4G3fQE2-K4hRj-YSzDShQ6Qmm-2V1yuc0A/edit?usp=sharing

Investment Stats:

* Initial Purchase Price: $143,500
* Cash Invested: $48,700
* New Appraisal Value: $240,000
* New Loan Amount: $168,000
* New Interested Rate: 5.375%
* Mortgage Payoff: $113,400
* Cash Out Amount: $54,600
* Exit Strategy: I plan to hold this property and never sell

I'm looking at (3) Options. I've calculated the tax adjusted value of paying points (they are tax deductible so 25% discount) and I've also included the opportunity cost of not investing that amount in the market (an expected 7% rate of return) to provide me my true break-even point and my true rate of return -

Option 1: 

* New Interested Rate: 5.125%
* Point payment: $1,050 ($787.50 tax adjusted) 
* Payment Reduction: $300/yr
* Opportunity Cost: $58.31/yr
* True Payment Reduction: $241.69/yr
* True Rate of Return: 30.69%
* True Break Even Point: 3.26 Yrs
* Capital Needed for 4% SWR to provide $241.69: $6,042.36 

Option 2: 

* New Interested Rate: 4.750%
* Point payment: $3,150($2362.50 tax adjusted)
* Payment Reduction: $768/yr
* Opportunity Cost: $177.69/yr
* True Payment Reduction: $590.31/yr
* True Rate of Return: 25.99%
* True Break Even Point: 4 Yrs
* Capital Needed for 4% SWR to provide $590.31/yr: $14,757.64 

Option 3: 

* New Interested Rate: 3.750%
* Point payment: $11,970($8955.50 tax adjusted)
* Payment Reduction: $1,944/yr
* Opportunity Cost: $713.00/yr
* True Payment Reduction: $1231/yr
* True Rate of Return: 13.71%
* True Break Even Point: 7.29 Yrs
* Capital Needed for 4% SWR to provide $590.31/yr: $30,774.90

Disclaimer: I know I'm probably missing a ton of stuff, and I'm not taking account time value of money, but this is just to help me make some comparisons.

As you can see, the capital needed to provide the same 4% SWR dwarfs what I would actually pay to increase my yearly passive income. This leads me to think I should ignore my ""True Rate of Return"" and ""True Break Even"" Metrics and just pay for the lowest interest rate. At first I was partial to the 4.75% interest rate option. What does this community think? I'm hoping one of you guys tell me I'm completely off base and point me in the right direction!

technology,"Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) explains why he recently supported legislation allowing ISPs to sell your private browsing history: ""... because Obama...""","I wrote to my Senator James Inhofe - (R) OKLAHOMA about a month ago.

My message was short and had two main focal points:

1. What the Senator believed the term '**Net Neutrality**' meant.

1. What his reasoning was behind supporting a recent bill that now allows Internet Service Providers to sell private browsing data of their users, and whether he planned to also support legislation making himself exempt from said information sales.

While he did copy and paste the definition of Net Neutrality from Wikipedia, he didn't adequately answer either of my questions.

He gave the following response as of today:

&gt; Dear [Tataku]:
&gt;  
&gt; Thank you for your correspondence regarding net neutrality. As your voice in Washington, I appreciate knowing your views on this important issue.
&gt;  
&gt; Net neutrality regulations are designed to prevent broadband providers from treating various forms of online traffic differently. Many Internet companies feel strongly that Internet service providers should be required to treat all online traffic equally. They believe that without regulation, Internet service providers could charge an unreasonable amount of money for priority Internet access, resulting in higher prices, variable service delivery and a decrease in choice for the consumer.
&gt;  
&gt; On the other hand, most Internet service providers argue that it is necessary for them to be able to set a fair market price for different types of online traffic. For example, applications like digital video and online gaming require a greater amount of bandwidth capacity than more basic online functions, like email. Internet service providers contend that it must prioritize the more complex programs to invest in the expansion of Internet infrastructure necessary for all Internet traffic to run smoothly. They also say that the telecommunications industry can operate more effectively and efficiently in a private realm compared to one that is stifled by government regulation. I agree with this perspective, and that is why I joined 36 of my colleagues in 2010 to send a letter to then-Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Julius Genachowski expressing continued concern with any regulation of the Internet.
&gt;  
&gt; In 2011, the FCC released three basic rules for an “Open Internet.”  According to the FCC, broadband providers are required to guarantee transparency of network management practices, to ensure no lawful content, applications or services are blocked, and to prevent any unreasonable discrimination in the transmission of lawful network traffic.  On January 14, 2014, a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down those rules, determining that, while the FCC has the power to oversee the Internet, it has no authority to impose regulations on Internet service providers as they are not identified as ""common carriers.""  In May 2014, the FCC voted 3-2 to open the discussion of regulating paid prioritization, reasserting its unauthorized power to regulate the Internet and potentially change the way the entire information highway operates.
&gt;  
&gt;**At its core, the debate surrounding net neutrality is a question of whether the FCC should maintain the classification of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as information services or reclassify ISPs as telecommunication services.  President Obama, in November 2014, called for the latter, and then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler put forth a new plan that aligned with this position.  On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted 3-2, along party lines, to adopt this plan.  On June 12, 2015, the new open Internet rules went into effect, which essentially gives unelected officials at the FCC broad, regulatory authority over the Internet.**  
&gt;  
&gt; The Internet has come a long way, in a short amount of time, without federal bureaucratic regulations.  **It was unfortunate the FCC took the Internet in this direction.** **I am pleased the new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is committed to an open and free internet and has already taken steps to reverse the FCC’s net neutrality actions.**  I also support his goal to increase broadband deployment and his move to **make the FCC more transparent and accountable to the public.**  As a new member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, I look forward to working with Committee Chairman Thune, as we continue to conduct congressional oversight of the FCC and to develop legislative solutions to protect the Internet.
&gt;  
&gt;   Thank you for taking the time to contact me about this issue.  If you are interested in keeping up with my activity in the Senate, I encourage you to sign up for my online newsletter by visiting http://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsletter/sign-up.

stocks,Is Canada destined to be an underperformer on world markets for the foreseeable future?,"At the end of every calendar year I write a blog on an non-investment related topic that ties into investing in some way. For example, I’ve written on the concept of personal diligence vs. buying a mutual fund—and compared that to shifting your own gears in a car vs. having an automatic transmission. I’ve written on the comparatives between athletic discipline and trading discipline.
The year-end blog that received the most comments, most viewings, and perhaps the most controversy was my 2015 blog entitled “Some pigs are more equal than others”. I’m sure many of you will recall that blog. Unfortunately, it can’t be seen any longer as we can only store about a year’s worth of blogs on this site.
But the concept that I wrote about was this:
Canada is destined to be an underperformer on world markets due to: low commodity prices for the foreseeable future, record high personal per capita debt, and a new socialist government with a tax n’ spend philosophy and arguably the least qualified leader in our history. As our rather inexperienced leader follows his father’s footsteps, TD Bank has forecast that Ottawa is headed for $150B in deficits over next 5 years.
Ironically, asked, after leaving office, if he had any regrets, Pierre Trudeau said yes – he wished he had paid more attention to the economy….sigh!

 
I noted on that 2015 blog that I thought you might see the TSX rise to its old highs (technical resistance).  I presented that level as my ultimate target. I was right. I suggested that the bigger picture from there was bleak for the TSX, and the Canadian economy.
Gosh, it sucks to be right.
The TSX, as noted above, has rallied to its old highs per my target of 2 years ago. And now, the index appears to be struggling right on schedule. Meanwhile, as suggested on the blog, the picture is growing bleaker for the economy. Rather than pretend to be an economist, I thought I would quote one of my favorite research analyst—Larry McDonald. I’ve subscribed to his research for some time now, and will say that his work is more often right than wrong. So I tend to listen when he speaks. I recommend that readers interested in his research check his website and determine if its suitable for your own needs.
Here are two thoughts out of his most recent report on Canada’s outlook:
 

 
 
Potential trade wars only enhance the bear case for the loonie.
“The United States is prepared to kill the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if renegotiation efforts don’t result in a better deal for the USA, President Donald Trump said on Sunday. Trump insisted that he was going to terminate the agreement, which links the U.S. to Canada and Mexico, before having a change of heart when the leaders of both countries reached out to him.Last week, shortly after announcing a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber in response to perceived unfair trade practices by Canada on dairy products, the White House announced it is considering an executive order that would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) under Section 2205 of the agreement. The Administration’s recent moves on trade have blindsided those on Capitol Hill who thought Trump had moved in a more moderate direction and would instead notify Congress of an intent to renegotiate the trade agreement under Section 2202. White House sources, however, have stated that no decision has been made.After strained relations with Mexico since Trump’s candidacy, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said last week was “a bad week for U.S. Canada trade relations.” But the news out of the White House cannot be ignored,  especially given that much of Trump’s legislative agenda has stalled. Withdrawal from NAFTA can be undertaken by the President unilaterally.”
 
Larry goes on to note the yearly trend for Canadian per capital debt vs. GDP, and it ain’t pretty:
Canada Private Debt to GDP
2017: 261%
2010: 223%
2005: 181%
2000: 186%
Source–OECD Data
 
Says Larry:
“Canadians have become ever more addicted to sub-prime mortgage borrowing, and it has become a major driver of the Toronto housing market – Home Capital Group’s home headquarters.
Canadian equities look to be facing a triple whammy, as we listed above. What amplifies this problem for Canada is that all of these issues are hitting them head on. The housing bubble is beginning to leak out with big mortgage lenders facing runs, oil has been weakening over the past couple of months which takes their currency lower, and now a trade war with the U.S. is looking dangerous. Equities in Canada have been trading higher this as many of the headline economic indicators such as retail sales and manufacturing growth have turned higher, if that begins to turn as oil and housing falter, equites will respond. Canadian equities look ready to break this recent uptrend as these three things come to a head.  Bottom line: Canadian equities trade just under 17x forward price to earnings and a 2.9% forward dividend.  A forward price to book of 1.78x and a 10.72 forward ROE, they should bounce here but are a SELL on any rally.  
As Canadian exports have become increasingly dependent on oil, the Canadian dollar has traded very close to how oil prices fluctuate. Oil looks to be under structural pressure again as OPEC has not come to an output cut extension yet and U.S. production has soared back to over 9 million barrels a day. Canadian producers also have lower costs, like many U.S. producers, which means they can stay competitive in a lower price environment. However, a big drop in oil revenue will have a big effect on the Canadian economy, both in terms of wages and profits. What makes this worse is that a decline in oil prices would be happening at the same time they are dealing with trade restrictions from the U.S. and a subprime housing bubble mess. 
The divergence in yields in Canada vs. the U.S. tells you what the bond market thinks about the respective economies. Rates are telling you U.S. growth will outperform Canadian growth as the spread between their respective ten year’s, is at its wide for the year. Another aspect playing into this equation is the respective central bank policy actions taking place in the two countries. In Canada, the BoC has struggled to get rates away from zero as the economy has become so levered. In the U.S. the Fed is on a path to hike rates at least one more time this year, and two more times if you listen to FOMC dots forecasts. The market is pricing in a 75bp or greater differential in overnight rates for these two countries by year end, this is will also lead to weakness in the currency. With their overnight rate (Fed Funds equivalent) down at 0.5% for nearly two years, Canada’s growth track has continued to fall behind G8 peers (U.S. / Germany).  The IMF sees Canada’s GDP at1.9% in 2017 and 2% in 2018. While inflation is at 1.6% year over year today, and expected to be moving along near 2% over the next 18 months. Canada is still running a current account deficit of GDP at around 4% to GDP, while real interest rates are well into negative territory.”
Here’s a chart that I have posted before–note the declining trend channel:

 
 
2. The Canadian economy is likely in recession or very close to one.  
Larry provides some insight into Canada’s economic growth – or lack of it:
“Private debt/GDP is over 250%, personal leverage is over 100%, and government debt/GDP is over 90%. Canada is a highly levered economy with two main engines of growth, services and oil. While oil has traded weaker in recent months, it is not in the same situation it was in 2015. If oil is to return to levels that cause serious pain for domestic producers, the economy will deteriorate. I housing is cracking, and we think it is, the amount of defaults and charge offs will rise, the economy will be holding a lot of bad loans that will have serious deflationary spillovers. 
 
The big problem the BoC has had is that like many central banks around the world, they are in this catch 22 type dilemma. As oil recovered since 2015, they would like to move rates higher but since the economy has levered up with household debt/incomes over 165% and so much money tied to low rates for housing, there is nowhere for them to go. In theory, there will be a need for BoC to cut rates and ease, but that only encourages a bigger buildup in the debt profile. They look stuck until real estate completely falls down, in that case they would need to step in with liquidity. In their April monetary policy update, the Bank of Canada discussed economic downside of a rise in trade protectionism.  They did not come up with data projections, but did suggest that prolonged elevated trade uncertainty could also undermine growth.”

personalfinance,Concerns Refinancing Student Loans,"I have a large amount of student loans, about 144k and my wife has about 13k left. I have refinanced my largest loan now approx. 75k twice, and considering refinancing for cash flow purposes. We live on a fairly tight budget, with our total debt around 165k we pay just under $1700 a month.  The link below is our standard budget we follow it pretty close. As you can see our cash flow is tight and we only save when we have extra income. As much as I hate to do it I am considering refinancing for an average of 1.5% higher interest rate and more time to pay off to help ease our cash flow issue. Thoughts and ideas welcome!

personalfinance,Collection agency is making it impossible for me to resolve a debt. Trying to buy a home and this 1 blemish is killing me!,"35yo. My base salary is $52k. Additionally, I receive quarterly bonuses of roughly $5k.
Apart from my student loans, I have very little debt. Credit cards are all paid down to zero. Vehicle is through my company ($250 per month, interest-free loan for $27k. It doesn't show on my credit as it was purchased through my company and ""financed"" through them.) 
I have about $60k in student fed student loans - payment history was a little rocky a few years ago when they came out of deferment, but payment history has been solid now for a few years.

So, my FICO score is only 610 - ""why"", you ask? Well, there are some past blips  - 2 paid collections from medical bills (marked as paid in full on my credit reports). 
Then there is the big one - the main reason I'm asking for advice:

In addition to my federal loans, I took out 2 private education loans to pay for school: 1 for about $15k and the other for about $25k. My father co-signed on these because I did not have much credit at the time.
When I finished school, these were the first to come out of deferment and because my dad had co-signed, I was especially attentive to paying them. So, I had a perfect payment history for several months; then, one day my autopay didn't come out of my bank. I called and the number was no good. I believe a letter came to my parents house shortly after this (I don't have it and didn't see it - my mother read it to me over the phone). I dont recall exactly what it said (this was nearly 10 years ago), but it was something to the effect of, ""we are going tits up - your debt is being transferred. Chill out while we figure this whole thing out. We'll let you know when/who to pay). After that I heard nothing for literally years. Later I saw that they were one of the companies that was swept up in one of those predatory lending lawsuits. I naively thought I had lucked out and it had all disappeared. Anyways, a year or so later, a letter shows up at my parents house saying something to the effect of, your debt was reassigned to some subsidiary of the lender (it even had the same name as the original lender). Your payments have been reinstated. You are 30 days past due. You have defaulted on your loan. This debt is charged off. Fuck you - thank you for playing. I REALLY wish I had this letter; my mother lost it. She said it listed all my past payments and then showed the due date for a new payment and a little note saying that 30 days had gone by and I hadn't made the payment. It was unreal. Anyways, it sucks, but that was the end of it. UNTIL, about a year later. The debt has been sold as junk debt to collection agency. When I spoke with them, I said that I would be happy to pay it, I just needed to get setup on a payment plan. ""We don't do payments. Give us $40,000.00."" Ok, I obviously dont have that  - but I can pay a couple hundred per month. They said, ""I can take your money if you want, but its not going to stop the calls, we will continue to report you and your father for the outstanding debt, and we will not report that you are making any efforts to pay this debt to the credit bureau.""

I went round and round with different ""supervisors for over an hour and they all said the same thing: ""we don't do payments like that. If you want to do payments, we can do 4 payments for $10,000 each.""
Eventually I hung up and never answered the call again. They call maybe a couple times a year. I was planning to wait until the SOL ran out (at 5 years now), but when I pulled my credit, I saw that they had re-posted it with a start date of Dec 2016. Dad doesn't want to have anything to do with it. He said its my problem and I need to deal with it - I agree and I feel bad about how its affected him; but, I don't really know what to do about it at this point.

Now, I'm trying to buy a house -I decide to sit down with a lender to see how this all effects me. I have the down payment, I have the income and he said they wouldn't even care about the $40k default - they would still lend to me. BUT, he said there is no way in the world I will get the PMI with that on my credit. So, I have to come up with 20% down on a home in order to buy anything because no underwriter will take a risk on me with a $40k charge-off on my credit.

He said I have 2 options: 1  - try and depute the debt. I don't think that makes sense. I have no documentation for my story and I KNOW the debt is mine. It would just be a waste of time. 2 - He said I can try to get a contract drawn up with the collection agency to see if they will be willing to take payments and report it monthly to the bureaus so that the underwriters can see that I am trying to resolve the debt. I'd also be open to a settlement - I could come up with maybe $10k or so. But, these guys have been completely unreasonable in working with me in the past and I think its because they can see I have a co-signer with lots of money and assets; so, at the end of the day, they can always try to sue for it. What are my options here?",finance

I'm 29 years old. I'm working a part time job with essentially full time hours. I'm renting a townhouse with girlfriend, no plans to marry anytime soon. I'm making around $10 an hour at a job that I don't plan on keeping forever. 

I have two credit cards, one with $400~ on it out of a $750 limit(24.99% interest rate). One with a $2,000 limit on it with 0 balance(0% interest for 14months, 18% after). 

I don't really have any outstanding debt aside from this $400~ on any cards. I owe my mother $500 and I have a few hundred on girlfriend's credit card for a trip we're taking next year. All in all I'd say that I owe around $1500 with all of this, with only $500 of it having any sort of interest.

I make around $1100-1250 a month before taxes. Probably closer to $1000 after taxes come out. I'm mostly looking for any sort of website to help me plan, and track an appropriate way of handling my money and whatnot, if there even is such a thing. 

I've tried looking at apps to see if there's anything that suits what I'm looking for and I don't really know if there is anything that fits what I'm trying to ask.

On my standard 40hr week, I make less than 30k/yr and I live near Chicago (finding an apartment on that income is difficult). Right now I have health insurance through my employer, but I may change employers soon and with the recent changes in US federal healthcare programs, I don't even know if my employer will continue to offer worthwhile (or any) coverage. To top it off, programs like medicaid are at risk of not being worth much by the time I retire and need medical care (I am a welder, I will need something by then).

Rather than just complain about it, though, I plan to move forward and solidify my own personal finances to help afford healthcare independently if need be. Only problem is, I come from a family whose teachings on finances include ""save money"" and nothing else. That's not very helpful and I have no personal connections to help me find the best way to put money away, invest it, or spend it on insurance. In short, my family is financially illiterate and so am I.

**So what should I look at for insuring myself against crippling medical expenses in the future?** Invest money? Save it under a mattress? Buy individual insurance when my employer doesn't offer any?

*On an opinionated note: I wonder what is expected of the millions of people like myself from financially illiterate homes who don't think to seek this kind of education.

personalfinance,Banking: Ally vs Discover vs Capital One,"I'm about to enter the real world and I'm not too happy with my current bank. I'm looking to move to one of these, but I'm having trouble choosing (don't think I can go wrong, though).

**Ally:** Pretty good all-around, well-regarded on this subreddit. 0.85% and 1.05% APY rates for money market and savings accounts, respectively. Has a 0.60% rate for checking if you have over 10k in it, but I'm not sure if I would ever really need that much in a checking account if I was also using a money market or savings account. Money market account reimburses up to $10/month for ATM fees.

**Discover:** Has a 0.85% rate on money market, increasing to 0.90% with over 100k (don't know if that would ever be useful, though). 1.01% on the savings account. The checking account offers a unique deal where you get 10 cents each time you use the debit card (up to $10/month), but has no interest rate. There's also a promotion for Discover where I can get $100 if I fund it with $15k by mid-June, which I can do. Another plus is that I recently applied for a Discover It credit card, so it would be convenient to use one account for my bank and card.

**Capital One:** Decent rates all around. Checking account has a base 0.20% rate and increases up to 0.90% at high balances, but I doubt I would reach those balances in a checking account (second tier is at $50k). The money market rate is surprising high at 1% with over $10k in the account, while the savings account is somehow lower (not sure why) at 0.75%.

I feel like a money market account with a small side checking account should suit my needs, though I'm not too knowledgeable about how much I should store in the bank relative to investments, and how much should go in each account. Maybe like $5k in checking and $30k in a money market? Would a S&amp;P fund like VFIAX be good for the rest of my savings, not counting riskier investments?

Capital One seems best because of the high money market rate. I don't see a reason to have a savings account when the money market rate is so close. The Discover checking cash back seems cool, but I don't think I would get a ton out of it since it only breaks even with my credit card cash back for purchases under $5. I'm sure a lot of you guys have experience with these banks though, so I'm curious to hear your advice.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on sale of rental property worth more than expected.,"Asking this on behalf of my parents who are facing an unexpected but rather nice challenge.

**TL;DR** Parents business property is worth 2.5x what they thought and need to figure out what to do with the money.

**Background:**
My parents are a hard working couple who own a small business and recently found out their property, that they bought for $1 million about a decade ago is now worth $2.5 million. Before finding this out they were considering downsizing into a smaller rental property but thought the property was only worth $1 million (just recovering from the 2008 crash) and wanted to hold it. Besides this property, their home, and their business, they don't have many investments and they see this sale as a potential vehicle to retirement.

**Information:**

* Property was purchased for $1 million.
* Still have ~$700k on this property's mortgage
* Real estate agent said $2.5 million should be a safe bet (these properties are in high demand I guess)
* Also have a ~$100k loan at ~3% interest rate with friend.
* Capital gains are roughly 35% here (US west coast)
* 
* Personal home mortgage still has quite a bit left on it/

**Decisions and Advice**

They have a couple options:

1.  Make use of 1031 and buy rental homes to use for monthly income. This allows for them to defer taxes until a future time (if ever?).

2. Take the cash, pay capital gains, and invest it for a decade or so and pull from it for retirement.

Thoughts? Ways to make the most of this? Considerations to take into account? I know there are probably a lot of things I am missing here so feel free to add comments and I will try to respond.

So I've got about 70k in student loan debt from both undergrad/and grad school.  I'm not too worried about the 50k in fedloans as I am on IBR/PSLF and my remaining balance should be forgiven in about 8 years.  I have a pretty stable job at a university making mid-40's. 

20k happens to be in private student loans so no options there but just pay it off.  If I continue with the standard repayment I'm looking at like $240 a month for about 4 more years.  About a ~4% interest rate.

After accounting for 3 months of 'emergency savings', I have about 14k left to play with (savings from busting my butt working multiple jobs the last cpl years).  I am trying to decide if I should just throw all of this money at the private loan or put all/some towards saving for a home down payment.  

I want to get rid of what debt I can on one hand but I also understand the benefits of owning rather than renting.  My current lease is up in 10 months and I live in a growing city where the housing costs, both mortgages and rents are gonna continue to spiral upward.  Its an affordableish city right now but a very popular destination for people to move to.  I fear if I push owning for a few more years the housing market is going to be much more expensive.

I estimate a down payment and closing costs on a suitable home in my area to be around 20k-30k, if I don't go FHA route.

I just don't really know what I should be prioritizing here? Pay down debt or invest in a home? I am saving a good amount for retirement already with employer matched 401k.

Getting a side hustle again is always an option for me to make more, as long as I stay in an income bracket that maintains my IBR/PSLF plan.

btc,PSA: Blockstream conspiring takeover of bitcoin in-conjunction with the government,"I worked as an IT specialist for a government contractor. I have decided it is now time to come out of the closet. The world needs to know what I have witnessed. During my 4 year assignment I have had access to many secret documents detailing classified projects and operations. One particularly caught my eye with the title ""Operation BlockRiver"" reason this caught my eye because the front page mentioned multiple times ""bitcoin"" and ""BlockStream"". I have contacted a couple journalists which will release full disclosure of documents within next couple weeks. Basically in a summary Operation BlockRiver is an operation conducted by an arm of the FFARARC Federal Financial and Asset Risk Assessment Regulatory Commision which is an agency of the Federal Government. FFARARC back in 2014 recognized emerging technologies as a threat to the power of the current banking systems and government and the stability of their power, in the words of FFARARC from the document 

    ""with the emergence of new technologies, particularly crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin these new alternatives to the current financial sector is a threat to the regulatory abilities of FFARARC and other branches of the federal US government as a whole. We must seek to discreetly guide this movement and control the direction of this technology""

They then go on to explain how they created Operation BlockRiver in which they established a shell company called ""BlockStream"". After further digging I found out that the board of commision for Operation BlockRiver have many ties to the elite banking system and the bilderberg group. The whole idea of BlockRiver was to discreetly hijack the bitcoin project early on then to slowly take over bitcoin. BlockRiver plans to do this through many means. Some of the methods include sneaking backdoors into the most popular bitcoin client Core which is easy because core is closed source, even if you compile the ""open source"" source code this backdoor is so well hidden that it polymorphs during a self extraction stage when compiling so it can go un-noticed. Eventually these backdoors in core will be used to siphon peoples bitcoin to fund BlockRiver but it will be disguised as a ""user error"", this is what happened to Mt Gox, Mt. Gox was a test run. Mt. Gox was then blackmailed or convinced to blame it on ""malleability"". Segwit will make these sorts of attacks easier and MUST be stopped at all costs. Another purpose for segwit is to make it so hard to run a full node that only a few companies will have enough resources to run a full node. By making it hard to run a full node they can centralize the bitcoin network, coincidentally Bitcoin Core LLC a child company of blockstream happens to be one of those companies whom run a node though they might deny it now knowing that we know their real agenda. If dont believe me I can show evidence where the bitcoin core devs admit they run a full node. I then dug deeper into Operation BlockRiver and found out that one of the board of directors on blockstream is also on the payroll of the Federal Reserve. This alone should raise much suspicion.

personalfinance,Looking for Student Loan Payoff Advice,"Alright, so I have come here today asking for your assistance in how to best approach my student loan situation. Its far less intimidating than the majority of what we see here, but I'm figuring objective viewpoints can only help me look at it in a better way. Forgive me for the potentially horrid formatting, I'm trying.

I net ~$2700 monthly (24 annual pay periods). Conservative monthly expenses are ~$1300 (THIS INCLUDES MIN-PAYMENT). BUT - this was a few months ago and of course circumstances have changed a bit in all directions (but that is a-whole-notha-level post with a budget flair). 

&amp;nbsp;

The low-down on the Loans:

&amp;nbsp;

ACS Loan Servicing:
**Federal Perkins Student Loan**
 * $1,416.23 @ 5.0% - Quarterly Minimum, $120.00
 * Im fairly certain the interest schedule on this loan is better than my other loans, but i can be wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nelnet Student Loans:
**Group A**
 * Direct Subsidized - two loans (equal amounts)
 * *Total* $4,102.43 @ 3.86% - Monthly Minimum, $46.22

&amp;nbsp;

**Group B**
* Direct Unsubsidized - two loans (equal amounts)
* *Total* $1,914.02 @ 3.86% - Monthly Minimum, $21.45

&amp;nbsp;

**Group C**
* Direct Subsidized - 1 loan
* *Total* $4821.86 @ 4.660% - Monthly Minimum, $57.55

&amp;nbsp;

**Nelnet Total**
* $10,838.31 - Monthly Minimum, $125.22

&amp;nbsp;

As you see, I am in a pretty good position. These are not intimidating amounts and for that I am lucky. I would appreciate any and all advice on best ways to tackle this! Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,I'm not sure I understand how my auto loan payments are being allocated,"I took a 5 year loan out for a car in the amount of $12,422 with an interest rate of 3.99%.

I've made 2 payments so far on it, each for $250 even though my minimum payment for the vehicle is $228.93.

When I look at the history, I see that $85.02 is my interest paid year-to-date and I have a principal balance of $12,007.02. My estimated payoff amount is $12,012.27.

I think what I'm having trouble understanding is how my payment is being allocated. My original goal was to make additional payments so that I could have the car paid off within 3-4 years and thus paying less in interest. Judging by what I'm currently paying (which is $250) it seems $42 of that goes to interest so I'm a bit confused.

What would I have to pay if I wanted to have the car paid off in say 3 years or 4 years as opposed to the original 5 year loan I signed up for?",finance

I have gone to credit unions and multiple banks trying to get a best rate. 

One of the best interest rates given was 7.45% Variable Rate or 8.86% Fixed Rate over the length of the term (I'm looking at a 3 year term). Although the difference per month on those two rates is about $18 /mo, I know variable rate can increase at no notice and maybe end up more than the fixed rate. However, looking at previous historical data it shows prime rate has been the same over 4 years and bank rates only increased once ( by 1% ) after remaining the same for 2 years. 

SO believes Fixed Rate is the best option, for the stability. I'm torn between Variable and Fixed, to me it seems Variable would save me the most but then again the interest rate might increase rendering the benefit of it null.

My rent is 1200$ a month, car is 300$, insurance is 200$. I was making enough before to afford that (well okay, I mean... not really - I have no emergency fund) . I owe 15k on my car, KBB value is around 11k. (I bought a $4k warranty that is transferable, so that should help with the value.) 

Rent was due on the 1st but because I've missed so much work, I have exactly 698$ in my bank account. I'm going to ask my Mom if she can help with the rent but that doesn't help me going forward. 

I just applied for unemployment benefits and I'm about to apply for SNAP. I can't really sell my car because I need one to get to interviews but damn if I wouldn't love a cheaper one...

My boyfriend has been unemployed for 6 months now, he has been dealing with a lot of mental issues. He is months behind on his car payment and insurance, I'm probably 2 months behind on mine now.

personalfinance,Funding College Application without Federal Loan or Scholarship (Germany),"For my studies at Cambridge, I will be expected to pay around 30,000  GBP in tuition for three years and I plan to cover it by a federal student loan offered by the UK government. Repayment will be based on my future income.

To cover the living costs of about 45,000 GBP for three years, I might have to take out an additional loan. I have sufficient funding for the first year, but I am missing about 20,000 GBP for my second and third year (10,000 per year).

I looked into the popular student loans and government subsidized loans but they do not apply to me. I will be studying abroad in UK and not at home in Germany. I have to show full proof of funding by August and taking out a federal loan is only possible after the third term, i.e. too late. Similarly I have not found a private student loan that I can apply for early enough. 

What do I have to look at if I want to take out a normal loan (not a student loan) to cover expenses two or three years from now? In my mind it totally does not make any sense because repayment would start immediately and not after three years.

What alternative funding methods are there (other than the obvious scholarships having deadlines too late to have all funding ready by August)? How did you find funding and what should you have rather not done? What should I avoid at all cost?

To cover my second and third year, I was thinking of finding a guarantor and to simply apply for scholarships, loans, work and do everything that seems possible in my first and second year. But I do not know anyone with 20,000 in savings willing to cover me. What are good ways to find a private sponsor/guarantor outside the family? What should I avoid?

**Some personal and family information:** 25 years old, no savings (just finished high school, went back in 2014 and used up all my savings to cover it), working class family (maximum my family can contribute is 2-3,000 per year), chance to get a bursary/grant of about 3,500 per year.

**TL;DR:** I have to show proof of full funding for my second and third year before my first year starts. I have no idea how and want to avoid any pitfalls.

personalfinance,What to do with pension contributions now that I'm leaving CalPERS?,"Hey folks! 

I am by no means a personal finance expert, and this question may seem naive, but I am wondering what to do with my pension contributions, as I will be leaving the CalPERS pension system before I vest, and do not anticipate working for CalPERS again any time in the forseeable future.

About me: 27, graduated college at 25, currently working full time as a lab tech at a Cal State University on a 9-month maternity leave replacement.  My current job ends in two weeks, then I'll be working ten weeks as a lab tech without benefits, then starting a fully-benefited year-long fellowship in NYC earning considerably more than I do now.  

I will have paid a little more than $2000 into the CalPERS retirement system by the time I separate.  This is the only money I have saved for retirement.  I have ~$39,000 in student loans and no other debt (no credit card debt, no auto loan, etc.)  It takes 5 years to vest, and as I'm leaving the state of California I doubt I'll wind up working for a CalPERS employer again.  I was told by a representative for the pension plan on the phone today that I have three options for what to do with this money:

1. Keep it in the CalPERS pension system and withdraw it after the age of 59.  I was told that it earns ""about 6% per year"" in the CalPERS system.

2. Withdraw it now, and pay 20% Federal Taxes, 2% State Taxes, and a 10% penalty for withdrawing before the age of 59.

3. Roll it over into an IRA to avoid taxes and penalty.

As I am saving for an expensive move to Manhattan, it would be nice to have that extra cash, but I've already saved &gt;$5000 for the move and don't, strictly speaking, need the extra money.  Plus, losing ~$700 to taxes and fees doesn't sit right to me.  So my question is: do I roll it over into an IRA, or do I leave it in the CalPERS system, at least for now?

personalfinance,Should I finance a private healthcare treatment or pay for it in cash? (CAN),"Hi everyone, thank you very much for taking the time to help me.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I am considering a private health care treatment and I'm not sure if it is smarter to pay for it in full with cash or to finance it.

&amp;nbsp;

The cost of the treatment is $14,950 (not sure if HST [13% tax] applies to this or not).

&amp;nbsp;

I have the money to pay for it but I would have to cash in some investments.  My investments are managed professionally, mostly mutual funds and whatever else comprises a conservative diversified portfolio.  There is close to $75k in these investments, $7k of which is cash.  I'm not sure what interest rate I'm earning here so I guess we should assume an average ROI for a conservative portfolio.

&amp;nbsp;

The financing option is open-term, 7.99% annually, minimum monthly payment of $230 with a maximum term of 120 months.  It also requires a cosignor (because I must leave work to partake in it) which I don't have at the moment, but that's a minor detail.

&amp;nbsp;

How do I analyze this problem? I would like to know which option is better and how that conclusion was arrived at (so I know for future situations).

personalfinance,Pay off debt or invest?,"Hey there,

I currently have roughly 30k in debt, and another 30k after i finish college next year (parents helped with half of it). This debt I believe has an interest rate of a little over 5%. Also my parents right now are making payments on the interest that the debt is accruing, but not paying my part down. Now this summer I'm working while living at home so I have no overhead. My question is if it's better to invest the money I make this summer in an index fund and to sit on it for the next 40-50 years or if paying off my debt would have a better ROI.

personalfinance,The Student Loan Debt Swap,"I'm currently in school, so my loans are in deferral.  

This summer, I'm taking 3 classes, but I'm paying the bill myself.  However, I was still offered loans for the summer.  I can either accept or decline them, so I was going to just decline because I don't really want more debt, at least not until the fall.

But then it hit me...the loans I was offered are at a ~4% interest rate, and I have old loans from years ago at 6.8%.  If you have federal loans, you know that your total balance is split up into a bunch of tranches (slices) for each semester, in like $2,500-$5,000 blocks.  The sum total of the loans gives you the weighted average interest rate.

So instead of declining the loans, I'm going to take them, and pay off two of the blocks at 6.8% with the money, thereby saving interest and lowering my average interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,First time home buyer and running into complications with timing my closing date!,"First time home buyer here!

I have signed a purchase contract for a small single family home, for $109,000. My closing costs are estimated at around 5 grand, though the seller has agreed to cover about $1300. For my own estimates I count $5000 anticipating other costs. I will spend $29,000 on the down payment, and will receive an additional $15,000 as a silent second lien (5years) from an assistance program. 

**Complications:**

This program has a lot of applicants and its first come, first serve. They've estimated I will receive the down payment assistance by June 29. My purchase contract however has me scheduled to close June 15. I am quite nervous now about the possible delays pissing off the seller, as he obviously wants to close quickly, and has had two other offers at 109k.

**How screwed am I here? What if the seller demands I close by the 15th or else he doesn't sell?** $15,000 is a good chunk of money at this price range, I desperately need those two weeks to get it.

Background information:

20(single), self employed LMT and employed part time, pay is service based commission. My business brings in $1000-1500/month, and my biweekly paychecks from work range $550-750 (about $1000-1500/month as well). I've had my business for two years, and this job for one, and I only work about four half-days a week. Annual take home pay after taxes and accounting for seasonal fluctuations: $28k-30k. 

My only debt is my student loan, currently less than $4000 at under 4% interest rate, min payment 50, I pay $100/month to pay off in 3.5 years.

Current assets about $52,000 some being in the bank, some in cash. Actually, we've just opened escrow so that is $5000 less. I have not started a 401k or IRA (I know, I know). My work requires me to be 21 to get their 401k matching benefits as well as a certain amount of time employed, so I've been focusing on saving the money for this down payment. 

The idea is my loan is $65,000 at 4.25% (this is locked in). Monthly principle and interest $319, property tax and homeowners insurance $133.. looking at a monthly payment of $450. 

Take a lower estimate of my monthly income at $2200, my usual expenses and bills come in at about 650, leaves $1100 I'm at 50% savings. And I can probably do better than that if I work more. I can set aside $500 a month to make extra payments towards my principle and pay this house off in less than 7 years. Right? I mean, **am I on the right track here?**

If I do close in June, I should be left with about $20,000 give or take, which would still be savings for now. What do I do next?",finance

Majored in English (yeah yeah), applied for any proofreading, writing and editing jobs that I come across, receive no response. I'm fed up and am no longer wanting to pursue that line of work, so I will look elsewhere, even if it means doing online microwork for meager pay.

However, today I pooled the resouces my wife and I have saved up, and we could just about afford buying a house of the same amount outright if I sold all my retirement accounts and investments. That would save a ton on interest, and keep me debt-free as I am today. That's enticing.

That said, it seems like a risky endeavor, even if the house I buy is basically a guaranteed good investment based on its location. Not having a retirement fund gives me the willies, and while I would invest most of my paycheck afterwards (probably in an index fund with Vanguard or something) and it would ramp up quickly, along with my 401k, it still feels risky. My taxes for 2017 would absolutely rape me (but by April 2018, I'd have enough money to pay it off).

What are the thoughts here? The interest rate I've been quoted on a loan is 3.875%, so I figure if my investments have a larger rate of return, I might as well just take the loan.

I have the following loans:

- $2,750.00   4.290%
- $2,750.00   3.760%

From what you guys have told others to do is to pay the high interest ones first which is what I intend to do.

By default the system will ""Once scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, excess will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time."" The other option is that I can allocate it myself.

I would like your opinions on the allocation and if I should stick to the standard they recommend or use a custom one.

personalfinance,"I got a large tax return and tried to adjust my W4 to bring me closer to my actual tax liability. The changes took according to my pay stub but my taxes, deductions, and net pay are all basically the same. What did I do wrong?","Disclaimer: PF n00b here.  When I got my tax return this year it was about $2000 (appx. $1300 federal and $700 CA state).  Since I've been browsing PF I realized for the first time that this is basically money I'm not getting throughout the year (""interest free loan to the government"" and whatnot) so I tried to adjust my pay forms to bring me closer to my actual tax liability.


When I started this is how my W4 looked (I'm 23 and single btw).  Federal Withholding Elections: Status, Single; Exemptions, 1; Additional Withholding, $20.  The additional withholding I had just done sort of ""blindly"" because that's how my mom always did my taxes, to maximize returns, although now I realize that especially with such a large return that was unnecessary.  I also had $20 withheld for the CA state tax.


Last week I changed to 2 exemptions, and brought the additional withholding down to $10 (I thought I would see a significant change in my take home and then depending on how much closer that brought me to my tax liability so I left $10 as a buffer with plans to remove or increase based on how much more I got back).  The change is reflected on my pay stub information but all of the dollar amounts are still basically the same.  Here are the numbers:


Most recent pay stub, with elections changed:
(FWIW this includes 1 hour of OT, about an extra $33 in my gross)

Gross Earnings: 1,794.12	

Total Taxes: 433.73	

Total Deductions: 107.65	

Net Pay: 1,252.74


Pay stub from three pay periods ago (I did not use my two previous because I worked a lot of OT and I don't want those numbers to throw this off):

Gross Earnings: 1,739.61	

Total Taxes: 453.48

Total Deductions: 104.38	

Net Pay: 1,181.75


So only about a $20 difference in the taxes deducted which I'm attributing to me lowering both $20 additional withholdings to $10.  What did I do wrong?  I can see a small jump in my net pay but it doesn't seem to be attributed to the tax thing.  $2000 / 12 = ~$160 so I figured I should be able to get about that much more in each paycheck but I clearly don't know what I'm doing....any help would be appreciated!

My job dissolved my position today. I got one paycheck of severance and two months of benefits. After I crunched the numbers, I came to the cold realization that even if I get the max amount of unemployment, it won't cover my mortgage and bills. I'm essentially going from $55,000 to $24,000. 

I'm already looking for another job. I may even have something lined up very soon, but as of now, my finances won't be fully covered. 

Mortgage is $1050. 
Private student loans are $400. 
Federal loans are another $440. 
Car payment is 400. 
Car Insurance for me and my wife is $220. 

Other small bills and credit cards are $150 all together. 

I have about $5,000 in savings. But that all I have vs a mountain of bills and no job. 

Can anyone offer any advice? I know I should apply for forbearance but I've used up all my time on both sets of student loans (I had to before I made enough to cover everything). What can I do, please I'm very worried.",finance

I've only recently been concerned with my credit. After a divorce, my score tanked because my ex didn't pay agreed upon debt. Things went into collections. It's been more than 7 years for most of the debt, and currently I only have 2 derogatory marks on my report (which I'm trying to take care of, albeit slowly)  But good news, I've managed to take my credit score from the low 600s to the mid 700s in about a year just by paying off what I could, and getting credit cards/accounts I can manage easily. I currently have about 16k in credit , and I'm at a 6k balance against that that I've been paying down, and trying to stay in that sweet spot of usage. 

I heard from a friend of mine who also did some amazing things with his credit - that I should diversify the types of credit I have, and get a low interest loan to pay off a large chunk of that 6k - essentially paying a much lower interest rate and having another credit relationship that I can easily manage and make payments on. Now, I don't have to do this, I can keep making monthly payments towards the current credit balance no problem, and keep it manageable with small purchases here and there.

tl:dr - should I take out a small low interest loan against credit debt to further diversify my credit history?

financial,Estimated Tax Payments: Q &amp; A,"Estimated tax is the method used to pay tax on income that is not subject to withholding. This includes income from self-employment, interest, dividends, alimony, and rent, as well as gains from the sale of assets, prizes and awards. You also may have to pay estimated tax if the amount of income tax being withheld from your salary, pension, or other income is not enough. If you do not pay enough by the due date of each payment period you may be charged a penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your tax return.
How do I know if I need to file quarterly individual estimated tax payments?
If you owed additional tax for the prior tax year, you may have to make estimated tax payments for the current tax year. The first estimated payment for 2017 is due April 18, 2017.
If you are filing as a sole proprietor, partner, S corporation shareholder, and/or a self-employed individual, you generally have to make estimated tax payments if you expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more when you file your return.
If you are filing as a corporation you generally have to make estimated tax payments for your corporation if you expect it to owe tax of $500 or more when you file its return.
If you had a tax liability for the prior year, you may have to pay estimated tax for the current year; however, if you receive salaries and wages, you can avoid having to pay estimated tax by asking your employer to withhold more tax from your earnings.
A Indian CPA is somebody who has had a thorough instruction and has been prepared to meet high expert norms and take after a strict code of morals to get authorized by the American Establishment of Affirmed Open Indian Tax Preparer in Frisco &amp; Plano Bookkeepers. CPAs have broad learning and years of involvement with expense law, including state charge law (for instance, a Seattle-or Bellevue-based CPA is required to pass examinations appropriate to Washington state assess codes). 
Who Does Not Have To Pay Estimated Tax
You do not have to pay estimated tax for the current year if you meet all three of the following conditions:
•	You had no tax liability for the prior year
•	You were a U.S. citizen or resident for the whole year
•	Your prior tax year covered a 12-month period
If you receive salaries and wages, you can avoid having to pay estimated tax by asking your employer to withhold more tax from your earnings. To do this, file a new Form W-4 with your employer. There is a special line on Form W-4 for you to enter the additional amount you want your employer to withhold.
You had no tax liability for the prior year if your total tax was zero or you did not have to file an income tax return.
How Do I Figure Estimated Tax?
To figure your estimated tax, you must figure out your expected adjusted gross income, taxable income, taxes, deductions, and credits for the year. If you estimated your earnings too high, simply complete another Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals worksheet to refigure your estimated tax for the next quarter. If you estimated your earnings too low, again complete another Form 1040-ES worksheet to recalculate your estimated tax for the next quarter.
Prior to starting her own tax consulting practice, she had worked in the Accounting Firm in U.S and in India for more than 10 years. She has worked very closely with the partner in the preparation of Individual Tax Returns and Business Tax Returns. She has been very actively involved in the tax planning and consultation for the clients. 
Try to estimate your income as accurately as you can to avoid penalties due to underpayment. Generally, most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits, or if they paid at least 90 percent of the tax for the current year, or 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever is smaller.
Tip: When figuring your estimated tax for the current year, it may be helpful to use your income, deductions, and credits for the prior year as a starting point. Use your prior year's federal tax return as a guide and use the worksheet in Form 1040-ES to figure your estimated tax.
You must make adjustments both for changes in your own situation and for recent changes in the tax law.

personalfinance,Pay off HELOC to reduce high monthly payment or invest?,"(throw-away) Long time lurker on this sub - seeking guidance. 

**Background** 

My wife and I bought our first home in Boulder, CO this past summer.  Boulder is currently a very competitive market that has seen 10% gains in home prices Y-O-Y though I’m skeptical that this trend will continue.  

When purchasing our home, we make a six figure down payment, got a 30 year fixed mortgage, and a variable HELOC to cover the rest.  We have a fair amount of cash on hand and am considering wiping out my HELOC vs investing, though we’d like to seek a bit of guidance before making such a large decision.

Of the options that I've outlined below, which one would you chose and why?

*Home purchase Details*

- Purchase price of the home was $762k.  
- $100k down payment
- 30 year Mortgage for $480k at 3.99% fixed - ($2700 / mo payment)
- 182k HELOC variable (currently at 4.75%) - ($1100 / mo payment)

*Personal Details:*

- Married 31 years old in the tech industry.  Our company was acquired last year and as a result my income was high in 2016 ($650k) I expect it to be roughly the same this year.  After next year I expect my income to dip back down to $180k.
- Wife is a teacher and makes $33k / year
- $50k set aside for emergency fund
- Additionally have $195k cash on hand.  Have been saving cash to wipe out HELOC.
- $90k saved for retirement
- $15k in Index Funds
- Planning on staying in our home for at least the next four years, maybe longer

*Options we’re considering:*

**Option A - Pay off HELOC entirely to reduce monthly cash expenditure on house**

- Pros
 - Reduce monthly payment on house to $2700. 
 - Eliminate the $700 or so we’re paying in interest on the HELOC 
 - We expect that we could rent our home for $2900 a month.    - This gives us ability to rent out our home and continue to build equity if we need to move or if we fall on hard times.   - We’d be net positive +$200 a month in this situation.
 - Guaranteed “return” of 4.75% on $182k
 - Most likely continue to have access to $182k HELOC for the remaining 9 years of the draw period, but I understand that this is not guaranteed.  
 - Don’t have to worry about interest rate hikes because my mortgage interest rate is fixed.
- Cons
 - Significant amount of net worth wrapped up in home.
 - No longer able to deduct mortgage interest from HELOC.

**Option B - Pay off large chunk of HELOC ($100k?)**

- Pros
 - Reduces monthly cash expenditure 
 - Guaranteed “return” of 4.75% on $100k
 - Most likely continue to have access to $100k HELOC for the remaining 9 years of the draw period, but I understand that this is not guaranteed.  
- Cons
 - If we had to rent the house out, we’d be losing money each month. Assume rent payment of $2900 vs a Mortgage / HELOC payment of $3100.
 - Interest rates are expected to continue to go up which will increase our payment.


**Option C - Invest $195k cash on hand**

- Pros
 - Depending on the investment, the money will likely be much more liquid than dumping into our home.
- Cons
 - High monthly expenditure on house.  Not sustainable on income of $180k.
 - Renting is not an option in current rental market.  Would be  - losing $900 a month.
 - Interest rates are expected to continue to go up which will increase our payment.


We've been planning all along to go with Option A and will likely talk to a CFP before moving forward with any of these options.

That said, we would love any guidance you all are willing to provide.  Thank you!",finance

investing,Stagflation &amp; low interest rates: Which asset classes and industries would benefit or get hurt the most by it?,"Hi All,

I was hoping y'all could share some wisdom on asset classes and within equities, specific industries that would feel either a positive or negative impact (compared to the market as a whole) in a theoretical situation where we have low interest rates coupled with stagflation. My assumption is that interest rates would have to rise to combat the inflation, especially if they come from a low base. Is that a valid assumption to make?

&amp;nbsp;

To be clear, this is a question to help my general understanding. I have no opinion on the economy or where it's going to be in a year from now. I'm jut at a loss of what would be specifically hurt by such a scenario and what would benefit and I'd like to expand my general understanding in this area.

&amp;nbsp;

 * From what I've read so far, **commodities** do well during stagflation. If we take oil as example, most E&amp;Ps are quite levered so an increase in interest rates would harm them. Likewise, a decrease of oil consumption would also pressure prices. So I don't understand why commodities would fundamentally perform well during stagflation. 

 * Other **real assets** like real estate make more sense to me. The interest rate is often fixed, and the asset is likely going to rise with inflation; rents can often be adjusted based on inflation as well to keep real cashflows consistent. Likewise Gold &amp; Silver would do well, or any other commodity that isn't dependent on economic growth for pricing.

 * Investment grade **bonds** would see an influx of funds but at the same time if interest rates increase lose some value. So probably short-dated bonds perform very well and long-term bonds break-even? 

 * High yield bonds would probably see a lot of pain due to the risk-off sentiment at the time. 

 * In **equities**, consumer staples would likely do very well and utilities break even (can pass rise in inflation to customers but hurt by rise in interest; benefit from flight to safety), with all other sectors doing badly, especially growth (tech, etc.) and consumer discretionary? 

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward to your thoughts on this topic. Thank you.

personalfinance,Derogatory Credit Mark from Trauma - help (slight TW),"Throwaway for obvious reasons..

TL;DR at bottom, sorry if this is long. Mild TW.

I've seen PF help so many people, myself included, so I hope someone can help me with this issue. I'm not going to go into too many details; this is a sensitive subject, please understand that it's still hard for me to address this.

I'm a 23 female and I'm generally in charge of my family's finances, and my husband and I are trying to plan for our future. I have a messy past, and I've been trying to clean up the financial mistakes I've made. My credit score went from mid/high 400s, to the low 600s it is now (first time ever, so I'm pretty happy). Baby steps..

I've been sober for almost 2 years (end of the month), but I've had a lot of trauma in my younger years that essentially caused an out of control spiral. I have PTSD and anxiety but am doing very well thanks to years of therapy and cleaning up. I've grown into the person I want to be, and I'm still growing.

Anyway. When I was 18 I moved out, after years in an abusive house hold earlier on. After a few months in the new apartment, an event happened that caused massive trauma, assumed sexual abuse // rape attempt on the apartment grounds (I don't remember the actual even, only before and after - I ended up suffering a massive head wound because I was running away, and got a concussion, so it's very blurry) followed by a hospital trip and a rape kit. I was young and scared and already suffering from PTSD, and I didn't report it. I just wasn't strong enough at the time; I could barely be okay as it was. It was just too much.

A note on the head wound - I got like 32 stitches in and out of the muscle by my temple, with a major concussion, hence why details get VERY blurry. I have memory issues already, so it's hard for me to remember everything. The injury happened on the apartment grounds, as I was attempting to running away and find my apartment.

So I left and moved back in with my mother (not the abusive parent). I was technically evicted because I stopped paying rent (obv), and I don't think I really tried to explain what happened. I'm pretty sure I told the complex, but I didn't pursue it, and I couldn't face it, so I just... didn't. Again, I was young, and I wasn't doing so great. It was easier to hide.

Fast forward to now. I have a derogatory mark on my credit for about $1400-ish, I tried to dispute it and they just added $7 (fees? I don't know).

When I was added to the lease my husband was on, they almost didn't approve me because of this, but the woman knew I had already been living there and we paid rent on time, and were good tenants. But she told me that this particular mark (I have others) would really stop us getting approved in the future.

She told me that I could write a letter to the creditor to explain the situation and ask it to be removed. Is there any merit behind this? I've been planning to send validation letters for my other marks, and then probably try to pay-for-delete, but this one.. I don't know how to address.

Do I send a validation request first, and hope they just drop it? Or do I by-pass that and send a letter just.. explaining? I can get the copies of the medical records and the rape kit showing that I'm not lying, that this thing happened. I just want this gone.

We can't afford a pay-for-delete, or I'd probably just do that. The way the property manager made it sound was like I shouldn't pay this anyway because of the circumstances. I'm not trying to run from it, but I don't know what to do.

It's from 2014, but I disputed it maybe a year ago? So I don't know what the SOL is anymore.

Please go easy, I know I made mistakes. I didn't report it, I'm just now addressing it.. I know. I'm only now mentally able to look at the f-ed up things that happened to me in my past (this is by far the only one). I'm trying.

My husband and I are looking to move soon, so I know this is going to be an issue. I've gotten several cards to boost my credit score, and it's rising, but this is a big red mark that I know looks bad, especially without context.

Thanks in advance, PF. You guys are miracle workers.

TL;DR - I have a derogatory mark on my credit becasue after an attempted rape // sexual abuse occurred on the apartment grounds, I ran away, stopped paying rent because I couldn't look at what happened, got evicted. Do I send a letter to the creditors explaining? How do I go about trying to get this mark removed, or fixed so it doesn't look so bad applying for apartments?",finance

Specifics:

- I have $60,000 dollars in student loan debt that won't be addressed by the bankruptcy.
- I have $40,000 in collections for medical debt, from an emergency Appendicitis surgery back before I had good insurance. This will be forgiven under the Chapter 7 bankruptcy I'm about to get.

personalfinance,"[x-post from r/personalfinancecanada] Met with a financial planner today regarding my credit card debt and I still feel clueless - help me understand, please? (CAN)","Hi everyone,

Full disclosure: I'm embarrassed to admit that at 27 years old, I'm still completely ignorant when it comes to personal finances.

I have about $60,000 in student loan debt (financial/federal) and another $5,200 in credit card debt. I am currently unemployed but will be graduating in June and hopefully finding a job shortly after.

Today, I had a meeting with a financial planner at TD. I expressed my concerns about my credit card debt because basically I'm only paying my minimum payments right now, which is basically just paying the interest and not actually making a dent in my balance; I never miss a payment and I have my account set up so that a set amount of money goes onto my credit card each week in order to make my minimum payment. He suggested I go with a credit card that has a lower interest rate (my current interest rate is 19.99%) and I agreed because I know that soon I won't be able to keep on top of payments, so we did that; my new card has an interest rate of 13.45%.

He also noted that because my credit limit is $5,500 and I have used $5,200 of that, it would be beneficial for me to increase my credit limit; I had been pre approved for a $4,500 credit limit increase, but I was too scared to approve it. I'm literally terrified to use my card at this point. Anyway, ignorant me was like, ""Well, if it's good for my credit, I guess I'll do it."" Now my credit limit is $10,000 and I feel like I have a huge pit in my stomach. I'm not worried about being tempted to go on a shopping spree; despite my credit card debt, I'm generally quite frugal - I've had this credit card since I was about 20 and basically just lost control at keeping up with paying it off somewhere along the way.

Lastly, the financial planner suggested that once I am employed, I should consolidate my debt and turn it into a loan/line of credit because the interest may be lower than a credit card - does this makes sense? I asked him to dumb it down for me but I still don't fully understand.

Anyway, I basically just hope I'm not screwed for life! I'm trying to get a hold of this whole adulating business but I feel a little late to the game. Did I make some good choices today or did I dig myself even deeper into a hole?

personalfinance,"240k student loan debt, baby on the way. Finally making money. Want advice on budgeting/where to save.","Hey Team,

I've begun to do my homework, and I'd like advice and second opinions as it will help steer me further. I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Thanks mucho in advance for your help.

240k student loan debt at 6.5% interest. F my life. Looking into refinancing but would love advice here. SoFi offers 3.5% BUT FedLoan offered Income Based payments, which I needed until now.  No other debt.

I'm finally near the earning potential my degree offered 3 yrs after graduation, and can finally consider making progressive (and, as mentioned above, refinancing). Here's the deets.

Married, self-employed starting this year projected to make 160k, gross, roughly 13k month. Wife works, but makes no money (also starting a business) Expenses are brutal (Bay Area). 2k rent for office, 1k health insurance, 1.5k other business expenses (insurance, advert, etc.), leaving me roughly 10k in taxable income. I set 1/3 aside every month, so this leaves roughly 7k.

We want to start saving for a house, we have a baby on the way, and we have no savings at the moment. How would people recommend breaking down my income into savings, payments, etc?
If I refinance, I'll finally be able to make progress on the debt, but I'll have to throw 2k/month minimum at it.

A little extra info: I believe my earning potential will climb. I've written a book, I'm ambitious, I can do speaking gigs, and I'm good at my job so my business will continue to grow. I'll probably top out at 180-200k in a few years. My wife may make money, but it's a bit of a crapshoot when that will happen due to the damn baby.",finance

personalfinance,Help with graduate school loan options,"So, I am going to be leaving my current career which reimburses for my graduate courses, and will likely end up owing them $25k-30k. I am hoping to set up a payment plan with the company to pay them back this money over a period of time, but there is a risk they will not accept that. I am wondering if I can take student loans for courses that I've already completed in a case like this. Or would a personal loan be more worthwhile to me? Also, as a graduate student taking 1 course at a time, I have read conflicting information on whether or not I even qualify for student loans.

I have a friend who recommended personal loans over student loans, as my chances of getting unsubsidized loans are very slim as I am a working professional making over $50k. I am wondering if anyone here has any suggestions on what type of loan I may qualify for, and what type might be the best option in my situation. My credit score is &gt;800, so I don't feel I would have much issue getting the loan, but I worry about choosing the wrong type.

Even if I can manage to set up a payment plan with my company, I am going to need to take out loans to continue my education as I will now be funding it myself (possibly in addition to paying back my employer). I am just looking for some advice on what might be my best option in either the worst case scenario where I need to come up with the ~$30k rather quickly or best case scenario where I can make payments and still take out loans for my future courses. I have about a year and a half or so left of graduate school (I am attending one course per 3 of the 4 quarters my school offers. They stated when I applied that I do not qualify for federal aid.)

I feel so ignorant to this whole process as my parents' took care of everything for me during my undergraduate days and never included me in any of it, besides attaching my name to the loans to build my credit. Any help or insight anyone could offer would be much appreciated!

TL;DR: Best case scenario I need loans to cover future courses as a part time graduate student. Worst case scenario I need to come up with ~$30k and still find a way to cover future courses. What do?

investing,"Bonds, Bond Funds, and the Optimal Equity-Bond Ratio","Hi everyone, 

I'm in the middle of reading The Intelligent Investor and I've decided to split up my holdings between 50-50 between equity and bonds. In the Zweig edition, he states that intermediate duration bonds are the best, since it provides a meatier yield than short term while still keeping the risk from interest rates moderate. However, 5-10 year yields, especially on treasuries, are extremely low.

What are your opinions regarding bond funds in this current environment (duration, type, etc) and do you think a 50-50 policy is a smart move? Regarding the latter, we're deep within a long bull run and it's probably a good idea to start hedging in some way, although the low yields are just almost insignificant after inflation and tax.

Your advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Help in figuring out how to pay off student loan debt?,"I've had student loans since 2013. I'm now in a position where I can put at least $1000 toward my minimum payments every other month. I have Navient with 7 separate loans, all Federal, and a Private loan through Great Lakes. The private loan has an interest rate of 9%, with an original borrowed amount of $9,761. However, I'm guessing with interest, even after 4 years, I have a balance of $10,000. I'm not sure about the balance of the Navient loans, but my min. payment is $432.98, to which I pay $440.00. My balance before I made my last payment was $27,669.51, even after payment processed it now shows I owe $27,677.61. I'm guessing this is due to interest? Because all 7 loans have separate interest rates, I imagine the interest applied toward my principal is an average of the 7 percentages. 

I'm trying to attempt to nearly pay off one of the loans, or at least get close. Which loans should I focus on first?

Navient loans:
Subsidized $4,019.30 at 5.6% interest (before payment was $$4,018.08)
Subsidized $3,952.11 at 4.5% interest
Subsidized $3,883.62 at 3.4%

Subsidized $3,942.77 3.4%
Unsubsidized $$5,582.04 6.8%

personalfinance,Where are the hidden fees in home purchase? (US),"Hello r/personalfinance

First off, this sub has helped me a lot over the years with realizing where I am leaking money, so thank you!

I am currently in the process of buying a house.  This will be a house owned solely by me, but I eventually (probably early next year) will be having my girlfriend move in the house and negotiate some sort of fair rent deal.

I am 26 years old and my income fluctuates slightly based on profession but I can realistically expect to make 70-130k a year depending on how hard I work/various factors.  As mentioned earlier, my girlfriend will be living with me and paying a portion of the mortgage in ""rent"".

I have been preapproved for a few loans, the best one being for up to 300k.

I plan on putting down exactly 20% to avoid the mortgage insurance fees, which I assume will be roughly 80k.

So my questions -

I'm looking at a lot of new build homes as they are desirable to me and in abundance in my area.  Oftentimes the list price of the homes I'm interest in will be between 290-340k.  Common sense alone tells me that after upgrades and all the other fees that aren't listed on a simple sales sheet, the cost will be much more than that.

I'm trying my best to educate myself on hidden costs like lot premiums.  What else am I missing when trying to estimate how much extra the costs of these homes will be when compared to ""sticker price""?

I am also under the impression that when purchasing new builds there is very little wiggle room for negotiations on the price of the home.  As I said, I've been pre-approved by two different banks for about 300k which should be more than enough, but my realtor says that using the lender of the home builder could potentially save the closing costs.

So even if I was to find a home that I wanted to purchase, I am a little lost on how to figure out which loan to use.  Should I just be roughly estimated the saving closing costs (if I can even get that) vs the lower interest rate of a third party bank?

The process is very overwhelming to me and I figure this sub is a great place to post.

Keep in mind this is a first home for me, so no experience at all.  No information given is mundane.

personalfinance,Canada Debt Decisions - Combined Income 75k - House Or Debt? (CAN),"Myself and my wife make 75k between us, I make 55 k and she makes 20k. We recently paid off a significant number of our debts and were looking to buy our first home , however the numbers are a bit murky...


Income - 75k before taxes, its averaging about 1850 bi weekly after taxes plus a monthly government benefit for our Daughter of around 350 dollars with no taxation.

Debts We Have

10k Credit Card Debt - Payments of about 200 month - Interest rate is 5k at 5% and 5k at 15%

My student loans - 17k - payment is 220 monthly at 4%
Her student loans - paid by father in law

Car 1- 19k total, monthly payments 350 - 0%
Car 2 - Owned, equity is 4k


Other costs
Rent - 750 monthly
Car Insurance/Home Insurance - 200 monthly
Cell Phones - 150 monthly
Parking - 100 monthly
Internet - 60 monthly


We have a 15k down payment for a home, which would be the 5% minimum for 300k in London Ontario 


Logic -

Houses are going up drastically in areas not named Toronto due to the city being  too expensive , if we don't buy soon it's entirely possible and likely that we will be priced out of this market.

However, I love the idea of having no credit card debt .

*Note, the 15k is not going to be used for debt, it was a gift from family under the agreement it only be used for a down payment for a home*

Savings have all been emptied out to pay back other debts, IE credit card was actually at 15k , we had a best buy card and a couch we had bought from a furniture store etc. 
We have 3K left in savings currently being used as an emergency fund / escrow in case we find the right home .




Really what I'm trying to figure out is What debt is best to pick away at, I feel like the most expensive credit card debt is most important as it would impact the interest payments the most and would be the easiest to knock out of the park.

personalfinance,"Returning for PhD in Reno, Nevada, seeking advice on making ends meet","Hi Redditors of PF, long-time lurker and first-time poster here (on a throwaway). Many thanks for all of the insightful discussion and advice over the years, it has helped immensely. Now, I am in search of a bit more personalized advice on my family's somewhat unique situation and would appreciate any insight you can offer.

&amp;nbsp;

A bit about the predicament: I (26M), along with my wife (26F) and young child, will be leaving a good salaried job to pursue a PhD in Reno, Nevada this fall with a stipend of $1,700 per month and good paying summer internships lined up. My wife will be able to make a consistent $1,000 from home, bringing our total to $2,700 reliable income per month. Throughout the past two years at my current salaried position, per this subreddit's suggestions, we've focused on paying down debts, funding my 401K to the employer match, and saving for the transition back to graduate school. Some life curveballs have destroyed our emergency fund and hindered the savings process, but we should have $3-4,000 in savings before next fall.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, for expenses. 

- Credit cards: no balance
- Student loans: deferred during graduate school
- Vehicles: $320 monthly payment (owe $14,000, worth $16,000); own one reliable vehicle (worth $15,000), 
- Auto insurance: $150
- Health insurance: mine is covered by the graduate school, unsure yet about options for wife and daughter. Estimating ~$500?
- Utilities: $200
- Cell phones + internet + netflix: $200
- Groceries: $500
- Pets/Child/Personal: $300
- Gas: $250
- Savings/Misc: $200

Total: $2,620

&amp;nbsp;

More or less, we will be short on income to cover expenses based on the above-outlined details when factoring in housing (discussed below). We are considering selling both vehicles to eliminate the payment and buy two older vehicles (one safe commuter, one 4wd). My wife isn't going to work full-time to avoid childcare costs ($800/month reduced cost at university daycare) and because it is important to us that she is there during the early years. So regardless, I will need to work part-time, which is doable. One way, or another, we will find a way to come up with the required amount of money each month, but the more we can minimize expenses the better. 

&amp;nbsp;

The crux of the issue: the inflated Reno housing market. We have two dogs and one cat, which in and of itself makes finding housing challenging, particularly since one dog is on all breed restriction lists for Reno property managers. Therefore, we need to find a house with a yard (haven't found any potential apartments) and assuming we can find one that accepts our pets, a basic 2-3 bed house is going for $1,500 to $2,000/month (mostly &gt;$1,700). Honestly, I am concerned whether we will even be able to find anything to rent at all. Plus rent prices have increased dramatically in the past two years and show no sign of slowing down, so the range above will likely increase.

&amp;nbsp;

This raises the question of buying a house. We can find/qualify for a decent, newer house outside of the city center for $200-250K with a low-interest rate. Theoretically, this would keep our monthly housing costs (mortgage, insurance, taxes) locked in to &lt; or = $1500/month (correct me if I'm wrong on this). This seems like generally a bad idea, as the market is potentially inflated and we don't have a 20% down payment to avoid PMI. Plus the risks involved with home ownership and the uncertain incomes we will have, although regardless we will absolutely have to pay the rent/mortgage amount each month anyway. The upside is that we qualify for a 5% grant towards a down payment (Home is Possible program) plus what we can contribute from savings, and we would be building equity over the next four years in a currently skyrocketing housing market driven by Tesla, Google, etc. moving portions of their operations to the area. Everything credible I can find suggests it is not a housing bubble in Reno, but is purely driven by supply/demand issues due to the influx of workers.

&amp;nbsp;

So this is now where we sit: three months out from moving to Reno  to pursue a PhD and currently unsure of how it is all going to come together. Things will work out, I just want to ensure we are making the correct financial and life decisions.

I hope this has provided the necessary context, and thank you for reading this novel. Here are my main questions: 

- What would you do in this situation? 
- How would you reduce expenses? 
- Would you replace both newer vehicles for older ones to eliminate the payment? 
- Are there any public assistance options we are overlooking?
- Would you take student loans to help cover expenses? 
- How would you approach the housing issue of buy vs. rent?

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: returning to graduate school with wife and child. Stipend plus wife's income won't cover expenses. Need to reduce expenses, find housing (with dogs/cat) which costs $1500-2000/month minimum. Considering buying $200-250K house to lower monthly housing payment.

personalfinance,Can I refinance to get rid of my PMI that is for the life of the loan?,"I'm a first time home buyer.  I'm currently choosing my loan options Conventional vs FHA on a $250k mortgage.

personalfinance,Paying Off Student Loans In 2 And a Half Years Instead of 6,"I just recently created my first real budget and realized that I could throw $1,000/month (which is a little over double what my current minimum payment is) toward my student loans. At first I calculated that this should mean paying off all the loans in about 5 years (I have just over 60k in loan balance), but I must have missed something because I just redid the calculations and realized it was actually going to be more like 6 years.

I don't want to be in debt for 6 years.

So, I redid the calculations using payoff.io (which has been awesome since I can use it to make specific one-time extra payments or recurring extra monthly payments) and realized that I can pay this all off in two and a half years if I do the following:

1) Up my monthly payment to $1,200/month from now until February 2018, increase to $1,600/month starting then (where hopefully by this point I'll have gotten my first raise with the new job I have), and then increase it to $2,000 for the last two months (October and November of 2019). Even if I don't get the raise or it's not as much as I'm expecting I'll figure out a way to address that $400/month difference. I'll either get another part-time job until everything is paid off, or I'll try to cut back my budget even further, or perhaps a combination of the two.

2) Since I now get paid bi-weekly instead of semi-monthly, that means I get two ""extra"" paychecks around May/June and November/December each year. I will use the 6 of those I'd get between now and November 2019 and put them all toward the loans.

3) Similar to above, using whatever bonuses I get. I know I get a bonus each year up to a certain amount, but that amount depends on how well the company does as a whole. But I assumed a bonus of 2.25% post-tax for the next two years.

I was thinking about refinancing some of those loans with SoFI (since out of the 7 loan groups I have, 4 of them are at either 5.6% or 6.8% with about 35k of the 60 being of the 6.8% variety), but according to the calculations I got from the site I would only end up saving just over $600 over these 30 months of payments and I lose what federal protections I have with my current loans.

I just made my first of these additional payments, waiting for it to post to my account.  Once I've made my payments for this month, I'll come back to my plan and put in the new numbers on the first of next month and make sure it still shows my projection to be correct.

So I'm gonna be honest, this is mostly a vanity post and a mile marker so I can see how far I've come while making these extra student loan payments. I hope I can come back and make a post in November of 2019 telling you all of my success.

The home was built in 1951 and like most homes in our neighborhood, it's somewhat of a fixer up-er (but only somewhat). We always had it in our head that we'd do a remodel and because we'll need a new roof sooner or later, we need to replace the knob and wire wiring that we have for electricity, are in need of an additional bathroom, and are expecting our second child and would just generally like our house to work for our growing family, we started talking with contractors and architects. 

We've been saving money for the remodel since we've moved in (and yes, we also have a substantial emergency fund already), but will still need to finance the remodel. Different architects have given us different numbers, but is seems like it's in the $240 K range for the remodel. 

What are the current reccomendation for financing a remodel?  Our mortgage interest rate is 3.875% and our home has appreciated in value considerable since we've moved in. I don't think we want to touch our original loan, but I'm open to suggestions. I've heard of construction loans, but think they aren't really recommended anymore.

personalfinance,Paying for graduate school (MBA),"Hi PF, 
I will be starting a full-time MBA program this fall and will need to pay entirely out of pocket.  Tuition is ~$60k and full cost of attendance is ~$85k per year, so ~$170k total.  I have a good bit of money in savings/investments and curious to see how others would approach given the following information.

Current savings/investment breakdown is: 

* $40k cash savings 
* $80k taxable investments
* $45k in Roth IRA (some rollover from Roth 401k)
* $35k in Traditional IRA (some rollover from Trad401k)

Right now my plan is to use the $40k cash savings to help offset living expenses, leaving about $130k to figure out how to pay for.  The way I see it I have several options:

* Option 1:  Use $40k cash savings for living expenses and take out federal loans at 5+% for first $40k and 6+% for remaining balance.  Federal loans also have sizable origination fees (1+% for first 40k and 4+% for balance)
* Option 2:  Same as Option 1 but private loans instead of federal loans.  Benefit would be potentially lower interest rates (as low as 3+% for variable rate and 5+% for fixed for entire balance) and no origination fees (usually), but risk would be far less flexibility for repayment.
* Option 3:  Dig deeper into taxable investments, even potentially IRAs, to minimize as much as possible how much I have to take out in loans.

Something to note with Option 1, there would be the option to refinance to a lower rate upon graduating and getting a job.  One caveat to consider against all options is I am engaged and will be getting married next spring.  After graduation and (hopefully) becoming employed, my significant other and I will be looking to buy a house sooner rather than later (talking a couple of years, not necessarily months).  This makes me nervous about completely emptying out my investments to where we have no cash later on for a downpayment (Option 3), but also nervous about having a significant student loan balance disqualifying us for a mortgage (Option 1 and 2).  Of course this ignores potential cash from wedding gifts, internships, job signing bonus, etc.  My SO will not be able to contribute much in the way of savings because she just recently finished up a 4 year professional degree (pharmacy), and despite her high earning power she herself has 6 figure student loans to work on paying down ASAP.

personalfinance,Impact of joint account on credit history?,"Recently I got a tremendous offer from a software company, and I decided to buy myself a car that I've wanted for a while. Brand new it's worth around 42k (I'm really into cars and I understood that it's not fiscally the best thing to do). I was talking to my dad about it and he mentioned that if I get a joint account/loan with him, he could get me lower interest rates. 

The problem is, is that I'm pretty young and have never had a credit card or any type of loan, therefore, my credit history is non-existent.  In theory I could pay the car off currently with cash but I am attempting to build my credit history for when I buy my car in the future.

So I guess I have two questions. How will opening a joint account/loan with my dad impact how my credit history, will it improve (assuming I will be on time for all the payments). And second, what down payment should I place on my car in order to improve my credit history the most.

personalfinance,Salary instead of benefit,"So I work for a company that has just announced they will be offering a new benefit to employees. They will allow them to refinance student loans with them, at margin, and every year they will apply the maximum amount they allow for tuition reimbursement as a principal payment to the loan. This is huge, the principal payment they would make is nearly $5k a year. Max term in the loan is 10 years. 

There is a caveat to this plan though, and members of some committees are exempt from taking advantage of it. I, unfortunately, am a member of one of the committees.

Because of my position I cannot really turn down being on the committee so I'm in a bit of a pickle from being able to take advantage of this pseudo-benefit. Within the next 6 months however I should be in line for a promotion. Now this promotion would still keep me in an exempt committee, however it should also come with a pay raise.

Would it make sense to use the exemption from the pseudo-benefit as a negotiation piece to gain an extra $5k in salary? The reason I ask, I am on the verge of finishing my MBA, which is the reason for the soon to be promotion, and a big chunker of student loan debt.

While I actually prefer to keep the loan with the fed for the repayment plans available, the program is very tempting - had I been able to take advantage of it. That principal payment is the big hook. 

Thanks in advance! Let me know if you need any other info. 


Edit: a line was brought up about others on the committee. In truth, in the youngest person and likely the only one to have any student loan debt that is on any of the committees impacted by the exclusion. It would be I likely anyone else is really in the same boat. Definitely wasn't done out of malicious intent, I genuinely believe they thought nobody on these committees would need it.

personalfinance,Where to invest my inheritance? (UK),"Unfortunately, recently my grandfather passed away, however I've been told I will be inheriting a substantial sum of money in the near future (£50,000). Effectively I'm looking for some advice on what I plan to do with it.

Some background on me: 

I'm 27 and work self-employed as a graphic designer, of which is just enough to support where I live currently. My business is still growing and I have only been operating for two years. Realistically I won't be able to buy a home in the near future even with the £50k as a deposit due to my income being fairly low (whilst still growing). I live fairly frugally and want to change that slightly, so I don't feel I'm missing out - but my aim has always been to do that via growing my business.

What I'm currently planning:

The stock market has always interested me and it's something I've read plenty on out of curiosity. It's what allowed my grandfather to generate is wealth in later years. However, I don't plan to throw money at a metaphorical dartboard and hope for wins. What interests me is dividend growth investing, so long term and fairly reliable growth if done correctly. The goal being financially secure in 20+ years time. I'd be looking to put 90% of the money into a diversified portfolio and hold it long term.

Also, I am interested in doing some swing trading with a much smaller amount of the money (5%), as again it's something I've read plenty on and fancy having a go. This wouldn't aim to be a full-time gig or to be a main source of income. My attitude towards this is more along the lines of a bit of fun and to keep me interested in the market, if I'm good at it then that's a bonus!

Alongside that I would make an initial deposit with the remaining money into a 'Help to buy' ISA and continue to save each year into it. For those that are unaware, this is a government initiated scheme where they provide an additional 25% of the money saved when used in purchasing a home (up to the savings total of £12,000, so up to an additional £3,000). This is in conjunction with the tax free interest generated by the ISA, which is paltry (around 2%). The maximum you can save per year into this is £2,400 per year however. 

My logic behind all this is due to the fact I won't be in a position to use the inheritance money against a house for 3-5 years at least and by then I imagine I would be capable of getting a reasonable mortgage without this lump sum. Interest rates are pathetic on almost any type of savings accounts right now. Just taking a lazy route with the money doesn't make sense to me, equally I'm logical and somewhat risk averse. So striking that balance is what I'm going for. 

Does this all sound rational and reasonable? Or would it make more sense to chuck it all in bonds and use it to get a better mortgage in 3 or so years?",finance

personalfinance,Why is the interest rate on my car so low?,"Sorry if this has been asked before, I searched but couldn't find anything.

My 3 year car loan for about $13k has an interest rate of 1.99%. This was not any sort of special promotion from the dealership or anything, I got separate financing from an outside source unrelated to the dealership. I'm just wondering why anybody would give me a loan like this, since it just doesn't seem like it would be profitable. A 2% annual return on investment is honestly pretty terrible. The institution loaning me this money could surely invest it better somewhere else, as they're barely even beating inflation by loaning it to me.

I'm definitely not complaining or anything, I'm happy with getting a low rate, but I just can't see how this is a good investment for the institution loaning me the money. It's far from a risk-free investment, and they're not making good returns on it at all. Also it's not like this investment on their end was low-work like dumping money into a mutual fund, some of that 2% returns that they make is going to their operating expenses, so their effective return is even lower than that.

The only thing that I can think of is that they can make money when I end up not being able to repay my loans. If I were to stop paying my loan now, they'd end up getting to keep my down payment, two years worth of payments, AND they'd get to repossess my car. Did they give me a low loan rate in the hopes that I'd end up defaulting? And if this were the case, why are they giving people with high credit scores lower rates? Wouldn't they want more people with bad credit scores to take the loans because they're more likely to default?

Can someone that understands economics better than me explain what's going on?

personalfinance,"Auto Car Loan, Did My Lender Breach Contract?","Hi, I am 25, waited till I had consistent and flexible enough income to begin accruing any debt or credit related purchases and last year I was financed a 2014 Nissan. I was expecting a high interest rate since at the time I had no established credit and was always planning on refinancing through my insurance agency when my credit was good enough. 

Fast forward to two months ago when my lender sent me a letter stating that because I haven't had an insurance policy on the vehicle that they were assessing an $1100 charge on my loan balance, pro-rated for the 11 months I've been apparently ""driving without insurance."" When I signed the finance contract, I not only agreed to the terms, obviously including full coverage, but had to provide the policy number and agency. I had kept the same policy number from my old vehicle and added the coverage specified in the contract as they were very specific. Lowest deductible, meaning highest insurance payment. It took two months and three attempts by my insurance agent to personally reach someone to fix the unjustified penalty. Unjustified as in I had already provided the same information when I signed the contract that they should have had now. There's been no changes to my policy, coverage or account and no discernible reason for them to believe otherwise.

This morning I called AGAIN and was finally informed the charge was taken off. When I asked for my new loan balance it was actually higher than than the initial loan amount of $12k. The only reasonable explanation I can think of was that I was accruing interest (18%) not just on the principal amount but also the insurance penalty added to the loan balance. As a result my buyout amount is higher, my balance is slightly higher than where I started and my already fragile, one year old credit score took a hit because, even though they took six months to report the last six on time payments, they wasted no time to report my loan amount going up. And they seem too incompetent to explain or help me understand their reasoning.

If the lending company added a $1100 prorated assessment against my principal loan amount, based on their own error, and have been accruing interest this whole first year of the loan (which is the period where I'm paying the highest amount of interest out of my monthly payments), have they technically breached their contract, even if they corrected the charge? Especially when their mistake inhibits my ability to refinance through someone more reputable?

personalfinance,"Planning (well, hoping) to buy a home in the next year to 2 years.","I know this question has been posted before, but it's sort of difficult to sift through all the previous advice and apply it to our situation. My fiance and I are getting married in September of this year and would like to potentially buy a house down the road if it's doable. We both have student loans, mine are at about $23K (only 2 years out of nursing school), and I have a brand new $28K car loan (just bought my car a few days ago). He is leasing his car right now. I know my fiance has student loans but he did have a scholarship for college so I don't think he owes much still. I make about $53K before taxes annually. He only makes about $25-27K annually right now, but he is learning computer programming and hoping to get a job in that field in the future. 

My (very) rough idea of a plan was to use the money from our wedding to pay down some stuff, and then just save and save for a sizable down payment. We were looking at houses around $200K - $250K (this would be the higher end) which would get us a decent house in our area (Durham, NC). 

Is this even plausible? What else should I be doing to prepare? 

TIA for the advice.

Edit: Just another piece of information, we both have decent credit, in the 700s. (mine low 700s, his mid). I know this won't make a difference with saving, I just am happy we at least have this right now. Also, as a few of you have mentioned, I know that my car loan situation is not ideal and seems excessive, however I was stuck in a REALLY bad car loan with an equally shitty car. I still owed about $7K on a car that was 6 years old, and my interest rate was a whopping 18%. The car was going to need about $1500-$2000 worth of maintenance which I didn't feel was worth putting into it, and by trading in my car, they were generous with what they gave me for it, they rolled over what I still owed but brought my interest rate to 1.9%. So even though I didn't want/plan on getting a new car, with the incentives they had and the interest rate, I went for it.",finance
personalfinance,29M - New Job: Financial summary and options moving forward,"I am starting a new job on the 15th and wanted to post a summary of my financial situation as well as my options at my new job to get your thoughts on where I'm at and what I can do moving forward.


**Current Situation**
* I have $20K in the bank between checking and savings.
* My 401K from my previous employer is at $7G.  I have been contributing at 5% 
* I have $3K in credit card debt.  I'm paying $500-$1000/month to get rid of this ASAP.
* I live with roommates and rent is only $410/month.
* I currently am 1 year into a 3 year car lease.  Payment is only $200/month.  I needed something cheap and reliable as the previous vehicle I had was breaking down.  


**Student Loans**
* 1) $16,875 on 5.9%.
* 2) $11,510 on 6.24%.
* Question: I am aggressively targeting Loan #2 and paying $500-$1000/month on this.  Am I correct in going after this one first since it has the higher interest rate?


**New Job**
* Salary will be $57K.
* Typically gets paid a bonus and the target is 10% and in a dream scenario, can go up to 20%.
* An HSA option.  Individually owned, tax advantaged account.  Can contribute up to $3,400/year.  Is this a good option? Is it essentially a separate savings account or is it impacted by the market? Is there any reason to use this as opposed to having it in my checking/saving?
* Pension Plan: 6% of eligible earnings with interest each calendar year.  Fully vested after 3 years. Do I need to do anything with this or just let is grow?
* 401K: Company match up to 4%.  Fully vested after 2 years.  I will put at least 4% into this.  If I want to invest more, should I just add more into this or should I look into an IRA? If so, traditional or Roth?


**Plans**
In the next 5 years or so, I will probably get married.  I'd like to have an idea of where you guys think I'm at because I'd like to look at getting a house in soon.  I could get a town home in the area for $100-$115K.  Is that a good idea to start building equity? Is it worth it, or just wait a few years? 

Thanks for taking a minute to read my summary.  I'm open to hearing any advice, suggestions, or thoughts you may have.  I don't think there's any information on here that is too sensitive to be on here, but if you feel I should take this down, I'd appreciate a heads up.",finance
personalfinance,Mid-30s family w/ 16k of CC debt. How can I restructure payments so the interest is not killing me?,"Hey all. I spent the first few years in our house trying to allow our family to live more comfortably middle class than we really were at the time, which meant falling back on the credit card more times than was healthy (or reasonable, or intelligent.) We built up 16k in debt while putting together the infrastructure for both kids. 

However, the payments are still pretty high and I didn't have a plan then on how to pay this debt off. I am now a little older and a little wiser (I hope!) and seeking to change things up so that the repayments, incl. the interest rate, are not killing me. 

My ultimate hope was this. Can anyone help me figure out whether this is reasonable or absurd?

1. Move the CC debt over to some sort of [X] repayment...thing. Loan program or another credit card or etc. As long as the interest rate (I think - and need to verify - that the existing card is at something like 16-18% interest) 

2. /\ move above debt over to some/any sort of program that rewards for paying the debt back (if that even exists...if it doesn't, then let me know. Maybe I'm living in a fantasy world here.) 

3. Do this w/o hurting our credit too terribly (730s) 

Is this possible? Are there alternative strategies I should be looking at? All I know is that this card helped us out a bit when I needed it, but the debt is getting in the way now. It's not killing us but it certainly would be nice to restructure it into something smaller.

dogecoin,tipbot thoughts...,"So yeah, this sucks. I had a small but insignificant balance, I know a lot of people had real money in there and are taking a big hit.

But honestly, this sort of thing is exactly why crypto isn't taking off. What this guy was doing, in the US at least, would have broken laws at both state and federal level around money transmission... And that's just the bot doing its normal thing, not even considering the funds that were taken.

So you've really got a few possible scenarios:

* An established company steps in, charges high fees to recover their costs/pay people/cover regulations, and probably nobody uses it any more because that company has to collect tax information, share transaction data with regulators and the IRS, and ultimately you're getting a nastygram from the tax office if you didn't report your tips as income.

* A nobody, or someone in a country that doesn't have these sorts of regulations, starts a tipbot with no regulatory compliance or accountability, and nobody uses it because the last guy already ruined it.

* Someone from the dogecoin community tries to do something halfway between those two points, people generally trust them, and everything goes sour again in a few years...


Maybe the best idea isn't to bring back dogetipbot, but rather to improve on it in ways that prevent this sort of collapse.",cryptocurrency
technology,The FCC claims that they received a DDOS attack at the exact same time as John Oliver's viral net neutrality segment last night,"UPDATE: The FCC is [now claiming](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-238132) that it was also hit by a DDoS attack back in 2014, the last time John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality. This makes me even more skeptical. These are serious claims -- they need to show us the proof. The only way we'll know what really happened is if the FCC released their logs to an independent party who can verify their claims.

UPDATE 2: Now we are pretty sure the FCC is lying. Our software dev has confirmed that the FCC's site [went down again](http://imgur.com/a/cALQp) last night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment would have aired again on HBO. He also confirmed that their servers repeatedly fell down under net neutrality comments coming through [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) over the last two weeks. It seems extremely likely the FCC is attempting to cover up the fact that their comment system simply cannot handle large amounts of feedback from the public. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just issued a [press release](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf) claiming, “Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS).” 

The FCC is saying that the site hosting their comment system was attacked *at the exact same time* comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight [segment about net neutrality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak). The media [widely reported](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/) that the surge in comments crashed the FCC’s site. 

Disclosure: I am a a net neutrality activist and I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) one of the groups behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com). I have been paying close attention to the issue since 2014, and have been part of efforts that [overwhelmed](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fcc-website-net-neutrality-20140715-story.html) the FCC’s comment site in the past. 

The FCC’s statement today raises two concerns for me. It strikes me that either:

1. The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access their site through John Oliver’s GoFCCYourself.com redirect amounts to a “DDoS” attack, to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or—worst case—is preparing a bogus legal argument that somehow John Oliver’s show *itself* was the DDoS attack.

2. Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from being able to comment in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules  many of us fought for in 2015.

Given the current FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s [open hostility](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance) toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of astroturfing and paying [shady organizations](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments) to influence the FCC, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet. 

One thing that we can do right now is call for the FCC to release its logs to independent security analysts so that we know what actually happened. The public has a right to know. You can email the FCC’s Chief Information Officer asking for them to do this at &lt;David.Bray@fcc.gov&gt; or call 202-418-2020",technology
personalfinance,"I am $93,529.07 in debt and it's killing me. To save my life, I am now commencing DAY 1 of Operation Debt Freedom!...and I need YOUR help!!","Do you know what it's like to be 25 years old, and wake up everyday knowing that every dollar you make that day is going into someone else's pocket?

To be constantly playing catch-up and never making financial progress...

Just running in place, like a hamster on a wheel...

Struggling to keep pace before losing control and falling out of motion.

If you don't know this feeling, let me tell you...

It feels like $H*T.

There's really no worse feeling other than the feeling of feeling indebted to someone....

To know deep down that my life currently has negative value in the eyes of the bank's, credit card companies, federal government, and whomever else I owe money to.

But, I wasn't always completely broke...

I actually started making money at a young age by working unofficially at my father's convenience store.

It gave me the opportunity to learn how to serve customers and more importantly, the value of a hard earned dollar.

I mean, hell, I used to get down on my hands and knees, shine a light under the counter, and pull back all the loose change that customers dropped at the counter.

I always was good at making money, it was the spending part that I always had a hard time with.

It started off with the typical things teenagers buy...

An xBox, sports cards, hats, shoes, movie tickets, a stereo system, rims for my first car, etc.

You get the picture...

I was a spender, not a saver.

I always had to try to keep up with my more well-off friends and the social pressures that come along with being cool...

This carried over to university, where I partied my way through 5 years of a relatively expensive business degree until I finally graduated with $50k in student loan debt and no real idea what I wanted to do. 

During school, I always had at least 1-2 jobs and was working 32-40 hours while balancing a full-time schedule...

But was I able to save any money?

C'mon,you should know me by now...

HELL NO I didn't!

As a matter of fact, I ended up piling on another 12k in debt when I thought I knew how to trade stocks and options, and took out a personal loan from someone that believed in my skills...

Long story short, the only thing I know how to do was...lose money.

She ended up getting her money back, but it was at the expense of having to go to the bank and have one of my parents co-sign on a new loan to cover her lower interest rate personal loan.

That was one of the major turning points of my financial life.

From there, I never really got out of the hole, it's been a constant process to stay afloat the last couple of years...

I've always been able to find a job, and had a decent corporate management gig last year that was allowing me to chip away at my debt little by little, at least I was until my employer and I had a mutual disagreement on the direction of the business and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been working part-time jobs to get by, while all but ignoring and trying to forget about my debt. 

I also just recently began working a remote job, which has allowed me to move back home to my parent's basement (super cliche, I know haha...but it's necessary at this moment).

Today, I finally have decided to take the first step and to take MASSIVE ACTION by eliminating all $93,529.07 of my current debt in, what I am going to call...

Operation Debt Freedom.

But I can't do this alone...

This is going to be a long and difficult journey, and I will need surely need guidance to get started and send me off into the right direction…

Help from those that have went before me, climbed the mountain, and lived to tell the story... 

The legends, the heroes, the conquerors, the soldiers, the muthaf*ckin hustlers that refused to let this $h*t hold them down from living their lives.

So, What am I looking for?

I'm looking for serious advice, actionable tips, words of wisdom, traps to avoid, a strategy to win, and whatever else you can think of that you believe will help me get out of the red once and for all.

After much procrastination (because it makes me sick), I have finally went through and found out exactly how much I owe, at what interest rate, and the due date. 

You can see [HERE](http://imgur.com/wiYzreJ) that I have 4 credit cards, 10 federal student loans, 1 university loan, and 2 other private bank loans that were used for previous debt consolidation.

To help get the best advice for my specific situation...

Let's say I'm currently netting $2,400/mo from work with no expenses, and I also can pull in $600-2000 on any given month doing some side hustles.

So, with that said....

personalfinance,Should I live at home save money and payoff loans or move out on a small budget.,"So I am 24 y/o, I have roughly $55,000 in debt from college (paid off 15000 since I graduated last winter). I make ~$2000 a month with an addition 500 in quarterly bonus and a $2000+ plus bonus at the end of the year. My current monthly expenses are $500 dollars a month in loans (all interest rates are below 6%), about $120 in gas, $150 for gym membership, $90 for car insurance, and $150 for tolls. There is usually another 200-300 dollars in expenses for random stuff like car repairs, entertainment, food, and whatever else. for a Total of around $1300 which seems to be my average. I currently have $3500 in savings.

So I live at home, but I have a long (1 hr) each way commute across state lines to work. I am planning on going back to school to finish an engineering degree and It will end up costing me about $2400 a year at community college and then I am planning on transferring to a full time university and that will be a whole different situation.

I just don't really know what to do regarding my living situation. I don't want to be living at home because I am 24 and I need my own space, would like to live closer to where I work, where my friends are, ect. But if I move out ($400-500 in rent) my budget will get pretty tight with only a couple hundred dollars in savings a month ( if am lucky 300-400 ). If I can stick out living at home until December I could pay off another student loan and my gym contract will expire and that would save me about $200 a month. Also, my car has had some issues and I am not sure how much longer I can keep it around so I will probably need a new car in the next year and that will be a big hit on my savings. 

So should I just keep paying the same amount on my loans and not drop 5000 on paying one off to lower the monthly payment so I can buy a car? Should I stay at home as long as I can if I am gong to be going to school to keep my expenses as low as I can? Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Recent medical school graduate contemplating buying my first home,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit so please direct me else where if this is inappropriate. 

I am looking for general ""Do it"" or ""DON'T, you are crazy"" type advice. I currently have ~$340,000 in medical school debt and will start repaying that in about 5 months. I am moving to Columbus, OH for residency for the next 3 to 5 years. I qualify for a Physician Loan where I only need 3% down and has a 4.125% interest rate. I was looking to buy a home or condo between 80-115,000 (which I already have a lender and have been approved for more, this is just MY budget). As of right now, I have a very very small nest egg that I would save for any unforeseen homeowners expenses and would ask my dad for help with the downpayment and closing costs. My annual salary will be about 54,000 before taxes

On top of the question concerning adding more debt to my already monstrosity accumulated, I am contemplating buying site unseen. Now before I get a bunch of ""Absolutely not"" responses, hear out my rationale. I am looking mostly at condos that have HOAs and are considered well maintained. I have a seasoned and respectable real estate agent that I truly trust and she knows the area well, would tell me if I was investing in a bad property and is willing to live Skype the walk through and inspections etc. My other thought is that I would be in Columbus for 3-5 years at the most so I am not buying my forever home. As long as the roof isn't caving in, it doesn't need new plumbing or wiring, I could honestly live anywhere for 3-5 years. Lastly, the property values in Columbus are 25% lower than historical average for the area and the last 3 years have seen an increase in property values annually (it's listed as the #17 US city to invest in property because of the appreciation). That being said, even if I sold at year 4 to break even, it would be better than having rented for those years. Right? So I would like to buy something right now while I'm out of state so when I do move to Ohio, I don't have to rent short term, store my belongings and re-move in a few months once I found a place. 

With this amount of outstanding student debt, would you take the risk and buy or avoid the extra debt? And does anyone have stories of buying site unseen that worked out well???

There is only the principal investments of making the renovations, property taxes, landlord-related insurance, and maintenance costs.  

If we were to do this, I understand the liability of taking on a tenant and the responsibilities of being a landlord. We are seriously considering taking on those burdens. However, we are unsure of how to figure out whether it's worth it in the first place.  

Alternatively, we could use the money to renovate the major features of the house (updated kitchen, updated full bathroom, fresh paint, etc.) and sell it in a year or so.  

Or the third option, sell it as is for a slightly-below-average value compared to the local market, about $300-350k. That would be cash in hand to downsize and my mother could retire more comfortably. We may exercise this option in 10 or 20 years should we carry out the other options in the interim. 10 or 20 years will be when my mother will need to move into an elderly community (she will be in her early 80s)  

There is more to consider in all this, but my basic question for now is whether this makes as much sense as it seems for a homeowner with NO mortgage (property taxes are high, $10k/year). Neighborhood home values are high. The local real estate market has remained strong for decades and decades, and recovered just fine from the recent recession.

personalfinance,Sometimes it pays to overpay your state income tax.,"As many of you are probably aware, state income tax is deductible on the federal tax return for the year in which it is paid. If you you have a year of unusually high income such that it pushes you up into a higher federal tax bracket, it may be in your interest to intentionally overpay your state tax by making an estimated tax payment before year-end in order to receive a larger deduction. You can then claim a refund for the overpayment on your state tax return. 


A few things to be aware of:

1. The state tax refund will likely be taxable in the following year, so this is not a permanent deduction. It simply shifts taxable income from one year to the next. This may or may not be good for your specific circumstances.

2. The payment must be made before year-end in order to claim the deduction for that year. For example, if you made an estimated payment toward your 2017 state tax on January 15 of 2018, it would not be deductible until you file your 2018 tax return. 

3. Various factors can reduce your itemized deductions including the AGI phaseout and alternative minimum tax. If your deduction is limited, then there may be little to no benefit from prepaying. 

4. This is effectively making an interest free loan to your state. So if your cost of capital or ROI is greater than the net tax saved, then it is not in your interest to do so.

I strongly suggest discussing the matter with a qualified tax professional before taking action.",finance

Re: financial crisis

I recalling having read some [JEL](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jel)s and [JEP](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep)s back in the day that were like ""so basically, the financial crisis was just a bank run""

except instead of johnny next door [demanding his cash from Jimmy Stewart](http://eeweems.com/capra/_imagery/_wonderful_life/bank-run-wonderful-life.jpg), who replies that it's in neighbor fred's house

it was financial institutions going to other financial institutions, who replied they don't know where it is because turns out they didn't understand their portfolios that well either

my experience w/ undergrads so far is that when asked to explain the crisis, the explanations I get are

Bad home mortgage lending decisions ----&gt; housing market collapse ---&gt; a bunch of financial institutions lose their shirts on misc derivatives -----&gt; ???? -----&gt; unemployment

I think stressing the stuff in the ???? would be a good idea

Especially because my impression is that most serious policy makers think the ?????? is the important part

Even though huge %s of undergrads will explain that the plan to prevent a future financial crisis is to ban complicated derivatives and crack down on Freddie, Fannie, and mortgage markets in general

when really the focus of policy makers has been like, how do we prevent these situations where people freak the fuck out over counterparty risk unexpectedly ballooning, stuff like that

idk, just seems we ought to stress it

**ocamlmycaml**

the easy causal story is kind of hard because a lot of it is happening simultaneously

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=dBfr

**mrdannyocean**

what's the best summary of that '???', gorbachev?

stock market crash produces negative wealth effects, scares the shit out of everyone, hurts consumer confidence, people stop spending.  Banks stop giving loans, leading to lower business spending/investing and job cuts.  the consumer piece compounds and hits the businesses again, leading to further cuts.

is that basically what we should be imagining for the steps between 'financial institutions are in a panic and lose a ton of money' and 'unemployment is now 10%'?

also at the same time, consumers get scared and lose confidence and stop spending, consumers have more debt than they can handle, banks are not lending, and all of those things lead to businesses who have to layoff employees because cash flow is significantly down

basically, is there a component of this that is consumer-demand driven?

**roboczar**

i don't know if that's a robust behavioral story. the movements of the stock market don't tend to drive consumer behavior

losing a job due to a drop in access to credit for firms, yes

**mrdannyocean**

yeah the stock market thing is probably not the most serious cause

the corporate credit crunch is likely far more impactful

I do think generally reduced consumer spending could play some role even though the credit crunch mattered more.  That consumer impact could be from a few factors - sudden spike in defaults, loss of confidence, etc.

And so at the worst possible time, consumers are all the sudden pulling back from spending

**gorbachev**

well, my understanding from the JEPs and JELs is that the ???? is something like

some institutions lose their shirts ----&gt; other banks look at their assets, begin worrying about which of their counter parties actually can pay up ----&gt; big freeze up in trading and lending between financial firms ----&gt; commercial paper &amp; repo markets freeze up too slash experience what is essentially a bank run

by that point things are so fucked that we essentially don't have a financial system for a while, companies like walmart only got the capital to meet payroll because the fed stepped in

so that's the part of the ?????? that escalates the financial shock into a financial crisis

**roboczar**

yeah i agree. it was basically a wholesale heart attack in the credit markets

firms can't meet operational costs across the entire economy, and then everyone's fucked

**gorbachev**

then you need the part of the ?????? that turns the financial crisis into unemployment

I know less about that, but I'm guessing ""no credit"" goes a long way

also industry specific shocks like to home building. housing wealth shocks. whatever

**ocamlmycaml**

here's a busier chart with more financials

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=dBfY

**roboczar**

firms basically run on short term lines of credit, not revenue

**gorbachev**

yeah, iirc literally walmart wouldn't have made payroll if the fed hadn't stepped in and either made them a short term loan or otherwise done something to bail out the commercial paper markets

anyway, I would mention that there are cool papers tracing the propagation of unemployment across the country following the GR

like, you can pick specific places and say ""the great recession started here, in terms of unemployment""

and then you can see unemployment basically transmit across input output linkages

from place to place

**roboczar** 

anecdotally, the company i helped found in the mid-2000s essentially started its death spiral when the bank we were getting a revolving line of credit from unilaterally converted it to a term loan, effectively strangling us to death

due to the GFC

we basically went running hat-in hand to any VC firm that would have us, and eventually fire sold when we were all out of options

that was fun

**gorbachev**

woof

**geerussell**

Shouldn't overlook the role of fraud in amping up the magnitude of the crisis. From origination to conveyance to securitization a lot of questionable-to-outright-illegal stuff had to happen to keep feeding the beast with new loans.

Also mrdannyocean, with regards to wealth effects, there was a very direct one as people were literally spending home equity with lines of credit and other financial products allowing it to directly provide purchasing power as opposed to simply ""feeling"" richer and spending more out of current income.

**gorbachev**

realistically speaking, how much did fraud really contribute to the size of the housing bubble? do we have something like

state level variation in the degree of regulatory stringency, have related to the magnitude of the housing market correction?

That seems imperfect - hmm, something else?

I'm skeptical that fraud played a large role

I'd almost imagine causality running in the opposite direction

big booming housing market that seems to be showering $ on anyone walking near it

------&gt; fraudsters want in

**roboczar**

i think it would be more likely that, while fraud did happen, the state of people's debt wasn't necessarily a concern, because they had incomes. It became a problem with the state of their incomes changed due to a credit freeze brought on by ?????

geerussell

Fraudulent appraisals were key in keeping year-over-year home values on the march. Fraudulent origination helped feed the raw material of new loans into the securitization pipeline. Things like MERS and simply ignoring tax constraints in securitization provided a lot of extra bandwidth. Not to mention the conflict of interest in ratings agencies paid by the same people who create the products being rated and the abstraction of ratings from credit evaluation to models provided by the people creating the products. Etc, etc.

**roboczar**

so yeah, fraud was an issue, but it was dwarfed by the substantial change in circumstances for holders of consumer debt that were now unemployed

**geerussell**

It's not either/or though.

Not all the people even had incomes, ninja loans were a thing.

**roboczar**

do we have stats on how much of a thing though

like i'm skeptical it was endemic

**geerussell**

It doesn't have to be endemic to set the pace.

**gorbachev**

I'm skeptical, but I should probably also acknowledge that my skepticism of the fraud explanation is partly politically motivated

in particular, I see people w/ the fraud explanation as like

delivering cover for bad policy

like, the number of finance bro undergrads

that come into my office and are like

the trouble with the GR was that some bad hombres defrauded some poor people with subprime loans

but for the bad hombres, there would have been no GR

and my intuition is that if we shot all the bad hombres, the housing bubble would have been 5% smaller but that the size of the GR may have been about the same

**ocamlmycaml**

anyways, I post these charts because it's worth thinking about pre-Sep 2008 and post-Sep 2008.

liquidity had declined, but you don't see catastrophic TED or equity volatility until Lehman/AIG

in early 2008, some people at the Fed were legit worried about inflation

**gorbachev**
 
so my natural instinct is to be like, disregard fraud, address structural weaknesses

**geerussell**

More like but for fraud the GR might have been the gR ... or maybe just the R.

That is, fraud raised the magnitude.

**mrdannyocean**

i'm less inclined to blame outright fraud and more inclined to blame ninja loans
 
and loans that just should not have been given

**geerussell**

ninja loans are outright fraud

**mrdannyocean**

are they?  I'm not certain what the legality of them was at that time

there may have been a regulation that said 'hey check for income you guys' but it was not enforced at all

raising the issue of defacto vs de jure legality

**geerussell**

The absence of regulation in which fraud flourishes is itself a structural weakness.

**ocamlmycaml**

fraud is pretty broad. lot of firms didn't have a great grasp of the risk on their balance sheets. is that fraud?

**roboczar**

yeah i think the only way to answer this is to see if we have studies on the depth of fraud pre crisis, and figure out how to define fraud

is just being inattentive toward the makeup of your assets fraud? not sure

**gorbachev**

geerussell,  claiming the GR would have been markedly smaller in magnitude but for fraud

is actually quite a large claim, and one that I think requires substantial evidence to support

because fraud only is relevant at the stage of ""pumping up the size of the housing bubble""

**geerussell**

Sure, and the bigger the bubble, the bigger the bust.

**gorbachev**

but it's a) unclear how large the contribution of fraud to the housing bubble actually was

and b) unclear that the relationship you just suggested

namely, a linear or other such relationship between bubble size and financial crisis size - it's unclear that that is correct

For example, it's perfectly possible that you merely need a housing bubble above some threshold size to kick off a financial crisis

I mean, consider the chain of events sketched out earlier in the conversation:

Bad home mortgage lending decisions + fraud ----&gt; housing market collapse ---&gt; a bunch of financial institutions lose their shirts on misc derivatives -----&gt; some institutions lose their shirts ----&gt; other banks look at their assets, begin worrying about which of their counter parties actually can pay up ----&gt; big freeze up in trading and lending between financial firms ----&gt; commercial paper &amp; repo markets freeze up too slash experience what is essentially a bank run -----&gt; across the board credit crunch  + at the same time industry specific shocks, like to construction + at the same time, big wealth shock ----&gt; unemployment

It's possible that a housing bubble that was +-5% in terms of the amount of distortion could map into a financial crisis of the same size

since the housing bubble bursting is in many ways just the trigger for this longer string of events

**geerussell**

Chain: Origination -&gt; securitization -&gt;ratings -&gt; sale of risky securities to risk-free buyers

**ocamlmycaml**

perhaps counterfactually, was there anything the Fed / Treasury could have done in mid-2008 to stem the severity of the recession?

**roboczar**

well, i know how post-keynesians would have answered that :stuck_out_tongue:

**geerussell**

They could have unclogged the housing market with mortgage cramdowns and a firm hand in foreclosures.

Instead of the combination of housing stock rot and financial damage for both borrowers and lenders as a kind of limbo dragged on for several years.

**roboczar**

i don't think either of those are in the Treasury or Fed's purview though?

i know it's not in the Fed's

**geerussell**

gorbachev, what I'm suggesting is the kind of 20%-ish year over year house price increases we had when the bubble was cresting would've been a lot smaller without fraud to feed it.

At each step of that chain.

**gorbachev**

This is sort of a sidebar, but I would imagine that the effect of fraud would be less on average price but more on who has a house. 


**geerussell**

You could also see it in dramatic escalation of price-to-income

**gorbachev**

Like, fraud I would think largely would contribute to increases in lending at the low end of the market, while I assume average house price increases are mainly driven by gains at the top?

That sidebar being put away, my point is just that it seems perfectly possible to me that any housing bubble where prices are, say, &gt;=X% higher than whatever than the ""true"" price
 
might be sufficiently large to trigger the chain of events that converts the housing bubble into a credit crunch

I would add I think it's super difficult to justify a dose-response relationship between housing bubble size and bust size, so to speak

I mean, imagine a counterfactual world where there are no derivatives and 100% transparency about every firm's asset ledgers

in that world, the dose response relationship makes sense - more mortgages going bust = bigger wealth effect on consumers and more assets going bad on bank ledgers

**geerussell**

In that counterfactual world it's more self-limiting because risk-averse asset holders aren't scooping up high-risk assets.

**roboczar**

NBFIs existing makes all this a lot harder and more complicated.

**gorbachev**

but the mechanisms that seem to have escalated the fin crisis hinge critically on how the housing market collapse

interacted with misc derivatives and with the sheer amount of uh, non-transparency of financial institution asset sheets

and completely freezing credit

**mrdannyocean**

especially how it ended up impacting the financial paper markets

**gorbachev**

Like, a housing market collapse is one thing, but if I just could look at your books and be like

oh okay, you're down 10%, I understand what your position is and what mine is

it wouldn't be so bad relative to all of your financial institutions suddenly having no clue who is a low risk counterparty or even what their own situation is

and that's sort of the crux of the credit crunch issue

**geerussell**

That's why a pipeline of financial alchemy where garbage goes in one end and comes out AAA from the other was such a doomsday engine.

An endless supply of risky borrowers feeding a boundless appetite for risk-free assets.

**gorbachev**

you need the housing bubble to trigger it, but it seems plausible that several different sized housing bubbles could have mapped into a similarly sized financial crisis
 
because on some level the size of the fin crisis was less about # subprime loans or whatever and more about the interlinkages between financial firms, the poorly understood structure of derivatives, etc

and i mean, you don't need fraud for that to blow up basically. like people were dumb enough to believe in the garbage ----&gt; AAA alchemy, even without fraud

**ocamlmycaml**

people acted as if MMFs weren't runnable at all

**gorbachev**

As a firm, I could honestly have sold you trash and if the contract around it was fancy enough, you were all in

Don't get me wrong, there are good independent reasons to want to crack down on fraud, but it doesn't seem to me like a very important part of the GR story. not enough to send us from GR ---&gt; R I mean

**geerussell**

It's kind of important as gasoline on the fire.

**gorbachev**

It's not clear to me that that analogy is appropriate.

**geerussell**

At the start of the pipeline a steady and growing supply of new origination was needed. The analogy applies to the extent that fraudulent origination kept it fed with new loans and rising prices.

A lot of corner cutting was needed to move all that volume through into securitization. That corner cutting also fed the size and made it harder to clean up afterwards.

**gorbachev**

I mean, but what's the evidence on a) how many loans were issued that would not have been, but for fraud and b) on whether or not that difference in quantity of loans made a difference in terms of translating the housing bubble into a financial crisis

**geerussell**

Fitch gives a nice 2007 canary in the coal mine overview of how fraud factored in here 

http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/FraudReport8Nov07Fitch.pdf

**ocamlmycaml**

I think this where a model would be helpful.  An ""overdetermined system"" if you will

**geerussell**

The FCIC report also gets into a number of relevant issues, including appraisal fraud 

https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf

**gorbachev**

okay, so, can we just step back a minute on that fitch report and think about what they're saying

3 million loans, 16k apparently w/ fraud.  within an ultra small sample of subprimes, they claim a high fraud rate

but then to get to their really big headline #s on subprime residential mortgage backed securities

the ""fraud is 25% of the underperformance"" thing, they're basically attributing the residual in their regressions to fraud

So if we sum that up, we have a ratings agency trying to argue that it's not that their subprime MBS ratings were wrong - it's just that they were right but that they got duped by fraudsters

I'm not saying my faith in the financial industry is low, but given that it seems rating agency conflicts of interest, among other issues, contributed to the brutally bad ratings of misc derivatives

**geerussell**

Ratings agencies were complicit but at a different stage far removed from origination.

**gorbachev**

I'm not totally sure I buy a rating agency trying to pin their failure on fraud by random poor people putting the wrong shit on applications while bankers turn a blind eye.

Like this just seems like the most self-interested, pass-the-buck style answer

and given the evidence is in large part them interpreting a residual.........

**geerussell**

blind eye/actively pursuing it. If no regulator is going to rap you on the knuckles for it, it's very profitable.

**gorbachev**

also wasn't the problem not that like, subprimes were crappier than expected on the margin

and more like, people literally thought subprimes were 0 risk if bundled together?

**geerussell**

That was a problem too and where ratings agencies were complicit.

**gorbachev**

like, maybe fraud meant that each asset's return should be downrated by x%, but fraud isn't responsible for why those risks were correlated

and the correlation across risk is what made CDOs and stuff risky as hell, and missing that correlation issue was big......

**geerussell**

They kind of go hand in hand. Fraudulent appraisals support garbage loans that feed risky MBS where the risk is obfuscated.

I don't buy the ""random poor people"" story either, it took actively dishonest lenders to keep it going. From the FCIC report for example:

&gt;Some real estate appraisers had also been expressing concerns for years. From 2000 to 2007, a coalition of appraisal organizations circulated and ultimately delivered to Washington officials a public petition; signed by 11,000 appraisers and including the name and address of each, it charged that lenders were pressuring appraisers to place artificially high prices on properties. According to the petition, lenders were “blacklisting honest appraisers” and instead assigning business only to appraisers who would hit the desired price targets.",finance

ethereum,"Populism, monetary policy and ether","Hey folks,

My thoughts are just thoughts, and I'm hoping to invite others to think deeper about ether, or blockchain in general, into the greater depths of the future. 

---------

Backstory: work at an international bank, had a fireside chat with the CEO, made a few connections.

A primary point he made was that beneath the face of the Western populism rise (Trump, Le Pen, Brexit, etc), and the general sentiment, a rather angry one, behind it was that the emotion generally arises from the middle class not feel accomplished for their contribution to society. That's the obvious part that we all hear about.

What he made a fascinating point was a macroeconomic and financial problem; asset prices are increasing and wages are lagging, and the gap continues to grow between affordability and wealth. This, he claims, is brought about by globalization and a perpetual state of experimental monetary policy.

Here is where ether, and the decentralizing effect of blockchain currency, can be a solution not to just monetary policy issues, but the political, social and cultural issues that seem to divide the world today. 

Decentralizing central banking policy could lift controlling hands in interest rates, money supply; moving from all the way back to gold Mercantilism to Bretton Woods, to the Smithsonian system, to the overly inflating, artificial QE fiat money that is in place today, it makes all economies more united; which can go both ways, a widespread recession will be even deeper than a world run by fiat money.

The world will no longer be a monetary policy experiment, policies.  

Ether is the progeny to the problems we have come across from globalization and a rather pathetic monetary policy in the world, one that has exacerbated inequality;  this is a product that may bring back purchasing power to a hidden recession in lower classes.

btc,The simplest way to fix transaction malleability (without witness commitment),"Yesterday /u/ABlockInTheChain posted an nice idea on [how to fix malleability in the simplest way](/r/btc/comments/69s2wf/the_right_way_to_fix_transaction_malleability/?st=j2h7i2bs), (similar to [this](https://github.com/tomasvdw/bips/blob/master/malleability-fix.mediawiki))

In that thread /u/dskloet convinced me of a rather crazy but *very* interesting idea to make it much simpler:

*There is no need to commit the witness data to the block hash!*

This means that the only change needed to segregate the witness is effectively:

    IF IsSegWitHFActivated(block)
      txid = Hash(tx-data-minus-input-scripts)
    ELSE
      txid = Hash(tx-data)

This same TXID can be used not only for previous output references, but *also* for the merkle-root and protocol messages.

The idea is *very* counter intuitive as we are accustomed to the idea that all block validity dependencies are committed to the block hash, and this seems a too powerful idea to abandon, but thinking it through it doesn't seem to matter at all. Compare currently,

&gt; The merkle root is valid if there exists a set of transactions that are valid in the block and hash to the merkle root.

with now,

&gt; The merkle-root is valid if there exists a set of transactions-without-sigs that hash to the merkle root, and a set of signatures that make these transactions valid in the block. 

Conceptually, there is no difference at all. The transactions and their signatures are needed to proof block validity. 

As for invalidity, this does mean that an *invalid* signature must be treated in the same way as a *missing* transaction: as insufficient data to verify the block. It can not be directly proofed to be invalid, but as this is the same with a missing transaction, it doesn't increase the attack surface.

One  caveat is that the block-size could be malleated, so we should either exclude the signatures (and limit by sigops) or remove the block size limit first (if we can ever agree on that).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I Surrender My Whole Life Insurance?,"Like many people, my parents bought into buying life insurance for their kids. Poor decision from the get go. They've been paying it for 26 years and just handed it over to me to do with it what I want. We all know it was a bad idea and there won't be any hard feelings if I decide to surrender it for the cash value. If I had a time machine, I'd go back and tell them not to do it, because after 26 years of payments totaling $1731, the policy has a cash value of $1749.

That's pretty paltry, and my first instinct was to surrender the policy. However, because this was bought in the early 90s, the guaranteed rate is 5%. Considering that I've got my Netspends, Mango, Insight, and Northpointe maxed out, plus a few smaller places with 5%+ rates and CCU is still too much of a hassle for me, I'm tempted to keep it. I did the math for the previous year. $59 of the cash value growth was due to growth of the account (in addition to $66 worth of ""growth"" due to premiums). That comes out to 3.6% annual growth. Better than LMCU which is my current lowest yielding account (not counting my day-to-day checking account), but worse than an index fund.

I took a crash course on Whole Life and [White Coat Investor had the best summary on what to do with an existing policy](https://whitecoatinvestor.com/how-to-dump-your-whole-life-policy/). Two sections of that article applied to me: had it for a long time, and tiny policy. He says to keep old policies and fund them to the MEC limits (this will asymptotically grow my interest rate to the guaranteed 5%). He says to not worry about tiny policies and to sell them off to get rid of the hassle.

I'm currently leaning heavily on the Keep and Fund to MEC Limits option, since the 5% rate is nice, and the current 3.6% rate is OK and growing. Also, I already have so many accounts that I may as well have another one to add to the mix. This certainly won't be the straw that broke the camel's back. However, I would like someone with an outside perspective to give me a sanity check and make sure I'm not throwing good money after bad.

PS. I'm single and don't have children. The death benefit doesn't do anything for me now as I have more than enough other assets that could be used to pay my funeral expenses in the event of my untimely demise. I do eventually plan on having a (hopefully large) family, but then the $15,000 face value will be pitifully small, even with additional contributions, and not enough to replace my income for my future dependents. As such, I'm considering the portion of the premium that went to insurance as opposed to increasing the cash value to be a pure loss.


TL;DR:
Parents got a Whole Life Insurance policy on me as a child. Cash value return over 26 years is .03% annual. Cash value return on previous year was 3.6%. Guaranteed returns of 5%. I don't need the life insurance part of this.

litecoin,Facts remain: BTC is doomed without segwit. LTC already has segwit.,"Doomed when it comes to mainstream usage because of no scaling (even tho it will remain #1 coin as immutable crypto gold).

No amount of dumping will change the facts:

1) Is BTC going to get segwit? No, at least not anytime soon (years?)

2) Is LTC segwit ready? Yes

3) Once more and more people want to use crypto and they see the slow speed and high fees of BTC, are they going to use it when you can use LTC which is the same but faster and cheaper and actually viable for OTC payments with LN? Yes

The idiots claming ""b-but LTC has no transaction volume so it doesn't need segwit"". Well think again dumbass. You upgrade the protocol before it's too late, or you end up with a clusterfuck (BTC)

You don't try to make your homework on the last day, or you fuck up. LTC has already done all the homework and can enjoy the summer. BTC will collapse due UASF stress.

As people get fed up of slow ass, expensive BTC, they will start using LTC, and you'll have your transaction volume going up with no uncertainty due drama about how to scale it because LTC can already scale infinitely due segwit + LN.

Meanwhile, BTC will have to go through endless drama to get segwit activated. There are hardforks, UASF, chain splits, 51% attacks, BUcoin and other shitty competing clients in between BTC getting segwit or not.

While this drama unfolds, price will crash, meanwhile LTC will smooth-sail through it and will become an hedge against it.

BTC will remain #1 most likely, since it will remain the gold of crypto and the fact that it's so hard to change (immutable) is a positive to meet this goal, but not so much for mainstream everyday usage, so this doesn't mean the price isn't going to correct and LTC will reach new ATH's 100% guaranteed because there is no drama in LTC which means no uncertainty + constant good news in a post-segwit environment with new technology being applied in real life instead of testnet, and more and more developers moving there since, as admitted by Gregory Maxwell, developing script stuff for BTC without segwit is a waste of time.",cryptocurrency

At the end of 2016, I received 2 direct deposits, totaling about $2K. After over a month of consistent calls with their India Call Center, I was finally connected to someone in the USA who sent me an email instructing to mail a personal check for the amount, which I did. 

In February of 2017, I received a physical check for the total ~$2K amount-I wrote VOID on the check and didn't bother following up. 
This month, I received another direct deposit for the ~2K amount. 

I know it's unethical to keep this money, and I plan to return it. However I'm worried about the implications of receiving a W-2 in 2018 for these amounts - which would lead to federal w/h implications.

Other possibly relevant info, as per chase, my credit score is about 730.  I pay about $520 for my car loan and insurance (the car stays, it gets me to work in a location only a car will get to). And i make about 50,000 a year before tax",finance
personalfinance,"Buying first apartment, how much to down pay? (opportunity cost)","Hi all, I am trying to figure out which route I should take - 5%, 20% or 40% downpayment (40% is my max, aka all my savings). I have 100K in savings. Amortization period is 25 years. Interest rate is 2.39%.
I might sell after 5 - 8 years, but really don't know bout that yet!


If I downpay 40%, all my money is down but my monthly payments are down to $885 a month.


If I downpay 5%, that is 15K down, 285K in mortgage + 11.4K in insurance. This equates to $1312 a month in payments. However, I keep 85K of my savings to invest. Assuming a return of 5% on a conservative mutual fund, that makes me 23K after 5 years. However, over the 5 years I am paying 25.6K more in mortgage payments. So the investment gains are outweighed by the increased mortgage.


If I downpay 20%, that's 60K down, $1062 a month in payments. I keep 40K of my savings to invest. Assuming a return of 5% on a conservative mutual fund, that makes me 11K after 5 years. Over the 5 years, I am paying $10620 more in mortgage payments, which is a bit less than the investment gains.

So does it seem most reasonable to downpay 20%? Or should I downpay all 100K to have more cash left over at the end of the month? 

What am I missing? Please be nice, I really am no expert and just starting to try figuring this out.

Essentially all our discretionary income after regular expenses / fun expenses has been going to pay off my wife’s loans, and we have knocked out about $20,000 in the past year. We do spend quite a bit on “fun” as well (snowboarding, golf, eating out, mountain bikes, vacations etc.), and while we want to continue doing these things we want to be more aware of how much we are spending.


We try to maintain a cash balance of $15k-$25k, and when it is higher near $25k, we dump some money into the student loans. We are on the cusp of dramatically increasing our earning potential one year from now (increase $50-$75k) as she is finishing a medical residency.

This is spread out over 16 Federal loans, with interest rates ranging from 3.86% - 7.2%. She is working in a nonprofit and plans to stay in the nonprofit world for at least 10 years (she currently plans on doing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness). She currently makes about 50k with room to grow in a few years. Originally, she budgeted about $800-$1000/month to go towards loans. She is about to start making payments (just graduated) and is automatically enrolled in the graduated repayment plan, which is approximately ~$800/month to start. If she were to do the standard repayment plan, the payments are ~$1200/month.  To qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness she would need to consolidate her loans and enroll in income based repayment. This payment would be around $400/month. I'm concerned because this payment doesn't even come close to covering the interest payments and I'm not too sure about the future of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. My worry is that after paying less than the interest for many years, the program will end and she'll be stuck with a ton of debt. I've read a lot about the debt avalanche approach and I'm leaning towards that. The downside to doing the debt avalanche is that theoretically she could have her loans forgiven in 10 years on PSLF and unnecessarily pay way more than she has to. Should she consolidate and do the PSLF and pay way less than interest and bank on getting her loans forgiven? Or should she attempt the debt avalanche approach? She is currently paying down all her CC debt but she needs to make a decision on this soon.  
Budget info: 
Income/month: $2900 
All expenses per month (food, rent, CC debt, etc): ~$2100-$2400

Excerpt from the article:

1.	Vanguard loses 10-15% of its AUM, an enormous outflow in a very compressed period of time as newly-minted passives realize that they're not quite cut out to be passive after all. The pain will prove too much for many recent indexing dilettantes who thought this was easy.

2.	Reporters will be doing stories on the performance of the large robo-advisors and their ""terrible"" performance. Vanguard, Schwab, Betterment and Wealthfront will all be under the microscope.

3.	Paul Singer and his fund Elliot Management, which just raised $5 billion in cash in 24 hours to take advantage of a coming major dislocation, will be on everyone's lips. They'll be the new hedge fund It Girl.

4.	Buffett will once again look like a genius as he puts some of his $95 billion in cash to work.

5.	Some lucky doom-saying charlatan who's been wrong about the market for 8 years will cherry-pick some of his crash comments and attempt to be the new guru of the moment. It won't work as well as last time though because these days we have social media – we have the receipts, player.

6.	Many financial advisors, especially those who are mainly asset managers, will have trouble convincing clients to hang on to their portfolios. The mass disillusionment with risk assets will return faster than expected.

7.	Tactical strategies will come back into favor, as will the subset of liquid alts that posts the smallest drawdowns.

8.	Gold will rise $200 or $300 an ounce, GLD inflows will explode. TLT will be the new momentum trade.

9.	Trump will call for Janet Yellen's head on Twitter, accusing the Fed of hurting the markets to influence the 2018 midterms. She will announce plans to serve out the rest of her term (til January) and then resign, if this happens before then.

10.	The yen will blow out to the upside vs the euro, wrecking stocks on both continents as contagion fears hit the headlines.

11.	Faber and Schiff will be brought back on to mainstream financial television, rescued from the web video hits they've been relegated to in recent years.

12.	The long-short hedge fund crowd will get its ""I told you so"" moment, their investor letters will be dripping with schadenfreude for the indexing movement.

13.	Ordinary investors who have not learned from history will be listening to all the worst advice, and making temporary drawdowns into permanent losses.

14.	Ordinary investors who are listening to the right people will stay the course, or even up their dollar cost average contributions in 401(k)s. The truly intrepid ones will raise the equity proportion of their ongoing contributions to take advantage of the situation.

15.	We will once again be told that buy and hold is dead. It will take the next 100% bull market from the future lows in order to resurrect the idea of indexing and passive investing. Lots of money will have been lost chasing holy grail strategies between the bottom and then.",finance

I work at a job that pays $11.10 an hour bi-weekly plus commission on the last paycheck of every month. My commission is .075% of whatever I make for the month so slow months it is only an extra $300. Roughly I make $1200 a month.    

I have one credit union credit card with a $5,500 limit, with about $1500 on there. I have a savings account with about $5000. I still live with my parents, no rent.    

I am open to any advice. My monthly expenses are hard to track because of several setbacks- Costa Rica trip that became more expensive then planned because we had to change flights ($500 over budget), bedbugs from a Costa Rica ($900 replacement mattress and frame, bed was beyond saving and $300 room treatment), and a few health issues ($400 roughly). I also did not have health insurance last year so my tax return is going to be nothing (maybe $200 from state, $100 federal). 
I need a car, but I have learned from past experiences buying a junker usually does not work out. Our Honda has 300,000 miles on it and is constantly in for repair.   

I guess my question is how do people normally save for their first big purchase? Should I try to pay it outright or put all my savings as a down payment? What can I do to see what I can even afford at this point? Should I look at financing through my credit union or though wherever I buy at car? Is CarMax really the best place to look for used cars?   

I am trying to find a better paying job because I want to (afford to) go back to college but leaving a stable job right as I want to make a big purchase seems like a bad idea.

The total cost of attending with tuition, room+board, ect is about 33,000. My dad is willing to pay as much as he can for UCI, but in the end it might not be much. 



For Emory University, they offered me ~10000 combined from grants, work-study, and federal sub and unsub loans which I'm not sure about the differences, and the total cost after tuition, room + board,  ect is ~66,700. 



My question is whether or not it's worth it to go to Emory because talking to alumni who have gone there, they say the support and counselors are much better compared to what alumni from UCI have told me, and it was definitely worth the money but many of those came from families that could afford to pay. If I attend, my family says I'll have to take out student loans and I'm not sure if it's worth the amount of debt I'll rack up which could be over 200k. However, Emory does reconsider financial aid every year and if i do well i could earn larger scholarships I won't have as much debt. 



How feasible is it to pay off the debt after college, and if I do decide to attend Emory, how would I pay it off?



My major is undecided, and I'm really open to anything but I'll probably end up somewhere in the sciences",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans: Consolidate? PSLF?,"I know there is quite a bit of information out there already and I have looked at alot of stuff just still not quite sure what my best route is.
Just Graduated from Nursing School, it is a second degree.
Loans ~ 100,000 all stafford spread between 10 loans w/ interest rates ranging from 2.5-7 split between two servicers
I will be starting my new job at the beginning of August
I will start at 60k a year before taxes (this does not include shift differentials, overtime, and I will have a second job)
Other Numbers
I currently have about 1k in credit card debt, own a car outright that I will drive till it falls apart hopefully another ~3yrs, Rent and bills ~700 a month though my rent could certainly go up as my current living situation is unlikely to last more than another year or two. 

Basically I see two routes I can either consolidate and enter an IBR plan and apply for PSLF (most jobs in my field qualify) and just ride it out paying minimums for ten years 
or 
I can grind and just put everything I can towards this huge number to try and get it down asap.

Does anybody know if PSLF will count towards loans from a previous degree?

What would you all recommend?  At what pay rate does IBR render itself useless?  I could be making close to three figures in 5 years or so, would there still be any benefit to IBR?   

No matter what way I go with student loans I plan on continuing to live cheaply, pay off my credit card, build an emergency fund and put money into retirement.

gaming,PS4 X-Inverted Controller Option Game Tracking,"So, I'm getting completely frustrated and miffed to the point I've given up and gotten myself a Gamefly subscription.

Why, you ask?

There is just *no way* for a gamer like myself, who needs *both* the X &amp; Y axes to be inverted, to find out whether a specific game offers the X-axis inversion because most of these games already include the Y-axis inversion.

And I keep buying/renting games that do not offer this option:  TitanFall 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Wolfenstein, and a few others I've come to be completely disappointed with.

Without further ado, I'm going to be listing games that do offer X-axis inversion for those who need the same requirements that I do.  Hopefully this can be an one-stop center to quickly find whether the game someone wants has the X-inversion option.

&gt; **FIRST-PERSON:**

* Alien: Isolation
* Borderlands The Pre-Sequel!
* Borderlands 2
* Borderlands: Handsome Collection (the above two games in a collection and then some)
* Destiny
* Mass Effect: Andromeda

&gt; **THIRD-PERSON:**

* Grand Theft Auto V
* Gravity Rush 2
* Last Of Us, The (Remastered)
* Resident Evil 4
* Resident Evil 5
* Resident Evil 6
* Witcher III: Wild Hunt

If anybody knows for sure in regards to whether a game offers the X-inversion option, chime in and I'll add it to either the first- or third-person games.  Anything at this point would help me and my wallet!

personalfinance,Help! Need advice on student debt!!,"So I'm 23 and have been out of college for a little over a year now. I have almost 90K in student loan debt from two different lenders (Sallie Mae and Great Lakes). I deferred them both but my deferment is now over for my Sallie Mae loans. I have been making payments on it for two months now. Great Lakes loans were deferred for a year but aren't of much concern due to the rates.

My Sallie Mae loans are killing me with interest!! Almost $500/month accrues in interest. Here are the details of the five loans:
 • $14,276.84 at 9.375%
 • $11,649.58 at 9.500%
 • $4,972.64 at 9.500%
 • $22,958.50 at 10.875%
 • $5,075.31 at 10.875%

So as you can see the interest rates are preposterous! I tried refinancing twice now but was declined both times. My credit is good, but not great because I've never really have had the chance to build credit. The most recent application I sent in for refinancing was declined because high debt to low income (first full time job that I started off at 36K) and low savings (no shit! I'm making $1,000+ payments every month).

So far I've made two payments totaling close to $4,000. Unfortunately only $3,000 went to paying down the principal :(. It's becoming really frustrating and I'm just looking for some advice or answers. Let me know if there's any other input I can add to help explain my situation.

personalfinance,Small Student Loan Question,"Hello and thank you for reading,

I was recently made aware that I have $9,000 in student loans, they were taken out by a parent who didn't inform me of the loans. THAT IS NOT WHY I'M HERE. I am not interested in legal action. I am looking for advice on the best way to pay this off as I have a few different options. I just received a new position in which I will be making a solid salary, but I hate paying interest so I am looking to get these paid off as soon as possible. I would be able to pay these off within a year with little financial burden on myself, but have discovered a few other issues along the way.

The loans vary in size, but are all direct subsidized loans from Navient:

1.Current Balance $1,861.58 Interest Rate 3.860%

2.Current Balance $1,808.35 Interest Rate 4.660% 

3.Current Balance $3,637.98 Interest Rate 4.660% 

4.Current Balance $896.58 Interest Rate 4.290% 

5.Current Balance $896.58 Interest Rate 4.290% 

Option 1: Pay them off using my salary. Not ideal because of the interest I will accrue.

Option 2: I have an I bond from when I was younger that is worth a good amount of money now (Much more than my loans), but it is earning interest at 6.24% and this is where I start to get conflicted. If I would have known about the loans I would have cashed the bond when my federal income tax would not be in the 25% bracket AND the fact you cannot get a guaranteed return that high anywhere. The idea of it is simply throwing away money to me.

I know this seems like the most illogical use for the bond, but like I stated previously I just want these loans out of the picture. The high rate and risk-free nature of the bond I'm currently receiving makes me cringe when seeing what I would earn if I were to cash it and reinvest the same face amount @ 1.87%.

Option 3: Ask for a family member to cover the current debt costs. I have family members who can cover the cost of this debt and I can pay them back with very little or no interest. This seems like the best and most logical option to me.

My main concern is that the fact my income will be starting at the upper end of the 25% federal income tax bracket leading to the bonds real rate of return diminishing by the time I actually redeem it. This leads to the assumption that I will have a successful career and in turn leads me to think cashing the bond now might be the best idea. Another question that I have not been able to find out from a CPA is whether or not the bond will qualify for tax-free status. I have heard mixed answers that it is only tax-free when it goes directly to a higher education institution, NOT a loan servicing company.

If anyone could provide some insight or thoughts on my situation I would greatly appreciate it as I don't want to look back and regret early redemption of the bond just because it is the easiest scenario.

1. I pulled my payoff amout as of 5/9, my monthly payment amount, interest rate, and # of months left and put them in a spreadsheet.
2. Then for each loan I take my monthly payment amount and multiply it by the number of months remaining to determine how much I'm going to pay with no prepayments. Compare that to the current payoff amount on each loan's website to see how much I save by paying up front now, and then divide the savings by the amount payoff amount to get an ""ROI"" like figure.

It all makes sense in my head. But I'm clearly doing something wrong. The loans with the highest interest rate have the worst ROI, and vice versa. And row #2 looks bogus - with only $4.2k to go, I surely don't have another $4.6k in interest remaining at 6%. Can anyone point out my error?

personalfinance,SO's financial adviser is recommending not fully paying off her student loans. Thoughts?,"Hi all. I'm looking for some long-term advice here. My SO is about to finish vet school and will be graduating with about 220k in educational debt. Nearly all her loans are unsubsidized federal loans that won't have any grace period before she has to start repaying them. The lending agency is offering to refinance them all into one lump amount with a staggering 5.75% interest rate BUT income-based payments. Meaning that with her current plan of doing an internship, her minimum monthly payments for the next 2 years will be next to nothing.

The problem here is that at that principle amount and her current income she is getting into negative amortization territory where it will become almost impossible to pay enough to even cover the loan interest every month.

Her financial adviser is recommending basically to just make the minimum payments for 20 years, invest about $300 a month in an IRA or some other long-term investment, and then when the loans get forgiven in 20 years, just pay the IRS the $60k she'll owe in debt forgiveness taxes, and be done with it. According to his simulations this is the method that results in the lowest total cost to her, and lowest effective interest rate paid.

Does this sound like sound advice? What other options would she even have? I find it hard to believe that this is the best option, but after looking at some simulations about how much her minimum payments would be, and how much she'd have to be paying to even just cover the interest every month, I just can't see how it would be possible to put a dent in this mountain. Even if she suddenly starts making 100k in her second year out of school, she'd have to switch to a 10-year standard repayment plan and be paying over 2500 a month towards her debt to get it paid off, which results in being done 10 years earlier, but a higher interest rate and higher amount paid than waiting for loan forgiveness.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"In a very shitty financial situation with work, can't afford to leave either. (UK)","I currently work in a pet shop, I live in a pretty poor run down area of the country, jobs are not easy to come by and unemployment is high. I originally started working at this pet shop through a work experience programme through unemployment benefit which I had been for 5 months since finishing college.

After my placement I continued to volunteer for 10 months, during this time I was praised about how much trust they had in me, and even ended up running the shop whilst they opened a second. I was began to be promised a job but it never happened, as well as saying i'm not good enough and require training. Still training never happened and I eventually got fed up, at the same time got offered my first job, a shitty factory job and left but work was work.. Money is money especially in this town.

A little time passes and the factory job begins to fall through, claiming there is no work whilst giving work to new employed people, (the agency work on a commission basis so the more people they 'employ' they get money for it. As well as a mental breakdown, I didn't want to stay but if I left instantly I'd have no job and unable to claim unemployment benefit due to fine print in contacts of the job. Basically in short I left a paying job even though it's 0 hour contract.

The pet shop offers me a job, but a training position as stated before.. which lasts a year, wage is shit, not even half minimum wage, which is legal because it's trainee wage, but I needed money and a stable job so I went back. Things seemed to go okay but now a year later. The training is basically over, waiting for all my work to be signed off, and once it is then my wage is due to rise, and it just seems to be making my life hell. Again I am apparently not good enough and just don't cut it, all whilst the boss sits at home doing nothing and complaining about not making enough money.
(before you all say that's what he pays you for, wrong, I'm the only payed staff member all others are volunteers, so he pays nobody other than me to run that shop all day and he sit at home, and I'm a trainee not a manager yet I've to answer phones, deal with social media, serve customers, manage staff and organise deliveries)
Not only that, the health of the animals doesn't come first and instead making money does as he refuses to treat animals that become ill and let's them die.

He is making my life a living hell, bitching about me behind my back to the volunteers staff about me taking 2 days paid holiday and calling me incredibly rude names behind my back. Also recently my boss has apparently also stated to a volunteer member of staff that if the shop doesn't improve he doesn't plan on paying me my full wage because i'm not earning it. He gets on my ass about any tiny mistake and honestly I don't want to carry on being there. But how he treats me and all this time just seems to be ways to stop paying me full minimum wage. 

I'm completely lost on what to do, as quitting my job will mean I'm back on unemployment, which I can't claim instantly because I left a paying job. Regardless if I claim or not I am then in an unemployed situation yet again for god knows how long, because of the shitty area, shitty economy and not being heavily qualified in anything which everywhere expects.

I know an obvious thing is just get up and move somewhere else where there is more opportunity, but not having any finances to do so, unemployment benefit will not provide enough to go find a place to live, furnish a place and afford all the bills to go along with it.

personalfinance,Home value has gone up ~75k in 2 years. Is there anything we should do?,"Hello /r/PersonalFinance!


My wife and I are first time home owners, and aren’t sure what to make of a steadily rising housing market in my area – our house has gone up quite a bit since we bought it in 2014, and it continues to climb.


Original Purchase Price: $120,000.

Currently owed: $110,000

Current “Estimated” Price: $195,000.

Interest Rate: 4.25%




We were close to refinancing with our current lender, and planned to take out the estimated value of the home as a sort of credit account (195k – 110k = 85k credit?), but we canceled last second because it was going to cost ~$4000 in origination fees, and it sounded fishy.




Selling seems nice since we’d make a profit, but all the other homes in my area are just as asinine in price as ours is, so we’d end up just using the profit as a down payment to get the loan down to what we could afford again. Also, I completely understand that “estimater” websites are just that – estimates; and that there are tons of costs that come with selling a house that would change the numbers around.




My question is, is there anything we should do? I am constantly told by co-workers to refinance and go for a lower interest rate, since I now have a ton of equity in the house…but to be honest I’m confused if it’s worth it or not.",finance

He pays $800 rent(recorded) monthly. [Not a problem tho, this can be omitted]. He's on disability and has no source of income. I don't want our house in PA to get foreclosed. nor do I want to see this man suffer.

In terms in housing, is there anyway I can help him out on his total mortgage payment + utilities + taxes etc... totaling to be: *$1800*. I'm thinking about refinance options for the house. Putting house in my name?. Should my dad file for bankruptcy? If so which chapter. (I'm sure he has more debt on top of the $60k Medical. And credit cards.) He owns a car that's paid off. And this house. 

**Myself:**I have $2000 saved. Weekly checks. of about $700 after tax, with new job that I got on 5/8/2017. Undergoing evaluation, might potentially raise to $950. My monthly expensive is $120 Transporation. $200~(probably less) groceries.

personalfinance,401k vs Additional mortgage payments,"Trying to decide whether I should put more in 401k or pay extra on my mortgage. 

Details:
I'm 32. Unmarried.  3 kids. Currently paying $500/ month in child support which will be ending later this summer. 

I make $66k. $30k in 401k. $2k in IRA. $700/ month goes to 401k. $100 to IRA.
I want to say 401k has earned about 6% per year.   

Bought my house for $119k. Balance of mortgage is $114k with 28.5 years left.  Home has appreciated to about $140k. I've set an arbitrary goal of paying off the house by the time I'm 40. Planning to refinance in 3-4 years down to a 15 year and drop PMI. Interest rate is 4.5%.

Kid's college is already funded. 

Only debt besides the house is my car. 

I have a solid safety net financially. 

I plan to put make an annual lump sum payment towards principle of at least $2000 annually.  If I pay an extra $500/month towards principle, payoff by 40ish is realistic. 

I could swing paying an extra $200 towards principle per month now,  and I'll have the extra $500/ month that I'm currently paying in child support soon. 

Should I put all this towards my mortgage? All towards retirement? Split it?

solar,"Seeking Advice: SolarCity, SunPower, or Local","First, thanks in advance for any advice. I'm looking forward to being of more help to this sub after we get this installed and get familiar with it all.

**Advice Needed:**

I'd like to know whether anyone has good or bad experience with roof-top installations from SolarCity vs. SunPower vs. Q Cells panels with a SolarEdge Inverter.

After all the sales pitches and googling, I really like what I've gleaned about the SunPower product, but you can see by the prices quoted below that SolarCity is making it reeeeeally easy to say yes to them.

Before we sign with one company or another, I'd really like to know whether any of these are a trap.

**The Quotes:**

Prices below are the sum total of all loan payments with all tax credits and other incentives factored in. All have different interest rates and terms, so I figured this was the best way to normalize. No loans have any prepayment penalties.

* **SolarCity:** $18,736.80 / 10,961 kWhrs = $1.71/kWatt
* **Q Cells/SolarEdge:** $25,102.57 / 12,120 kWhrs = $2.07/kWatt
* **SunPower:** $27,502.53 / 12,092 kWhrs = $2.27/kWatt

---

*EDIT, 2017/05/10 10:05 AM:*

Here are the *real* hairy details for those who wanted to know more. You'll see that financing rates make a HUGE difference in each case, and **since we'll be buying these systems with borrowed money, that makes a significant consideration for us.**

* **SolarCity (REC 300 Panels/SolarEdge inverter):**
  * **8.26 kW** (10,961 kWH est. annual production)
  * Cost: $22,467 - $7,276 credits = **$15,191** cash price
  * Financing: $15,191 x 2.99% APR x 10yr = **$156.00/mo** ($18,736.80)
* **Local Guys (Q Cells 300 panels/SolarEdge inverter):**
  * **9.0 kW** (12,120 kWH est. annual production)
  * Cost: $23,600 - $7,080 credits = **$16,520** cash price
  * Financing: $16,520 x 7.50% APR x 12yr = **$174.32/mo** ($25,102.57)
* **SunPower (SunPower panels/SunPower microinverters):**
  * **8.8 kW** (12,092 kWH est. annual production)
  * Cost: $34,924 - $10,477 credits = **$24,447** cash price
  * Financing: $24,447 x 1.99% APR x 12yr = **$190.99/mo** ($27,502.53)

**Pro tip I discovered while getting quotes:**

We gathered quotes from the top-4 companies in our area with the best reviews on Google maps. We kept everything out in the open and let everyone know we were shopping around. That tended to shorten the consultation times and let us get down to numbers faster.

We started with SolarCity, and their initial quote was %30 higher than the small guys' quote. After we got quotes from all 4, I was set to go with the smaller company, so I started calling to let the other ones off the hook. That's when they said, **""Is it just price? If so, I can probably match their quote. Just email me.""** (!!!).

I was thinking to myself, *Shit! Wish I would have figured this trick out sooner in life!* It came out ""Oh, OK. That sounds good. What's your email, good sir?""

So that's how the SolarCity quote came down 30%. As you can see above, their financing arrangements make a further HUGE difference. I'm going to reach out to the SunPower guys to see if they won't do the same thing, but I got as far as Reddit this morning.

Thanks for the good number of already helpful responses.

Found out SolarCity plans to install REC 300 panels and a SolarEdge inverter. Added to bullets above.

*EDIT, 2017/05/16 12:36 AM:*

I really hope future solar shoppers find this post helpful. After openly price shopping, asking the questions this sub gave me, and getting installers to compete on quotes, I managed to 1) get a great education about what I'm getting and **2) get each and every installer to drop their price without changing configuration.**

I plan to call all the installers back tomorrow morning to let them know I plan to go with **SunPower.**

Reasons that sealed the deal: 25-year warranty, lowest tested over-time panel degradation, easiest system to expand, and even though this installer's total system price came up in the top range of quotes, their 1.99% APR (loan handled by Enerbank) makes the total 12-years of payments the 2nd lowest total financed price.

BTW: The financed price was only beat only by SolarCity, but our local SolarCity office has a Google Maps rating of 2.6 stars, vs. this company's 5.0 stars. Most of the negative SolarCity reviews are for problems with long-term panel service, so that was enough to push us to SunPower.

Thanks, again, to everyone for all the advice.",energy
personalfinance,Confused over what tax forms I need to file as an unemployed US citizen overseas.,"I am an American citizen, and three years ago I moved to the Netherlands with my Dutch partner. They do not have a green card or any sort of ties to the US, they have never lived or worked there. Two years ago we were married. Through these three years I have remained, for the most part, unemployed due to medical problems. There was a short stint where I worked in a grocery store but I never made enough to put me over any sort of threshold that I'm aware of. I also do not have any debts remaining in the US. 

When I called the IRS three years ago to figure out what my tax obligations were, I was told by the rep that I would not need to file any taxes until I returned to the US. I let the rep know that I was not on vacation and would likely never be returning to the US, and they only repeated that I would not need to file until I returned. ""Great"" I thought, ""Now I can solely focus on getting medical care.""

There was a year where we were briefly in Hong Kong, and I was denied a bank account because of my American passport. I then decided to read up on why the Hong Kong banks thought it was too much trouble to deal with me. Now after reading about it, I'm stressing because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, and being unemployed I cannot afford to visit a US tax expert here in the Netherlands (every price quote I saw was in the hundreds of dollars for a simple tax return for an unemployed person!). 

What really worries me is the hefty fine for not reporting your bank account to the IRS. I was under the impression I had already reported our shared bank account through as the bank had sent us a form to fill out. Apparently this is different than a FBAR though? Is anyone able to explain what it is I need to do? 

So far my first step has been to print out a Form 8822 to let the IRS know I've moved overseas. Apparently the rep didn't find that to be important to share with me! Since I never notified the IRS of my address change, do I need to file state returns for the last three years? Or just federal?",finance

personalfinance,"[Germany] I have a consultation with my bank in a week for the purpose of restructuring and ""further planning"". What should I put attention on?","Dear Reddit,

first, sorry if my post seems a little unstructured and hard to understand. I am not a native speaker but from Germany. Here goes:

My savings bank contacted me recently to arrange a consultation. My contact employee would like to speak to me, as I mostly use my dispo credit limit and that this is probably ""too expensive"" for me. In addition, they would like to prescribe some form of retirement, insurance or savings plan - after all, they do not contact me out of pure philanthropy, because they are so reluctant to cash my dispo interest.

You might notice it already, but my confidence in the advice of the savings banks it is not very far; I am engaged in the public service and in relevant forums I read enough stories of frustrated employees getting pressured from above to negotiate as much as possible in favor of the bank. I have the fear that the improvement of my finances will not be the focus of the consultation, I feel like they just want to sell me something that they profit of.

Since I know little myself and so far I have not dealt with my old age provision: What kind of offers do I have to be careful about? What makes sense in my financial situation? What should I better leave alone due to either risk, low profit for me or high fees?

Point two: For me, the limit of my dispo over the years creeped in as my ""zero"", means: 

At the end of the month my account is not at € 0,00 (I know it should be more, the ideal should be a savings fund), but in the negative. 
The minus is about twice my monthly income, there is no way for me to get out of that very fast. 
Interest rate of my dispo is around 10%, means I pay 90€ each quarter for simply sitting in the negative all the time.
At present, I am still repaying a loan from my employer (until August).

This year I have to start the Bafög (student loan) repayment, around € 9000,00. 
I can get a significant partial release (~25%, reducing it to little over 6000,00), if I repay everything at once. 
I would like to use this, but would have to take out a loan. On this occasion I would like to choose the credit high enough that I can balance the dispo. For me, it also would be easier to pay off a monthly rate, than a quarterly, very high rate, as usual with the Bafög.

I had addressed a bank employee a few months ago to a possible debt restructuring by credit, but the could only offer me a loan with interest in the high single-digit range - that I felt in the current interest rate policy as insolence. Which interest rate would you consider appropriate for an amount of ~ € 10,000.00 with a maturity of 5 years?",finance

personalfinance,Why PFers tell you to walk away from a car dealer if you don't like them (AKA my horror story because I followed advice),"If you plan on following through with the advice given to you from r/personalfinance on purchasing a car, be sure that you are working with a salesman who isn't more worried about his bottom line and forcing your hand than he is the word of mouth he will receive later. I had possibly the worst experience buying a car yesterday as the salesman basically threw an 8 hour long tantrum about me not taking the dealer financing on a used $14,000 car.

The first red flag was that they were trying tricky tricks like not having the price match in person to what was online and getting upset when we were trying to haggle the trade in. The manager approved a deal for us and it really pissed off the salesman because he apparently didn't feel like he was making enough off of it. 

Unfortunately, I live an hour away from this dealer so we had to put the car on hold until I could get there to complete the sale. We gave them $500 to do so.

We went in yesterday morning to get a bill of sale to take to our credit union for the financing, and we had a new salesman. This man spent several hours pitching the financing, taking longer than he needed to file paperwork, constantly spelling my name wrong... there was a point I felt like we were on Sesame Street because of how slowly we were having to go over the letters in my name. I literally have 5 letters in my name, it's nothing difficult. He had to redo the paperwork over and over again. Finally, after being told how much time the dealer financing would REALLY REALLY save us, it's soooo great and fast, we got to leave for the credit union. (note: the credit union financing was at least a percent and a half below what the dealer would give us, and we had credit scores over 800; There was no more room to haggle their financing)

First, the salesman calls me and tells me that we're taking too long that he has an appointment that we're holding him back from and ""THIS IS WHY we tell you to take the dealer financing."" I tell him I'm getting the paperwork done, he will just have to wait or leave for his appointment and we'll do it without him, but I do not want to talk about the dealer financing any more.

The second call I get from him is again about how I'm taking too long and that he is cancelling his appointment that he has to go to and it's just really ridiculous that we didn't take their financing.

We finally get to the dealer, he's still having trouble with paperwork, and I'm getting fed up. He tries to basically finance-shame me one last time. I tell him to drop it and he basically argues with me about dealer financing for another 15 minutes while I'm trying to hand him money and he is straight up being belligerent and calling us names like ""a time sink."" Apparently, he just had to go at me one last time before I could leave this place with a car. Finally, I got to talk to a manager, and I got to walk away with my car, but I still have a migraine from all this. 

Seriously, it is NOT WORTH the mental pain to deal with these types of salesman to get a good deal. I'm pretty sure my situation was age-based, since he was so SURPRISED that our credit scores were good, and I know that may pertain to a lot of reddit users. If you start seeing red flags that your salesman is not going to go down without a fight over you making intelligent investment decisions, seriously just get another one or leave. 

EDIT: Just to be clear, this is meant as a cautionary tale. There were plenty of times where I thought the salesman would give up, especially once I was just shoving money in his face. I mean, SURELY he knew I would badmouth him to every review website I could find. But, it never happened that way. My point is letting people know how bad it can get if they want to try to work through the negativity. You never really know this stuff happens until you hear about it or it happens to you.",finance
personalfinance,Use Roth IRA to pay student loans?,"Income: $130K

Graduate student loans: $154K @ weighted average of 7.5% ($42K in accumulated interest, so total balance is $196K)

Current plan: IBR (15%), current minimum monthly payment is $1,030 but I can probably afford to pay about $1,750

Currently saving: About $25K/year through 401(k)

Already saved:

$90K in Vanguard Roth IRA

$10K in rollover IRA from previous job

$14K in company 401(k)

-Refinancing the student loans is not currently an option, as I would not be able to afford the minimum payment even with the most generous interest rate and terms, and I don't want to lose the federal protections

-I am finally (career-wise) at a point where I can afford to pay the monthly interest on the student loans.  However, as $40K in interest has accumulated since I entered IBR, I cannot touch the principal until that is paid off

-I am thinking of taking $40K from my Roth IRA (I have enough in contributions that it wouldn't be taxed) and using it to pay off the accumulated interest, so that I can finally start attacking the principal.  By my calculations, this would allow me to pay off the loans about a year and a half early (assuming I can pay $1,750/month)

-I know it's a bad idea to tap retirement savings for any reason, but it's kind of hard to justify leaving it there when I've already got $154K in loans accumulating 7.5% interest annually?

Would appreciate any advice.  Thanks.",finance

It would take at least an extra year to pay it off that way using the personal loan rather than continue paying how i currently am. The only catch is I am paying a ton more in interest now and have a lot of seperate payments that add up to a lot more than the one single payment I would have to make if i got the personal loan.

personalfinance,Selling house and will have a good amount of cash - best way to pay off all debt?,"My wife and I have lived in our house 3 years and are about to sell it for about a net gain from the initial purchase price.  After all the closing costs, paying off our mortgage, our second mortgage we had to get to cover some repairs (HVAC went out), and other miscelanous fees and costs, we will be getting about $40,000 cash as a result.

Right now, we are eager to get out of debt.  I've added it up, and outside of student debt (which is deferred and income-based) we've got $29,000 in credit card debt, a $5,000 loan, and about $6,000 in past-due medical bills.  I want to go about paying this off in the best way possible to maximize our financial freedom.

On the 29k credit card debt - I've been in a ""repayment program"" through a non-profit place (not a settlement/restructure company) so they were able to get all my interest rates lowered and all my payments lowered, so my payments on that 29k is about $1000 per month.  Interest rates range from 6%-10%, with a couple fopr only $300-500 at 0%.  I figure at the very least, I'll pay off a majority of this.  The one with the lowest interest rate (6%) is the highest balance - $8000.

On the loan, its an unsecured loan for $5,000, and the interest on it is 25%.  I've only had the loan for about 4-6 months but I plan to pay this one off first with it being such high interest.

On the medical bills, that is where I'm up in the air.  Do I negotiate with them to get the total $ amount lowered?  Do I set up a payment plan?  Do I pay this instead of some of the other debt off?  They are relatively new debts (past 3-6 months sent to a collection agency) so they haven't taken any drastic action like garnishing wages or anything, but I don't want it to get to that point.

So, again, what is my best play here?  I have wanted to be able to keep a little cash in the bank, hence my hesitancy to use the entire 40k to pay off the debt (which adds up to almost exactly what we are making on the house).  I also want to have some cash around for an emergency fund and be able to start saving for a future house.  I want to be smart about this and not just see all $40k be gone overnight to this debt.

personalfinance,Bank suggestions for savings/checkings/credit card all in one?,"Hey! I've read through a lot of the 'which bank do I use?' posts, but haven't found one that meshes exactly with my question.

I'm a recent college grad who has used US Bank checking/savings/credit card for the past 4 years. It was the convenient bank on campus. Now that I'm moving for work, I figured it was time to see if better options for banking exist.

While I know different banks different areas of expertise (e.g. Schwab for checking, Ally for savings), I'd love suggestions for a 'home base' bank where I can have checking, savings, and a credit card if possible all in one. Looking for low fees and good customer service. What do you guys think?

My initial inclination was to go with Schwab and then just find a brick and mortar credit union in my new city, but I'm second guessing that plan.

personalfinance,Currently choosing a mortgage loan and was offered LPMI instead of monthly PMI. Is this a smart option?,"My SO and I are currently buying our first home. The home we are buying is a townhome that we can easily afford, even with only one of our incomes (we don’t anticipate losing our jobs but just in case). The neighborhood and school zone are very good and it should be easy to sell. Our plan is to stay in the home for 5-7 years, build some equity, save money, and eventually move into a larger single-family home. 


In addition to our 6-month emergency savings (which we do not want to touch), we have enough to put down up to 10% on the house. Since we don't have the 20% we must pay PMI. Our loan guy gave us a few options, the first being to do an FHA loan pay a monthly PMI of $260 for the life of the loan, the second being a conventional loan with LPMI, which made the interest rate go up 0.7% but it still reduced the monthly payments by about $200. I figured because we can write off some of the interest and we aren’t planning to stay in the home for the life of the mortgage, that the LPMI sounds like the better deal. I just wanted to get some input before we decide because we are both new to all this. 


I’ll also note that while for some it may be a wise decision to just spend some of their emergency savings and replenish it, my SO has a chronic disease that is well managed, but very expensive without insurance. Knowing that we can afford his meds if something were to happen to his insurance is a peace of mind neither of us are willing to part with.

personalfinance,"Need to finance car out of state on short notice, help!","Hi PF,

I'm in a bit of a bind here. I just graduated college in Massachusetts, which is the state in which I received my license. I'm currently in Connecticut, where my parents live, until early next week. I went to a dealership and picked out a car, and they said they would be able to finance the car through a credit union that they work with. They just needed to see proof of insurance. 

But, the thing is that I got a job in New York and will be moving there next week, so that's where I insured the car. I sent the dealership my proof of insurance and they just said that they couldn't go through the credit union they had in mind because they only work with CT registrations, and the car now needs to be registered in NY since that's where it is insured. 

So, now I'm kind of on my own as far as financing the car goes. I need a loan of about $4,500 within the next few days. Something I should also mention is that this is an independent dealer, so from what I've seen so far that makes getting a loan from a big bank (Bank of America, Santander, etc.) out of the question. On top of that, I have no proof of residency in New York since I don't actually live there yet. 

I'm waiting to see if the dealership can find another source to finance the car, and other than that my only idea is to take out a personal loan at a higher interest rate and just pay it off as soon as I can. What do you think is the best course of action? 

Edit: Just got off the phone with the insurance company, they were able to temporarily switch my coverage from NY to CT, and now I just need to let them know when I move. Thanks for the comments though!",finance
personalfinance,"24M need to build credit, and my current situation.","Hello all. First post to personal finance, also pretty new to reddit in general. So apologies in advance for mistakes.

My current finance situation is this; no debt, current student at a community college (no student loan) going to be graduating this semester with 4 computer science certificates. Currently have medical insurance until i am 26. Live at home, no bills. Currently employed at a bar doing security, running food, and barbacking, typical paycheck is just shy of 900 a month.

I have a savings account with $1,850 a checkings account linked to a debit card that i usually keep $250 dollars in in case of emergency. And a 12-month 0.90% compounding monthly interest rate CD account with $500 dollars that it started with. (I am on month 3 of the CD and now have 501.08) 

Yesterday i went into my bank (travis credit union) and ran a credit check and was trying to apply for a credit builder card so i can start trying to build my credit. The credit check came back with no credit whatsoever, which i was told was only good because it is better than having bad credit. 

I was then told that i could not apply for the credit builder card because i have not been consistently employed for 2 years at any job i have ever worked (my resume is a bit of a nightmare but thats another story)

However my bank allows for secured credit cards. Where i put up $500 dollars collateral, and then that is my credit limit. They also have an option wherr they lock away $500 in your savings account and you slowly pay it back each month. Technically the only money i end up paying after this loan is $3 but it looks like i took out a loan and paid it back which builds my credit.

I decided to walk away without making a decision because i wanted to get some more advice before locking away $500 either with the secured credit card, or the loan.

My goal is to move out within the year with my girlfriend. And to of course pursure getting employed in an IT position upon graduation. However with no credit i cannot see myself being able to get my own place, get a better car, or any kind of good loans in the event i want to transfer to a 4 year.

Other information that may be relevant. I am very, very frugal. I consistently build my savings and am very careful with my money. I monitor my spending habbits and have been doing so for years. I think i am responsible enough for a credit card, that ideally i would only use on gas and pay it off fully each month. 

Tl;dr are secured credit cards a good place to start building credit, or is doing a small loan through my bank using my own money a safer way to start?",finance

If my car loan is 20k and my savings are 20k what's stopping me from closing out the loan? My thinking is that I'll be doubling my cash flow so my saving will bounce back quickly.

personalfinance,Need help reddit.. big credit card debt and just got 10k but need some insight,"Hello r/personalfinance !  We need your assistance and insight.

We can just cut to the chase, not going to explain how we got into this mess as it is irrelevant at this point.

Me and my girlfriend (been together for over 5 years) are in a total of 23,000 of credit card debt.  We are currently attempting to get out of this hole.  It has been a combination of things that got us to this point but we are trying to get our shit together.  My girlfriend just got 10,000 from a recently passed away relative (grandma).  Her mom has it but wants us to use it towards a house (something we have been considering for the past year).  Her mom doesn't want us to use this 10k towards debt, she wants us to use it for a house.  

We both work at the same place, and we bring in 4800(ish) after taxes every month.

Our bills usually total to around 2400 every month (including credit card minimum payments)(not including gas or food).  Our credit card debt is scattered over 5 credit cards.  2 credit cards currently have interest and 3 are on no interest at this point.  The ones that have interest are our highest cards at this point.

Our credit scores have gone way down as of the last two cards we opened to get debt onto no interest.  Mine is ~640 (18k of credit card debt is in my name) and hers is like 660 (the rest of credit card debt is in her name).  My credit score used to be like 740 so I am feeling pretty shitty as of lately.

We wanted to get a house because our apartment is horrible at the moment.  We have mold all over the bathroom and i have tried getting the landlord over to fix it and he never comes.  I just want to get out of here.  I've heard of people getting loans for houses with shitty credit scores and no down payment, is this possible?  I have 80k in student loans i pay on (40k private and 40k federal) and she has 30-40k in student loans she pays on.  I also have a truck that i pay 450 a month for (included in the 2400 bills per month figure i gave above)(still have about 23k left to pay on that).  I feel like we have a high debt-to-income ratio.  I am so lost as to how to approach this situation.  Deep down i know that putting this 10,000 towards credit card debt is probably the best thing to do and then just knock out the rest and then look towards getting a house.  But the problem is, her mom has the money and doesn't want us to put it towards bills (she knows some of our situation) because she thinks that is kinda wasteful (in a sense... she just wants us to have something to show for it).

I am sorry this post is kind of scattered all over the place.  I would REALLY appreciate your help reddit.  I know we fucked up, but i want to make the best of our situation.  Please help.  :)

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff Glitch,"I paid off my student loan on January 31, 2017 using the Fedloan Servicing webpage to calculate my payoff amount on that date and made the payment the same day. Three weeks later I received a letter dated February 21, 2017 entitled Paid In Full Notification. It listed the two loans I had paid off and their balance of 0. 

On April 29th a letter was mailed out entitled Disclosure of Loan Repayment Terms and it states that the repayment schedule on some or all of my loans had changed. The letter proceeds to outline what could have caused this change and what impact it could have with a series of bullet points for me to guess at which one might apply. It lists a principle amount due of 137.83 with a Total Repayment Amount of 172.33.

On April 30th a monthly bill was mailed to me showing a balance of 137.83 and my payment due date of 04/21/2025.

So I called and I won't go get into all the details of a very long conversation with the FedLoan Servicing people, but I will give a couple bottom line points. First, they were very nice to me, they at least pretended very convincingly that they cared about my problem and I can't ask for much more than that. Secondly they told me it was a glitch; that interest must have capitalized the very instant before I paid it off. When I asked how that could be since it was their system that gave me the payoff amount for that day: Glitch. When I asked why the letter was mailed a full three weeks later notifying me of a fully paid debt: Glitch. When I asked what assurance I would have that if I were to pay this off I wouldn't get another letter in three month asking for more money, I was basically told this wouldn't happen again, presumably because they don't have glitches. I refused to pay, told them that I thought I should not need anything other than there notification of payment in full and ask that they escalate this to someone who might be able to clear this. I got a name and number and a promise to call me back in a few weeks. I was warned that this debt is earning interest at a rate of approximately a penny a day, so I should be solvent for next few months at that rate.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I repaid my debt and I am not interested in giving them more money at this point, but more of my concern is how do I know this won't happen again? They really couldn't tell me how this happened or why this happened and that does not make me comfortable that they can tell me it won't happen again.",finance

I have a lot of questions and I get overwhelmed thinking about the near future.

* I'm making around $47k, she got promoted and will be making around $70k with a linear progression in salary (federal).  
* I have $25k left in student loans, $7k in an IRA, and about $10k liquid in emergency funds and savings.  She is just now starting to save as she just finished her PhD.
* Monthly expenses come to around $2k for myself (I'm throwing $800/mo at student loans, I could probably throw more now that my emergency fund is refilled).  

I know that we should not feel pressured to buy a house, but prices here in San Antonio are climbing rapidly and it seems like a good idea to take GF's new salary and aggressively save for a down payment, and maybe just ask for donations at our wedding (which we intend to do modestly).  We definitely do not want to live out in the suburbs, and living inside the highway loop will probably cost us $200k bare minimum.

+ I've got BBVA Compass, they offer a Clear Choice Money Market Savings Account with a 0.995% interest rate at 1% APY. $15 monthly fee, though can be waived blah blah loophole - **how does this compare to other ""interest earning"" options?**
+ I literally have no idea what I'm doing nor do I really want to.. I know that sounds terrible, but of all my business minor classes accounting was not my gig. I want something that's safe but also gives at least some kind of ROI but also something that I don't have to be ~involved~ in for it to work, **but what is that?** Does that even make sense bc will clarify
+ **Do I just leave it in interest gaining savings accounts and slowly watch it grow or what???**",finance
investing,REIT Discussion ~~ Seems like an interesting time to get in,"I've been reading up on REITs and market factors that affect REIT stocks. I'm no expert, but it seems to be that with the economy doing well and raising interest rates, more loans for more houses will be made. In turn, it would seem that REITs would benefit as an industry. However, it's all about taking advantage while the economy is performing well, and then getting out when the economy is at the end of its good period. 


One thing I haven't quite figured out is how to choose some REITs over others. What are the criteria typically used to find a REIT with potential? What are signals of a failing REIT? 
I am definitely not claiming everything I've said is right, but it's how I understand it, so if anybody has any light to shed, it would be much appreciated",finance

personalfinance,"Buying an engagement ring, had an odd experience, need help","Hi personal finance,

I am considering proposing to my girlfriend of 2 years next month and so I started shopping around for an engagement ring this week. I had an odd experience yesterday that I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on (and also maybe some light on the process of buying a ring in general).

So here's what happened. A woman from one of the large brand-name stores initially seemed very friendly. However she used some strange ""tactics"" (don't really know what else to call them really). First of all she requested my drivers license as soon as I walked in. I couldn't find any harm in this so I gave it to her. Why this was done I'm not sure, but thinking about it retrospectively, I felt a little off-put by it.

Secondly she asked what my budget was. I said no more than $5000. She called someone using the store's phone and then had me speak to them. The person said they were from the same company and started asking questions like ""What do you do for a living?"", ""How much student debt do you have?"" and ""What is the limit on your Visa card?"". She then handed the phone back to the saleswoman and she told me good news, I was ""approved"" for $5000. I THINK what she meant was $5000 worth of financing, but I'm not really sure. She was very vague about it when I inquired further. She mentioned that I could put $1000 down and pay something like $150 per month for 18 months with zero interest. 

So there are a couple weird things about this. One, I asked her if she had told the representative on the phone about my $5000 limit, because I found it odd that I was approved for the exact same amount of $5000. She said she did not. But I am quite certain I could be approved for way more than that. The lady on the phone didn't even ask me about my current assets.

Another weird thing is that I mentioned to her multiple times that I don't need financing, I have the cash. She just ignored this and went on with the financing.

When she pressuring me into buying a ring I was considering that day, I told her no, I don't make large purchases on the first visit. She then tried to get me to sign a document. She explained it poorly, saying it was for ""membership"" and so I could access my $5000. Of course she scoffed when I flipped the page back and actually started reading the thing. It was very vague itself, very wordy and difficult to interpret. I did not sign it.

So needless to say that was a very confusing and annoying experience.

r/personalfinance... any idea what this was about? And any tips shopping for engagement rings?

I should say I'm actually kind of against buying diamonds for multiple reasons (blood diamonds, DeBeers history of fixing diamond prices by controlling supply, the fact they can be made synthetically now but prices are still unchanged, scammy business practices by many diamond retailers) .. the only reason I'm even considering it is because my girl seems to expect it.

If anyone knows of an alternative, please let me know.

Edit: Wow. Thanks for all your support guys. This is really an awesome community of helpful people.

I wanted to give you a quick update. It turns out they did check my credit score without my permission. Which is bad, because it will likely lower it a little bit. I printed out my credit report and confronted them. They were super extremely apologetic and said they had no idea, but they've been in the industry for at least 5 years each so I'm sure they knew exactly what they were doing.

I guess my next step would be to dispute the inquiry with the credit bureau.. I'm going to look into it tomorrow.

And I've decided to buy a non-diamond stone (probably moissonite) online with a cheap ""placeholder"" ring and propose using that, then let her pick the ring style herself afterwards. This way I can save thousands and she gets to create exactly what she is imagining. 

I will have to tell her it's not a diamond though. Hopefully that goes over well.",finance

personalfinance,To refinance or not to refinance?,"Let's try this again. I embarrassingly posted this over on r/personalFIANCE a couple weeks ago by mistake, so the numbers aren't exact to today's. But...

I've got a 2012 I bought gently used in 2014. According to KBB website, I'm not upside down on my loan, I owe a little less than trade-in value range. I have 43 payments remaining on the original loan, the current regular payment is so high that I can't afford to pay any additional principal payments and I think I'll end up paying another ~$1,000 in interest through the lifetime of the loan if I stick with it.

I'm considering paying the principal down to $15,000 in September, and refinancing with another lender for 4 years (hopefully at 2.99%) to decrease my monthly payment and total interest paid.

With the lower monthly payment, I should be able to make additional principal payments of $100/month so the payoff date would end up just a month earlier than it is currently, but it would save me ~$300 in interest on the lifetime of the new loan vs the old loan if my calculations are correct. Plus I'll have the peace of mind that in case of financial troubles, my minimum payment will be ~$150/month less.

Some info, if it's helpful:

- Date loan opened: 7/28/2014
- Original loan amount: $32,617
- Interest rate: 3.49%
- Loan term: 75 months
- Current scheduled payment ~$485/mo
- Current daily interest accrual: $1.86
- Current loan payoff amount: ~$19,500
- Current payoff date: 11/2020
- Total of payments on original loan: $36,402.75 
- Refund on GAP if I refinance: $749 (and I think the new GAP is a couple bucks less FWIW)

personalfinance,Question about debt consolidation,"I have roughly $10,000 in credit card debt.  Between my other bills and now child support, it seems I am just always making the minimum payments on these cards, never ever paying them down.  I do not have any extra money at the moment to attempt the avalanche or snowball methods of reducing CC debt. So someone suggested I take a look at debt consolidation. 

The way I understand it works:  One company takes on all of your debt for a somewhat low interest rate, and you make 1 payment a month towards the lot of your debt.  My question is the following... Do you think it would be a good idea to go for debt consolidation with roughly $10,000 dollars in credit card debt?  Mind you, my goal here is to free up some extra cash during the month, i.e instead of paying $350 in total to 4 different companies, pay $150 dollars to one company.  

To help better understand my situation, the following is my credit card debt/interest rate for each card:

-Bank Of America - $1,960 owed with an APR of 21.74%
-Chase - $4,617 owed with an APR of 23.74%
-Barclay Card - $2,582 owed with an APR of 23.74%
-Best Buy - $1348 owed with and APR of 25.99% (This APR doesn't go into effect until 10/04/2018 as I am on a no interest promotion)",finance

litecoin,BTC maximalism and the 1MB limit will kill the booming demand for crypto by artificially constraining the supply - Ask businesses and payment processors to accept altcoins!,"A lot of countries are starting to get into crypto, and both exchange volumes and on-chain transaction volumes are increasing rapidly. Bitcoin cannot properly meet even the current demand (which is rising), and users are having to outbid each other by constantly raising transaction fees to have hope of getting their transactions confirmed (see [chart of daily total fees in BTC](https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees)).

Bitcoin getting segwit is still probably a year away, and when it finally does come, it will be too little too late (for scalability). Even Lightning doesn't provide a big enough help immediately, and there are [problems related to routing when attempting to scale LN beyond relatively small numbers of users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6afxig/litening_lightning_on_litecoin_mainnet/dhe8d2j/). The problems will probably get solved in time, but just segwit and LN when they come to Bitcoin won't be enough alone!

The best and in fact only way to scale Bitcoin soon and well enough is actually to ~~use altcoins instead~~ move a part of the transaction volume to altcoins. Alts could share some of BTC's load right now! But if the global supply of crypto payments is artificially constrained at [~3.5 tx per second](https://blockchain.info/charts/transactions-per-second) for much longer, all the new users are eventually going to get fed up and conclude that this technology just doesn't work well enough.

In the next 6 months I might also be able to pay-off the loan @13.5% completely off; should I attempt to consolidate now or after I've paid that off?

personalfinance,"Student Veteran, 34k in liquid assets. How much is too much sitting in savings with upcoming career/life changes?","Hey y’all! Throwaway for privacy, but I have been subbed to PF for a little over a year now. This is my first post though as I am receiving advice all over the place on what to do with my liquid assets for future investments. I feel like having almost $25k sitting in a savings account is not intelligent. I am a full-time student veteran making a cross country move to Boulder in 3 weeks to finish my MIS/Business degree. 2 years left in my degree. Moving costs are already accounted for as I have liquidated almost all my bulky items/furniture so I can use the smallest truck Penske offers.  


Here is my profile:


**Age**- 25, 26 in less than a month. 


**Current Funds**- $24k currently in savings/checking accounts (Navy Federal, local credit union) 


**Debt**- No student debt upon my graduation (Thanks Post 9/11 bill!). Have a separate college fund that I can either cash out for $10k, or use to pay roughly 60% of my MBA if I choose. Zero CC debt, use a flagship visa rewards credit card through Navy Federal for all daily expenses. Currently owe $19,000 on a new car loan (just had my last car of 7 years totaled due to someone running a red light last month). Slightly irrational decision to purchase my dream car (2017 Subaru STI), but it puts a smile on my face daily and is better than the pills the VA tries to prescribe for anxiety. Put $14,000 down on the car and took out a loan for 19k @1.69% for 60 months. Payments are $330 a month. STI’s specifically depreciate very little over time and I felt comfortable after negotiating over 3 weeks for the car 2% below invoice. 5-year-old examples routinely sell for $25-27k, so I plan on using this car through its powertrain warranty for the next 5 years.


**401k**- $8,450 currently in a traditional 401k with TSP. Have not been able to contribute to this account after my time on active duty ended with the Navy, so this is just compounding. Most of the advice I have read on this forum with TSP is to keep the assets in the account due to the insanely low fee’s.


**IRA**- $3,900 currently in a Roth IRA that I have contributed since 2015 when I could no longer put money in my TSP retirement account. 


**Assets**-  I own roughly $9,500-$10,000 worth of photography equipment as appraised for my insurance. Acquired some of it initially for a hobby 5 year ago, but I have been doing shoots as a side gig during my time in the service and now as a college student. I am selling some unused lenses over the next few weeks that will bring in around $1,250-1,400. 


**Monthly income**- $3700- $4,300 after taxes. This is combining what the VA pays me for monthly housing and services, plus what my averages are from doing photography on the side. 
-I held a part time job in the government contractor industry up until this last month before my move. I anticipate holding another part time co-op for 15-20 hours a week after I move. For part-time jobs in my industry, I have been averaging around $700-$800 a month, but I have mainly been holding these jobs for applicable civilian experience in my industry to bolster my military weighted resume. 


**Expenses**
-$1750 rent, split down the middle with my girlfriend. I am allocating $1,000 a month after all utilities and cable bills.
-$65/month for phone
-$95/month for car/renter insurance
-$100/month for gas
-$300 ‘ish for food/month
-Photography business expenses- Minimal. $90 a year for a website, gas to and from a local shoot (which I deduct), $9.99 a month for license for software, $24 a month for liability/equipment insurance. 
Income-$3,700-4,300. Expenses- ~$1800 after small items like Netflix, donations to local vet service dog foundation, triple ply toilet paper to treat myself. 


**Misc**
-801 credit score. 
-Moving in with my significant other in the next few weeks and we have been together for almost 2 years. She is a third-grade teacher and will make around $43,000. Marriage is something I am taking into account in my 5-year financial plan. She has less than 5k of student debt so I will not be bearing any additional debt. 
-I really do desire to be a homeowner. Growing up, my father and his father built their own homes and I have done a lot of house work with them. I am confident in normal repairs and DIY projects. Due to still being in school and not knowing the exact area where my career will take me, I am just saving until the time is right and I can use a VA loan, but put 20% down. 


I feel like I am on the right track as a 25 year old. I have no real debt (I could sell the car for 33k right now and be $14k ahead), and I have a good amount of liquid assets once I decide to sell photography equipment, move it to a hobby once again and head into my full-time career. I currently have been putting around $165 a month into the Roth IRA, but I believe I should really increase this as I have a lot of disposable income right now. What would y’all recommend I do? Max out my IRA contributions, wait until I graduate, and use the 25k I have in savings towards a house? Open up a vanguard account?

This loan currently has a balance of $160,000, a per-diem of $25,  an interest rate of 4.875%, and a payment of $1026/mo.

personalfinance,How do you properly budget with one commission salary and one steady salary?,"**TLDR: How should we efficiently/properly budget with one commission only salary and one steady salary. My BF with the commission only salary wants to be responsible for items such as rent, utilities etc.**

I'm kinda new to all of this and its kinda exciting but scary... I went from being unemployed and seriously delinquent in debts to employed with a new job that will provide a substantial surplus. We actually had a point in time where we were both unemployed with $0 income. Here are a few more details:

My boyfriend and I (early-mid 20s) live together and over the last year, we've had a period of time where he was sole provider while I was unemployed and then I became sole provider for some time as well (he has a pending case we hope to put behind us this year). We are both currently working good jobs and I'm a little unsure of how to properly budget with our situation. 

**Him:** My BF works a commission only job (with no cap). It's a pretty recent job so I don't have good month-month trending data. He currently targets bringing home at least $900-1000 a week but in the past month, he's had weeks where he would take home $200 one week and $900 the next and $1800 the following week. It just depends. He is extremely motivated and good at what he does (already promoted) and I can see his earning potential growing significantly. Biggest expense under his name is $500/month payment to lawyer (0% interest) until October. No other debt - new to building credit.

**Me:** I take home about $1500/week steadily. Working on rebuilding credit. I have significantly more debt - about $17,000 in charged off debt from when I was unemployed last year and $23,000 in federal student loans at 6% interest (currently deferred so no payments expected at this time). 

**Our main bills (after this month):**

- Rent/water - $900

- Electric - $75

- Cell phone 1: $125

- Cell phone 2: $125

- Cable/internet: $110 (possibly getting Roku or something similar soon)

- Car insurance for 2 cars: $132

- Gym: $65 (covers both @24 hour fitness)

- Personal care 1: $150 (me)

- Personal care 2: $50 (him)

- Payment 1: $500/month @0% interest 

- Groceries: $400/month

- Gas: $120/month (me)

- Gas: $150/month (him)

- Savings 1: $500/month - ROTH IRA (me)

- Savings 2: $500/month  - ROTH IRA (him)


I'm trying to aggressively pay off my debts this upcoming year. We are also trying to  build substantial savings as well. Is it more realistic to split the bills in half? If we both maintain ""separate"" budgets, I look like I have a massive surplus which I can throw towards my debt payoff but I'm trying to take his commission salary into account. My though was to set up an emergency fund to cover expenses just in case and then start putting all surplus towards debts? What is a reasonable amount?

As with most things, there are grey areas with Net Neutrality. For instance, T-Mobile's Music Freedom program has been criticized for not counting data used from major audio streaming services towards a customer's monthly data allotment. While this is a nice perk on paper, it isn't necessarily neutral either, and leaves a door open for possible exploitation by ISPs and content providers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why is Net Neutrality important?**  
Without clear and specific rules in favor of neutrality, a major fear is exploitation of the Internet. Two of the major fears are the creation of pay-to-access content and fast lanes by the ISPs (more on this below).

&amp;nbsp;

**Key to Net Neutrality: Internet as a utility**  
An often contended point: should the internet be considered a utility? The FCC thought so in 2015 while led by FCC led by Chairman Tom Wheeler when they reclassified ISPs as common carriers (read: utilities) under Title II of the Telecommunications act. This allows the FCC to regulate and provide stringent oversight of ISPs similarly to Water and Electricity carriers. This act is referred to as the FCC's Open Internet Rules.

&amp;nbsp;

ISPs for the most part are opposed to being classified as Title II, claiming the FCC shouldn't be allowed to tell them how to conduct business. This recent video by Verizon highlights the absurdity in this line of thought and spreads misinformation about the changes the FCC is now proposing (more on that next).

&amp;nbsp;

In April 2017, new FCC head Ajit Pai proposed rolling back Title II classification to Title I (information services), in a filing ironically referred to as ""Restoring Internet Freedom"". This would provide a light-handed approach in regulating something nearly 75% of Americans have access to (according to 2015 statistics as seen below).

&amp;nbsp;

Internet has indeed become a utility--it's as simple as that. Going forward, it would be impossible for anyone to not use the internet. It is vital and [regarded a basic human right by the United Nations Human Rights Council](http://gizmodo.com/internet-access-is-now-a-basic-human-right-1783081865).

&amp;nbsp;

**Without Neutrality**  
These are a couple of the major fears if the internet does not remain classified as a utility.

&amp;nbsp;

*Hypothetical: Pay-to-Access Content*  
Imagine groups of websites/internet services being bundled together and your ISP charging you access to them. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's the Cable TV model applied to the Internet. For instance: bundling Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and other streaming video services together and calling it a ""Video Streaming Bundle"" add-on for only $10 per month! Without subscribing to this bundle, you only get access to ""Internet Basic!""

&amp;nbsp;

*Hypothetical: Fast Lanes*  
Imagine an ISP charging Netflix and Hulu directly for better and faster performance on their network, leaving other streaming services on the regular (read: slower) speeds. As a result, customers experience manufactured fast and slow speeds depending on the service used. This concept also has the potential to alter competition and destroy innovation in the from of new businesses/services that can't afford a ""fast lane"" premium.

&amp;nbsp;

**What We Can Do**  

* Tell the FCC to leave Title II regulations for the Internet in place. Tell them you strongly believe the Internet is a utility. To do so, [visit this page on the FCC site](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:%28%2817-108%29%29) and click on the ""+Express"" link to leave a comment.

* Share this information with anyone who will listen. Educate your family, friends, and co-workers who may not be familiar with Net Neutrality. Protecting the Internet should be on everyone's radar.

personalfinance,Accepted new job offer - details inside,"Like the title says, I accepted an offer. In the process of the interviews and such I used this subreddit to help me so i thought I should return the advice for people looking. The details below:

I work in Software for Pharma companies (but not a CS or Engineer). I have done a lot of contracting (which is great for raises) but after buying a house with SO and getting used to that I realized I didnt want to travel anymore (don't travel much currently with this gig but that can change quickly in consulting). 

When I found a job I like that was in Bike distance (side note - not getting rid of the car but SO and I commute together currently and her car probably only has a few good years left so we want to keep to one car as much as possible) I applied (using linkedin - very important if you can find this). Linkedin allows you to submit your application with only your resume, this helps because it keeps HR in the dark initially about things like salary and such. 

Got an phone interview that day, when asked about currently salary I gave my wanted salary (about 32%) more than current pay which was a bit of a stretch but after my break-even analysis I needed at least a  12% increase (current employer pays grad school loans and I would have to take on the remainder - a little over 10k) and I knew (well highly suspected) my current employer would counter if it was within 15-20% because my annual raises have been within those. So I went for a high amount. HR still tried to get my current income but I refused. Next day HR said they could do between 3-5k less than that (this is high 5 figures), i said ok and we moved on to the in person interviews. 

Days before the in person interviews I was told to apply online through their site. This required my current or last jobs salary (it is important to not lie here because they check that). Did the interviews: team seems awesome, facilities is cool, and they liked me. Within an hour of leaving I was contacted by HR with an offer; since they knew my current salary (because of the application) they low balled me well under the agreed range (about 5k) and it was delivered with the ""this is a great offer but it's non-negotiable"" from HR. The offer was great and bonus eligibility along with awesome 401k match was tempting.

Since I like my current job I stuck to my guns and said we agreed on a range so the bottom of that range was the lowest acceptable offer. They came back and approved it the next day.  

My employer wanted to counter but said they couldn't come up that high so I told them not to worry about it and that I wanted to try this company out. Ended happily.

My advice for people looking for new jobs or trying to negotiate.

&amp;nbsp;

 use linkedin if possible and keep current salary to yourself as long as possible


&amp;nbsp; 

Have data and expected salary in your head before doing any interviews, HR is usually the person you battle with this.


 &amp;nbsp; 

know what your bottom number is so if/when you get an offer you are ready to say yes or no


&amp;nbsp; 

come on reddit to search and ask questions a lot of people are doing this type of deal everyday there is a ton of experience


&amp;nbsp; 

 if possible take a bit of a risk - either a higher position or higher salary. closed mouths don't get fed - you gotta ask.",finance

personalfinance,Everest private loan forgiveness?,"I unfortunately got swindled into one of for-profit schools.

Outstanding mortgage balance: $726,000
Interest Rate 3.09%

Lump sum amount $350,000

Should I put it towards the mortgage or should I pop it into the market to earn.  

Considerations:

-No short term need for the money. 
-RRSP's and TFSA's are maxed out so any market investments are going to see capital gains.  Currently getting around 8% in the market.  
-I would love the feeling of knocking down my mortgage.  So psychologically, there is a lot of value in that to me.  
-In Canada, there is no capital gains tax on primary residence but there is also no writing off principle residence mortgage interest.

personalfinance,Which Loan group should I focus on?,"Hello Everyone!

I graduated from university about two years ago and have been on a very strict weekly pay off payment plan using the avalanche method. I am coming upon a weird issue where I would have two separate loan groups that have the same interest rate but one loan has higher principal.

Logically, I think it shouldn't matter which one I start focusing on first, but I think it would end up being better financially if I focus on the one with higher principal. My main reasoning for that is the loan group with the higher principal has a higher minimum payment, so it would allow me to focus more leftover capital after paying the minimum payments on that specific loan group. Secondly, after doing a quick calculation to see my overall student debt APR, it looks like after paying off the higher principal loan I have a lower APR than paying off the smaller loan. Here are the numbers for those specific loan groups:

**Loan Group 1**

* Principal: $2,027.49
* Interest Rate: 3.86%
* Monthly Minimum Payments: $23.36

**Loan Group 2**

* Principal: $2,885.51
* Interest Rate: 3.86%

personalfinance,"I just paid off all my debt, but had to take a settlement on part of it. How is this going to affect my taxes for 2017?","Earlier today, I paid all my debt off. However, I had to take a settlement for part of it. I know the stuff I paid off in full with no forgiveness will not change my taxes in any way, so none of the numbers I'm about to mention include stuff paid off in full normally. All numbers are rounded up to the nearest $100.

I recently got a Beneficiary IRA setup, as my mother died and I got her IRA money. I understand the money I withdrew from the beneficiary IRA count as regular earned income with no penalty. In order to cover my debt, I withdrew $25,000 (net withdrawal) and withheld 25% for federal taxes. I'll likely earn about $35,000 at my job this year, giving me $60,000. I ended up paying $27,900 on an amount owed of $45,200. This means $17,300 will be counted as income.

This doesn't look like it's going to push me into the 28% tax bracket. It looks like I should have income of $77,300 which is below the 28% bracket. However, it's possible I may need to withdraw more money from the Beneficiary IRA. It's also possible I'll be getting a raise soon at work, which would change that $35,000 figure.

For background info, I am a French citizen, I've spent the majority of my life in the US, and I will be studying in the UK. I also have a very high credit score in the US (780), but pretty much no credit built up in Europe - if they even take that into as much consideration there as they do here.

1. Am I eligible to take out a federal loan in the US for grad school, even if I am not a US citizen and even if I will be studying abroad?

2. Is it better to take out a federal loan in the UK than in the US?

3. Alternatively, are federal loans in France better than the UK and US? - I have an immediate family member currently living in France whose address I could use, and who could co-sign for me.

4. If I am not eligible for federal loans, what should I be looking for in a private loan aside from interest rate?

5. How can I calculate the amount of money I need to take out in a loan outside of tuition cost? For example, I wanted to factor in the cost of a laptop, since I will definitely need one for school, and I would like to factor in the cost of at least one plane ticket home.

personalfinance,Working towards med school. Questions on managing credit card debt.,"I have $9,000 in credit card debt, $5,500 of which I'll be able to pay off by the end of this month due to some bonuses I'm receiving from military service. I'm going back to school, though, so I won't have much spare time to work a second job. I don't expect the income will be enough to live off of *and* make significant payments on this debt (though minimums aren't a problem).

I'm wondering what my best options are for managing it. Can I apply subsidized loans towards the debt? Does it make sense to take out an extra credit card with no interest for 18 months, switch all the debt over there, and not use the original card I hold the debt on now?

To be clear, I'm not at risk of bankruptcy or anything. My mom would be happy to help me pay this down if I asked her, and I can manage the monthly payments just fine. If I ever run the risk of going under water, the worst case scenario is I drop school and go back to work, where I'm making $60-$80k. I could pay it off in a few months without any problem whatsoever if I ever felt overwhelmed by it, so I'm not in a horrible spot.

But I'd really like to handle this myself as much as possible, and I only have to ride out another year without work. I have one year left of prerequisite courses before I can submit my med school application, and even if I get accepted I'll have a gap year between then and starting school. During that time I can pay off whatever I need to.

Is there any trick towards minimizing the impact of this debt until then? Paying it off with a lower interest rate debt, or, like I mentioned, opening a new card with no interest? I'm just worried about it getting out of hand because it's on a card right now.

EDIT: FWIW, my credit is strong enough to open new cards. It's mid 700's, used to be higher but going back to school affected credit utilization.",finance
personalfinance,I'm 18 and wanting to find an interest rate of &gt;8% and learn about stocks and/or passive income (AU),"Hi,
I'm an 18 y.o. living in Australia, studying university and looking for a part-time job.
I currently have $20,000 AUD in a bank term deposit (2.7% interest compounded daily).
I remember a teacher telling the class at the end of the year about the power of compound interest and he was using examples of 8% and 12%, but I have always wondered where I can get an interest rate &gt;8%.
I recently watched a YouTube video and it had a similar scenario, if you invest $300 per month (into something with a 10% interest rate) from the age 19 until you're 26 (total investment of 28,800), if you then leave it, by the age of 65 the amount will grow to $1,863,287. The video then revealed that this 10% reuturn rate was the average increase of the US stock market (S&amp;P 500). It also said to diversify your investments into internatial stocks and also bonds
However, I have no idea how stocks work and have been told how risky they are and that you should only invest what you are willing to lose.
I don't want to jump into the stock market without any knowledge. So I am wondering if anyone could guide me in where/how I can learn about the stock market or another investment option with a &gt;8% return rate or a passive income?

personalfinance,"Buying my first car, is 8.54% a bad apr?","(I'm on mobile at work so I apologize in advance for the bad formatting!)

I'm about to buy my first car, and I have 3 in mind. 
1.) 2013 Subaru Tribeca for $22k. 
2.) 2012 Toyota Avalon for $16.5k. 
3.) 2015 Chevy Cruze for $16k.

I don't really want opinions on cars, but more about the financial aspect of this. I applied for a $20k loan through my local credit union and was approved with 8.54% and 1k down. I'm military and I currently live overseas, and there isn't really another credit union to compete with. My two other banks that I use are known for having bad deals on auto loans so I haven't bothered with them. My credit score is around a 635 right now but I just paid off a loan (early) a month or two ago. The only way I was told to get a lower interest rate is to have a co-signer, and my only option would be my dad back stateside. I honestly don't think he has good credit to begin with because he's kind of struggled with debt my entire life, never makes payments on time, and has added financial burdens over the past few months because of my mother's passing.

I'm trying to do as much research as possible to make this happen, but I don't really know what I'm doing, or what I could be doing differently. Any help or advice or tips/tricks would be greatly appreciated!!

personalfinance,(CAN) - Quitting my job to focus on school. How should I use my savings vs Line of Credit?,"Hello All! This is my first reddit post :)
I'm a week away from my last day of work at a big accounting firm. I had to quit as they were not giving me enough time off to study for my CPA exam in September. 

I'm currently debating how I should allocate my resources over the summer. I have $6,500 saved and $14,000 available on my professional student line of credit (3.2% interest rate)

My monthly costs are quite low thankfully, and my savings will get me through about 20 weeks - this brings us to approximately the end of September. At this point, I'd have to use my line of credit. I have some big fixed expenses coming up related to school so after all these expenses considered I only have about 6,000 available on my line of credit which is another 20 weeks lets say.

Some people say that I should max out my line of credit first before I dip into my savings whereas I'd like to use my savings first and THEN use my line of credit.

Even though I am an accountant, I cannot see the benefit in doing it this way as I try to avoid debt as much as possible, but I'm wondering if anyone out there can provide me with a different insight!

personalfinance,Pay zero-interest debts or build an emergency fund?,"The dilemma here is more psychological,
let's assume you do have 5000$ in saving to be put into an emergency fund, on the same time you have 5000$ on debt (0% interest rate).

1- **You pay the debt**: 


**Pros**: Get rid of the feeling of being in debt, who lend you the 5k$ will trust you even more in money matters.


**Cons**: No Emergency fund.

2- **Build 5000$ emergency fund**:

**Pros**: Feel more secure.


**Cons**: Start all over again thinking about the debt which can be depressing.

personalfinance,Why are mortgages so much harder to get than student loans?,"I was genuinely surprised at how much harder it is to get a mortgage than student loans. The reason it surprises me is that students loans are given out way to easily. There is hardly any oversight in the process. If we break it down:

**Student Loans**

You fill out applications like the FAFSA to see how much federal loan money you qualify for. Any amount you need over those federal qualifications can come from a private lender. I don't remember getting any credit checks, income checks, or anything. It was the easiest process ever. No education on the interest rates. No education on the difference between subsidized and un-subsidized loans. 18 year old me could take our hundreds of thousands of dollars with zero financial knowledge, no credit, no income, and no auditing into what type of degree I was going to get.

And then on top of that... as soon as you go to orientation for your first day, there are credit card vendors just sitting outside matriculation just waiting to get you signed up for a credit card.

It feels so much like predatory lending.

**Mortgage**

Fill out a mortgage application. Fill out an application to purchase a home. Credit checks. Background checks. Send in pay stubs proving income. Send in all bank account information. Send in tax information. Prove education. Prove employment. Document any gift money. Document all assets. More paperwork. More discussion. Have to have house appraised to make sure you're not taking out too much mortgage. Limits to the loan amounts. Prove you have home insurance. Prove you can afford it.

**Question**

Even if the amounts were the same, say $100,000 for a home or $100,000 for student loans... why is the process between these two things so different? Shouldn't there be more oversight in the process of lending student loans?",finance

financialindependence,Help with a budget + spreadsheet request,"Posted this in Personal Finance but didn't get an answer. FIRE is more my jam anyway. 

Please excuse the throw away. Don't want people who know me to know my business! I'm looking for a little help here please. Long time r/personalfinance [edit: and FIRE] lurker; first time poster.

Well after a financial roller coaster through my 20s: college, law school, and having a number of more temporary jobs and living situations, I have FINALLY settled into a place where I have consistent monthly income and expenses. Before, my personal finance strategy was essentially trying to spend less than I took in any given month. It worked, but it made it very difficult to keep to any kind of budget in the spirit of this sub.

For the next year and a half (I'll be working for a judge), my income will be ~$4,000/month post-tax.

""Hard"" Expenses:

* Rent, inc'l insurance: $1000
* Student loans: $600 minimum (want to be aggressive)
* Fuel and auto insurance: $120 (estimated)
* Food: $200 (estimated)
* Health insurance: $60 (God bless Tricare)

So that leaves me about $1900 to play with for my IRA, 401k, and student loans.

If my average student loan APR is 5%, **with the goal of FI/RE in mind,**what would be the best way to allocate this? (Note: I plan to consolidate my loans into a private loan at a lower rate when I start my permanent job in 1.5 years--unless the Fed goes 1980 on us--but let's keep that discussion out of the scope of this question for now.

Also, does anyone have a good spreadsheet for this? I can't seem to find it in the sidebar.

personalfinance,Which loan should I pay off first? (Higher interest rate or higher daily interest accrued),"So I know that typical wisdom says to pay off the loan with higher interest rate. And that is what I have done while in college/internships.

* Loan 2: 8% on $8,000 -&gt; $1.75 every day on interest

personalfinance,Tough Choice: Pay off debt immediately or begin to invest?,"Hey guys! Throw away because a lot of people know my normal reddit account and I want some privacy on that regard. 

I am a 25 year old graduate from law school. Just started my job at a law firm making 80k. They are paying me this same salary while I study for the bar (passage in August God willing). My wife is a teacher. Combined we make about 115k per year salaried plus about 40k from a side hustle. Our combined take home right now is $8,750 including the side hustle. No kids. I don't think my exact breakdown of expenses is that relevant, but our total expenses are  $2,600. 

Notable things. 

175k house with 35k in equity. = 140k mortgage. 

I have 80k student loans at an average of 5.1% (highest is 5.8%).

Student loans are in deferment until January 1, 2018 because I just got out of school. Going to set up payment for 25 years at $500 per month and then pay them off ASAP via avalanche method so that the most possible goes to the higher interest loans. 

My firm contributes 5% to my 401(k) retirement account each year regardless of if I contribute, meaning that I do not have a match that I need to contribute to to get.  

One other thing, it is extremely crucial to my wife and I to have my student loans paid off by the day that I turn 30, so 5 years from right now. That is when we want to start a family and we want to be as debt free as possible by then. 

Okay so here is my question. I have two avenues the way that i see it. I can either pay off my student loans with every extra dollar I have, about $6,150 per month paying it off in about 15 months, then start contributing some to retirement (15% probably) and power through my mortgage, paying it off in about 3 years, and then being 100% debt free and spending the rest of my days maxing out my 401, wifes teacher pension, 2 roths, and throwing a ton more into taxable. I would be debt free by around 29 years old. 

Second option, pay $2,000 per month on my loans, paying them off slowly over 4 years. Now doing this, I could go ahead and max 2 roths, my 401(k), my wife's teacher pension, and save a little extra. In addition, I would open up a solo 401(k) (already confirmed I can) for the side hustle and contribute about 28k per year to that from my side hustle, only having about 12k of taxable income instead of 40k. The mortgage would just stick around for a bit and I would just pay it off later (not that concerned as it is a 3.15% interest rate.) The benefit of this is better mathematically on paper. The tax savings are outrageous. I just feel that it would be completely awesome to have my loans gone by 26 and my house paid off my 29 with some retirement savings. Then again, it would be insane to have my loans gone at 29 and have a TON of money in retirement accounts and some in taxable accounts. 

Thoughts? 

Edit 1: Mortgage is a 15 year.

Edit 2 : I should have mentioned that I already have a 15k emergency fund, a 3k checking account buffer, and about 5k in savings for sinking fund accounts types things like car repairs, maintenance, etc. 

Edit 3: My main concern with putting everything toward the debt is that by not maxing out tax advantaged accounts (401 and solo 401) we are paying 15-20k more in taxes each year. That sucks. I got that number by the following. 28k solo 401 + 18k 401 = 46k. 1/3 of 46k = 15.5k in taxes due. Ew.",finance
personalfinance,[HOUSING]How to finance a home repair? I've already started work.,"I own a home in Louisiana that needs a lot of work. I've already started work. I need to a loan or HELOC to finish and will probably pay it off early with the sale of my house. I would like to stay away from paying closing costs for a loan.


I ran into termite damage while preparing my home for sale. It is not listed yet. I called about a HELOC and was told that I need an appraisal, but an appraiser could not get an appraisal because the floors are open and I've already started work, therefore I could not get the HELOC until the work is complete. (Capital One told me this)

I checked into PenFed because I found an online post that said that PenFed doesn't require an appraisal. However, if I pay the HELOC off/close the line of credit early (which I plan to do), I have to pay the closing costs that PenFed originally paid upon the origination of the HELOC.

I have a good amount of equity in my house, but it looks like I will have a problem tapping into it.

Owe: $57K / current mortgage $99K

Last appraisal: 2010 @ $165K

I really want to get my home ready to sell, but it's beginning to look like my funding options are limited short of pulling out of my savings ($10K) or my Roth IRA ($60K) and taking a penalty for pulling out of my Roth IRA. However, I don't want to tap out all of my resources because I will be buying another home and foresee that I will need money for that.

personalfinance,"Six-figure savings, zero income. How to invest?","Thinking about investing gives me a headache, and I have spent most of my adult life avoiding it. However, I just quit my job and am planning on traveling (inexpensively) for a couple of years, and I figure I should try to be responsible since it will be a while before I earn a significant income... I spent some time looking at resources on this subreddit already, but it seems like a lot of them assume there is some kind of steady income.

The current state of my finances is relatively straightforward? I  have 90k in a savings account with a 1.05% interest rate (Goldman Sachs, woo woo!). I have an additional 10k in a couple different checking accounts that I use for ATM withdrawals, direct payment of credit cards, etc. I saved this money over the past 2.5 years by earning a generous income and living modestly.

I have zero debt and my only monthly expense is car insurance ($80/month). I bought the car with cash and could sell it in a pinch for ~5k. I just turned 25, and am on my family's medical insurance (at no additional cost), so I expect another year before I need to figure out my own health insurance. My credit score is in the 780s.

I have 12k in a profit-sharing trust from my former employer instead of a retirement account. I can let them continue to manage my funds for 0.42% a year. It looks like I can withdraw any amount at any time at a 20% tax rate. I also have about 7 days to decide if I want them to roll it into an IRA account, though I do not currently have an IRA.

I am budgeting to spend about 20k/year while traveling, though, realistically, I expect to spend about 15k/year. How much of an emergency fund do I *actually* need, considering I will likely be traveling internationally? 10k seems reasonable, but it feels like such a small amount relative to what I have saved. 20k?

I am fairly conservative when it comes to investing (which is partly why I have avoided it up until now) and would prefer a slower, steadier return to something more volatile. I would also like to keep this as simple and easy to manage as possible. I do not know the next time I will have a steady (or any) income, but I might try to pick up freelance or contract work to supplement my spending (which I know is an entirely different tax headache). I also have no idea when I will want to settle down and/or plan for a family, but I expect to want both of those things eventually.

Any help or advice is appreciated.

EDIT: In addition to an emergency fund, I need some portion of my savings or investment to be fairly liquid, since I will be living off of that for the next couple years.",finance

personalfinance,Two Personal Victories!,"Hey, guys! First time posting here. A bit of background. My wife's a school teacher, and I'm a student. Back in August, we had our first child two months early, where she stayed for 1.5 months in the NICU. I accepted all available federal student loans (FAFSA) for the year in anticipation of potential medical issues.

She's doing great, and since the loans paid for school, we had extra money. Another note, I have a full-ride ROTC scholarship. We live in an area with low cost of living (86 vs. the national average of 100 on cost of living index), so I switched my scholarship to housing and tuition, which is $5,000 per semester. My tuition costs less than that ($3,800 per semester maybe?), so we make money by using the housing check for tuition.

Now for the good stuff. We've been saving, and hit a couple benchmarks:

* **GERMANY**: I was an exchange student in Germany in high school, and have been dying to go back. My wife teaches history with an emphasis on WWII. We have essentially been saving since we got married (2.5 years ago). The baby drew money away from that, but we threw all the student loan money into savings. Our trip was a success! We found two round-trip tickets totaling $1,700 with lodging and food (except for lunches) covered by staying with my host-family. Travel was also mostly covered by riding with friends in their car. Our original budget was $5,000, but that was cut to $3,000 since we found such cheap tickets. We felt like we spent/bought all that we wanted to without having to be frugal because we saved for just that.

* **CAR**: Because we had money left over from our Germany trip, plus a $5,000 tax return, we paid off the $8,500 left on our 2014 Toyota Corolla **today**. We feel so free! Definitely blessed to be in a situation to whittle down our debt.

All that we have now are student loans. Our plan is to accept all grants and *subsidized* loans and start paying off the *unsubsidized* loans. I still have two more years of school, so that will give us some time. Luckily, I'm studying engineering, so I should land a good job.

I'm not 100% on the loan details seem alittle strange and I'm having a hard time piecing it all together.  I wish my loan servicer (ditech) would simply state what type of mortgage this is. I think it's an 5/1 ARM as the rate seems to every year (it shows the rate being adjusted twice a year).

I think we've been pretty lucky as it states we started with a 5.25% interest rate (according to the servicer website) and since it converted, we've had rates in the low 3s. From 2015-2016, it was 3.125 and recently it went up to 3.625.

I dont think rates would drop back down to 3.125 (your guess is probably better than mine), so this sounds like a good time to refi?

personalfinance,"(US) 22 year-old, I need some advice as I start a new job","I am a 22 year-old that is graduating tomorrow. I managed to get a job already and I need some advice when it comes to taxes, benefits, and savings planning.

Questions:

1. Should I do any additional tax withholding? My parents are worried that I will be in trouble when it comes to taxes since I don't really have any tax deductions other than my students loans.
2. Do you have any tips for paying off student loan debt (just extra payments or anything else)? Should I skip the grace period?
3. Should I put more towards my 401(k)? What about Roth After-Tax Savings (I don't know what this is, but it's on the benefits page)?
4. Should I get dental even if I have dental through my parents? 
5. Do you have any advice for saving/investing? I would like to start savings up for a down payment on a house. I looked into 13 month, $1000/$500 CD's with an interest rate of 1.34%. I was thinking about doing this for a year, then do some regular saving with the same amount over the next year while the CD's return. That should be a hefty down payment if I go with the $1000 CD's. Is this a good idea?


My new job starts before the end of the month with a starting salary of $62,000 ($2384.62 bi-weekly gross, $1679.73 bi-weekly take home). I have a little less than 3 months worth of expenses as liquid savings already from a previous job.

* Monthly Take-home: $3359.46
* Total Monthly Expenses: $1021

Net Cash Flow: $2338.46

After 6 month grace period, I have to start paying back my student loans:

*      Total Student Loan: $28,532 ($3500 subsidized)
*      Monthly Payment: $291
*      Time: 10 years (I want to pay this off much sooner)
*      Interest Rate: 4.2%

New Net Cash Flow: $2047.46

* 401(k): Basic explanation, if I put in 4%, the company will put in 8%. Contributions are pre-tax.

personalfinance,When is investing in my retirement better than paying off my debts?,"I have about 60k in student loans. Half of which have an interest rate of about 3.5%, and the other 30k have an interest rate of 5.3%.

I have the means to pay these off pretty aggressively. My minimums are about $820/mo, but I have been paying on average about $1300 per month over the last year and a half. If I continue at this rate, and up my payments slightly every few months, I believe I can have these paid off in 4 years from now, by the time I am 28. 

I'm wondering if it makes more sense to invest in my retirement earlier, rather than focus on my student loans? If I lower my payments, my student loans will accrue interest for at most 7 years, whereas if I invest in my retirement that money could grow for ~40 years.

Is there some math that makes this make sense?",finance

I'm trying to invest my Roth in a Target Retirement fund, but I'm only allowed to invest the $500 that's in the Settlement Fund. Why is this?

personalfinance,Student Loan Option Help. Need some sort of financial strategist help.,"Hello Everyone, 
I have been looking to plan my future student loan pay out and I need some help and guidance.  I posted something like this before and everyone told me i just need to pay my loans off ASAP.  It doesnt seem that most people really understand the situation.  But I am looking for some help and reason as to which option would be best for me. 

Financial Situation: Wife and I currently rent and our gross income is ~$111,000.  She has student loan debt that will be paid off in 2 years.  Currently have a Car Loan and Student Loan 

Current Student Loan Situation: $121,686.35 Interest Average 6.5% 
Current Car Loan: $17,000  Interest 1.83% 

Repayment options 
1) Standard 10 year repayment
 - consolidate public loans to private and decrease interest rate to decrease monthly payment 
- current 10-year payment is $1450.  Unable to afford to pay this amount each month 
- Estimated Monthly Payment $1400/month 
- Loan Life 10 years 

2) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Jointly) 
- REPAYE option: 10% of discretionary income a month for up to 20 years then loan is forgiven 
- Monthly Payment $631.  Calculation based on studentloan.gov website should loan would be paid off in 18 years with no loan forgiven.   This website assumes your income increases %5 every year but Mine is projected to be 3% if i remain staff not dont move up to management position (im a physical therapist) 

3) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Separately) 
- PAYE: 10% of loan holders discretionary income 
- This option will let me pay a decreased monthly payment since my wife and i will file separately. 
- Add additional monthly deposit to make up for the Tax on the loan forgiven after 20 years. 
- I recieve decreased amount from taxes 
- monthly payment : $300 + $200( for tax forgiveness) /month 
- Not sure how to invest my $200 a month

Anyone have any idea on what the best option for me is?  
I know that the 1st option saves me the most money but I have to pay $1000 on top of my monthly payment!  I am not saving enough money to afford putting that much in.  We're also looking to get a house and need to save money for a down payment and closing costs.  

When providing feedback please back up your thoughts! I already know how much more I will pay over time with option 2 and 3

Ripple,The real Tax Implications of withdrawing/trading out of Ripple ( Or any other Crypto) .,"With the surge of gains we've had in the last week I'd like to take some time to post on here some real financial implications we all will eventually have if we sell or trade out of XRP at these highs. 

** This is only for those of us in the United States of America *** 

Any transaction that you conduct via trading for USD/Alt Coins etc... is a taxable event. This means you will have to pay Federal capital gains tax and State capital gains tax on any amount over your initial investment recoup. 

If you believe XRP will continue to increase in value, and the amount of money you made, isn't enough to significantly benefit you long term, my best advice to you is to wait 1 year and 1 day after your original purchase of X amount of XRP to cash out. To benefit from Long Term Capital Gains tax rates (0%/15%/20%) 

Otherwise if you withdraw at day 365 (1 year) you could be faced with a very large tax bill resulting from Short Term Capital Gains depending on where you fall along our progressive USA tax bracket. Meaning any short term gains will be taxed at Ordinary Income tax rates ( 10%,15%,25%,28%,33%,35%,39.60%). 

Please use this link to see the 2017 tax brackets (https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/) 

If you withdrawal 1 year and 1 day after purchase this will classify as Long Term Capital Gains and depending on your ordinary income bracket, will be taxed at 0%/15%/20%.

So an example would be : If before accounting for your Crypto profits your taxable income would be above about $37,950 per year you'd fall into the 15% bracket. Unless you make $418,000 per year then your taxed at 20%. 

As shown above, USA tax rates are progressive meaning if you made $20,000 last year but had $20,000 in crypto profits 18,000 of your long term Crypto profits would be taxed at 0% the other 2,000 would be taxed at 15%. 

Keep in mind these are all federal tax rates, and each state does have capital gains taxes you will also have to pay as well. In California these get as high as 33%! So you could potentially be hit with a federal of 20% and a state of 13% for a total of 33% of your profits taxed by the government.

There are also state tax implications it's best to consult with a local CPA. I have currently passed 3/4 CPA exams ( Tax Regulation included) and am sitting for my last exam at the end of this month. As always if this is helpful to any of you, feel free to Tip in BTC/XRP, gotta Grind to make back the money I spent on study materials!

Disclaimer: This is my own interpretation of current tax law. Consult about your specific situation with a local CPA/Lawyer.

Some individuals are stating they are deferring gains by utilizing form 8824 for 1031 exchanges (i.e. XRP to Bitcoin, etc..).

The best way to verify if this is allowed would be to send in a request to the IRS for a Private Letter Ruling explaining your specific situation and asking permission for this kind of treatment.


In my professional opinion knowing the technical differences between each coin I highly doubt this treatment will be verified. BTC ledger and system is entirely different than XRP/ETH etc...

personalfinance,I want to see more of my check each month - want to know how I should adjust my W-4.,"Good morning, all.

This may be a dumb question, but I've tried using the witholding calculator on IRS.gov, and it's slightly confusing.... I am currently claiming 1 allowance on my W-4 (for myself) -- I'm single, no kids, not married, etc.

I'm wondering if I should claim 2 allowances?

Gross salary: 37,800 

Deductions: 500/paycheck (roughly... it's just a tad over 500)

This year I got a refund of 900 (with student loan interest accounted for it gave me a little extra).

The thing is... I don't want a refund.  I would like to see more money in my check every 2 weeks, but I also don't want to owe, either. Is this possible?  

My AGI for last year was just a little over $30,000 after all the deductions and everything.  I did get a bonus this year ($600), and my income has gone up a little bit (I'd say it's gone up 3%).  I expect another raise in June or September.  I work for the federal government, so it's pretty predictable.  My salary should go up to 39,000 or so once I get my raise.

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans or Save for Retirement?,"Our financial snapshot:

Me (27) and wife (29).  
Household income: $159k before annual bonus (amount unknown)

Student Loan balance: $92k w/ a weighted average interest rate of ~6%

After monthly expenses w/o contributing to retirement, we have an extra ~$2500 per month to allocate either to retirement or student debt.  

Personally, my student loans feel like a weight on my shoulders that I want to get rid of ASAP.  I'm tempted to forego retirement savings and put all of my extra money into my student loans.  That would be a guaranteed 6% ROI for every dollar I pay off early.  However, it just feels wrong to not be contributing to my retirement.  I'm starting a new job in July and my new employer doesn't match any 401(k) contributions until 1 year of employment, so I wouldn't be leaving money on the table by foregoing retirement contributions for a year.

What does PF think?  Should I aggressively pay off student loans and forego two years of retirement savings? Or, should I pay student loans slightly less aggressively (5 year payoff instead of 2-3), and contribute to retirement savings at the same time?  For the record, I have a 6 month emergency fund in a 1% savings account, so no problems there.",finance
Bitcoin,Which would you prefer single backend or federated backends? (Poll),"I was thinking about the difference between the Copay backend and Electrum backend today.

1. Copay's backend is all open source, and you can run your own and share your backend with others if you want. However, there's no way to broadcast your backend server to the public and all clients default to Bitpay's public backend.
2. Electrum's backend is all open source, and you can run your own and share your backend with others if you want. AND you can set it to announce itself to the public, allowing anyone to connect, and clients default behavior is to look at the list of announced backends and pick one at random to connect to.

Question: Which do you think is better?

One of the main concerns with both backends is privacy for people who don't run their own backend.

Is it better to default to a company which we are sure won't be spying on us (out of trust) or to trust a list of randos on the internet to not be NSA agents collecting as much info as possible?

iirc both backends make a point to encrypt and blind the backend of as much as possible.... but there's no way to blind the backend of 1. your client's global IP and 2. Your raw transactions that are broadcasted.

(I am aware Electrum offers tor, but this is not default, so for most random users off the street, it's irrelevant to my question.)

I have savings bonds from when I was little and am wondering if I should apply them to some of my loans. 

I have received a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized loans to reach this total of $19,000.

I have two loans from salliemae, $18,000 each, one at 3.5% and one at 6.5%. I also have roughly a dozen fedloans. They were taken out various quarters (like semesters) over my five years at school and vary in amount and interest. They all have fixed interest rates which vary from 3.4% to 6.8%. They add up to about $31,000 so in total I have roughly $66,000 to pay off.

I am out of school working as a paid intern. Because of my intern status I am technically not graduated and so my loans are all deferred. But in a few months I will hopefully have a career position and will graduate, at at that point my loan payments will begin in earnest and I may want to refinance at that time.

Let's say a government,  doesn't have to be the U.S.,  gets fed up with crypto and how it ""is capable"" of funding terrorists,  drugs,  and the myriad of other illegal activities and bans anonymity.  Meaning that any exchange based in their country must secure identification before transactions can be made,  AND,  cannot be associated with any other anonymous exchanges.

That's pretty big.

Now think about this.  Look man,  Ripple ain't no joke,  backed by fucking Google and has customers like BOA and Santander and 75 other huge banks  They'll already be ahead of the game.  

So lets say that Ripple is like ok,  pull XRP from any anonymous exchange.  Done.  XRP value on those exchanges may plummet,  and it may plummet across the board as well.  Until people realize that XRP is exclusive.  The network will only consist of TRUSTED affiliates,  banks,  etc.

Ripple is talking about spreading their nodes to trusted universities,  the govt,  hospitals,  etc.  How in the fuck can any shitcoin compete with that.  They're trusting some guy in his basement mining coins.

Anyways,  so President Trump comes up and says,   yep,  we're banning any crypto that is traded on anonymous networks in any other country.  Well ripple already has their shit together so,  that's were they can become exclusive.

Remember,  the only value in a coin is who backs it.  The bank backs my dollar and they are backed by the US govt.  Only exchanges back shitcoins.  Remember what happened at Mt Gox?

So I was visiting Polo's twitter today,  it was almost strictly posts about how they're getting attacked,  DDOSd and how their system was down.  Take a look.

Now visit Ripples twitter and Gatehub,  only stories of success and problems with too many people trying to open/access accounts.  No mention of hacks,  stolen coins,  DDOS,  etc.

Here's a question,  so if banks are going to use XRP,  will they back it?  I would assume they will have to.  They use it,  so in a perfect world I could transfer XRP to my bank account into dollars.  That's when it becomes real.  Ripple already has a head start on everyone when it comes to the banks and the banks have the money,  not some shitty exchange that can disappear (Mt Gox) overnight with your untraceable shitcoins.

Unlike most traders,  I want some sort of centralization,  someone responsible.  Someone that has the ability to change things.  However,  it must still be a community that is based on majority vote and I believe that's what Ripple is going for.

So,  if governments prevent exchanges on their soil from accepting or transferring coins tied to anonymous exchanges in other countries,  it will be the fall of bitcoin and the rise of any tied to vetted exchanges.  My opinion,  Ripple and XRP will only be available to banks and government approved exchanges.  It will be the equivalent of US dollars worldwide.

Anyways,  if you have thoughts to share I would love to hear them.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,friend works 40+ hours/wk but not full-time,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice to give to my friend. She has been working at a certain grocery store chain for about 6 months now. She was hired as part-time, but consistently works 38-45 hours/wk. She usually gets scheduled 6 days a week, and recently has gone 14 days straight of working with no day off. Lately she has been asked to take on more of a ""leadership"" role at closing but has received no additional compensation or title.

I am just wondering if there is anything she can do to get them to declare her full-time so she can get benefits, or how she can go about asking for more days off in a week without coming off as ungrateful. She's fine working that amount of hours a week, but would rather condense it into, say, 5 days. Their argument is they are short staffed and they need a good closer.

She's saving up for college and desparately needs this job so I don't want her to get fired or anything.",finance

personalfinance,Planning to buy a new vehicle. Trying to weigh financing/investing options.,"Some background:

&amp;nbsp;

-27yo  
-$16K in savings (weekly paychecks at $1.1K after tax, retirement, and med/dental)  
-$8K in 401K account (current company doesn't do matching)  
-$2K monthly expenses (2 bed apartment, split rent with GF)  
-Recently paid off student loans  
-Have never owned a Credit Card. Credit score currently 635  
-Likely to be offered a $120-$130K salary position + signing bonus, stock option, and 401K matching by end of Q3 this year

&amp;nbsp;

I moved here a couple years ago and I donated my fading '97 Camry before the trip. Have been car-less since. Was working from home for the first year but started contracting at a well known software company this past year. Both the bus and carpooling has eaten into a lot of time I'm trying to reserve for GF, dog, and personal projects.

&amp;nbsp;

The company has expressed an interest in bringing me on board as an official employee around September this year. If that happens, then I'd like to purchase a new vehicle. If it does not, then my contract will end in November and I'd like to transfer a good chunk of my estimated $30K savings at that time into an IRA for a future house down payment.

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming the new offer does come through though, I'm trying to decide how I should handle financing on this potential vehicle. I've been looking at a $30K 2017 compact SUV. Something that I hope will be a smart purchase given the size and fuel economy for a future family. Come September/October, with my current habits I should have a little over $25K in savings. My plan at purchase time is to maintain at least 3 months worth of savings ($6K), put the remaining $19K as a down payment on the car, and finance the remaining $11K over 2-3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is, given my credit score, and lack of credit history, is it even feasible that I could get an $11K loan with a sub 2% interest rate? And If not, how likely is it that owning, and using a Credit Card between now and September/October, would raise my credit score enough to make that loan possible?

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my student loans?,"I seem to read often on this sub that you shouldn't consolidate your student loans as you can end up paying more over the long haul that way. 

I have two student loans through two different providers (Great Lakes and Navient). The Great Lakes one seems to be going okay, I can see the number going down after being out of school for about 6 years now. But the Navient one feels like it hasn't budged at all. The Navient loan has an 8% interest rate, which seems crazy high to me. I'm paying $350-400 per month on that one, and $300 on the Great Lakes loan.

Is this still a situation where I should stay there course? Or would it potentially be better to consolidate these loans and hope for a better interest rate?

personalfinance,How aggressively to pay back student loans ?,"I have very recently graduated from university with my bachelors degree. I have tallied up all of my loans and I am wondering about how aggressive my timeline should be when paying back.

The total my loans amounts to is:

$54,779 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.89%


I do have a job lined up. I will be starting at the beginning of June. The financial info is as follows:

$69,000 annual salary, $5000 signing bonus, ROA bonus that ranges from 10%-22% of salary. Looking through the past couple years the ROA bonus is closer to 15%. 401K is on the lower side with a 25% match up to 7% of your salary. 

I will be able to keep my cost of living fairly low. I have calculated my monthly expenses to be $1500 a month as long as I don't do something silly like go out and finance a brand new car.

I have never made this much money before. In fact the amount of taxes I will be paying on a years salary will be more than I have ever made in a year.

personalfinance,How to fix the mess i put myself in...,"About 8 months ago my So and I hit a bit of a ruff patch and I  (being the super intelligent person I am) decided we could use a credit card to help keep us afloat (only car broke down and I worked out of town). I started with a normal credit card but the limit wouldn't allow the repairs I needed so I ended up having to get another through the store to cover the price. Fast forward a couple months and I lost my job and had 4 active credit cards... I eventually found a job again but we are being on 3 of the card payments and every week I feel like I'm not actually to make any sort of progress on this debt. I got a letter in the mail from one of those mass letter of ""pre-approved loans"" and when I looked into it the rates were 300% interest. I know that's an ungodly amount but would it be better to have one payment that isn't late or just keep trying to make individual payments on the cards... If anyone knows of a decent loan company that allows loans to low credit people that would be much appreciated and thank you in advance

Edit: Thank you for saving me a bunch of money! and I've thrown away the paper but 300 wasn't a typo, I'm not sure if that was interest rates or something else, though I'm not sure what else it could be, but that number was the only reason I didn't immediately take it to turn all my bills into one",finance

personalfinance,Removing PMI (No ReFi),"Hello r/pf,  
  
Hoping to get some advice here for success with removing PMI without Refinancing.  
    
Demographics: home purchased 13 months ago for $315k in Denver suburbs, current online (redfin/Zillow) show value of $360-375, currently have been offered a HELOC of 23k with a driveby appraisal at 373k, we owe around ~290K.  We are considering doing a major remodel of the backyard that is going to cost ~25k which is basically just a scrape all the ruined grass and weeds out and replant/ zeroscape the yard in a maintainable way, the backyard alone is 14k sq ft.  We have seen our exact home go for 350-400k in the past year, with the backyard redone and the interior work we have done, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to get an official appraisal for 390-410k.  We would be using the HELOC to fund 90% of this project, I do not think it makes sense to refi after it is done, we have a 3.75% and do not want to move up in interest as basically our payments would stay the same + HELOC payments (unless we cashed out refi which I want to avoid).  Please, I am not asking for wether you think the HELOC is a good idea or bad idea or to analyze our financial situation, I've done that on another thread.  I am asking for help with success in removing PMI with a new appraisal, our servicer is CENLAR.  I messaged them a few weeks ago about removing PMI and this is what their CSR sent back:  
  
&gt;qouted text
If you feel you have met the guidelines, please submit a written request sent by mail  
  
Alternatively, the request and any additional questions may be sent via email to PMI@loanadministration.com.   
   
The request will be reviewed to determine if all requirements to terminate Private Mortgage Insurance have been met.  Upon completion of our review, you will receive written notification in approximately 30 days advising you if we are able to accommodate your request.  
   
Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) Guidelines:  
   
When a loan reaches a certain loan-to-value ratio (LTV) it may be eligible for PMI removal.  Loan-to-Value ratio is based on purchase price or original appraised value, whichever is LESS.  
   
Ex:  Purchase price $100,000 (lesser), Original appraised value $150,000 (higher), Current loan balance $90,000.  LTV: $100,000/ $90,000= 90.0%  
              
Refinanced loans:  
  
• If an appraisal was completed, LTV will be based on the appraised value.  
• If an appraisal was not performed or required, the value given by the lender at the time of loan closing will be utilized.  
   
Removal Requirements  
   
*Please note all requests are subject to the final approval of Investor and/or [NPL= CENLAR, PL= Enter clients name] and may warrant further requirements be met prior to PMI removal eligibility*  
   
1.  PMI can be removed when the LTV has reached 80.0% of the original value.  If the LTV is not 80.0% there is the option to pay down the loan.  A Good Payment History must be maintained, which includes no payments 30 or more days late in the last year, no payments 60 or more days late in the last 2 years and no outstanding late charges.  If loan is not seasoned for at least 2 years the existing pay history will be assessed.  If you wish to submit a pay down to reach the 80.0% LTV, the amount will be calculated based on the original value of the property.  This amount will be determined by our PMI removal analysts.    
   
2.  An appraisal can be ordered when a loan has been seasoned for two years starting with the 1st payment date.  If an appraisal is desired prior to two years, evidence of completed substantial structural improvements must be submitted to our PMI department. These improvements would then be reviewed by our PMI removal analysts to determine if an early appraisal can be granted.  If an appraisal is requested and the borrower is eligible, then a LTV of 75.0% is required if the loan is less than 5 years seasoned.  If the loan is more than 5 year seasoned then a LTV of 80.0% is required.  Good Payment History must be maintained. (See #1 for specifics)  
&lt;qouted text  
  
So I am having a bit of a hard time understanding this response, at one point it looks like they only go by original purchased price. But at #2 it seems to state you can get an appraisal ordered, I know it also states after 2 years, but a ~8% of original price investment I hope qualifies as ""evidence of completed substantial structural improvements"" (we have never paid later than the 1st of the month as well).  At 390k we would be at a 75% LTV.  I have found very mixed reviews on removal of PMI w/o a refi, so I am hoping someone with experience can help.  
  
I realize there is no clear path here we could spend the 25k and be on the hook for the HELOC and PMI, which would significantly suck and we'd most likely ultimately end up refing to a higher interest rate. If we could get out of PMI we could then knock out the HELOC in 1-2 years, w/o the added pressure of putting a large amount extra to organically pay down our mortgage to remove PMI.

The issue is, as I'm sure many other redditors would agree with me, at this sort of age we move between jobs/areas quite frequently, so I'm not sure if this its worth it at this point. Some points I'd like to peoples thoughts on are as follows;

With interest rates so dire, is property a sensible option right now, with savings doing so little sitting in ISA's?

Considering that the area has two big universities and is a relatively thriving city, would it be a good idea, as I can rent it out quite safely after being it in for 2 years or so?
Being from an area where I know I won't be afford property for a good few years, would this make sense as a starter on the property ladder?

personalfinance,Does a larger down payment on a loan for a new car help get a better APR?,"The headline pretty much has the question I have. But here is the background as well. So I was originally in the market for a good used car. However while I was at one of the dealerships, a brand new car was only $1,000 or so more. I don't have great credit, but it is okay considering all the college debt I still have. 

Anyway, for curiosity I filled out an application for the new car loan and I got approved. I wasnt ready to make a decision that day, but they obviously tried to push for me to take it home that day. And they kept knocking it down to a really good offer. I told them I really needed to research it better and I would prefer to save up for a larger down payment. They said down payment wouldnt change anything. They were originally wanting me to take it home with no money down, which scared me for some reason. The thought of taking something that expensive home without putting a cent into it made me feel really nervous.

Anyway, they didn't say what the apr would be (I was too dumb to think to ask). However, capital one was saying if I go through them it would be 3%-8% depending on the length of the loan and the type of car. So I am thinking it would be closer to the lower end since it is a new car. 

Would I get a better interest rate if I make a larger down payment? And if it matters, this is for a Hyundai elentra, and it would be just about $11,000 plus tax. At least that was the final offer that was on the table

Tuition is ~$10,000 per year, room and board is another ~$12,000 per year, including a meal plan.

personalfinance,Fresh college graduate with 90k student loans dedicated to paying them off as fast as possible. Choose extended repayment plan for lower monthly payments even though I plan on paying 6x that for the added flexibility?,"Hey guys, new college grad. I graduated into a field (pharmacy) where starting salaries are around 100-140k. I have around 90k in student loans I want to pay off as soon as possible. I live in a relatively low cost-of-living area and share an apartment with my girlfriend so my monthly expenses are (conservatively) around 1500 including rent, car, food etc. Health insurance is not included in that as I have yet to figure that out. I estimate my starting salary to be around 110K in my area, leaving me with about 70k per year after taxes (Federal, FICA, state) or about $5800 monthly take home. I can realistically pay about $4000 monthly to my student loans but I'm planning on paying $3000 monthly while I purchase furniture and save for other things. 

So my question comes in on which payment plan to choose. I'm stuck choosing between the 10 year fixed payment or the 25 year fixed payment. As far as I can tell, it doesn't really matter which one you choose if you plan on paying extra every month and finishing before 10 years is up. The only difference is if you have a rough month or two, you only have to come up with about 500 dollars for the minimum payments instead of 1000 dollars.

This isn't taking into account refinancing options which I'll look at doing once my grace period is up.

TL;DR: Paying off 90k in loans over 3 years. Does the payment plan matter if you pay it off faster than the plan requires?

I think I found a good way to invest it, would like some advice on it first.","I recently learned I have access to something from USAA called the career starter loan, for individuals about to receive a military commission (I'm going into the reserves).  here are the basic terms:  up to $25,000 available, 60 month loan, 2.99% APR, no payments due until 12 months after commissioning.  I heard about this before, but I didn't think I could find a suitably low risk investment with a return that would be reliably over the interest rate to make this worthwhile.  Since then, I've looked into alternatives to index funds, stocks, and bonds and found lending club, which although having a variable return has a relatively tight distribution around 7% (I would invest in all C grade notes).  
My source of concern is that this may make me significantly over-leveraged.  I have about $4000 in cash/savings, no debts aside from a credit card I pay off every month, and $9000 in stocks/index funds.  I will graduate after this summer and according to my budget for the rest of my time in college will finish with about $900 in cash left and without touching my current investment.  I don't have a job lined up, but I'm pretty confident I will find a good one that I can go into shortly after graduation.  The sources of risk I see are either that my return on a $25000 investment dips below 3%, or that there is risk from the lending club platform itself (never used it before, but I believe if Lending Club itself goes belly up I don't have a way to recover my capital).  
after doing a few simulations on excel,  it looks like if everything goes well my expected profit would be between $3000 and $4500 after the loan is paid off.  
My questions are:
1. Is lending club, all C grade notes from different lenders, a good investment idea?  Should I invest elsewhere or attempt some diversification?
2. Is taking this loan on for an investment worthwhile?  Is the risk too high, or am I missing some other source of risk?

personalfinance,Current US College Student with Question on Paying off Debt,"Currently a college student in the US with about $1k in credit card debt. I will have money to pay this off in the summer (in about a month) once I start work. 

I am considering doing a personal loan through Upstart to pay off he debt immediately and make regular payments at a lower interest rate. Alternatively, I will be able to pay off the amount (I have already paid minimum payments for the month) in around a month, but I am scared of how this will effect my credit score, given the utilization ratio.

Would you recommend taking out the small personal loan to lower the ratio and begin lower-interest payments now, or waiting a month (with a large balance) and paying off over 60-70% of the debt at once?",finance

She was a stay at home mom for most of her live, so her SS benefits are estimated to be pretty dismal (I think $200ish a month).     

My question is this: we plan on paying her enough so that she can fund an IRA. She shouldn’t owe any federal taxes on it because of the standard deduction, but she will owe the self-employment taxes on it.   
Can we pay her just the $5,500, or do we need to pay her that + 15.3% SE taxes so that she ends up with $5.5K to put in the IRA? (I think it comes out to around $6.5K)

personalfinance,"Graduated medical school with 170k in high-interest loans, looking for budgeting and loan advice (warning: long post).","Hello,

Longtime PF reader on a throwaway account. First things first: THANK YOU for all of the wonderful advice this community provides. I've learned a lot over the past 2 years, and I now come looking for some more personal advice:

**Background**: 

- Late 20s male, graduated medical school last week
- Total debt: ~$173,000 student loans (undergrad + medschool + masters); no consumer debt, no property
- $10k savings (plan to use most of it for cross-country moving costs + deposit/1st month’s rent, etc)
- $5,000 emergency fund


**Income/Expenses:**

- Starting residency 7/2017 earning $55,000

- Residency is 4 years, after which I will have an income potential of 250-350k
- Need to live relatively close to hospital in city with VERY HIGH COL (think NYC/SF/LA)


[Click for Loan Details:](http://imgur.com/a/GygaO)

**Budget/Estimated Living expenses:**

- **Rent**: Currently looking for place to live with SO, would each like to budget $1000-1200/mo for rent: $1,200
- **Utilities/Internet:** Is $100/mo reasonable?
- **Food**: $300
- **Phone**: $55
- **Health insurance**: work benefit
- **Disability insurance**: $35
- **Savings**: $100
- **Transportation**: See question 2
- **Total Anticipated Monthly Expenses**: 1790 + transportation cost

**Questions:**

1) Student loans

- I want to refinance my parent's PLUS loans with SOFI (or DRB, etc), add myself as a cosigner then pay AS MUCH AS I CAN AFFORD. My only concern is losing federal protections on these loans, which total ~80k, although I do not anticipate losing my job do to the nature of my profession/training.
- I want to enter REPAYE for my own student loans, which will allow me to make very small minimum payments that will still count toward loan forgiveness 

2) Transportation: Debating a bike+public transport vs car

- If I need a car, how much can I afford (including insurance/gas)? Credit score 750.

3) Retirement

- How much can I afford vs larger loan payments?

4) HSA account

- I've learned from PF that this is a great way to reduce tax burden. Am I eligible if my employer provides insurance?

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt?,"Hi everyone,

I currently have about  $1800 of debt. One credit card is maxed out at $500 and another $1000, both with a 19.99% interest rate. I also owe just over $200 in overdraft fees from a chequing account I left overdrawn for a year. 

I'm working full-time at $14.5/hour until September when I go back to school. I have very few financial responsibilities (I live with my mother and don't pay rent or living expenses). I pay my phone bill ($96/month and gas about $60/every two weeks).

It is worth consolidating my debt through a personal loan or line of credit with a lower interest rate or paying off my credit cards individually? I don't know very much about finicanes and have no idea what is the best path to take.",finance
devops,Anyone using the Amazon Code* Toolchain?,"We are evaluating it for some of our SaaS projects, most (though not all) of which would probably be hosted in Amazon or using kubernetes.

We are currently using GitHub + Jenkins in most places, though are looking to move towards Gitlab for it's integrated CI, better ops story (we have many sites to support, Geo and the DR story there is cool).  It also has excellent integration with kubernetes, and a pretty easy transition from out current toolchain (not to sound like a gitlab fanboy, but thus far I haven't really found a huge complaint.... Gitlab is pretty good).

Our story with deploying to AWS from Gitlab is that we'd be using the command line and/or CodeDeploy.  Not seamless, but didn't look terrible.  We've proofed several examples using the 'dply' stuff from Travis (which supports Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, and others with a DSL).  

Looking at the AWS code* suite ... I guess I'm not seeing the draw?  It honestly looks like a hodge-podge of tools loosely hung together. for the most part  Most of the examples of a complete pipeline I see are using a fair bit of custom Lamba code to glue things together (which seems like a legit step back from more popular approaches).  Lots of examples are showing using code pipeline to just wrap Jenkins (which seems like a shoehorning an AWS product into a pipeline).  CodeCommit frankly looks bare bones and little more than a hosted Git repo.  CodeStar looks like it could have promise, but I haven't yet saw enough examples of it to fully understand it's place.

personalfinance,Good news on managing mom's finances!,"My 82yo mother ruined her finances (AND bought a timeshare!), and ended up owing $32K on credit cards and ~$12K on the timeshare loan.  In a years' time, at the start of 2017, due to interest, it went $37K.  She WANTS the timeshare.  I stepped in, but had to work with what I had, you know?

Income is SS, a rental house, and her annuity--way better than most people.  I just had a meeting with her and her financial advisor to better use her annuity, providing more $/month to be used on debt, rather than a smaller monthly amounts and a big distribution.  She remains just barely over her minimum required distribution and should be okay another 12-15 years.

But interest on her debt was killing.  My brother and I loaned $12K, directly paid on the highest interest card--we are last to be paid back, and I am aware not many people can do this.  But she went from 24% interest on that amount to 0% with us.

She got a one-time distribution (to get the minimum required for 2016), and I applied that to that same card.  She WAS paying over $300/month INTEREST on that card, and another $250/month on the rest.  So we cut that in half right there.

I got her to cut her spending, then worked with what I had.  She's paid off four cards now.  On MY schedule, she should have all the back debt on her cards, plus the timeshare loan, plus me and my brother--all paid off by the end of next year.  Yes, that is dumping A LOT of money on debt, but that's the way to do it to actually pay it off.

I live 250 miles from mom, but I keep an eye on her stuff.  Having a light case of ocd ""helps.""

Tips:  

- I created a spreadsheet with all of her creditors (utilities/insurance/credit cards/everything), contact info, logon info, account numbers, closing date, due date, interest rate, and amount owed (or approx monthly cost).  

- I called the higher-interest cards and got the interest rates reduced.  The ~25% card is now ~16%.  

- I balanced paying down the highest-interest card and the low-balance cards, to make progress at both ends.  

- I opened online accounts on every creditor and monitor them practically every other day.  She lost a card last week and I got the text alert about an uber charge--fraud.  I handled it immediately, getting the creditor and mom on the phone, got the card and those charges cancelled.  

- I restricted her to ONE credit card and told her to charge most purchases (so I can see them), but she is to have a couple hundred in cash available per month so that she has *some* control over her finances.  It's not a set amount nor an ""allowance.""  

- I just had her pay off this one credit card that's in use, taking a bit of a hit to her checking account (which is still high enough to handle an emergency up to $5000)--basically so that she can now SEE what her spending is.  And she is to pay that card in full every month as we pay down the remaining debt.


I know that she is in much better shape financially than most people IF she is responsible with her money.  She wasn't.  She is now.  By the time we're done, she'll be somewhat ""re-trained"" about spending.

For the first time in a year, I can relax about her finances and ""outliving her money.""",finance
personalfinance,Student loan had HUGE negative impact on my credit score.,"Hoping someone can explain what's happening or had a similar experience.

Throughout my studies, I took out around $85k in student loans, one private loan and some federal. My credit score was approaching 800 (around 780) during the end of my senior year of college. After I graduated and the grace period ended on my loans my credit score dropped below 700. I've made every single payment on every loan on time my entire life. When I checked my report it is showing that my line of credit is closed and my credit usage is over 200%. I only have three credit cards, and I am nowhere near even 10% of my credit usage.

I'm thinking that my loans are not being reported properly and that is what's impacting my score so much. So I called my loan provider and explained my situation, they said that everything was as it should be. I also contacted one of the credit bureaus, but they weren't much help.

My girlfriend and I share bank accounts/expenses.

What we've done:

* Reached out to private apartment and home rental listings on sites like craigslist and trulia. This has been hit or miss; there are a lot of scams and some people are just slow to return calls. Also, we have to drive a fairly significant distance just to check out places.

* We've test drove a few vehicles, and we have decided we would like to get a crossover like a Rav4, Equinox, or Outback. We've never bought a car from a dealership before, always private sellers. She would really like a 2014 or newer, because we've had three older cars. Is leasing a smart option?

We are young, and have never borrowed money other than federal student loans. We've never bought a car from a dealer. What options should we be exploring as far as car financing goes? Will we even be eligible for viable financing? Should we accept a longer loan term for lower monthly payments? Should we think about hiring a real estate agent to help find us a place to live? We've pegged our MAX rental price around $1700, which might make things uncomfortable at first; is this too high?

technology,Senator Todd Young on Net Neutrality,"Dear Mr. IamaRobot9,  
  
Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality. I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.  
  
  Since its inception, the internet has flourished with minimal government intervention and revolutionized our ability to share information and carry out commerce here at home and around the world. Today, Americans typically connect to the internet through a residential broadband service or through a wireless broadband service. Companies that provide these broadband services spend billions a year advancing and maintaining the infrastructure that has allowed the internet to thrive. As a result, internet speeds are thousands times faster than they were just a couple decades ago, and available to nearly 96% of the population.
  
  This has all occurred under light-touch regulation from the federal government, and not under the heavy-handed rules of common carrier regulation, which has unfortunately become synonymous with the notion of ‘net neutrality’ today. While there is no single accepted definition of ‘net neutrality,’ most agree it is the notion that these broadband companies should not be allowed to favor or block any legal content on their network, or discriminate against any legal content providers.
  
  On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted along party lines in favor of reclassifying the internet as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act – effectively putting 1930s era regulations in charge of the modern day internet economy. While some have applauded this move as ensuring net neutrality concepts are protected, many others have expressed concerns that the FCC simply applied an already outdated regulatory framework to the most dynamic industry in human history.
  
  On April 26, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced a proposal to return the classification of broadband service from a Title II telecommunications service to a Title I information service. On May 18, 2017, the FCC will vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which if adopted will begin a period of public comment on the FCC’s proposal.
  
  I believe we must keep the internet ecosystem open and vibrant. I also believe that major decisions on how to regulate the internet ought to come from Congress, not unelected bureaucrats dreaming up how depression-era laws can regulate the internet. I believe it is imperative for Congress to work toward bipartisan, light-touch regulations that ensure the internet remains accessible and unrestricted by government intrusion for future generations.
  
  Again, thank you for contacting me. It is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.
  
  Sincerely,
Todd Young

ethereum,Can we get ERC20 BTC with Rootstock?,"With recent news that Rootstock (RSK), an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain, will be launching on the Bitcoin testnet and later the mainnet soon, I was thinking it would be possible to implement a 2-way peg to allow BTC to be represented as an ERC20 token on Ethereum. 

Until now it has not been possible to make an ERC20 BTC token because there isn't a good way to lock up the BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is why we haven't seen one despite BTC Relay being out for some time. Rootstock has essentially the same problem but supposedly they have a decent, albeit not perfect, solution. Ethereum could utilize Rootstock's federated peg to allow a BTC onramp to the Ethereum blockchain. 

From a BTC user perspective, it would be a three-step process. First, they use Bitcoin/Rootstock clients to move the BTC to the RSK sidechain. Next, they use a Rootstock client to send the BTC to a 2-way peg contract. They will have to specify their Ethereum address so the token contract credits the right address on the Eth blockchain. Lastly, on an Eth client they submit the merkle proof to the token contract which proves the BTC is locked up in the RSK blockchain, crediting their Eth address with ERC20 BTC tokens. It is essentially the same process in reverse to go back to raw BTC.

This would immediately allow BTC to be traded on the existing decentralized exchanges, participate in smart contract ICO's, be used as diverse collateral, played in Eth casinos, and everything else an ERC20 token can now do.

I assume many less technical people will not want to go through the effort of converting BTC to ERC20 BTC or the reverse, so there will likely be centralized services trading BTC for ERC20 BTC for a small fee. I also expect ERC20 BTC to be worth slightly less than raw BTC due to the extra risk associated with holding BTC in the contract on the Rootstock sidechain. But all the extra use cases of an ERC20 token could make up for that small difference.

I think it would be great if the Ethereum community can come up with a solution to make this possible. It doesn't seem to hard IMO, but let's get a discussion going. Do you disagree on any of my points? Do you have any additional technical info? Can you throw some solidity on Github and get this thing started? How can the process I described be improved for security or usability?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Paid off $75K in student loan debt 5 years out of college.,"Hi there /r/PersonalFinance!

I know we occasionally have weekly threads for good news like this, but one of my smaller goals over the past few years has been to self-post on here when I was all paid up, so I thought if I provided some details, a narrative, and advice related to my situation, I could perhaps make it worthwhile to anyone who might find my situation similar to their own.

Now I wish I could tell you I followed a strict payback schedule the *entire* 5 years of my journey, but the reality is that life happens and you can't *always* pay the same amount every month as planned. As long as you **trend** in the direction you set out, however, I personally think that's all that matters. So, let me break down some highlights over the past 5 years and explain how they affected the loan payback situation. Then at the end I *may* rant for a bit. Fair warning.

All of this took place in Minneapolis, MN, just to give you an idea of my average cost of living.

**Late 2011.**
I graduated at the end of 2011 *without* a full time job and about $75k in student loans. I had a promising internship that was paying me a small stipend of $1400/month. I was hoping to get hired full-time by them within 6 months.

**April 2012.**
Internship offered to hire me on full time salaried for $25k. I tried not to laugh. Luckily I had been interviewing around while they dragged their feet. Turns out a lot of people there made no more than $28k, which broke my heart.

**May 2012.**
Accepted a full-time job offer at another company for $45k. Began paying back my loans with just minimum payments for the first few months as I created my budget and figured out what I could afford to put towards them. I also spent a few thousand on furniture plus a few other improvements for my soon to be bachelor pad (1 bedroom) after parting ways with a roommate and our 2 bedroom.

**July 2012.**
Moved into my own place. My rent went from $820 ÷ 2 = $410/month to $650/month. Worth it to have my own place. If the 1 bedroom price still seems low to you, it’s because I lived in an apartment coop, which among other things means that rent is/was pretty below market. I decided that even if I _could_ afford a better apartment later on, this one would serve my loan payback situation better, so I was staying put indefinitely. 

**August 2012.**
Finalized my payback plan and optimistic goals. I netted about $2800 per month from my $45k/year job, and my month-to-month living expenses only added up to about $975. This meant I had $1825 to put towards 401k, savings, and student loans. I did the minimum for 401k to get employer match and threw a piddly $50/month in savings leaving me with $1650/month to pay towards my loans (and my minimum payment was only about $500). If you do the math, that’s around 60% of my take home pay that I was putting towards my loans every month. Until…

**February 2013.**
...I met a guy on a dating site that eventually would become my first ever boyfriend. I quickly discovered that dating and actually having a social life (something I never really had throughout college) is **_expensive_**. He made significantly more than me (about $30k more to be exact), but I didn’t want nor expect him to pay all the time when we’d go out, so I helped too. This put a hindrance on my loan payback throughout 2013 and 2014, as my loan budget of $1650 was the largest and easiest pool of money to dip from when dating-related monthly expenses (eating out, movies, etc.) got higher than planned. I can’t give you concrete numbers as it varied from month to month, but based on my _original_ projected payoff date and my _actual_ payoff date, I’d say the expensive early days of our relationship set the loan payoff back _maybe_ a year. But spoiler, he turned out to be the love of my life and we got married in 2016 so it was definitely worth it.

**August 2014.**
Two years into my $45k/year job, I'd gotten fed up with being overworked and under-appreciated. So I left that job (doing what I went to school for) for a higher paying job doing a skill I’m self taught at. That's right, I was now making more for something I didn't even go to school for, making my $75k degree seem useless. (This is important later when I do my takeaway rant.) I was now being paid $60k/year. Oh, the boyfriend also moved in with me at this point since his lease was up, so my living expenses went _down_ as my salary went _up_. Nice, huh? He had tried convincing me to move in with him and renewing his lease where he paid $1600/month for one of those new apartment buildings downtown but I just _couldn’t_ justify it, even when he offered to pay more than half. He’s a smart man and quickly realized how much money we could both save if he moved in with me and our per-person rent costs were only $650 ÷ 2 = $325, so he was pretty easily convinced. We did get a parking spot at my apartment for his car which was another $60/month, but at $710/month total, still trivially low by comparison.

**December 2014.**
I paid off my first loan! It was a private loan, originally taken out in 2008 for $14k with a 10.25% interest rate. Woof. I know. Oh, and it was unsubsidized, so it accrued **$4000** in interest while I was in school. Good _fucking_ riddance. Luckily this was the only loan anywhere close to that bad. I'm a little embarrassed to admit the origin of the loan, but this post is about transparency to my situation, so I will. It was taken out for **living expenses** for the 2008/2009 school year. I didn’t have anyone in my life smart enough to tell me that was a horrible idea. I figured it would make school easier, not having to work and allow me to focus on my studies 100%. Stupid, stupid reasoning. I ended up getting a part time job the rest of the time I was in school as a student worker and did freelance on the side, and my grades were just fine.

**August 2015.**
Boyfriend and I got engaged. He asked, I said yes! Wedding planning didn’t start for a few months more, but after talking about what the wedding would be, we realized that we both wanted a somewhat big wedding. However, neither of us comes from families in any situation to help pay for a wedding, so we decided that provided we could pay for it all before the wedding – i.e. we didn’t want to owe on it *after* getting married – then we would have our somewhat not-so-modest wedding. Money would eventually be redirected from large student loan payments to help pay for the wedding. Not the best financial decision, but it was important to both of us so we made it happen.

**January 2016.**
After a year and a half of living together handling our finances separately, we realized that if we were going to be getting married, we didn’t want to handle them separately any longer. We were one team afterall, and it would make paying for things like the wedding a lot less of a headache. Combining our incomes, we now jointly earned $150k/year. Student loan payment dropped to $900/month to set aside money for the wedding. Forgot to mention, he didn’t have any student loans himself, but he did have about $12k remaining on a $35k car loan. We would be tackling that together too. Oh, and our rent went up $30/month. Still amazingly affordable at $740/month.

**June 2016.**
Fiancé got a new job for $105k/year. We now jointly earned $165k/year.

**October 2016.**
We got married, and everything was perfect. We pinched pennies where we could and primarily spent money on things that were important to us – i.e. we spent nearly $3000 on a damn good videographer because we wanted to be able to relive that day for ever. But when it came to booze, we just bought some cases of Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe's and got a keg of a good beer and a keg of good cider from a local liquor store on the cheap. No open bar and our guests were just as happy. All in all, the wedding probably cost us $25k, BUT a good majority of that was on things for us, like photographer, videographer, etc.

**December 2016.**
I got a new job. New job paid $75k/year, and I'm still not doing what I went to school for. We now jointly earned $180k/year. With the wedding paid off and the holidays over, it was now time to boost loan payments into turbo.

**January 2017.**
I did say turbo, right? This month we made a student loan payment of $3800. God damn that was satisfying.

**February 2017.**
The next few months will be similar. This month it was $3500. I can see the finish line. Around this point there’s only $12k of the total left.

**May 2017.**
Final payment for $4010.38 submitted over the phone (to verify it was actually paid off and that no $0.02 in interest would bear it's ugly head the following month.)

**I'M FREE!**

**Okay. Let's give you some graphs.**

* [Here is a screenshot of my ""Net Worth Over Time"" graph from Mint.](http://imgur.com/reO3nKq) The point when everything first drops to the red is when I first added the bulk of my student loans to my Mint account. The previous 4-5 years I had been naïvely watching my ""net worth"" in Mint grow, quietly ignoring the fact that I hadn't added my student loans to the picture yet. After graduating and getting ready to be serious about paying these off, I couldn't fool myself any longer. The second big dip in the red is a few months later when I realized I had forgotten to add that private loan (mentioned earlier) that I had taken out the first year to live off of. If it wasn't clear, taking that loan out was probably the second stupidest decision I made in my higher education journey; the first being going to an insanely expensive for-profit college.
* [Here is a screenshot of my payoff history of the primary chunk of loans.](http://imgur.com/1xAhwya) You can cross reference dates above to see what happened where if you want.



**Takeaways and Words of ""Wisdom""**

* By far biggest thing that allowed me to payoff my loans at the rate I did was cheap rent and all-around low cost of living. I know finding super affordable (and decent) rental units simply isn't possible in some areas like Denver or San Francisco. That said, if you live in a place like that and you want to get rid of your loan debt FAST, you may have to consider moving somewhere cheaper while you tackle your loans. My brother, for example, who lived in LA after graduating, spent almost a year working remote in South Dakota in order to live dirt cheap while making an LA income. I know this isn't possible for everyone, but if you can make it happen, it will do wonders for your repayment schedule.
* Having paid back this giant debt that 2008 me decided to take out has kind of made me 1) skeptical; and 2) bitter regarding higher education as a whole. At this point, I honestly don't think a college degree is necessary for a good chunk of jobs out there. Unless you want to go into medicine or law, I honestly think you can learn what you need to learn online for free (or, at the very least far cheaper than college) via online courses or in trade school settings. This is especially true in the creative industry that I'm in. I wouldn't recommend ANYONE who wants to get into any sort of creative field (graphic design, web design, animation, photography, etc.) go to college for those things, even if the college tries selling you with compelling placement rates, likely post-grad incomes, etc. Seriously. You can get a Digital Tutors account for $50/month and learn way more than you will at those $20k per year colleges. Not to mention that design/advertising agencies don't give a crap where you went to school. All they care about is your portfolio – what you've done, who you've done it for, and what you can do for them.
* On the same note, I will _not_ be one of those overbearing parents that insists to my future kids that they have to go to college if they want to be successful in life. These days, there are so many other ways to learn and build a profitable skill that I wouldn't dream of pushing college as the sole means to their future.

I didn't post this here to humble brag, and do know that I consider myself one of the lucky ones – actually being able to pay off my student loans 5 years out of college. And I know the student loan landscape is grim for a lot of people out there, as they realize they may never be able to afford a house as they deal with this overwhelming burden hanging over their heads. The best advice I can offer is to sit down, formulate a plan based on your current and projected income and see if it's possible. And if it is, do it! Duh! If it's not, play with the numbers. How much sooner could you pay them off if your rent was $100 cheaper per month? $200? Can you possibly move to a lower cost of living area? 

Also. Careers. Don't fall into the trap of a ""dream job."" My dream job, or so I thought, was at that company that offered me $25k. At one point I was honestly running the numbers to see if I could make $30k work if I was even able to get them up that high. Screw that noise. I can't imagine how screwed I would be today if I had taken that job. On the same note of ""dream job"" traps, don't feel locked into the industry you went to school for. Part of the reason I left the field I went to school for was because it paid shit. It's a highly technical creative field and people here _should_ be averaging at least $75-80k per year doing it – but they're not! Talking to friends in the field, it seems like the high is around $55-60k or so. It's ridiculous to me that they stay doing it. Yes, yes, passions and dreams jobs – but I say if you're that passionate about that kind of work, you'll find time to do it even if it's not at work. I'm not suggesting everyone get a shitty office 9-5 job that they're miserable at, but my point is that you should explore other fields that you may be good at if they pay more.

Okay, I think that about wraps it up. I didn't intend to write a full-length novel, and I'm kind of ranting here towards the end, but hopefully some people find the post as a whole somewhat useful or can at least relate to certain parts of it. Thank you for reading and hearing me out, and thank you all who've shared your stories with me over the years. It's been exciting putting myself in your shoes and finally building up to my own payoff story.

I'd be glad to answer any questions people might have as well, so let's hear them!

TL;DR: Paid off $75k in student loans in 5 years; degree was pointless; overall became bitter about higher education in the process.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt. Which option should I choose?,"Hello Everyone, I have been looking to plan my future student loan pay out and I need some help and guidance. I posted something like this before and everyone told me i just need to pay my loans off ASAP. It doesnt seem that most people really understand the situation. But I am looking for some help and reason as to which option would be best for me.
&amp;nbsp;

Financial Situation: Wife and I currently rent and our gross income is ~$111,000. She has student loan debt that will be paid off in 2 years. Currently have a Car Loan and Student Loan
&amp;nbsp;

Current Student Loan Situation: $121,686.35 Interest Average 6.5% Current Car Loan: $17,000 Interest 1.83%
Repayment options 

&amp;nbsp;1) Standard 10 year repayment - consolidate public loans to private and decrease interest rate to decrease monthly payment - current 10-year payment is $1450. Unable to afford to pay this amount each month - Estimated Monthly Payment $1400/month - Loan Life 10 years

&amp;nbsp;
2) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Jointly) - REPAYE option: 10% of discretionary income a month for up to 20 years then loan is forgiven - Monthly Payment $631. Calculation based on studentloan.gov website should loan would be paid off in 18 years with no loan forgiven. This website assumes your income increases %5 every year but Mine is projected to be 3% if i remain staff not dont move up to management position (im a physical therapist)

&amp;nbsp;
3) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Separately) - PAYE: 10% of loan holders discretionary income - This option will let me pay a decreased monthly payment since my wife and i will file separately. - Add additional monthly deposit to make up for the Tax on the loan forgiven after 20 years. - I recieve decreased amount from taxes - monthly payment : $300 + $200( for tax forgiveness) /month - Not sure how to invest my $200 a month

&amp;nbsp;
Anyone have any idea on what the best option for me is?
I know that the 1st option saves me the most money but I have to pay $1000 on top of my monthly payment! I am not saving enough money to afford putting that much in. We're also looking to get a house and need to save money for a down payment and closing costs.
When providing feedback please back up your thoughts! I already know how much more I will pay over time with option 2 and 3
EXTRA INFO Tax on Loan Forgiveness: Yes I know there is tax on the loan that is forgiven and I factored it into my calculation to help pay off the taxes.

Our monthly Budget : 
Total Expense: 4139.39( Loans, Rent, Cable,Car Payment, Gyms, Extra, Food, roth ira, car gas, church donation) 
&amp;nbsp;

My loan payment is 615 and my wifes is 500. this is factored into the total expense(which she will be done with in 2 years)
&amp;nbsp;

Total Income:6311
&amp;nbsp;

Total Discretionary: 2171.61

personalfinance,should I refinance my second house so I can pay off my first house faster?,"My parents refinanced their house about 4 years ago.  Their interest rate is 2.99% and the current payoff is 95154.75 (maturity date is 2028).  I refinanced my house last year and my interest rate is 3.625% and the payoff is about 90,000 (maturity date is 2031).  Both are 15 year mortgages.  Payment on both houses is about $900/month each.  I am wondering if it would be a good idea to refinance my house to a 30 year mortgage and lower my payments (I know my interest rate would likely go up).  Then I take the extra money I have and apply it to my parents house.  I think I could then pay off their house in 6 or 7 years (rather than 10) and then apply double payments to my house also getting it paid off far before the maturity date.  This would also give me a little financial wiggle room if something was to happen.  Am I crazy?  Can this work?  Or is it just a bad idea and I should stick with what I have.",finance
personalfinance,Leaving a job with vested pension balance - Rollover to IRA or leave with company for guaranteed interest accrual?,"I'm going to be leaving a job where I hold a vested pension balance. I have the option to leave it with the company until I retire with a guaranteed interest rate of 4% or rollover into an IRA. I know enough to get by on IRA investing, but hard to say whether I'd beat a guaranteed 4% rate.

I'm not sure which is the right move.

I could also take a lump sum payout, but I don't want to pay the 10% tax penalty for early withdrawal as well as lose out on the additional potential retirement savings.",finance
personalfinance,[Housing] Renting Out vs. Selling,"I was wondering if someone could give me a financial breakdown of whether it is a good or bad decision to rent my house instead of sell.

Firstly, I bought the house 2 years ago. Had a long time GF living with me, but things didn't workout. Now I'm stuck in the suburbs with a house to myself, 20 years younger than anyone in the neighborhood, and kind of desperate to make a change. I wanted to move closer to the inner city where a majority of the mid 20s age people live, but unsure about selling my house or renting. Obviously either one results in me moving and renting an apartment, or maybe a house with a friend. 

Financial info:
Purchase Price: &lt;span-tp timeprices-text=""198000"" timeprices-isnew=""true""&gt;$198k&lt;/span-tp&gt;
Current Mortgage: &lt;span-tp timeprices-text=""140500"" timeprices-isnew=""true""&gt;$140.5k&lt;/span-tp&gt; (3% interest rate)
Water/County/School Tax: &lt;span-tp timeprices-text=""5200"" timeprices-isnew=""true""&gt;$5.2k&lt;/span-tp&gt; Annually

Monthly mortgage payments are &lt;span-tp timeprices-text=""1800"" timeprices-isnew=""true""&gt;$1.8k&lt;/span-tp&gt; (15 year loan)
Realistically I could rent for &lt;span-tp timeprices-text=""1650"" timeprices-isnew=""true""&gt;$1,650
&lt;/span-tp&gt;
The home's value has steadily risen in the past, and I think is projected to continue appreciating but at a slow pace. There is a lot of new developments in the area. It is a convenient location as well, and houses in the neighborhood typically sell reasonably often. 

I don't have any issues with being a landlord, the house is in pretty good shape, and I can afford the mortgage without problem. I'm mostly just wondering if it makes any financial sense to keep the place even though rent would be less than the monthly mortgage. With the high taxes, it seems like I'd only clear a few hundred dollars on the equity basically. Is that right?

Edit: option C is stay in the house, and possible just rent a room out for $650 a month. I'm sure that's the smartest financial move, but at the expense of my own happiness basically.",finance
personalfinance,Am I doing the right thing by buying? Here are my numbers.,"Married, 2 kids.

Me: $68k, pre-tax
Wife: $32k, pre-tax (part time, stays with the youngest who will be in school in 2 years and she will go back to full time).
So, just about $100k (a little over if I'm having a good few months).

Debt: $265 car lease. That's it.
EF: $15k
A little late on starting our retirement savings, but we now do $5,500 each for our Roth IRAs, yearly. Neither of us have a 401(k). My trade doesn't typically offer one, unfortunately.

We live in NJ. No, we can't move out of NJ. I understand that it's expensive, but my job wouldn't make me as much anywhere near as much as I make here. I need to be by the City. It is what it is.

I am willing to rent or buy. I'd probably even prefer renting for another few years, but the fact of the matter is that the market is smoking hot and the inventory is next to nothing. And even when there is, a 3 bedroom apartment (necessary) is in the ballpark of $2400-$2700 a month. It's absurd.

A mortgage for what we need (and that's not a lot, because we're not interested in buying a huge/modern house) is about $325-$350k. We were pre-approved for $400k. We won't be spending that. No thank you.

Taxes in NJ are insane. Between $7,500 and $8,500 a year for what I'm looking at. All in all, with house insurance, taxes, mortgage, included, I'd be at about $2000-$2100 a month, or almost exactly 25% of our pre-tax income.

We have enough for a 20% down payment (a gift from one of our parents) and closing fees.

It feels right and it feels like it SHOULD be comfortable, but I'm apprehensive and scared. I want to take advantage of the interest rates right now, but the market is hot and stuff is flying off the shelf.

We wouldn't be moving for the foreseeable future. Unless something incredible jumped up at us, we would be in this place for the long haul.

Thanks for an advice.",finance

personalfinance,Employer is paying lump sum to correct for the last two years at high interest.,"I was hired on to my current job towards the end of 2015, and when the HR department made my payroll entry, they entered the incorrect salary amount discussed with my hiring manager. The company agrees, and they're getting that all fixed now by paying me a lump sum payment for the discrepancy relevant to 2015-2016, and then adding the 2017 discrepancies to my upcoming paycheck.

However, for the lump sum payment, my employer is taking out nearly 40% of the payment in taxes, largely in part due to the 25% flat rate on lump sum ""bonus"" payments taken out federally. My salary for all three relevant years would have put me in a 25% marginal tax rate bracket, if that's important for my question.

My question is, do I have a leg to stand on to get my payroll department to either (a) pay me enough such that if the IRS is going to take out the 25% lump sum, I would still get the same final amount as I would have normally, or (b) communicate to the IRS that this lump sum is a corrective payment so that it wouldn't be liable for the 25% rate?",finance

technology,There have been lots of reports that someone is using real people’s names and addresses to submit fake comments to the FCC against net neutrality without those people’s permission. But we need proof. Here’s how we get it:,"Numerous redditors have [noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6a6qvi/someone_is_astroturfing_the_fcc_with_antinet/) , and media [reports](http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/) are raising [suspicions](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities), that a person or organization is stealing people’s personal information and submitting large numbers of fake comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opposing net neutrality, the principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from discriminating between content on the web.

A media outlet in Denver [discovered](http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/) that more than 7,000 such comments used names and addresses of people in Colorado, many of whom said they had never submitted such a comment.

Journalists have been calling many of the people who supposedly submitted these comments, and many of them say that they did not. But in order to really prove this beyond all doubt, we need to contact a significant number of these people and ask them the right questions to make sure that they didn’t just forget that they had signed something, or get duped into signing a misleading petition against net neutrality that presented itself as something else.

This is a task that redditors can easily work on together. The likely fake comments all use the same template, which makes it easy to search the FCC’s filings for them. We could divide up by state or alphabetically and start contacting people on twitter, through emails if we can find them, Facebook messenger, or by calling people who are in the phone book. [This site](http://www.truepeoplesearch.com) makes it pretty easy to find contact information based on someone’s name and address. 

* These are the key questions that we could ask people to determine beyond any doubt that they did not knowingly submit a comment to the FCC:

* Did you file a comment with the FCC opposing net neutrality? You may have filed it through an online petition page rather than on the FCC’s website.

* Here’s the text of the comment: “The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation. I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20 years. The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obama's Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet for everyone.”

* You might have received a misleading email soliciting a signature, probably with language such as “repeal Obama’s power grab.” Is there a chance you ever signed an email like this, either recently or years ago?

* Do you agree with the comment that was filed in your name? (If not, why not?)

* Are you on any email lists or do you subscribe to any newsletters from groups that could possibly have been collecting comments against net neutrality?

* If a comment was filed in your name without your consent, do you think legal actions should be taken against the person or group who did so? Do you have anything to say to your local lawmakers or would you like them to investigate this?

Given the [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of the telecom industry funding “astroturf” organizations to create the appearance of opposition to consumer protections like net neutrality we should also be contacting the press offices of major ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile to ask if they have a comment on this issue, and ask them if they are funding any organizations that could be submitting these comments. And we should be asking members of Congress if they plan to investigate the fact that many people in their district may have had their identities stolen to submit fake comments to the FCC.

If you’re willing to help with this, please comment here or contact me at evan@fightforthefuture.org -- we also have a slack channel running . If you speak to someone who firmly believes that their name and address was used to submit a comment without their permission, please refer them to me so that we can help them take appropriate action. 

Groups opposing net neutrality seem intent on making the FCC’s comment process period appear chaotic and unreliable. If they are submitting completely fake comments, the public deserves to know that, so it’s important that we verify these media reports, the way only reddit can :-)",technology

**We currently are not making any payments on these loans - she will not have to start paying for another 7 months**

Her father left her just under $70,000 in inheritance and we are just trying to formulate the best way to tackle this debt. While we realize we might be able to do better investing the money in the market we have chosen to eliminate this debt as fast as possible.

We have no other outstanding debt (two car loans under 10K, no credit card debt, 20k+ in savings for emergencies, contributing to TSP, and we both max our Roth IRA's every year.).

Is it as simple of a decision to simply pay down the highest interest loans (I could eliminate loan 7, 6, and half of loan 5 with that money). We have the monthly income to support paying $4,000 a month towards these loans.

With table math, putting nearly $70k towards this loan and $4,000 a month we could eliminate this debt in under 2 years.

personalfinance,How to choose a bank after college graduation,"Hey Personal Finance,

I am looking for some help on choosing a bank. I just graduated from college this past weekend and am close to getting a job. I am looking to switch banks because the one I currently have is not the best IMO and I don't want to stay with them long term. I would appreciate any help that people can provide. 

With my current bank, I have a checking, savings, and a credit card. I know the basics of these account types but by no means do I know everything. I am also in the chicago-land area and looking to stay in that area if that helps.

I am looking to set up a checking and savings account, and credit card with the new bank. I am looking for a lot of atm locations so I don't have to keep paying fees for using another bank's atm (this was always happening in college), low fees for online aspects or any other things usually have fees,  and an online banking available including a good android app. 

Im not super knowledgeable on savings account. I think they have some better interest rates but that's it. I have about $9,000 in my current savings account and would want to bring that to the new bank. What are some aspects of a good savings account? 

For my credit card, I only used it for building credit so I don't have a shit ton of debt or anything. Should I just cancel the card and then open a new one at my new bank?

I also have about $15,000 of student loans to pay back and wanna do that pretty quickly. I'm gonna live pretty cheap, probably at home with my parents for 6ish months. 

I've also been looking at banks such as Chase because my friends have accounts there and seem to be happy. 

Any Help would be appreciated.

personalfinance,A new grad in making with $118K salary in silicon valley from June. Is the budget okay and how to invest and where?,"I am 25, single, Indian and starting as SDE I in one of the Big four on OPT from June.

For 401K: My company matches up to 4% of your eligible pay at the rate of 50%, for a maximum company match of 2% of your total eligible pay and it vests only after 3 years. So I am thinking not to max out 401K (at least till I get H1B) as doesn't make sense to invest if I leave or if I don't get H1B visa and I have to return to India.

After taxes, I get approx $6650/month. I have an education loan in India - approx $35K with 11% interest rate. But I will be getting sign on bonus and I pay the some of the loan with bonus (after tax amount) so lets say the loan amount is close to $20K

Here's my budget per month:  
1. 4% of my gross income monthly for 401K directly from payroll deduction - $393.34  
2. 5500/annually for IRA savings - $458.34  
3. Car Savings (I would like to buy after a 1-1.5 year) - $600  
4. Emergency fund savings as I already have $5000 emergency savings - $650  
5. Food - $500  
6. Rent (I stay with roommates) - $600  
7. Groceries - $100  
8. Miscellaneous - $100  
9. Transportation (mostly will take bus/light rail to work as employer gives travel card) - $50  
10. Utilities (wifi, pgne) - $50  
11. Loan (can be paid in 1-1.5 years approx) - $1550  

Total = $4650 approx
Savings = 6650 - 4650 = $2000 monthly

I have few questions:

1. What should I do with the remaining $2000? CDs? I bonds? Savings Account? Invest in stocks and bonds. I am a beginner in investing though? Pay off the debt sooner? Any other suggestions?  
2. I was thinking to create 3 different Ally/Discover savings account with 1.05% interest - one for IRA, one for car savings and one for emergency fund savings. Is it a good way?  
3. Any changes to the budget? Anywhere I can improve?  
4. If you know any specific plans to invest in India as well?  
5. Can I get a tax savings here if I am paying off my debt in India? I guess no but just want to confirm
6. Any other suggestions?  

I don't want to max out my 401K as of now because my status is this country is unknown.

All suggestions are welcomed. Thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Tax-Exempt Bond Funds?,"I'm pretty new to all of this, so I apologize if this seems self-explanatory, but I'm trying to work out the math myself and want to make sure it's right. I'm moving to California soon to start a new job making roughly $160k gross (including the estimated bonus and vesting stock value), or $142k after 401k deductions. According to [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#AtfYIwX42s), that puts me at a combined (state and federal) marginal tax rate of 37.3%.

Apparently, California has tax-exempt municipal bonds. Now, for my retirement portfolios, I'm looking into Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund ([VBTLX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0584)), their Intermediate bond fund ([VBILX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=5314)), or possibly their long-term bond ETF ([BLV](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0927&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) which have respective yields of 2.42%, 2.61%, and 3.80%, but for my taxable investments, tax exempt funds seem beneficial. For California bonds, Vanguard has Long-Term ([VCITX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0075&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) and Intermediate-term ([VCAIX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0100&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) funds, which have yields of 2.39% and 1.82%. Unfortunately, the Admiral shares have a much larger minimum ($50k) and these funds don't have an ETF variant, so the expense ratios are higher (but not ridiculous) at 0.19%.

Using this [calculator](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/tax-equivalent-yield-calculator-tool.aspx), a taxable fund will need to have a yield of 2.79% to beat the intermediate-term fund, or 3.66% for the long-term fund. These values don't take expense ratios into account, however.

From these numbers, it appears that the tax exempt funds are noticeably better than the others (besides BLV), though I'm not aware of the risk level comparison. So, a few questions:

* Are CA municipal bonds significantly higher risk than the broader funds? Is the difference enough to make them not worth buying?

* Is the risk difference between intermediate long-term bonds significant enough to make the intermediate CA bonds the more reasonable choice?

* Is this federal tax exempt, high-yield bond [VWAHX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0044) fund too risky make it worth using over the CA bonds?

* To calculate the equivalent rates using expense ratios, would I subtract the tax exempt fund's expense ratio from the yield, and then add the taxable fund's ratio to the equivalent yield?

* Would I be better off investing in bonds in some other way?",finance

financialindependence,Early Retirement - please critique my plan,"**Us:** Age 36, married for the past year. We do not have any (human) kids, nor do we plan on having any. Prior to meeting, we each owned our own houses. We live in hers, mine is for sale (spent the past year fixing it up after moving out). We would like to retire as soon as we can afford to.

**Our income/savings:** My pre-tax income is just under $100k and my wife’s is about $83k. We each have a combination of traditional and Roth retirement savings: I have about $47k saved pre-tax and another $59k in Roth. She has about $127 pre-tax and another $2k in Roth. After my house is sold I expect another $65k that we can put towards retirement. Grand totals: $174k pre-tax, $126k post-tax.

**Past spending/savings:** 2016 was an expensive year for us due to the wedding - I was still able to max out my 401k but I ended the year with about $10k in 0% credit card debt. In 2015 I maxed out both my 401k and IRA with similar income (salary was lower, but I got bonuses that year). I’m not sure what my wife was able to save that year, I think about 6-7% of her salary. Based on that, I think we can say we’re used to saving about $23.5k pre-tax and another $5.5k post tax.

**Future savings:** We’re trying to spend less money, but I’m not counting on that in planning for the future. I will however count on saving the money that I’m used to spending on my house, about $16k annually, bringing the total estimated future savings rate to $23.5k pre-tax plus another $21.5k post-tax. 

**Traditional vs Roth:** After deductions, we’re still comfortably in the 25% tax bracket with a taxable income around $127k. After retirement our spending will reduce from this number because we will no longer be making Roth IRA contributions and, after the house is paid off, we will no longer be making mortgage principal and interest payments. It seems reasonable to me to assume that our marginal tax bracket in retirement will be less than or equal to our current 25% bracket, making traditional either better than or equal to Roth in tax efficiency. 

**Saving strategy after house is sold:** My 401k contribution is currently at 6%, which is the minimum required to get the full match. I reduced it to this at the start of the year to pay back the credit card debt. After selling the house I’ll reset this to something much higher since I’ll have $65k in my bank account to live off of, until I’m on track to contribute at a sustainable rate again. We’ll also use some of the money to make our 2017 IRA contributions, and use the rest to open a taxable brokerage account. 

**Saving strategy for future years:** The plan is to max out both 401ks and two IRAs, keeping the 401k as traditional for the reasons stated above, and keeping the IRA as Roth because that’s the only option for our income. I considered switching to Roth to enjoy an effectively larger limit, but decided against it because there are ways to avoid or at least limit the capital gains taxes owed on the money in a taxable account (more on that later). The $21.5k post-tax savings that we have each year has a pre-tax equivalent of $28.6k making the total 52k pre-tax. Out of that $36k is saved as pre-tax and the remaining $16k is taxed at 25% to become $12k post-tax. $11k goes into the IRA and the remaining $1k into the taxable account. 

**Plan for early retirement:** The first priority is to save enough to fund the traditional retirement years of age 65 to death. Once we hit that milestone we’ll have the option of quitting our jobs and working part-time for just enough money that we need for day-to-day expenses (we would not be saving for retirement any more, so we could achieve the same lifestyle with less income), or working a few more years until we have enough to truly retire early. 

**How much we need to retire:** After taxes and the retirement savings contributions explained above, we spend about $95k/year which includes about $12k in mortgage principal and interest. With the house paid off, we could afford the same lifestyle with $83k in post-tax income. 25 times that is 2.075 million. We won’t spend this money until the age of 65, 29 years from now. Adjusted for 2% inflation, that 2.075 million is 3.68 million. Assuming 8% growth over the next 29 years, we’d need $427k saved today to be on track to achieve this goal at the age of 65. Assuming a future tax rate of 25%, we’ll have $321.5k saved after selling the house, so we’re about 75% of the way there!

**Early retirement:** Assuming that we keep working until we are ready to retire, rather than taking on part-time work after we have the traditional retirement years saved for, the first savings that we spend would be from the taxable account, to avoid taxes on future gains. Since we will have little to no taxable income those years while we spend that money, I believe that means we will not owe tax on the gain at all, since the long-term capital gains tax is 0% if you are in the 15% tax bracket or lower. Next, we can withdraw the contribution portion of any Roth investments that we made. If we need more money out before the age of 65, we’ll set up a Roth conversion ladder to withdraw from the 401ks without paying a penalty. 

**Housing:** In the estimates above I assumed that all of the money saved by combining houses will go to retirement, so my wife’s 30-year mortgage would stay the same. However, we will be considering another option of refinancing to a shorter-term mortgage. Initially I thought this should be a 10-year loan so that we pay it off on schedule around the same time that we stop working, but now I’m not so sure. I’m aware that many people prefer a 30-year loan with rates as low as they are now, diverting that money to retirement savings instead where it will probably grow more than the mortgage’s interest rate. However a counter-argument to that saying that comparable low/negligible-risk investments do not have a return higher than typical mortgage rates convinced me a few years ago to refinance to a 10-year mortgage while keeping my 401k 100% stock: basically let the house satisfy the “safe investment” portion of your portfolio, rather than doing the mix of stocks and bonds which is normally recommended. However, I crunched the numbers on it and the difference is significant. We’ll probably do a hybrid of the two extremes and go for a 20-year mortgages. 

**Allocations:** As mentioned above I am currently 100% stock. I plan on keeping it this way until I’m ready to retire in my 40s. If a recession hits right then, I’d have to keep working a few more years. I’m comfortable taking the risk of having that first-world problem. As soon as I stop working, I’ll start being more conservative by introducing some bonds but also keeping stock at some to-be-determined ratio. 

**Questions:** Typing this up was helpful to get all the thoughts that I’ve had on the subject in one place. I don’t have any specific questions, but would be very curious to hear what others think of this plan, if I have neglected to consider anything, etc. 

edit:
**Expenses**: Several people have pointed out that our expenses are high. I don't disagree, but to be clear that $83k/year includes *everything* except for the mortgage principal and interest. That's not spending money, it includes car expenses, public transportation, real estate taxes and insurance, house maintenance/repair, donations to charity, utility bills, pet care, etc. 


Nonetheless, is that that a lot of money to spend? I mean it's all relative, but by most metrics yes, it is a lot of money to spend. In and of itself I'm fine with that - I worked hard to get my masters degree and I continue to work hard at the job that I got with that degree. I've earned the right to do what I want. 

I'm not interested in saving every penny at the expense of turning down opportunities to have fun now while I still have the health. Nor am I interested in the opposite extreme, spending every penny now and working into my 60s. Aiming for a good happy medium I guess.

All that said, there is opportunity to cut expenses without negatively impacting my lifestyle: bringing my lunch to work, selling my car (neither of us drive to work, we don't need two cars), etc. Also, that $83k estimate includes some expenses that will go away when my house is sold, namely the utility bills, upkeep on the house (significant last year while I was making the improvements) and transportation expenses to get there (our new place is closer to work).",finance
personalfinance,"Is it better to use a 0% APR Credit Card, take out a loan, or pay in cash for a class that I'm quitting my job to take.","I am attending a 3 month coding boot camp. I am quitting my job in order to do this because I am ready for a change. I have the cash to pay the tuition in full. However, I don't love the idea of eating into my nest egg while also being unemployed

When I finish the course I have a high degree of confidence I will be able to find a job very quickly (I could even likely go back to my previous employer if necessary), so I do not anticipate being unemployed for a significant period of time.

My question is, what is the best approach for me to pay for this class? The program is partnered with a loan organization, with whom I qualify for an 8% interest rate loan, but also have to pay a 5% fee. This equates to 14% interest on what I could pay in cash. This seems expensive for just the added security that I may not even need.

Another alternative is to pay for the course on a 0% APR credit card. I've seen offers that go as long as 18 months. This seems almost too good to be true. Why would I not take this approach? I am essentially getting a ~2% discount on the cost of tuition (because of the intensives the cards offer), while deferring the payment of the course until a time when I have become employed again. Additionally I can leave my money in low risk investments to get an somewhat small additional return.

I'm interested in what other people might do in this situation. The total cost of the course is $15,000.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my loan sooner than required? (Message from the bank inside),"I got the following message from my bank when I queried paying off my loan sooner. I am not sure I understand it but as far as I can tell there is absolutely no point in me paying off my debt sooner than I am required to, in fact it would be stupid to or am I misunderstanding what they are saying? I would just be missing out the interest my money will generate while paying the same interest to them if I paid it off tomorrow or over 5 years. All that would change is either the amount I would pay per month or the duration of the loan. Or am I misunderstanding because I really am not sure.

Here is the message

&gt;When making additional payments or lump sum payments into your account, you have one of two options.
 
&gt;    1.    Allow your account to remain in advance
&gt;    2.    Capitalize the advance payment (capital reduction)
 
&gt;The benefits of allowing your account to remain in advance are as follow:
 
&gt;    -    Decrease your capital balance and your contract balance (only the actual balances, as the normal monthly interest will continue to be calculated on the theoretical balances, excluding the advance amount)
&gt;    -    Earn rebate interest on your advance amount at the same interest rate (only on accounts inside the National Credit Act)
&gt;    -    Shorten your contract term, due to the actual balance being reduced
&gt;    -    You may ask us to do a capital reduction whereby the advance amount is utilized in a recalculation of your monthly instalment amount and the remaining interest over the remaining period.
 
&gt;The benefits of a capital reduction are as follows:
 
&gt;    -    The monthly instalment is recalculated and reduced over the same period
&gt;    -    You may add an additional sum to your debit order after processing a capital reduction, in order to keep paying the same instalment amount, thereby reducing the period by paying it off sooner.
&gt;    -    Once a capital reduction is done it is irreversible and the advance is no longer available, as the actual and theoretical balances become the same.
 
&gt;Should you wish to capitalize your advance payment, a valid proof of payment is required.

I am still in the first year of my career and about the start graduate school (paid by my employer through tuition reimbursement, which is great), so our situation should improve steadily as my experience grows longer and I finish my education.

(300) Dental Insurance

(1670) Health Insurance

14880 Net Income

I understand that 401K isn't lost money and that the matched contribution is basically a 6% pay increase, but it sure doesn't feel that way come bill paying time.

I have been looking at student places to move into with some friends and prices range from £115-150 pppw for the area around my university. This doesn't include utilities, internet and of course food. 

I don't pay rent currently and spend £20 on fares a week commuting to university, so of course this is a massive difference in my out goings. I do work and I will be working a good job in London for the entirety of the summer, however I was intending to use this money to buy a car, tax and insure it to gain independence from my controlling mother if staying at home. 

I am getting to the end of my rope with the home situation, but moving will only exacibate the situation and she will not be happy with me making a decision she has no say over. I also feel for my 3 younger sisters who will have to continue to deal with her. Before you say, she will not get help. Its always everybody elses fault and I am fed up of confronting a 45 year old woman. 

So what do I do? I feel trapped. Move out and struggle financially or stay at home and continue to suffer.",finance

My plan:

Pay $1,600 to the CC to bring it to a more manageable debt and lower the interest charges. Save for vehicle payment due later this month (paycheck coming in 5 days after bill is due), purchase bicycle and use that to save on gas, put the rest in savings to save up for vehicle maintenance.

I'll try not to make this a sob story, since I know I have it relatively well off compared to most.

I have a mental illness, and during one of my episodes, I committed a crime. This was over 5 years ago, but it's still on my record. I get income from the federal government due to my mental illness being classified as a disibility. I've been working part-time making fairly good money, but lately I have found it trouble (mentally) to continue in my profession. That side income brings in about $500 extra each month, without it, I will be struggling to pay all my bills. If I get a full-time job, I'll lose my benefits due to earning too much. I've found it difficult to hold down full-time employment in the past (for very long).


Some questions:

* Is there anyway to restructure my nearly $10k in credit card debt?
* When does bankruptcy become a viable option to lower or get rid of some of my credit card debt? (or would it not be worth it, due to the consequences of maybe getting denied for apartments, etc)

Also, I'm under a kind of parole-like program due to my crime. Because of this, I can't move in with a roommate or lower my living expenses more than maybe $200 per month. I'd also have to break my lease in the process, which would cost $1600. I don't see that as a viable solution at the moment.

Here is my question, should I wait until we come back to pay off Car1, which will be near the end of the life of the loan. Then pay off the ATV, which will be 1 year out from the end of the loan. Then put the remainder towards the personal loan, due to the interest rate compared to Car2. Or should I pay them off as soon as possible?

I know that the sooner I pay them off the less I pay in interest, however since they are on a fixed payment cycle I will have more money to put towards the personal loan if I wait until the end. But, I know if I pay them off I will free up more month to month capital to put towards other things, like the personal loan.

Tuition is around $15,000/semester. In Fall 2016, my parents paid the $15,000 in full. This semester I took out a $20,000 Federal Sub Direct Loan at 5.1% interest.

A few months ago I sold my company and made $250,000 in capital gains. I bought two investment properties (paid in full: total around $110,000) that cash flow around $1.5k a month (net). I now have $100,000 left over (after taxes).

I currently have 4 years left of school since I am doing a joint MD/MBA program. The MBA program is one year and around the same amount of tuition, $15,000/semester. 

Next year, interest rates are expected to go up 1%. I'm scared that if this trend continues, I'll be paying 7-8% by the time I graduate. So going back to my original question, I'm wondering if it's smart to pay off my loan now.

* Fall 2016: $15,000 (paid in full by parents) 

* Spring 2017: $20,000 (loan taken out for this amount at 5.1% interest)

* Fall 2017: ~$15,000 (to be paid by parents)

* Spring 2018 ~$15,000 (to be paid by me)

* Fall 2018: ~$15,000 (to be paid by parents)

* Spring 2019 ~$15,000 (to be paid by me)

* Fall 2019: ~$15,000 (to be paid by parents)

* Fall 2020: ~$15,000 (to be paid by parents)

* Spring 2021 ~$15,000 (to be paid by me)

personalfinance,Retirement Planning for me (34) and wife (37),"This is long, but I believe it's all pertinent information.

So my wife and I have a slightly convoluted situation.  Both of us are state employees and have defined distribution pensions that pay out for life, as well as to a beneficiary if that situation arises.  The pension is very healthy.  A lot of retirement calculators suggest we're pretty much good at this point and don't need to do much because of our pensions.  But we also know that other state pensions have collapsed.  So I definitely don't want to treat it like ""we're good"", but I'm not quite sure if we should just treat this like the pension doesn't exist at all either.  My concern with doing that is having a lot of our retirement money tied up in ways we can't access it until later than we may like.  We can potentially retire earlier than typical and I'd hate for all of our money to be tied up until we're 59.5.  So I'm not sure if maybe we should pursue non-traditional investments that would keep our funds more liquid.

I'm going to start with the high level details, then ask a few questions, then give some very detailed info regarding retirement benefits.

**High-level info**:

Currently, I make about 76k/yr and she makes about 57k/yr.  So about 133k/yr or a bit over 11k/mo combined.

6% of our income goes directly into the state pension.  No choice in that.

Mortgage = approx. $1,300.  Combined with home insurance, taxes, etc., it's about $1600/mo.  1yr into 30yr fixed.  Paid 20% down, so no PMI or anything.

Home value approx. 360k.

We have approx. $700/mo in debt payments outside of the mortgage (auto loan and school loans).  We should be done paying those off within the next 18 months.  Or we could pay them off faster but the interest rates are low.

We have about 30k in various older retirement accounts that haven't been rolled over yet.

We have about 30k sitting right now, ready to invest (not counting 10k emergency fund).

**Once all of our bills are paid, we set aside money for things like auto repairs, vacations, etc..  With all necessary and discretionary spending accounted for, we have about $2,500/mo (30k/yr) left for investing however we'd like.**

Due to our pension, our income could potentially be high in retirement.  i.e., I need to consider that I very well may be in the same tax bracket in retirement as we're in currently.


**1) Would it be better to use Roth or Traditional accounts?** -- Most calculators I can find show that (due to thetax bracket in retirement), roth is ideal at this time.  I know that's not typical, but our situation isn't typical and the calculators do seem to make sense.  But what do you say?

**2) We have options of a 401k (unmatched), 403b (unmatched), or 457 (unmatched) all in traditional or roth.  Which would you use, if any?  Maybe we should just use IRAs?** --  We could use some combination thereof.  The 401k and 403b contributions would be combined for the total allowance, but 457 contributions don't count toward that 18k limit.  So we could use some combination of 457 AND 401 or 403.  We like that we can pull from the 457 as soon as we leave our employer, but the investment options and expense ratios are not great.  There are some okay options though and the option of withdrawing funds as soon as we leave may be worth the trade-off, not sure.   We could put money into roth options, which should give us easier access to the principal.  And in general, none of them have a lot of options with stellar expense ratios.

**3) Should we be looking at some other sort of investment vehicle outside of traditional retirement accounts?  If so, what would you suggest?**


**4) Should I approach this like our pension doesn't exist at all?**

**5) What would you set as a goal in our situation?**




More details about our pension and what not.


I am 34 and can ""retire"" at 56 (end of 2038).  She is 37 and can ""retire"" at 53 (in 2033).  By ""retire"", I mean leave employment with the state and immediately collect our respective pension benefits.  We are allowed to work in the private sector and still collect our pension benefits, but there are strict rules surrounding going back to work for the state itself.

Based on my current pay, my pension benefit would be about $3,500/mo.   My wife's pension benefit would be about $2,500/mo based on current pay.  Based on our career trajectories so far, we expect to both continue to go up a bit in salary outside of whatever COLA raises we may be given, which will increase our pension benefits in turn because they are based on a percentage of your salary.  The pension itself is COLA when the legislature agrees, but it usually doesn't keep up with 3%/yr. 

So here is a time-line of our minimum benefits by age range assuming current pay rates and that pension stays healthy.  All in today's dollars.

Current income: $132K/yr or 11k/mo

2032, Me 50 Her 53: $106k/yr or 8,833/mo  -- Wife can ""retire"" and collect pension.  She would be able to work and make more though if she wanted.

2037, Me 55 her 58: $72k/yr or 6k/mo -- I would be able to ""retire"" and collect pension.  I would be able to work and make more though if I wanted.

2042, Me 59 her 62: $86,400/yr or 7,200/mo  -- Wife could start collecting social security at reduced benefit.

2044, Me 62 her 65:  $108k/yr or 9,000/mo -- I could start collecting social security at reduced benefit.


Obviously, if we were to wait longer to collect social security, we would have a higher benefit there.

Healthcare is currently supplied to retirees for a pretty low premium through the state.  Again, no guarantee that it will be available 20 or 30 years from now.

Leaked DNC emails appeared to show top party officials conspiring against Sen. Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton,"*Redditor's note: Re-posted in this format because Fox News gatekeepers buried the lead. Main takeaway is that Rich was most likely the Wikileaks source of DNC leaks according to professional investigator and confirmed by government sources, which is circumstantial evidence that he was murdered in retaliation for damage leaks did to Clinton campaign, and to prevent him from exposing more corruption. My speculation: he was a patriotic Sanders partisan, not a Trump partisan, and the DNC wanted to strangle the Sanders campaign in the cradle and send a message to anti-Clinton dissidents and DNC establishment opponents within the Democratic Party.*

Family of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich blasts detective over report of WikiLeaks link
By Malia Zimmerman

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/16/slain-dnc-staffer-had-contact-with-wikileaks-investigator-says.html

family of the Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., blasted reports that he was a source of thousands of emails leaked to WikiLeaks.

Rod Wheeler, a retired Washington homicide detective and Fox News contributor hired by a third party to investigate the case made the WikiLeaks claim, which was corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.”

But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks ""unsubstantiated."" Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.

""Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so,"" Bauman said. ""We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.""

The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.

Rich was fiercely patriotic, say family members.  (Rich family)

An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

Seth Rich, shown here with his mother, was idealistic and wanted to change the world, his father said.  (Rich family)

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.

On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.

WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.

“WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,” the organization announced.

Assange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.

Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.

The department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.

""If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at (202) 727-9099 or text us at 50411,"" read the statement. ""The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.""

personalfinance,Rent vs. Buy: A Case Study in home ownership in a low COL area (Mid-west) vs. renting in a High COL (East Coast),"Hi All,

Long time lurker here. To give back to the community a bit, I thought I'd break down my personal rent vs. buy findings over the past 5 years since it's always a popular topic, particularly in the current frenzied real estate market. I've been in the interesting (albeit unfortunate) situation of completely subsidizing my parents home in the mid-west and also renting in a high COL area on the East Coast. 

Note: I will not be comparing taxes, etc. except as it pertains to houses. I also will not go into groceries, entertainment, etc. This is strictly a housing vs. housing comparison. 
  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Background for rental: I rent a 2 BR apartment with a roommate in a popular, extremely dense urban area (**not** NYC). 
  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Background for house: It's a single family, detached home in the mid-west worth ~$225,000. The mortgage has approximately $75,000 left on it at a 5% interest rate. 
 
  &amp;nbsp;   

Here's the breakdown. The rental cost will always be on the left, the house on the right. All values are monthly unless otherwise noted. 

* Rent vs Mortgage payment: $1190 vs. $550

  &amp;nbsp;  
* Property Taxes: $0 vs. $208

  &amp;nbsp;  
* Renters insurance vs. home insurance: $20 vs. $60

  &amp;nbsp;  
* Maintenance: This one is by far the most variable. The rule of thumb is generally 1% of the home's value, with some of that going towards saving for large, one-time expenses like a roof replacement. This also quickly becomes a time vs. money trade-off. Things like lawn-care, painting, etc. can be done yourself, but require up front investment in tools &amp; time. The numbers below reflect basically all home maintenance &amp; repairs contracted out. Generally lawn care, appliance repair, etc. are about the same each month as the total burden of home maintenance amortized: **$0 vs. $187.5 (1% of home value's per year / 12) + $150 (lawn care, appliance repair, etc.) = $337.5

  &amp;nbsp;  

* Utilities: Again, this is variable. My parents enjoy their AC and heat. On the flip side, Google Fiber came to our area and dramatically lowered our cable bill. For the rental, I pay for electricity &amp; cable, split down the middle between myself &amp; my roommate. For our house, we pay waste water, google fiber, electricity, and gas. I tried to average the amounts between summer &amp; winter: $117 vs. $278

  &amp;nbsp;  


* **Total cost comparison, rental vs. home: $1327 vs. $1433**

  &amp;nbsp;  

A few qualitative comments: Your mileage will vary! You could very easily lower your utility payments &amp; home maintenance costs by doing more things yourself, using less AC, etc. On the flip side, we've been fortunate that no major expenses have occurred at the house. A damaged roof could have easily added $200 per month to that maintenance cost for several years. Likewise, you could easily find a cheaper rental near me. My girlfriend's rent is $700 per month and she lives a few blocks away. It's also worth noting that our mortgage is quite low. At first purchase with 20% down your payments would be closer to $851 (plus insurance &amp; taxes). This would take the comparison to $1327 vs. $1733

**TL;DR: In my personal opinion, a single family detached home as your primary residence should not be your primary way to build wealth. There are highly variable costs, you often have to choose between money &amp; time, and home prices in general are flat against inflation. I also believe that lifestyle inflation tends to creep in much faster in a home than a rental apartment. There's always the tendency to upgrade your sofa, add an extension to the house, etc.** 

**That said, this is not an anti-house rant. There are many emotional / comfort reasons to buy a house for your family. But it is important to structure your finances such that you are not counting on an unrealistic appreciate in home prices or dramatic cost savings vs. a rental unit**
  &amp;nbsp;  

Edit: It's worth mentioning that even if you have your house ""paid off"" most of the expense above remains. Subtracting the $550 in mortgage leaves an ongoing for rent vs. buy (at current rental prices) at $1327 vs. $883. While it's certainly true that rental prices are likely to increase, it's also true that older houses tend to have higher maintenance costs over time. In addition, property taxes may need to rise in many communities to support local pension fund obligations, infrastructure, etc. 

  &amp;nbsp;  

Edit #2: Just for kicks I ran the ole ""what if"" calculator. If my family had taken the down payment for a house (20% of a $225,000 house = $45,000) and invested it in all in to the S&amp;P 500. Then, for 10 years, we took the ~$300 savings from renting over owning and invested it as well (note: obviously this is a super simple calculation. We're assuming rent stays constant, home maintenance stays constant, etc.). At the end of 10 years (specifically April 2002 to May 2017) we would have $235,969.04 if we re-invested all dividends for a RoR of ~7.4%. If we subtract the cost of rent ($1300 * 120 months) we get $79,986. 
  &amp;nbsp;  

If we repeat that with the house and assume the national average price appreciation in the same time frame (1.7% inflation adjusted, source: the economist) &amp; a 4% mortgage rate (actually in 2002 the rate would have been closer to 6%, but we could have refinanced so I'll leave it)  then we wind up with an equity balance 
 of: $124,888.32. 

So it's pretty close from a pure RoR point of view. Making slightly different assumptions around home appreciate rates, maintenance costs, rental rates, etc. could have definitely shifted the balance the other way. The bottom line is that a primary residence is first &amp; foremost a place to live, not an investment vehicle. You might make money, you might lose money, but don't count on it.",finance
personalfinance,"Second property with moved mobile home: Should I refinance my home and pay cash if I can, or should I seek a lot loan mortgage? Any other ideas or advice?","I'm 34 with a 761 FICO and no debt aside from a mortgage on my condo. The balance of the condo mortgage is $97,000, with the condo valued at $210,000-$220,000 (based on comps). I have $30,000 cash earmarked for an RE investment, and could probably get together an additional $13,000 or so while still maintaining a decent emergency fund. 

My parent's live on 10 acres in a rural area about 40 minutes away from Portland, OR. One of the parcels immediately adjacent to them is a 5 acre plot with a mobile home, a 30x30 shop in good shape, electricity, septic, and a well. The mobile home is uninhabitable and will need to be demo'd/replaced. The owner, who my father is friendly with, recently moved to another part of the state. 

My parents currently live in a nice 2bd/2ba mobile home on their property, and are preparing to break ground on a new stick-built home. My goal is to purchase the adjacent property, demo the current uninhabitable home, move their home to the property, and rent it until I'm ready to build a home for my future family (5+ years). My father spoke with the owner who has agreed to sell it to us for $170,000 as is and work with us time-wise (he may also be open to carrying a portion of the contract, if the terms were *very* favorable to him). Based on comps the land would likely sell for $200,000-$220,000 cash within a few weeks (this is one of the hottest housing markets in the US). 

Despite the fact that my parents mobile home is in fantastic condition, banks won't finance mobile homes which have been relocated. I believe this leaves me two options, try to get a land loan or pay cash. 

So far my research into land loans seems to indicate they're either short term, high interest, or both (example Washington Fed 20yr fixed @ 6.8% with 30% down). I'm thinking it might be best to refinance my current property and try to find a way to come up with the remaining cash needed to buy it outright. 

I'm not familiar with this sort of creative financing or even what my best move(s) might be. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions, or advice my family and I would really appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Why does it matter how much you use your credit card as long as you pay it all off each month?,"My question up front is this: I pay my credit card off each month in full and use it for everything to get the rewards from my bank, but my credit has lowered in the past month. Why is this? I did some research and it says you should only be using 30% of your credit limit (which is  $390 as this is my first credit card and my limit is $1300) and that is pretty low when you add up monthly expenses like internet, groceries, dining etc. (I think this is called a Utilization Rate) My credit card has a small rewards system and so I thought as long as I am paying it off in full then why not use it to get the rewards? However, this seems to be hurting me instead. A little bit more about my history below if you need it.

I am 26, married, both my wife and I have college degrees and no student loans (never had any to begin with as we just worked and paid our way through college and family helped too), we own two vehicles (both paid off), don't have any monthly bills besides internet and phone bill (we live on a base as we are military family). I never had a credit card growing up ever and only in the last 4 months just got one. I bought 1 vehicle cash from my in-laws and my motorcycle my dad bought and I paid him back over time (so I wouldn't have to pay interest rates through the dealer). So my credit history is really non-existent. I just recently opened a new card so I could build more credit that way too. I am very new to this whole credit building world. As I get into it more I am just getting more frustrated. Why do credit companies offer rewards but then tell you not to use the card, if I wanted to make a big purchase like a new TV or travel to see my family then that is way over my 30% of my credit limit but then I am not getting those cash back rewards. Is it even worth it to build my credit? It seems like a huge hassle to try to get credit. I pay for everything straight up anyways so why all this hollabaloo? Why do I need credit? Can I not just pay cash for everything? I mean I put away savings each month and don't have debts, it feels like we are just not winning with these cards. Why not just cancel them and forget about credit score all together? I am just very confused.",finance
personalfinance,"(UK) Small debt but high interest rate, should i re-finance?","I am not sure if this is the place to post and i apologise in advance if this does not belong here.

In December i wanted to buy my first car and when buying the car the sales man could not offer any financing options and advised me to go to my bank to see what options i have (Natwest). 

After speaking with them they offered me a 2 year loan for £3500. i pay monthly payments of £185 which i thought was normal and okay with me. after speaking with a few colleagues at work they asked how much interest goes back onto it a month. when i checked it it had started at £70 interest a month. My colleagues seemed to be very shocked and said i need to look at getting a smaller APR loan.

After scouting around i had come across Tesco Loans. the only problem is for little amounts of cash around £3000 it is still 12% a year, but when i apply for £500 the APR drops to a really low sum of 3.8%.

Here is a pastebin of my bank statement minus the personal info
https://pastebin.com/b5WhShge

And the link to the loan calculator

My question is, is it wise to get a new loan at a significantly smaller APR for £5000 and put the rest in savings or should i just continue my payments of £185 a month

More info: 22 year old male, no significant debts, £600 on 2 different credit cards and they will be paid next month.

personalfinance,Understanding an owner co-signing you on a mortgage to purchase their house? Good/Bad Deal?,"I recently came across a seller looking to work with me on a deal to purchase their house. The house itself is in the best area possible (school district, shopping,etc.) It is a 4 bed 2 bathroom home. The owner split the house in half into two separate apartments one upstairs one downstairs. The rental market is very strong in this area so I am not worried about getting it rented. Homes in this area are going north of $500k. Since I am still in graduate school I do not have the money to a) come up with a down payment b) unsure if I would even qualify for loan. 

That being said I have been actively looking for a seller finance type deal. It just so happens this person might want to work with me, but they suggested the following type deals;

1.  They would co-sign for an FHA type loan. Minimal down payment, but we use their income, credit score, etc. to establish a good interest rate. The title would be written so I own the home so I am on the hook for mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc. I assume they would take the cash use it for whatever (reinvest into another property). 
2. Same as 1., but instead of an FHA, the owners would draw up a separate loan and submit a 20% down payment with their own cash. So I would still be on the hook for the mortgage and then the 20% down payment they had loaned me to purchase their house.

Has anyone seen a deal like this before? Original seller finance deals to me were down payment, then monthly payments on amount agreed upon to owner. If you default the owner repossess the house scotch free. I'm trying to view every angle of risk to see if this is a bad deal. Essentially the owners are still attached to my name so they are at risk co-signing anything. 

Ideally I want to own a home as fast as I can. I'd like to buy a home in the $250-300k so there is not as much risk involved, but I don't want to pass on this offer and look back in 3 years when the house goes from $550k to $900k. 

Any and all advice is appreciated!",finance

We consistently work between 50-60 hr weeks. However I do not get overtime a lot of the time because they say that the hours paid do not combine together (has seemed fishy)

Ex: I spend 25 hrs in 1 week at the warehouse, but I spend 30 hrs out in the field. So 55 hrs total but I am paid (18x25)+(20x30) 

Am I getting screwed here or is this legally acceptable?

EDIT/UPDATE: 
A coworker of mine tried to explain his understanding of how they seem to get away with it. Apparently we are governed under DOT rules. Now we are production techs (AV) most of us have our Class B license and we will drive a Class B or smaller truck to whichever gig it is (usually in town, under 10 miles away) 
I have tried to look up DOT overtime rules but they still do not make a ton of sense to me. 
I appreciate the help I have received so far. 

Update #2:
Spoke with Idaho Labor Dept and Federal Dept of Labor wage an hour, they told me they are allowed to do this as a private carrier. So it is a private carrier exemption. 
Thats how they get away without paying any overtime although we are consistently over 40 hrs.

personalfinance,Recent College Graduate Seeking Advice,"Throwaway because of personal information.

About a year ago I graduated college. Since then, I've gotten a full-time job paying $50,000 and purchased a new car in November of 2016.

I have been living with my parents to save up money. So far, I have $13,000 in savings.

Now, my dilemma is what to do next. 

Due to circumstances, I would really like to move out of my home. Without getting into details it's become a stressful situation and I would also like to be closer to my girlfriend who lives an hour away.
However, I'm not sure I can afford it.

I have roughly $22k in student loans and still owe $14k on the car (1.9% interest).
 
Current expenses comes to around $810 per month (student loans, car loan, car insurance, cell phone, gas, and gym membership) 

Take home pay from work is $2,800 per month, after 401k contributions. 

That leaves me roughly $2,000 per month for rent, utilities, food, and plain old living. 
I live in Northern New Jersey so apartments are usually between $900-$1300 for anything decent. 

Basically, my questions are: 

Would paying that much in rent be enough to live comfortably?

Should I take my savings and wipe out the car loan or does that not make sense due to the 1.9% interest rate?

Would it be best to take out the highest interest rate student loans and save back up for moving out?


Thank you in advance! Any and all help is greatly appreciated, as I am torn on how to proceed.",finance

I posted something like this before and everyone told me i just need to pay my loans off ASAP.  But I am looking for some help and reason as to which option would be best for me. my wife and I are looking to travel crazy before kids so although paying off debt right away should be at the top of everyones list, we really rather see the world right now. 
&amp;nbsp;

Financial Situation: Wife and I currently rent and our gross income is ~$111,000. She has student loan debt that will be paid off in 2 years. Currently, I have a Car Loan and Student Loan
&amp;nbsp;

Current Student Loan Situation: $121,686.35 Interest Average 6.5% Current Car Loan: $17,000 Interest 1.83%
Repayment options 

&amp;nbsp;

1) Standard 10 year repayment - consolidate public loans to private and decrease interest rate to decrease monthly payment - current 10-year payment is $1450. Unable to afford to pay this amount each month - Estimated Monthly Payment $1400/month - Loan Life 10 years

&amp;nbsp;

2) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Jointly) - REPAYE option: 10% of discretionary income a month for up to 20 years then loan is forgiven - Monthly Payment $631. Calculation based on studentloan.gov website should loan would be paid off in 18 years with no loan forgiven. This website assumes your income increases %5 every year but Mine is projected to be 3% if i remain staff not dont move up to management position (im a physical therapist)

&amp;nbsp;

3) Income Driven Payment Plan (Filing Separately) - PAYE: 10% of loan holders discretionary income - This option will let me pay a decreased monthly payment since my wife and i will file separately. - Add additional monthly deposit to make up for the Tax on the loan forgiven after 20 years. - I recieve decreased amount from taxes - monthly payment : $300 + $200( for tax forgiveness) /month - Not sure how to invest my $200 a month

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone have any idea on what the best option for me is?
I know that the 1st option saves me the most money but I have to pay $1000 on top of my monthly payment! I am not saving enough money to afford putting that much in. We're also looking to get a house and need to save money for a down payment and closing costs.
When providing feedback please back up your thoughts! I already know how much more I will pay over time with option 2 and 3
EXTRA INFO Tax on Loan Forgiveness: Yes I know there is tax on the loan that is forgiven and I factored it into my calculation to help pay off the taxes.

Our monthly Budget : 
Total Expense: 4139.39( Loans, Rent, Cable,Car Payment, Gyms, Extra, Food, roth ira, car gas, church donation)

Bitcoin,Japan eyes prize in regulating bitcoin,"As speculative fever takes hold, cybercriminals taint the brand with ransom demands and prices whipsaw between record highs and cliff-edge stumbles, governments, investors and financial institutions are legitimately asking whether the world is ready for bitcoin.A thornier question — soon to be answered in Japan — is whether bitcoin is ready for “Mrs Watanabe”, the notional holder of the nation’s household purse-strings.Since April 1 this year, as the global market value of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies has surpassed $50bn, a growing number of online exchanges, funds and remittance companies has been scrambling to make formal registrations with the Japan Financial Services Agency. The process is expensive, demanding, laced with invisible tripwires and not all applicants, by any means, will be successful.The prize, though, could be spectacular. Japanese retail investors — a group that does include a lot of Mrs Watanabe housewives but is actually dominated by her day-trading children and their leveraged online accounts — are voracious. FX margin trading in Japan, the “Mrs Watanabe” favourite with volumes at about $10tn per quarter, is the largest in the world. A minute fraction of that channelled towards the bitcoin market, say the most excitable proponents, could be transformational.Propelling the rush to register is new legislation that (perhaps counter-intuitively for a country whose financial services industry still routinely uses fax machines), puts Japan comfortably at the head of the global pack on crypto currency trading regulation. Some US states have their own regulation for local bitcoin exchanges, but so far, no central government has taken the plunge and attempted to regulate an asset that was invented to defy regulation. It is easy to see why the FSA is keen to move: Japan, by volume, is one of the largest centres of bitcoin trading on any given day and has been helped by China clamping down. The Japanese government — unexpectedly clear-headed on the issue — sees as much potential opportunity as threat in that.Hence the stampede to register exchanges and other businesses with the FSA. The prospect of a market where the government has demystified an otherwise enigmatic asset and Mrs Watanabe has been soothed by seeing the stamp of a regulator known for its conservatism, is simply too lucrative a bet to pass up.By October 1, any bitcoin or “alternative coin” exchange or money transfer business that wants to operate in Japan must come under the regulatory supervision of the FSA and be submitted to annual audits. Much of the regulation (some of it in the familiar language of anti-money laundering measures and “know-your-customer” protocols) represents an attempt by Japan to purge some of the anarchy from bitcoin’s image. Other parts are designed to ensure separation between the stashes of customers’ bitcoins from those belonging to the exchanges themselves — a measure that might have avoided some of the chaos that followed the 2014 collapse of what was at the time the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, the Japan-based Mt Gox.In a final regulatory flourish that gently mocks the first two-thirds of the phrase “digital crypto currency”, new customers will not be able to trade until they have received a hard-copy acknowledgment letter, delivered by registered post to their home address.But for all the regulatory freight, this is a strangely light-footed moment for Japan and the FSA. To reach this point, a series of surprisingly un-Japanese breaches of natural conservatism have been necessary — not least, the formal recognition of bitcoins as a legal payment system.The retail investor — Mrs Watanabe — doesn’t want the wild, wild west, she wants something regulated and trustworthyMike Kayamori, chief executive of crypto currency exchange QuoineThere are several reasons for the leap. The first arises from the Mt Gox catastrophe, the high global visibility of what remains one of the biggest digital heists in history, an international cast of furious investors and the FSA’s fierce discomfort that all this happened on its turf. This is an assertion of control by Japan, but one driven by the desire to legitimise something that it knows, from long experience, that Mrs Watanabe may very well be interested in.Just as important, though, is the extent to which fintech — a loosely-mapped Aladdin’s cave of blockchain technology, crypto currency trading, artificial intelligence data analysis and other envisaged innovation — lies at the heart of government plans to turbo-charge Japan’s comatose financial services industry. Everyone loves and talks up the idea of Japanese banks (only recently armed with the legal ability to do so) splurging investment towards bleeding-edge fintech; nobody, confides the president of one of Japan’s three megabanks, is going to invest a single yen until there is a regulatory framework in place.The way regulation has been handled in Japan, say companies currently applying for the licence, is both curse and blessing. On the one hand, there are elements of the regulation that are heavy handed and could ultimately threaten a crypo-currency that has thrived on anonymity. Apart from bitcoin, for example, there are more than 800 alternative currencies on the market, but the FSA is effectively approving only one of them, ethereum.“When you are talking about start-ups, which of course a lot of the bitcoin-related businesses are, you never really think of regulation as a good thing,” says Mike Kayamori, chief executive of the crypto currency exchange Quoine, who argues that Japan has a long history of using regulation to squash innovation and “undesirable” areas of industry as it famously did with consumer loan companies in the late 2000s. “But in this case, it just might be different. The retail investor — Mrs Watanabe — doesn’t want the wild, wild west, she wants something regulated and trustworthy.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Plan on paying off loans in 4-5 years; is it always best to choose the lowest payment plan?,"I will be finishing up my graduate degree, (hopefully) finding employment, and beginning to pay off my school loans sometime this summer. I fully intend to pay down my loans in the smallest time frame possible, between 3-5 years depending on job prospects. My loans are spread out between grad and undergrad, and have interest rates between 3.4 and 6.8%.

Now, with the idea that I want to pay off loans well ahead of schedule, does it *always* make the most sense to choose the lowest possible payment plan? And in doing so, you have the absolute most discretion to apply your excess payments to your high interest/high priority loans?

An example would be wanting to dedicate $1000 a month towards student debt. I could have a $400 monthly payment, then allocate $600 towards my highest interest loans. Alternatively, I could do an extended graduated repayment plan, with a $200 monthly payment that then allows $800 to be applied so those high interest loans.

personalfinance,"Wife and I are in $40K debt, her workplace is offering a $20K loan at 0% interest. What now?","This post is mostly a question about where the best use of this money would be. 

I'm a US citizen living in Switzerland, married to a Swiss citizen. We're about 40K in debt, including car, my student loans, a personal family loan, and our combined credit cards. We've started taking the Dave Ramsey approach and start with our first $1000 in the bank, then work on paying off the debts, smallest to largest. We're making decent progress. We're going to be able to save about $500-$1000 per month, after all payments and food, fuel, etc. We also have about ~$1000 in value of precious metals on-hand.

Thats all to say that my wifes work is offering to us a $20,000 get-out-of-debt loan, with a whopping 0% interest. $400 gets taken out of her paycheck per month for 20 months, then $800 a month for 15 months. The company is a publicly-funded, yet semi-private organization. It bewilders me that any company would offer something like this without any interest (pun) of getting a financial return. My wife says is a Swiss thing - the company values good work from their employees more than money. They'd rather have out-of-debt employees that are in-turn happier and can do a better job than the alternative. Even with the $400 a month removed from her paycheck, we can still add money to our savings. 

Our debts, in order from smallest to largest. 

* Credit Card #1 - $1,812.37 - 23.65% interest - Min Monthly $68
* Credit Card #2 - $2,791.48 - 23.40% interest - Min Monthly $89
* Credit Card #3 - $5,721.50 - 9.9% interest - Min Monthly $300
* Student Loan #1 - $1,592.09 - 5.6% interest [Forbearance]
* Student Loan #2 - $2,032.03 - 6.8% interest [Forbearance]
* Student Loan #3 - $3,217.72 - 6.0% interest [Forbearance]
* Personal Family Loan - $10,000 - 0% interest, just potential strife if not repaid soonish
* Car Lease - $12,704.45 - 3.8% interest - Monthly $429

We have exactly $1,000 in the savings account. Our initial plan was to completely knock out Credit Card #1 and #2, as they are the highest interest rates, and smallest amounts. We plan to put $3,000 onto card #3, which should half the minimum monthly payment to around ~$150 per month - but we still plan to pay ~$300 to pay the balance sooner. We had no intention of putting any money onto my student loans, as they are in forbearance, and we make no monthly payment on them. We planned to put another $2,000 onto the Personal Family loan, and keep the rest of the cash as a bigger emergency fund - if something comes up, like the transmission on the car goes, I don't want to end up putting things on the card(s) again. 

How would you do this differently? I'm hoping to get a few other perspectives on how to use a windfall like this. I'm worried that we have no real plan to pay the student loans in the next 3-ish years as long as I can still get the forbearance (aware that interest is still accruing).

Is it better to save this month or two for a small downpayment on the car? I could probably save 1,000 to 1,500. OR, is it better to offer pay for deletes on the collection accounts, raise my credit score, and re-apply for pre-approval to get better rates on the loan?

personalfinance,Is my mortgage interest fully deductible or not? Reading guidance from IRS and tax services and still can't figure it out.,"Hi Guys,

I'm getting my mortgage approved for a recent condo purchase (&lt;$1m price)- I can afford the place regardless of the deduction but it would be good to know for sure what to expect!

I read this: 
https://www.irs.gov/publications/p936/ar02.html

IRS lays out 3 conditions for to qualify for fully deductible interest: 

1. Mortgages you took out on or before October 13, 1987 (called grandfathered debt).

2. Mortgages you (or your spouse if married filing a joint return) took out after October 13, 1987, to buy, build, or improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but only if throughout 2016 these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $1 million or less ($500,000 or less if married filing separately).

3. Mortgages you (or your spouse if married filing a joint return) took out after October 13, 1987, that are home equity debt but that are not home acquisition debt, but only if throughout 2016 these mortgages totaled $100,000 or less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately) and totaled no more than the fair market value of your home reduced by (1) and (2).

It seems like I qualify under condition #2, but was not sure if I have home equity or home acquisition debt. 

Then I read the following on difference between home equity and home acquisition debt: https://www.fulleredu.com/taxblog/mortgage-interest-deduction-acquisition-indebtedness-v-home-equity-indebtedness/

This article makes it sound like my mortgage is a home acquisition debt. 

Am I missing anything? Is my mortgage interest really going to be fully tax deductible? And by that I mean, if I pay $15k in mortgage interest in 2017, will my federal tax bill decrease by $15k?

personalfinance,Boss does not negotiate salaries - leave?,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub to ask this question. I'm fresh out of college and working a marketing internship in Silicon Valley. I'm being paid $10/hour, slightly below minimum wage, on the grounds that I am doing this three month internship and ascending to a permanent position at the end. I have done particularly well and have been offered the permanent position three weeks early. However, the amount they are offering is 42K plus bonuses, which I believe is below market value for this job in this area.

I countered the offer with 48K and made what I believe was a compelling argument, given this is my first time negotiating. After two days, they came back to me saying they were sticking to their original offer. They agreed with the points I made about my work from the last two months being strong, and they said that's why they offered the position early, but they price our service based on the amount they pay their account managers and this is a standard amount which cannot be adjusted without raising our prices. They said our service serves a worldwide audience, so they have to price our labor to a worldwide market, although the office happens to be located in Silicon Valley where everything is high cost. I did not expect to get 48K, but I expected them to come up to about 44K and I was planning to take that offer. The fact that we serve a worldwide audience does not get me out of paying Silicon Valley rent prices.

Our office is already understaffed and they are taking on new interns who will start the week that my internship ends, but who will need to go through the whole 3 month internship before being qualified to do the work at the permanent level. Meanwhile, other team members are complaining every day about how much work they are taking home because we don't have enough people to get it done in a day and clients get angry about delays.

I think I could get a better offer elsewhere, but it might leave a gap in my employment unless I find something in the next 2.5 weeks. My other option is to accept the offer of 42K and work here until I am able to find a better offer, building up my resume in the meantime.

My question is, is this common for an employer to flat out refuse to negotiate? What do you think about the argument my employer makes?

EDIT: I took the job. Thank you all for your input. It was very helpful to see different perspectives.

personalfinance,IRA: Best option if I'm likely to go back to school?,"I'm 24 years old and about to start a new job.

personalfinance,Can get earn more interest at a different bank. How big a difference makes it worth the move.,"I've banked with Capital One for many years now and I'm happy with them. But the interest on my savings accounts is only 0.75%. I saw today that Ally offers 1.0%.

I figure if I move my long-term savings accounts (which I rarely access) to Ally, and keep my checking and short term savings at Capital One, I could earn about $57 more per year. That's worth about 1.5 hours of my time.

But changing banks is a pain, and I'm not sure 0.25% is worth it. Especially considering that Capital One could catch up to that - or continue to lag behind - you just never know.

personalfinance,"question about: high interest low initial balance loan, vs low interest higher balance loan","hello all

i have a loan from school that i took out, the principal balance was about 67,000, it was a variable rate loan and over the life of the loan it has now increased to 9%, so far the interest over the years has added to about 33,000

if did some research about re-financing the loan, and i could get a loan with DRB / sofi / etc for 5 year variable starting at 4.9%

i will be able to pay off this loan in the next 5 years (switching from medical resident (65,000/yr salary) to attending (200,000+/yr) 

my question is, if i re-finance, will that save me money? it is a lower interest rate 4.9%, but the starting balance on the loan will be at 100,000 not 67,000 like my initial loan. so it will be 4.9% on 100,000 vs 9% on a 67,000 loan

personalfinance,Which will hurt my FICO least/help most in the short term?,"I am in a situation where a required loan (for new home construction/purchase) will be obtained in October that has an interest rate which varies based on FICO score.  If the October deadline passes and I don't get the loan, the property the loan is for will no longer be available.  I have a car leased, and the lease will be up in August.  I need to at the least maintain my current FICO score to get the lowest interest rate on the upcoming loan.

Which of the following, if any, would lead to no decrease in my credit score?  If all would lead to a decrease, which would lead to the least decrease?  Note that I have no revolving debt or other debt that can be paid down further prior to obtaining the upcoming loan.  The upcoming loan is for purchase of a house (new construction).

Options are as follows:
1) Turn in leased car and do monthly car rental over the following months, until the home loan goes through; would not require hard inquiry to my knowledge
2) Convert leased car into purchase
3) Return leased car and purchase different car
4) Return leased car and lease different car

Any of the above, save for renting a car, could be done through the same financial services brokers with whom I am leasing my car now (i.e. if it were a BMW - it's not - and it were run through BMW finance).  Not sure if that is relevant or not, and I am wondering about that too... am thinking of going to a different car brand/financer if I do lease/purchase a different car.

Also note that I don't care about ROI on the car.  A few months after the deadline to apply for the new loan I need, my salary will be climbing VERY substantially and I can always put off purchasing (or leasing) a car until down the road if needed and rent a car in the meantime.

I am explaining the conditions here in a detailed way; I can provide clarity, but please assume that for purposes of this thread that none of the conditions can be changed.

financialindependence,From corn fields to Silicon Alley,"It’s fascinating being a part of a community that has a similar goal(s) and somewhat similar values but such different backgrounds. I love hearing these stories so thought I’d share mine.

I’m currently in my late 20’s, living in a HCOL area in the East Coast, transplant from a HCOL area in the West Coast, born in Asia but grew up in the Midwest.  I guess if you were to look at my resume, it wouldn’t look too different than most other techies. Graduated from a top 5 school with a STEM bachelor’s (Electrical Eng), went to another top 5 school for a STEM master’s (Computer Science), with internships and FT jobs from string of big tech companies (I’m listing out a range, I didn’t work for all of these companies) like Google, Facebook, Apple, and mid sized like Uber, Lyft, Palantir, Pinterest and some smaller startups. 

I’ve always felt lucky. However, my background wasn’t privileged and that helped define my modest world views. Very fortunately, my tuition was paid by summer internships, Research/Teaching, and very generous financial aid so I had zero college debt. I was able to get generous financial aid because my parents combined never made over the federal poverty line (my parents only speak Korean and have had health issues).  We were always on government assistance, which was something I used to be embarrassed about, but now find it a humbling experience.

But it was a combination of seeing how happy we were without much money (or the spending of it) and the dependence we had on external financial circumstances that drew me to financial independence. And anti-hedonistic values probably helped.

I’d love to talk more about perspectives and world views if you have more questions, but onto finances.

Expenses

My average rent in the HCOL areas is probably $1300 (current rent is lower), and I get away with it by living with friends in rent controlled places and finding very modest apartments.
Food is catered by my company, but monthly eating out (probably once a week) and weekend groceries probably adds up to $100 a month.

Commute 

is easy since I don’t have a car and take public transportation (company expensed), walk, and bike everywhere. 
Travel/Health/Leisure/Clothes I’d probably say is $500 a month. This is a huge *estimate* since budgeting tools have too much noise for me to track. I would like to say this is a conservative estimate, but there might be something I’m forgetting.

This puts me at under 25k a year for the last several years (I think this year I’m hitting under that because of cheaper rent). I’m also proud because the average rent alone for the areas I’ve lived in are probably around 2k a person.

Debt

I have 135k mortgage left on an investment property (see below).

Income

I got into the tech industry a few years ago with a low 6-figure salary (when I say ‘low’, I don’t mean I think it’s not enough), and have seen an average of 10% raise every year.

Retirement Investments

40k in Roth IRA (all in US ETFs—I’m risky and we’re in a bull market)
7k in IRA (all in US ETFs—see above)

Cash

30k Emergency fund

Housing Investments

I invested in a home 3 years back (in a LCOL place) and it’s currently worth 250k. The rent pays the mortgage, but I put in an additional 5k a year for taxes/HOA/maintenance.

I’ve been somewhat vague and hand-wavy with numbers intentionally, but some of you might notice that with my salary and expenses (and the bull market we’re in), I have fewer assets than I should. Where did the money go? (I rhetorically ask myself this often). 

It went to startup options investing. I don’t think I see this often in these forums, since this is a very startup thing. I’m, at least right now, not risk-averse, so this is me playing with fate. If you work for a private company, they sometimes give you the opportunity to buy options that could be worth a lot, but could also be worth nothing and you’d lose money. Over 90% of startups fail, and the ones that succeed don't always have good exits. And depending on financial circumstances, you might be required to pay tax on the option purchase, even though no profit has been made.

So I’ve spent overall around 100 to 120k on stock option purchases and the accompanying taxes. This is a huge chunk that might go to zero if the bubble bursts. However, combined throughout the different companies, the current worth is around 900k. I can’t in good conscious consider this part of my net worth because it’s not liquid, but I do have somewhat confidence that some late stage companies would make that figure not look ridiculous. 

If some of them have good exits and I hit my number (currently 1 million in non-house assets), I would strongly consider FI/RE. If not, I’ll continue to chug along I guess, I'm thinking I'll know in 2 years. Wish me luck! 

Edit: Also didn't bring this up because I don't consider it an expense and it's not super much, but charity donations probably add up to around 5k every year. Will try to inflate this with salary, assuming I'm salaried ;) Also thought it was important to add because it kind of equals my misc. spending. I'm wondering if people don't include this figure in theirs because they're not donating or because they figure it's irrelevant.",finance

personalfinance,"(UK) Medical student, graduating in 2 years. Inheriting property. Advice much appreciated.","Hi all,

Apologies for the long winded post. Pretty clueless and any help would be much appreciated.

**CONTEXT**

Just for some context, I'm a 3rd year medical student (aged 21) and I'll be graduating in 2 years. 

**STUDENT LOANS**

By the time I graduate - I will have amassed approximately £60k of student loans, which are repaid by taking 9% of any earnings over £17,775 before tax. The interest rate on my student loan is 1.25% APR.

**SALARY POST GRADUATION**

My salaries post graduation as a junior doctor can be found in the table below [here](http://imgur.com/a/mtpdM). 

Foundation House Officer 1 is my first year post-graduation, Foundation House Officer 2 is my second year post-graduation and so on and so forth. I will spend two years as a Core Trainee. Anywhere between 3-8 years as a Speciality Registrar. The pay scales 1-9 are based on how many unsocial hours I work/which department I'm in. I can also supplement my pay by taking up additional (locum) work at a rate of £40/hr for night shifts for a first year (a rate which will increase as my seniority increases).

**CAREER PROGRESSION**

By the time I turn 35, taking into account any career breaks or failed exams, I should be qualified consultant (senior doctor in UK). The pay scales for those can be found [here.](http://imgur.com/a/nCNI6) This pay can also be supplemented by additional private work but that tends to only become available when you are a more senior consultant with 10+ years of experience. 

The income tax rates for UK are as [follows.](http://imgur.com/a/OzN1D)

**PENSIONS**

The NHS pension scheme (from what I have heard) is better than most private alternatives that are available in the UK. Although I'm struggling to find the contributions/payouts in a format that makes sense to me. I know the contributions are automatically taken out of our pay but I'm not sure how much. This is the most basic explanation I could [find](http://imgur.com/a/U2qqT).




**SAVINGS AND ASSETS**

I currently have £5k in a cash ISA and £4k in a credit union account. 

Furthermore, when I graduate, my dad is intending to transfer a property to my name. It's a modest 3-bed property, currently worth around £100k with £40k left on the mortgage. My dad is currently letting it privately to a young family for for £560pcm. He says when I graduate I can either sell it/pay off the mortgage or continue to let it out and have the income for myself.

**ADVICE** 

I'm pretty clueless about all things finance. From savings, credit, mortgages, investments etc. I've been trying to build my credit by taking out a credit card, buying some groceries with it twice a month and paying it off immediately. 

The main questions I have are as follows:

a) What should I do with my £9k cash savings when I graduate?

b) What should I do about my student loans? I'm assuming that I shouldn't pay them off in full due to the low interest on the loans? 

c) What should I do with the house? Sell or keep? If I sell - what would I do with the £60k profit that I'd make from it? 

Many thanks for the help and I apologise for the lengthy post. I am totally clueless about all things finance. I thought it best to try and get a basic grasp on things before I'm let loose into the big bad world.

-$12/hr full time job, only $2000 in savings (+ $1000 see below).
-I am newly graduated with a bachelor's degree in Foreign Language. 

I know I need a better paying job period.
I am also trying to kill bad spending habits. I've had a ""new"" budget every month since I've started working last October, edifying my allowed spending amount. The numbers are showing I am doing much better.

My question is what to do first. Do I save to move out and then start on my loans? Do I save and pay loans? Do I stay and pay loans? 

My worries are that if I put my money towards loans now, I have less savings (or none at all depending on the method) and what amount I am able to give to loans will go to waste just paying off interest and not making any dent at all. In other words, it's pointless.
It will also take forever. Maybe I'll never move out.

Actual story: 20 months ago, my now ex-husband cut me off from all marital funds. I borrowed $6,000 from a family member for my attorney's retainer. At the time, my attorney thought that we could get a settlement within six months and I told my family member that I would pay him back then.

That didn't happen, so at the six-month mark I offered to start paying in installments or take out a personal loan to repay him, since I was then in a better position to do so. He declined and told me to pay when it was all settled. Of course, this doesn't matter as far as what I will pay, but I'm just adding it to show that he was not hurting for the money.

It's now been 20 months and settled! I will be going to my bank to get a cashier's check tomorrow. My family member did not mention interest but I would like to include it since he did not have use of this money for 20 months. What would be a fair amount? $300, $500, $600? If it matters, my family member is pretty conservative financially and it is highly unlikely that he would have been making high-growth, high-return, high-risk investments.

And for the ""personal"" part of personal finance -- because of our respective financial positions and cultural/family considerations, my family member would be offended if I were to give him what he saw as a gift of money. I want to be fair and I'm perfectly willing to be generous, but I don't want to repay his kindness and helpfulness in a way that he would find offensive.

personalfinance,Need to refinance student loans. But need to improve credit score first.,"27 and single, no kids

My student loans are pretty insane for a non-graduate. about $660 a month in interest only. I was blessed in finding a great IT job that I have been at for about 4 months now, 44500/yr.

I have 80k in student loan debt that I want to pay off. but I can throw little at principle after all my other expenses, maybe ~200 at best, and that's assuming no other odd expenses(I know I have tires and breaks coming up).

My other credit lines open are my credit union bank credit card($1200 to pay off, my first priority), overdraft credit, and auto loan($4K left to pay off 3.2%). As well as another bank line of credit for Google store to get a phone(0% interest for 2 years).

My credit is kind of bad at sub 700 in part because of getting the new phone, so I know I need to give it time to heal.

I want to refinance my student loans but I'm sure it will need strong credit as it is a large amount, and I want to refinance it in my name only(current loans have a co-signer). Paying off my student loans is my only goal, financially speaking at least.

Since I know my credit will take a good 6 months to heal(at least), and with the current terrible interest rates they have, I am left with little money to pay off loans. Should I focus on my car loan and even my phone account to close those lines of credit to try and get my score up a touch more to better my chances at refinance? Or am I better off just throwing what I can at the worst of my loans until my score is healthy again.

On the subject of student loan refinancing, does anyone know if I go back to school if the loans will go into deferment? Or does that depend on the institution I refinance through?

-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd question: I don't currently have any sort of emergency fund, with my debts I haven't had the chance to make one. what kind of priority should I give this? I feel it is more important to pay my credit card off before I save for this, but I am uncertain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd question: Still up in the air, but, I potentially have the chance to get a side job that will get me an extra 600 a month AND eliminate my cost of rent at the same time, which is huge. safe to assume I should throw all of that at my loans given that I have my credit card and emergency fund in line?",finance
personalfinance,Need help choosing allowances for W-4,"I recently got a promotion at my job.

My sister bought a car 3 years ago for $16,000. She has bad credit. She has been paying her car payment though. She is telling me she is at 19% interest rate. After 3 years, her principal has only gone down $1000. That seemed to be at the beginning of the loan. Looking at her statement, she has been paying $0.00 towards the principal each payment.

She called the bank and said she has a simple loan. I've never heard of such a thing. Has anyone heard of this before?

6 credit cards, 2 cars. 

We spend around $1600/mo on debt of our ~$5k/mo income (US military), not including bills/mortgage. Making minimum payments we're projected to be debt free in around 15 years (kill me), but it's really challenging to pay more than the minimums in my current paygrade. 

We've looked into debt consolidation that will have us debt-free in around 5-6 years, but I've heard a lot of negative things about consolidation, namely the high interest rates. I'm looking into consolidation through Navy Federal tomorrow but for now I'm really interested in the community's thoughts. My thought is that for a couple of our credit cards we pay 25% interest anyway, so I don't see the downside.

personalfinance,Should I cash in my gift trust early or kept doing what I'm doing?,"I have a gift trust of about $37,000 that will reach maturity in two years, almost to the day. I have been told by my parents that if I wish to use this money for x-reason, my grandfather (the beneficiary) will sign off for me to get the funds early. My question is should I cash in this money now to pay down various debt at various interest rates, or should I kept paying my bills as usual and just wait until the money falls into my lap. My husband and I are living paycheck to paycheck and he wants me to cash this in to pay off all our debt. 

The debt various between credit cards and student loans. We have $25,000 in student loan debt between the two of us with the highest interest rate being 6.8%. In credit cards, we have about $20,000 in debt with the highest interest rate of  20.49%. 

My husbands theory is that if we cash in the money now and pay off the highest interest debts, then we can use the extra money every month to pay the rest off and throw into savings. My hesitation is that this gift trust is not met maturity yet so we could be losing out on thousands of dollars in the next two years. We also would pay $8,900 in tax on the money. Also, I wanted to use this money possibly for a down payment on a house in the future. It is a massive amount of money and neither of us will be gifted anything like this ever again.

personalfinance,"Closed on a $395,000 home today, let me know if i made the right move","I've been given I guess an injection of wealth by my family. Ultimately though I want to know if this was the wiser decision to make at 22 or did I buy too early. 

I was able to put 20% down on this home within the DC area. It's about 30 minutes away from the city. After taxes I'm making about $3600 a month. My monthly payment is around $2100 a month. I am renting out one bedroom for around $900 a month. No outstanding loans or debts, don't have to pay my own phone bill because of work, the only necessary expenses I have are food and utilities. 

Because of my lack of working history/credit history my credit score wasn't as strong as I believed. It was around 700 I think. The rate I locked in as in the upper 4% range, nearly 5%. It sounds bad right now, but I've been hearing a lot about interest rates going up, historically we've had higher interest rates in America. It wasn't until a few years after the recession that rates got to as low as they were for a few years. I feel that the small loss I take now on an interest rate is worth it long term if rates go  up. 

I have a stable job with a good outlook, I am expecting a 10% salary increase within the next year. Jobs in the area are plenty in my field. 

I moved to the area recently on my own with the support of my family after securing a job. This was their way of helping me out after seeing how actively I was trying to save money (took a roommate, commuted a bit further for cheaper housing, etc.). 

I like the area, but I don't love it. There are nice things about living here, but the general over population and horrible driving conditions make me not enjoy life nearly as much. Thankfully the location I bought in is actually quite close to my workplace. I am thinking that if in 5 years I feel comfortable leaving my company I will likely sell the home and move to a place with cheaper property and secure a job that pays well for the area I live in. Is 5 years too soon? The owners before me had the home for about 10 years. From what I was able to tell, the previous owner had purchased the home at 25 and lived there 10 years. I could see myself maybe staying 10 years, but it feels a bit long to me. We'll see how well I continue adapting to the area and feel a need stay rooted. 

I was able to max out my Roth IRA last year, in a few months my company starts matching my 401k and I will actually be taking home about 10% less in pay which will be offset by whatever salary increase I get. I want to continue saving as much as I can but I fear it's going to take some actual budgeting from me (I'm very frugal normally so it was easy to save money my first year, but now it looks like I have a tighter budget.). I will try to make an extra payment on my home each year, but I am not sure how I will be able to squeeze it in.

Did I just make a huge mistake, am I underestimating the toils of home ownership. I don't have a massive yard to take care of, but there are some trees that will eventually need to be taken care of near the property, the roof is quite old too even if it is in good condition and because I negotiated for a lower overall price on the home I agreed to take it as-is and that includes a fix that has to be done in the attic that will cost me up to $1000. Other than that everything else is very new. Windows, kitchen, hvac, appliances, all quite new.",finance

personalfinance,Significant income but immense financial burden from debts accumulated by my husband and my husband quitting his job- it seems silly but we're barely getting by.,"I haven't posted here but I've heard great things about the advice you all provide and I think it's time I figure out what to do with my financial situation. Here are the facts: I make $210,000 before taxes and year end bonus (I live in a state without state income tax), and my take home salary is a little under $12,000 per month.  our rent is $2,700 a month (we live in a city with a higher cost of living and can't move to another city- we just moved here from NYC where our rent was double this), cable bill is $250. I have $265,000 in federal student loans from law school that have been in forbearance for 9 months due to my current situation- interest is accumulating at about 7% and adding to the principal- and the forbearance period ends in August. The student loan payments are $2000 a month minimum when I'm paying. My husband racked up about $37,000 in credit card debt over the last two years unbeknownst to me, and some of the cards he put my name on. The interest rates on these cards are about 25% and The minimum payments are about $5,000 per month. He stopped putting things on the credit cards months ago except small things on the Amex, but the balances never seem to go down when I'm paying the minimum payment. $20k of the credit card debt is on an Amex card and I just don't understand how my paying about $3,000 on it a month doesn't make the balance go down. 

In 2015 my husband decided to cash out on his retirement fund to pay down some of the credit cards (the balance was much higher) and we took a huge tax hit and now owe $45,000 to the IRS- he was still working at this time so we were in a very high tax bracket- yes it was dumb and we will never do this again. I worked out a payment plan to pay $750 a month to the IRS, the minimum they'd let me pay. We have one car and the payment is $380 a month and $145 a month for car insurance. 

We live simply- I buy about $100 in groceries a week and we don't go out to eat. We don't buy many discretionary items. I do buy breakfast and lunch at work for about $20 total a day. For about $400 a month- gosh it sounds like a lot writing it out. So $12,000 per month in income with about $10,000 a month in mostly non discretionary spending. And I may be missing some bills. 

My husband left his six figure paying job last July to pursue his dream of being a writer and I said I would support him in doing so, but it wasn't supposed to last this long. He supported me in law school and feels I owe him. Long story. Obviously he is going to have to go back to work if his writing doesn't yield an income in the next 3 months when I have to start paying my loans again. But he really doesn't want to and doesn't see the problem with me not paying my student loans, which with random costs like gas and the occasional dinner out, would put us in the red. I have the entire burden and it is weighing on me. I worry at night going to bed and I'm so worried about what will happen when my loans come due again. Assuming he refuses to go back to work and I have to bear this burden on my own (please don't just say he needs to work- I know that but it's a tough situation with too many details to share), what can I do to not go under? I just don't see any options, but I'm not that financially savvy. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Decision making on my mother's home,"Hello all,

I would greatly appreciate some help making a decision. My grandmother has a 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2200 square foot home in the middle of nowhere, California. Town's population is 1200 and lacks even a gas station. The area is the High Desert and is the type of place you move to to disappear. Best I can tell, the market value if it were in good condition is $250,000, but the house needs a good amount of work, ~20,000 worth. Her mortgage is underwater at $270,000 ($110,000 as a deferred principal). She had an in-house modification done on the property resulting in a low payment of $800 which is ending soon--the interest rate was kept at 2% until May 2017. There is about 37 years left on the loan.

Due to her age (87), I had to move her out closer to services. The home was ~30 miles from a hospital, isolated on 3 acres. Now I have to decide what to do with the property. My initial thought was to do a short sale and get out of it. The bank didn't set a practical price on the short sale and the real estate agent suggested we go a deed in lieu of foreclosure instead. My mother's credit is shot as it is due to consumer debt, so I figured why not. I thought it was especially good since she would qualify with state and federal programs that would give her some money in relocation fees. Between 8 and $10,000.

Now I am thinking we may not want to do it. I am worried I am giving up on a decent property. In the area, similar homes rent for around $1500 a month. I imagine once the modification runs out, the mortgage will increase to about $1200, but we should also try to pay down the deferred principal as well. I live far away from this property (7 hour drive) so I would have to hire a property management company. 

What are everyone's thoughts? I still think the DIL of foreclosure is the best option as it gets her some money. Moreover, if I inherited this place tomorrow that's what I would do since managing it would be so difficult. But, let me know if you people have other thoughts!

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,22 year old looking to finance an RV,"Hello everyone.

I'll be 22 next month. I have been interested in buying a fifth wheel or travel trailer for about a year now and have done a fair amount of research so far but I am wondering how I would be able to possibly finance this purchase. I'm looking to spend about $15-25k. I have a couple of credit cards and about 3 years of total credit history but no other loans or debt. My credit is excellent (760+ on credit karma).

I know that some or most banks tend to avoid handing out loans to younger people since their risk generally tends to be higher. My primary job is also seasonal, about 5-6 months out of the year. Last year I earned $33k, unemployed for about 5 months. I figure that might not look so great on a loan application either. Would I be straight up denied or recieve an insanely high interest rate if I applied for an rv loan? Is a personal loan a better alternative in my situation or is there some other way to get the money? 

I even considered opening a new balance transfer card for a 0% interest rate and trying to charge as much as I can keep to my rewards card, then transferring the balance. Of course, utilization is going to be high with this option and I don't know how much that would hurt my credit in the short/long term. 

I also have about $15k in an investment account that I could deposit in a CD and possibly borrow against if that would help me get a better rate and guarantee me an approval. I would need to do the math to see if it would be worth it but I plan to pay everything off within 2 years and I don't plan on needing that money before then so a 2 year CD would be fine by me. I don't know much about these accounts though so any input is appreciated.

I do have enough savings to buy a smaller, older rv but I plan to live in the thing and would much rather be able to get something newer and larger to be more comfortable as long as it is affordable.

Thanks in advance and please, of you have any other suggestions or you straight up think this is a terrible idea, let me know. 👀",finance
personalfinance,"First time home buyer in a sellers market, constructive advice is helpful.","I'm currently trying to buy a house for the first time. I have a lucky financial situation in the sense that my family left me quite a bit of money. That, including my very part-time job I take home  ~66,000/yr.

I have minimal debt, a $300 car payment with about 8k left to pay off, so maybe a year and half left. No student loans, and a $500 secured savings credit card which I pay minimally on every month and use only to fill my car up with gas twice a month. My balance never gets above $120 and my minimum payments are around $60. I end up saving around $1,500/mo. I could do more, but I've grown so used to the cushion of at least 2k in my checking to want to do so.

I have 25,500 in my savings account. I have a trust fund with ~1,000,000. Mostly equities and fixed funds. My yearly distributions are ~5% of my trust and I do everything I can not to touch the principle amount, which is slightly dependent on stock market performance. I'd love to learn how to turn around and invest my distributions wisely, but that's another personal finance post altogether.

This one is about buying a house. I live in an incredibly beautiful and popular part of the US, we are in a college town that has a 1% vacancy rate currently and are sandwiched between two major metropolitan areas. Housing prices for a standard single family home are around 300k for going price. Rent here for the same thing is around $1,700/mo plus utilities. The only thing more aggressive than the buyers market right now is the renters market. The problem with the renters market is that there is no where for the hardworking middle class to live, especially if you own a pet (which I do). Everyone who owns around here is renting their properties out to college kids at exorbitant prices. Call me crazy, but I'm almost 30 years old. I don't want to live with 4 college kids, and even if I did, no one is going to rent to me because I have a non aggressive, small breed dog.

I recently got pre-qualified for a mortgage at a 4.125% interest rate (shitty, I know. My lack of credit history and spotty work history have left me with a measly score of barely above 710). My loan is up to and a little over 300k. 

I put an offer on a house today for 285k. It's a smaller single level house on a small lot. House might be too small for me to really consider renting out a room. It has been well taken care of and recently painted. The owners put a lot of care into this property. I'd be comfortable putting 5% down and am looking at a ~270,000 30 year conventional loan. My monthly costs are going to probably run me fairly close to $1,700/mo for my mortgage. This includes my property taxes, PMI and hazard insurance. Would not include my utilities. After all is said and done I'm probably realistically looking at 2k/mo for this place. At the same time, to rent the same thing here I'd be looking at a very similar price range. 

I currently have an excellent deal renting for $650. I have to move in approximately 1 month. The more information I type out for you guys, the more bleak my situation seem to get. Here for the renting market, it is legal to ask for first, last and security deposit. Minimum I'd be looking at is 5k to move into a rental. Do I rescind my offer on this house in this incredibly aggressive market and opt to rent instead in what I think is an even more aggressive market, effectively handing over a third of my down payment for someplace I may have to move out of in a year? Or do I go through with this offer and just give as much as I can to get to that 20% and pray that the housing market trend continues to grow? With a 1% vacancy rate I could effectively rent out my house if I ever wanted or needed to relocate. Mainly, I just don't feel like I know enough about buying to be 100% comfortable. 

Side note, my boyfriend is unsupportive and thinks this is a poor financial move for me. That's his opinion, which is fair enough. I haven't taken anything he makes into account because it doesn't matter, if something were to happen this would still be my house, my loan and my responsibility. I need to make sure that I'd be okay.

I would appreciate any and all advice I can possibly get. I haven't closed on this house yet and still have a few days to mull it over.

TL;DR: I currently take home 67k a year, and have over 25k in savings for part of DP. Should I buy a house at 4.125% interest rate with 5% down and a 30 yr 270k loan?

My regular bills are a $322 monthly car payment, $326 per month for car insurance, and a $45 per month phone bill. I spend about $80 in gas a month, and (I know this is a 'luxury' but habits die hard) about $20 in cigarettes a week.
I have a few other debts (credit cards, student loans) that should be paid off but they don't have as strict of a deadline as the others. I have $477 in the bank. What can I do to catch up?
Sorry if there's any crucial info missing, if I missed anything please comment and I'll update. I appreciate any advice that can be given.

UPDATE:  
I felt it was easier to do an update since mostly everyone had similar concerns. The roommate is my mother so I can't necessarily just leave her, she'd be in a shelter otherwise. I am going to talk to her about paying more of the rent.  As for the car, I don't have an option to live on campus since it is a community college and doesn't have dorms. It would be a 10 mile 3-3.5 hour walk to work and 20 miles to school. My car is just pretty good on gas. I have a public transportation option but I've lost a job because of it before and it would take 2-3 hours to get to school if the buses actually showed up. And I'm nervous about what will happen to my credit score if I lose the car while I still owe payments on it.  The car insurance is high because I had a lapse of insurance late last year and have to go through the state Auto Insurance Fund for 8 more months before I have the option of going to a ""regular"" provider like AllState or Geico.  I can't get out of my lease until October, and being that I live in Maryland $935 for a two bedroom is basically the cheapest I can get unless I move to a worse area.  I have looked at refinancing but I need to get my credit score up. I found out I have 4 days to pay my electric bill before my apartment complex takes legal action, so I'm going to have to go ahead and take out the payday loan and figure out the rest as I go. I'm also looking for a better paying job so hopefully I'll have luck in that venture.",finance

personalfinance,Wire transfer issues with Discover Bank,"On Monday 5.15.17 I filled out and uploaded a domestic wire transfer paper to wire money from my discover savings to my escrow company for the purpose of buying a house. I was called by discover on Wednesday 5.17.17 at 8 am and told that due to a delay in my funds not posting from a transfer I had put in on Friday 5.12, that my account did not have the amount needed for the wire. Luckily I have a second savings account with them and was able to transfer money from one savings to the other to cover the wire transfer. I then received an email confirmation Wednesday 5.17 at 11:09 am confirming my wire. I also checked my account and saw that the wire amount had indeed been debited from my account.

Thursday 5.18 my escrow company called me and told me they had not received my wire yet. I spent three hours with Discover on the phone trying to understand what was going on. I finally got all the way to a manager who assured me the funds had left discover, and they must be stuck at an intermediate bank between Discover and the federal reserve. I was told that because they had not received a tracking number from the federal reserve they could not tell me where my money was. They also had no way to confirm if they had sent the money to the proper account. She put a tracer on my wire and said they would follow up right away Friday morning.

I now got a phone call Friday morning saying that the funds are actually still at discover bank waiting for additional verification. 

If my account was debited Wednesday May 17th, and yet they needed additional verification, why did they not reach out to me Thursday May 18th for that verification? Beyond that, how can this woman assure me the funds have left discover bank, only to be called the next day and tell me they haven't left discover bank after all? 

My closing day is today, the funds have to be to my escrow account today. I feel totally helpless and discover bank has been absolutely no help. All they can tell me is they understand my frustration but have no additional answers. They can't even confirm the wire will go through today. Is there anything I can do?

personalfinance,[UPDATE] - Requesting a sanity check and critique of my budget,"Hi PF, 

I last posted in December 2016 asking for feedback and help to finalize my plans to build an emergency fund, pay off credit card debt, etc. (You can see the old thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5gn2r8/requesting_a_sanity_check_and_critique_of_my/)). 

It's been about 5 months and I'm happy to report back some good results.


**Old Milestones:**


1.  Quit smoking as a 2017 resolution to free up ~$50
2.  Reduce Entertainment / Misc. spending to average $400 a month
3.  Build emergency savings to at least $6,000 by December 2017
4.  Pay off $1,500 credit card balance by February 2017
5.  Save $4,000 for a down payment for a car by May 2017 (Total value of ~$12,000)
6.  Build ""Family Help"" fund of $2,500 by February 2018 for a down payment on a used car (Total value of ~$10,000)


**Current Situation:**

1. Smoking remained the same. Tried e-cigarettes which lasted me 2 weeks before I went back to smoking. This is a WIP 
2. Entertainment / Misc. expenses were kept &lt;$400 except for March, when I had to pay ~$1.5k in federal and state taxes (have adjusted my withholdings since then) and April when I incurred some moving costs
3. Emergency Fund is currently at ~$9k. I've adjusted my goal to reach $14.5k by December 2017 to cover 6 months of expenses (including paying student loans and helping family). Ultimate goal for Emergency Fund is $30k by January 2019 to be able to cover a full years worth of expenses if necessary
4. Credit Card debt has been paid off on time 
5. $4.5k has been saved up in a separate savings account specifically for the car down payment. Goal currently is to get this up to $6k by September 2017 (using the Money freed up from not having to pay for my expired lease and car insurance). 
6. ""Family Fund"" of $2.5k has been met ahead of schedule. Goal now is to bump this up to $5k by February 2018 so that I can get them something a bit more reliable.


Setting these milestones/goals last year in PersonalFinance has been a huge help and has also opened up the floodgates for me to pursue the FIRE track as well. Some of the new goals I've set are:

* Increase 401k contribution from 15% to 20% by end of 2017 to max out the $18k contribution limit 
* Begin fully funding Roth IRA ($5500) starting March 2018 
* Start contributing $300/month towards a taxable brokerage account starting March 2018 
* Fully pay off student loans (~$25k) by April 2020

● Will not offer discount if balance is paid in full

● No fees after balance is paid in full

1. Transfer balance to a lower interest card 

2. Pay full balance (eats into emergency fund of $12k)

personalfinance,Current pharmacist graduate student with $14k CC debt without options.,"Hi everyone; hopefully this post doesn't get buried in the rest of the posts and someone with experience can provide some input. Below I am going to split my situation into 3 parts: Debt, Future, End-Goal

* I currently have about $14k in cc debt between four credit cards with APRs ranging between 14-20%. Due to some poor judgment from an old relationship, I also owe my ex-girlfriend about $15k. 
* I will be entering my 3rd year of pharmacy school in August and will be graduating with my Doctorate in Pharmacy in May 2019. I am currently a part-time intern at Walgreens making $16 an hour and am guaranteed a job upon graduation with a salary that should at least be around $95k/year. I don't have any student loans because my parents are funding my education, but I cannot get myself to ask them to help me out with a personal loan, since they are already doing so much for me. 
* I have looked into personal loans from SoFi, lending tree, upstart, etc. and it is very difficult to get a large loan with an APR lower than 20% with some type of interest only repayment plan until I graduate in May 2019 and can begin to take on larger monthly payments. Essentially what could erase all of this is like a $40k personal loan for 5 years in which I could make payments on the interest until May 2019 and then full payments thereafter. I don't mind a high interest rate. It's just hard to find this type of loan with my current student/intern job position and without a co-signer. My credit is currently 694.

In summary, essentially I know I dug myself into a hole; I understand how poorly I mishandled my money and I want to just be able to pay off the ex-gf debt and get back on track. I KNOW I will be making good money come May 2019, it's just hard to prove that to a bank without them wanting to sell me a student loan (I don't need help paying for school, hence why I don't need a student loan).

personalfinance,Does Student Loan Refinance make sense in this situation?,"Hi PF,

I've been looking into refinancing my student loans and can't make up my mind on whether or not this makes sense. Here's how they look now (sorry, there are a lot of them):

1 for 7,541 @ 4% 6/7/2029  
2 for 11,377 @ 3.5 5/7/2029  

Grand total of ~45k with a weighted average interest rate of 3.92

The best offer I've found on a refinance is 4.4% fixed rate 7 year term for the whole 45k. Now maybe this is dumb but given the varying lengths and rates of my existing loans I didn't know how to go about determining if this would benefit me or not.

On the one hand I like the idea of being completely done in 7 years, but on the other hand the rate is higher than my average now. Is the obvious answer here don't take the higher rate refinancing? Or is there more to it than that?

EDIT: Probably worth mentioning, my current monthly payment is ~780. New monthly payment would be 615, but my intention would be to keep paying 780.

personalfinance,Banking pros and cons?,"I'm not sure if this breaks the ""Generic, open-ended, or hypothetical questions"" rule necessarily, so if it does I'm sure this will just get deleted.

Anyways, I am trying to make the most of my banking options and it just dawned on me that I could probably get more benefits if I host more of my personal finances with the bank that holds my home loan.

Currently, I have personal checking and savings with Wells Fargo and my home loan with a local bank. I looked at my lender bank's website and they have checking and savings with more benefits than Wells Fargo currently offers me (cash back checking, better interest rates on savings and checking, etc.), especially since my loan qualifies me for their top-tier plans. Plus, I'd qualify for good CDs and MMAs.

So my question is this, what sort of pros and cons are associated with having all of my finances under one roof? Is it risky or smart? Would you keep things the way they are or would go after those additional benefits?

In a few months, I'm going to be moving in with the GF when she has a job (she just graduated, yay!).  She has her own student debts at around $90k+ (-_- but she's going to be working in a school so eligible for PSLF should it be around).  The cheapest apartments in the area we will be working are around $1300/mo + utilities so that kinda sucks.

After taxes and her loan payments, she should have $1500-2000/mo income.  Here's how I see my personal expenses as of now:

* Income - ~$2900/mo
* Readily available - ~$8000
    + Alliant CU - ~$6200 (~$5000 @ 1.05% interest, the rest at 0.65%)
    + HSA account - ~$1800
        - I add ~$50/mo, employer adds $2200/year spaced out, they will be adding their last $550 in a few months.
* Current Debt/Bills - ~$48k, ~$1000/mo ($630 minimum)
    + Auto - $8800 @ 3.74%
        - Payment - $500/mo ($200 min)
    + Student (Fed) - $31700 @ 4.625% (4.375% w/ autopay)

        - Payment - $65/mo (min)
    + Insurance - $165/mo (should go down by at least $20 come July, but I'm going to shop around and hopefully find lower)
    + Gym - $20/mo
* Investments - ~$27500
    + Employer 401k - $2300 (4% match, contributing 6%, gets me around the $5000/year mark)
        - Blackrock S&amp;P 500 Index - 40% (BSPIX - 0.11% ER)
        - Blackrock International Index - 20% (MDIIX - 0.37% ER)
        - Columbia Small Cap Index - 20% (NSMAX - 0.46% ER)
    + Fidelity Traditional IRA - $12500
        - Target 2055 - 33% (FDEWX - 0.15% ER)
        - Nasdaq Composite Index - 33% (FNCMX - 0.3% ER)
        - Fidelity Small Cap Index - 33% (FSSPX - 0.19% ER)

        - Vanguard Bond International Bond - 20% (VTABX - 0.12% ER)

* Anticipated Bills - ~$2500 (rent, utilities, food, etc.) - hopefully a vast overestimate, but if we split them in half, it will still leave me with at least $500/mo for other spending/saving and her with at least $250/mo.

I'm trying to snowball the car, then the variable loan, then finish up the fed loan even though it's the highest interest.  Should I pull the two percent from my 401k and put it towards the debt, or are the interest rates low enough that I could even increase that amount slightly and keep putting money away for retirement?

Next, how should I diversify my investments better, or am I okay here?  I'm thinking about changing one of the small caps to a mid-cap.  A mid-cap on my 401k is also 0.46% ER like the small cap I'm in, but then the ERs start to raise around 1% and higher.  The PRIDX ER is also a bit of a steep one, but it's one of my best performing investments overall.

Lastly, what's the best way to go about saving for big things like a marriage/house while paying off the debt? GF has an accident settlement of ~$15k that her parents and I suggested putting into mutual funds, so she has that for now.  How much would be a reasonable amount to save per month?  Or should she pay the minimum and save up because of PSLF, and I maintain an e-fund and leave it at that until I pay off my debt?

**TLDR:** Good amount of debt and investments, seems like it's under control.  Do I need help, or am I just paranoid?  Also, how to save for a wedding and house with debt.",finance

The one private loan I have already consolidated over 20 years with a monthly payment of $328. The other is an 8 year loan with a monthly payment of $141. My federal loan is a parent plus loan that I could pay off by draining my savings and emergency fund that comes to $58 per month. My last federal loan I just signed up for an income based repayment, but the repayment is based on my current salary and not military salary and it currently will be $88 per month. 
I'm having some trouble deferring loans and getting my debt to income ratio low enough to be given a boot camp date for the coast guard. I've already gone through meps and taken the asvab, this is the only thing holding me up. The ratio needs to be under 30% which comes to about $550 in total debt per month. The parent plus loan holder said there wasn't anything they could really do as far as deferment went during bootcamp because of the nature of the loan (parent loan), which I can understand that but I'm still the one responsible for the loan and it's on my credit report. The other federal loan holders said that once I go to bootcamp I can lower my monthly payment to about $0 during that time, but that still doesn't help me lower my debt to income to start bootcamp. I've read that with the private loans I can call and try to work with them on temporarily lowering my monthly payment since I haven't missed any payments before. What I feel like I'm running into is the military saying I can't go to bootcamp until my debt is better handled, and the loan companies saying they can't lower my debt until I have orders from the military.

personalfinance,Loan provider changing disbursement ratio of monthly payment,"Hello,

We have multiple loans open with Navient that are of varying degree of interest rates and principals.  We have been doing the avalanche method of paying off the higher interest rate loans, but noticed something weird regarding the monthly payment disbursement.

We've been paying ~$607 monthly spread across all these loans through autopay. The highest interest rate loan is 6% (loan A), and automated monthly payment history. May - July of last year they were a standard $82. As we began paying more ontop of loan A, and the total balance decreased significantly, the % of the autopay to this loan decreased, and the % to the other lower interest rate loans began increasing.

This 'makes sense' if every month the system takes the monthly payment, and distributes it equally across all loans based on the % of your total balance.

My question is - Is this normal? Is this 'supposed' to happen? Does Navient have to get 'approval' from users to change the way loan payments are disbursed? The conflict of interest is pretty clear, Navient is earning more interest by switching these payments, as opposed to them staying consistent. They've opened a question to their 'research team' that should send a response within two weeks.

personalfinance,Need your advice. Please help.,"Throw away here. 

I need your advice. 

I have about 30 dollars in my wallet. 

I am unemployed and have been actively seeking employment for four months. I am in the midst of several second and third round interviews for various positions, so that looks promising. 

Here is the problem.

I owned my own business in 2015 and made enough money to buy my own car without a cosigner. My exwife ruined my credit in 2007, so when I got approved for financing, I wasn't thinking properly. I bought a 2012 acura TL for 22k. I bought the car in VA. Monthly payments were $584/ mo. My rent at the time was 1700/mo. I was single and having a great time. 

Then I met my current gf, and now we have a child. He is now one years old. We relocated to GA, and now I have since shut down my business because i was never home. I have since gone through all of my savings (about 11k) I mistakenly spent six months unemployed spending my savings to spend more time with my son. 

Now, I have since figured out that my interest rate on my acura was 20%. I have been paying almost 600/mo on a car that isn't that great and now I owe more on it than it's worth. In fact, because of the interest, I owe more on the loan than I have originally taken out. 

Now i'm literally broke, and am about to have my car repo'ed. (it's 74 days past due) I can't afford rent this month, and I spent all my money to buy food for my son. 

I know what it's like to have little money, but the stress is ridiculous, and it may break apart my family. 

If I don't have a car, it's hard to land and keep a good job. 

What can I do?

But now I'm spooked. Has anyone had this happen?  I've kept up with my credit score on Mint and my discover card statements, and nothing looks out of the ordinary. I even pulled my Transunion report and nothing looks suspicious there.  Should I pull the other two reports as well?

Come to think of it, my federal tax return was flagged for potential identity theft and I had to go to the IRS office to prove I'm really me.  Could these things be related?

* Base future retirement benefits on the average of the high five years of salary instead of the current high three.

* Eliminate cost of living adjustments (COLA) for current and future FERS employees

From my research (looking up the CUSIP No. on Fidelity's site), I've determined this is a Treasury Investment Growth Receipt (TIGR). This investment vehicle was popular when interest rates were high but government bond returns were low. Apparently you could buy a long-term government bond for pennies on the dollar and it would be only worth money after its maturity date.

It didn't take much to figure out that Shearson Lehman became Lehman Bros. and you know the rest of that story. Ironically, in the instructions it says ""should you desire to sell your securities at anytime, we would be pleased to handle the transaction for you.""

If this is not possible then I figure there is no point for me to continue doing a Roth and will just do a traditional from now on since it will reduce my state tax burden now and I wouldn't even owe it in the future.

Edit 2:  Apparently this isn't as cut and dry as it seems like it would be.  I thought I was crazy for not being able to find a definite answer.  I do appreciate all the replies.  Keep them coming if you have any info.  At this point it looks like it's going to be a question for my tax person.  I do have someone I regularly use so I'll be asking them at tax time.  In the meantime I'll be doing the traditional since it saves me from ever paying NC tax and will be hoping I can get a definite answer on the conversion when I talk to my tax person.  :)",finance
personalfinance,Long term loan.,"Hello, 

My questions to you are whether or not it would be a good idea for me to take out a loan to help me get my credit cards under control, and if not, if there are other options available that I am unaware of. 

Currently, I am about 4k in debt to two different credit cards. I had a month long stretch with my previous job where I had to make up bills and other living arrangements. 

I owe $2,200 to the first card at almost 25% APR, the other card is about $1,800 at about 20%. 

Currently I have no wiggle room to pay these cards off any faster than the minimum payment amounts, which are making progress at an abysmally slow rate of about $30 a month after the interest hits me.

Long term, I was thinking about finding a loan to pay these balances off while also finding a lower interest rate, as these seem awfully high.  Long term, I think this will cost me more money, but short term this is significantly more sustainable. 

I have never missed a payment, and the only blemish on my credit report is the high utilization of available credit. At the moment, my score across the various unions is about 630.

I have tried to make an assortment of changes in my life including not carrying the cards with me anymore, and eating less fast food. Some other changes I'm interested in making include living more within my means, but having little savings at the end of the month is making the first/last/deposit for new living arrangements difficult to put together. 

My thinking is that a long term loan would likely provide better than the average %23 APR, however with my credit score being what it is, I don't even know where to begin looking. After that, putting together new, more affordable living arrangements would help me pay off that loan faster. 

Any and all advice is appreciated, you folks know more than I do. 

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,How I Got Into Real Estate Investing at 22,"I bought my first investment property (a triplex) when I was 22 back in 2013. Prior to making this purchase I had to prepare for nearly two years in order to set up the necessary financial infrastructure to make this purchase. This is the story about that process, the lessons I learned, and things that that I wish I had known beforehand. Unlike the many other articles and “guides” to real estate investing, I won’t be treating you like a novice. The reality is, only a small fraction of the people reading this article will use the information that I’m attempting to convey and that’s fine. If you’re like me and want a perspective that’s more than skin deep then this is for you.

My parents were average middle-class people and growing up, I did not have a “Rich Dad” mentor who would guide my financial education. It wasn’t until after I had made my first investment purchase that I had sought out my first mentor who was none other than my own landlord at the time (that’s a story for another time). During my journey towards acquiring my first rental property, the greatest difficulty I faced was the lack of detailed and specific information available to new investors. Most of the information I encountered were either very generic or “philosophical”, sure financial freedom sounds nice but what are the exact steps that I need to take? As someone who doesn’t come from wealth or parents with high financial IQ, it really made me realize why the middle-class and poor were at such a disadvantage when compared to the wealthy and financially educated class. The greatest barrier was not money but knowledge.

**Part I: Getting Started**

Now, back to the story at hand. As I mentioned the process of buying my first investment property began more than two years before my first purchase. The reason for this simple: qualifying for a loan. In my opinion, the reason why real estate is a far superior investment option compared to stocks is that no one is going to give you a 95% loan-to-value 30-year-fixed rate interest to buy stocks. Thanks to government subsidies, mortgages are the cheapest money you’ll ever get and it’s accessible to all investors, not just accredited investors.

However, in order to access this valuable resource, you’ll have to develop several important assets. These assets are: credit, income, and capital.

**Credit:** If you’re like me growing up, you’ve either been told many negative things about this subject or nothing at all. What I’ve learned is that credit is a tool and the way you use it will lead you either to wealth or ruin. As an investor you must discipline yourself to use credit wisely and care for it as if your life depends on it. Credit is one of the greatest barriers to entry for younger investors and that’s why you must start building it as soon as possible. Whether you get your credit history started with a secured card or become an authorized user on someone else’s card, the important thing is to start! I won’t go in further detail about this, you can look up resources like Credit Karma to answer your questions.

**Income:** Having a great credit score is a good start, but without any provable income, you’ll be hard pressed to qualify for any sort of loans. The ideal scenario is to have a steady salaried job which you’ve been working at for at least one year. You can qualify for a loan with self-employed income but it’s much harder to do so. Of course, loan regulations are constantly changing so you should find yourself a qualified mortgage broker to familiarize yourself with the details. Learning as much about loans and the various ways you can take advantage of them is something I wish I had done prior to buying my first investment.

**Capital:** Recently I’ve seen dozens of articles, books, and classes that offer you the opportunity to get into real estate investing with “No Money Required!”. Now I wouldn’t go as far to say that these people are all lying, but doing any sort of investing without any personal funds is both risky and foolish, especially if you’re a novice. If you’re the type of person who can’t manage to scrape together any savings to invest with, then your first priority should be to straighten out your personal finances, not investing in real estate. Acquiring sufficient capital to make a down payment on your property should be part of your preparation process. You should ideally prepare enough to make a 20% down payment, but 5% + closing costs should be the bare minimum.

I made the decision to go into real estate investing back when I was in high school. However, I didn’t really take any serious action until close to my second year of college. It took me quite a while to figure out exactly what I needed to buy my first property. Thanks to a family friend who was a mortgage broker, she explained to me the minimum requirements (listed above) that I needed to qualify for a loan. I started my credit history with a $500 secured credit card from a local credit union, and my parents were kind enough to bolster my credit score by adding me to one of their cards (like many middle income families, my parents had great credit but no money).

For my income, I had started an IT consulting company which I managed to net out about $50k in profits in the first year and about $80k in the second year. This was reflected on my tax returns for their respective years which allowed me to qualify for a loan. In hindsight, a salaried job would have made it easier to qualify but I might not have made as much considering my age at the time. Besides, it wasn’t until my second year of operating that business that I had learned about the requirements to get a loan. I had to make do with the situation at hand.

Finally, living at home and building my savings during that time allowed me to accumulate around $80k which was enough to make a down payment on a property. And so, with a low 700’s credit score, two years tax returns, and $80k in the bank I was off to find my very first investment property.

**Part II: Finding Your Investment Property**
The year was 2013. While the real estate market in the Seattle area was starting to pick up again, the great recession still loomed like a dark cloud and was never far from peoples thoughts. It was during this period that my naive and inexperienced self began the hunt for my very first investment property.

There are two important lessons that I learned during this and later periods. One is that the majority of people know nothing about real estate investing and taking advice from such people will only lead you to catastrophe. Two, this same principle applies to real estate agents as well. The only people who knows anything about real estate investing are real estate investors. I don’t care if the person who’s giving you advice is a CPA, financial adviser, managing broker of a real estate brokerage, or a successful business entrepreneur. Unless they’ve actually gone through the process of buying a property, listing it for rent, managing tenants, collecting rent, and spent a Sunday afternoon repairing a leaky roof; they don’t know anything about real estate investing.
On top of this, the majority of real estate investors are terrible investors. I would say that the percentage of successful real estate investors is probably equivalent to the percentage of successful stock investors. Many of these people became landlords/investors by accident, and as a result, their investments are likely to be either cash flow negative or just break even. So before you take advice from Uncle Bengee who rents out his former house in Minnesota, check to see that their investments are actually investments and not a poorly disguised liability.

Continuing on with my story, I followed the advice of my friends and family and I started my search by asking around for a good real estate agent to work with. I soon partnered up with an agent who, looking back now, was a mediocre agent at best and didn’t have the slightest clue about investment properties. But he was a likable character and had some very entertaining stories, not that this would help me in anyway.

With what little I knew I outlined a simple criteria for the type of property I wanted:

- Good location (meaning commuter friendly, developing area, and potential for growth)
- Cash flow positive
- Multifamily (I’ll go into more details)
- Within my price range ($200k-$300k)

I had decided early on to buy a multifamily property because based on my reasoning and research: multifamily properties benefit from fluctuation in income from vacancies (1/X% units vacant vs $0 income if a SFH is vacant), combined maintenance costs (one roof, one sewer, one structure), location convenience (1 address for all units instead of multiple addresses), and better cap rates in general. Of course, this is sacrificing greater appreciation and longer term tenants but the cost-benefit weighed in favor of multifamily for me.

There were a few properties that I considered prior to finding the triplex that I ultimately purchased, frankly if I could go back I would have looked at more properties and have done more research before making my purchase. I think I was more lucky with my timing and location than any smart decision making on my part, but the experience gained from making that initial leap of faith was the necessary jump start to my journey as a real estate investor.

The triplex I ended up buying was located in the South part of Seattle, it was an old property over 100 years old and frankly looked the part. It was a short-sale (which means the owner owed more than the listing price) with a listing price of $330k. Several things that caught my eye about this property was that it was 2 minutes from the highway on ramp, a 10 minute walk from the new light rail station, cash flow positive based on the rent numbers, and it was zoned for commercial use in an area surrounded by commercial properties. I made an offer of $300k for the property and the offer was eventually approved by the bank.

I found the property using Zillow while searching for multifamily properties in the greater Seattle area, the triplex had two 1 bedroom units and one 2 bedroom unit.

The rents were $690, $730, and $1000 respectively or $2420 total. At 25% down the monthly costs for mortgage, insurance, and taxes were about $1,500 with a 4.5% interest rate. I estimated about $300/month in maintenance and $200 in utilities for additional expenses. That would leave me about cashflow positive of about $420 a month. That’s about a 6% cash on cash return, it was nothing to write home about but I didn’t know any better at the time. I was just happy with the fact that it was cashflow positive. Of course at the time I didn’t account for any vacancies and definitely underestimated my maintenance expenses considering the age of the property.

The closing process went pretty smoothly despite being a short sale property. During the inspection contingency I did as much research about the property as I could. I checked the county records to look up the property history, previous sales, current and estimated property taxes, and any permits that were pulled for any renovations. Due to the unique zoning of the property, I made an appointment with the city permit department to learn more about the zoning benefits of the property. After speaking with a city planning representative they informed me that the property was a zero-lot-line property (meaning if developed the new structure can be built close to the edge of the property line), no parking spaces were required due to close public transit, and that the building height limit was going to be increased from 65 to 130 feet.

This was all very good news to me. After considering the current state of the property, I believed that if I had to sell the place down the road, it was more likely to be picked up by a developer instead of another landlord. What I learned from meeting with the city permit department was that the land would be worth a lot to any future developers.

Things I learned and things I wish I knew then:

- Turnkey: I would suggest for new investors to buy a more turnkey property than a more risky property that requires a lot more repairs and work. I think real estate investing is a big pill to swallow and it’s better to have your first investment be something more manageable. A catastrophe on your first investment will set you back quite a lot while a good but not killer first property will help set a good foundation for your future acquisitions while allowing you to decide whether or not real estate investing is for you.

- Patience: While decision paralysis is a real issue, I strongly believe being patient and meticulous is important to have a better understanding of your market and its current opportunities. I think if I had spent more time analyzing more opportunities, I would have likely found a even better cash flowing property.

- Inspector: For the novice real estate investor, a good inspector makes a world of difference. This is someone that unlike your realtor, your loan officer, and everyone else in the buying process is not incentivized by you closing the deal. I was not impressed by the inspector that I had for my first purchase, I think if I had someone more knowledgable and insightful I would have been more aware of the issues that I was buying into. I suggest getting referrals from other investors for inspectors that really dig into the details. You may not want inspectors referred by your agent because they may be incentivized to say less in order to prevent scaring new buyers away. Ask for samples of previous inspection reports to get a better idea of the service and information that the inspector will offer you.

- Rent: Don’t be afraid to raise rents to market levels. This is perhaps one of my biggest mistakes after buying my property. I simply renewed everyones leases and kept the rent the same for the three years that I owned the property. I probably lost tens of thousands of dollars by not increasing rents to market rates. Previous owners and landlords usually aren’t as aggressive in raising rents because they don’t want to deal with turnovers. Use resources like Craigslist, Zillow, and Rentometer to determine what market rent is for your property. It’s a good idea to take tours of other units and see how they compare to yours.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Credit Card Recommendations for Retired Dad,"I recently found out that my dad who lives on a fixed income, has about 15k balance on a credit card with a 28% interest rate. 

I reviewed his statements and it looks like he hasn't used it in a year. When he did use it, it was primarily on car repairs and utilities. 


Now he's making 400.00 a month payments, but nearly all of it goes to newly accrued interest. Unfortunately he cannot afford to pay more. 

He's going to be looking into getting a part time job. In the mean time, can anyone recommend a good credit card that offers balance transfers with 0% interest for a certain period of time? Bonus points for cards that maintain a low variable range or fixed interest rates. 

I would love to help my dad pay this but given the size and severity of the debt, it's not sustainable for me to do it on my own.

I live in the Philly burbs. As of right now I am a pizza delivery guy working between 30-40 hours a week. I make an approx average of $1200 per month after tax. Rent is $300 a month, which is really my only fixed expense other than gas/food, stuff like that. My credit score is currently 570 because I was an idiot in my 20's. I am digging myself out of the hole I put myself in. I currently only have 2 negative remarks in collection my credit report (one for $406 and one for $1,149).  I assume it would be in my best interest to take care of those before apply for any loans but I am finding it difficult with my current situation. Also have to pay about $250 back to the bank from an overdraft I took to fix my brakes on my current car recently as well as about $700 to a friend from when I was unemployed and homeless. 

I am trying to become a driver for Uber/Lyft to earn some extra cash and depending on how that goes maybe do it full time. Expect I will drive about 30 hours a week which according to the Lyft estimator will allow me to bring in an additional 600 per week$2400 per month pre-tax. In order to do that, I need to get a car in better shape. Im kicking around a few ideas.

*Idea 1*: My stepmoms aunt recently passed away and had a 2015 Subaru Outback with 26k miles on it. I don't know how much is still owed on the vehicle (if any) but from what I understand it now belongs to my stepmom. My dad said that if I wanted it we could try to work something out, which would require me to obtain a used car loan. He threw out the number $20,000 but that's not a solid number yet. I know that interest rates in used car loans are always higher than new car loans, which will have to be figured into my decision. I think because of the higher interest rate I would have to get the loan amount down.

*Idea 2*: Buying a brand new car. The ones I have in mind would probably run me about $25-30k (thinking about Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, etc... You get the idea). I used the payment calculator on the Hyundai website and with my credit score and trade in: with a score of 580 and a 2k trade (per kbb) and zero down, the Hyundai website says the estimated monthly payment is $382 (based off 10.39 apr/60 months) for a Sonata sport w/MSRP of $25,545. I've been speaking with someone at the local dealership and they believe it won't be a problem get a loan for a new car.

*Idea 3*: try to obtain a newer vehicle through the Uber leasing program. From what I understand, they are unlimited mileage leases and cost from $150-$200 per week. That's a lot of cash per month but I wouldn't have to worry about the mileage I put on the car like I would with a regular lease and can probably upgrade again in a few years. But the cost per month makes me think this is the worst option, but I don't know for sure.

I think that's all the info I have but if I left anything obvious out I can answer.

So far the few people I talked to all have different opinions.... What do you think?

Edit: I have applied to Uber and waiting for approval. Once that is obtained, I am also going to look into their rental program as someone suggested. I would definitely rent before I go into any lease with them...",finance

The Ripple(XRP) Effect - Fundamental Analysis:
lennartbedrage44 in cryptocurrency
ripple.jpg

Lately, there’s been a tremendous amount of buzz around Ripple(XRP), but is it only because of the massive growth we’ve seen in the past few 30 days, or is there something more?

In this article, I’ll dive into a brief back ground of Ripple, objectively examine the arguments for and against it, explore its potential from a economic standpoint, then close with potential threats to your investment and a summary.


Meet Ripple(XRP)-

Released in 2012, Ripple aims to enable “secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks” through their real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and currency exchange and remittance network. Ripples distributed open-source internet protocol consensus ledger was created as basic technology for interbank and regulated financial institutions to integrate Ripple into their own systems. This differs from the Bitcoin full node and other crowdsourced altcoin consensus networks in several ways:

Ripples common shared ledger is a network of independent validating servers which compare their transaction records, rather than the full network of nodes coming to consensus prior to each transaction, enabling faster transaction speeds.
Although their protocol is open source, it was not created as a plug &amp; play solution, like bitcoins full-node software, nor does it rely on crowd-sourced support.
Unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other Alt-coins, Ripple is recognized as legal tender by several governments, which gives it instant liquidity via financial institution, as well as purchasing power over material goods. Because of this, it cannot be evaluated in the same ways as other coins, which are largely evaluated based on assumptions &amp; speculation.
In terms of value, it’s more like cash than a commodity. Because of this, it is evaluated in a much different way than Ethereum(ETH) and other alt-coins with intrinsic value, but is accepted much more rapidly because it’s easy for the mass-market to understand. Remember: without market acceptance, there is not value, regardless of how innovative something may be.

Just 4 short years after its release, on 01MAY17, Ripple announced that a consortium of 47 banks have successfully completed a pilot implementation of Ripple in Japan, making it the first country in the world to enable domestic and international real time money transfers via the cryptocurrency. This event lead the XRP value to sky-rocket from $0.051580 USD to an all-time high of $0.430085 in just 16 days… but why? Is it 100% speculation, or is there something else going on here?

“It’s not a real cryptocurrency!”
Or is it? Well, those whom bring this argument to the table are probably referencing facts that I’ve mention during my introduction to Ripple: Its a centralized and regulated crypto-currency which does not need global consensus for transfers, and it is built specifically for (and potentially by) financial institutions. Though a lot of the Anarcho-Capitalists may want to steer clear of this one due to its highly regulated nature, regular capitalist may believe these core differences to be its greatest strengths:

Regulated - As I mentioned in my analysis on Ethereum(ETH), Bitcoin’s lack of regulation was likely he reason (or at least, that’s what they told us) that the proposed ETF failed to pass the SEC’s evaluation several months ago. If adhering to some sort of trusted regulatory standards, this could drive federal confidence, which in turn drive bank and lending institution faith…trickling all the way down to the consumers. This insures rapid mass market acceptance.
Consensus - As mentioned before this is much different process than Bitcoin’s global consensus, which means that transaction times are nearly instant regardless of volume transferred. Additionally, all transfers adhere to distributive ledgers DLT standards, which is a requirement for many financial institutions to be insurable.
Institutional Management - You’ve probably guessed this one already. Although the demand and speculative value is driven at some capacity by ‘the people’, this currency is about as close to the World bank and SWIFT as you can get. This is largely due to the amount
Deliberate - It feels like a big bank, because it is. Ripple was built specifically for the financial markets, which is why they specifically targeted regulatory compliance.

Economic Value
As mentioned in the last point, Its easy to see that Ripple offers tremendous value to financial-institutions and retail investors. These two groups make up 358 billion (numbers from 2013) non-cash cross-country annual transactions, and the FOREX market which sees more than $5.1 trillion $USD each day. Per a report released by Capgemini and The Royal Bank of Scotland, this is growing at an average rate of about 7.5% each year globally, though China and other Emerging Asian economies have been leading the charge at around 21%.

Seems like a lot, right? Well, for sake of uncovering the immediate value of XRP, we will zoom into the recent adopters of the distributed ledger technology: Japan, India, and the Central Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(CEMEA) regions.

Japan.jpg

Japan is the third largest economy in the world by nominal GDP ($6.11 trillion), fourth by purchasing power parity(PPP) and second largest developed economy. Currently, their GDP per capita is roughly $48,412 (vs $56,430 in US) and their major trade partners include the US, China, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea.

Japan GDP.png

Aside from the speculation that they maybe soon pressure their trade partners (excluding the US and China) to adopt a system which allows for instant, near free transfers of funds, here’s where it gets interesting for the immediate future: Japan has already started accepting Ripple(XRP) as legal tender. If Ripple raises to just 25% of the overall transaction volume of P2P, P2B &amp; B2B within Japan itself (represented in the chart by Other Services, Real Estate, Retail, Transport, Communications, Finance &amp; Utilities) which is equal to about 20% of their overall economy, Ripple would be handling roughly $1.27 trillion USD in Japan – alone - every year. To put that in perspective, the current (at the time of writing) market capitalization of Bitcoin(BTC) is $30.7 billion USD (or &gt;0.4%). Unlike Bitcoin, Ripple is legal tender which means that it can be exchanged for material goods and services, which means that it’s likely to have explosive acceptance in the local area.

India.jpg

India-based Axis Bank announced in April that they will soon begin leveraging distributed ledger tech for cross-border transactions and to make banking simple and convenient for their customers. About 15 days’ prior, another large financial institution, Yes Bank, also announced that they would be adopting Ripples ledger for the same reasons. If Ripple continues to grow in acceptance at this rate in India, we could see another economy, roughly 1/3 the size of Japan’s ($2.074 trillion USD) add to Ripples annual transaction value. Now, from an economic stand point, this is most interesting because agriculture represents more than 50% of India’s employment, which means that India would be the 2nd case of consumer trading Ripple for staple foods.

India GDP.png

It is likely that Ripple will not handle as large of a percentage of overall transaction volumes in India because only two major banks have adopted this currency and it is not the only Crypto. The latter is probably one of the most important variables, as this means that Ripple will be duking it out for market dominancy. As all of my projections are fairly conservative, I would estimate that Ripple will handle roughly 10% of India’s over all transaction volume in the next 365 days, equal to roughly $311.1 billion USD.

One last thing that I would like to mention is that India is literally the ‘I’ in BRIC and roughly 13% of the BRIC countries total output. If the BRIC comes to fruition, India may be able to convince it’s other close trade partners to jump on the XRP-Train as well.

Dubai.jpg

Abu Dhabi Bank, the National and largest bank of the UAE, has already begun offering cross-border transaction services with Ripples distributive ledger technology as well. As they deal extensively with their middle eastern neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, the UAE is likely to set a trend for other CEMEA countries to follow.

UAE GDP.png

This might be a surprise to some people, but Dubai’s largest industry is the energy sector (shocker!) followed closely by Real Estate and their Finance industry (double shocker!). Although their GPD is much smaller than Japan and India’s (about $370 billion USD), I am anticipating Ripple to handle a larger percent of the UAE’s transaction volume (31.11%), especially in the finance, Real Estate, Retail and Logistics industries. This is due largely to the fact that their population is only roughly 9.157 million, but most Abu Dhabi nationals are very financially inclined (or at least heavy spenders).

Potential Threats
As this threatens SWIFT (unless they are completely on board) and the US dollars’ supremacy in the economic &amp; financial markets, I would not be surprised to see a false flag attack, in which the NSA attacks Ripple and blames it on North Korea or China. Frankly, this would be a cake walk compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry and they could probably hand the task to an MIT intern. Where semi-centralization is Ripples strength in terms of transaction speed and regulation, it is also the biggest security flaw and may open it’s user to some heart ache, hair loss and heavy drinking over the next several years.

Possibility
So, what is possible in terms of value over the next few years? Well, if we consider the following scenario:

XRP accounts for roughly 20% of Japan, India full GDP, but 31.1% UAE’s GDP ($7.152 Trillion USD) total exchange volume in the next 2 years
Max XRP Supply stays at 100 billion
No other countries adopt XRP (not likely)
No hacks or other catastrophic events remove confidence
Exclude speculation, demand, rallies, and GDP growth projections for each country
Then we’re looking at each Ripple(XRP) market capitalization over ~$1.75 Trillion USD, making each coin $17.52 in real value. This means that if you were to invest today at $0.362794, your ROI would be about 4,989%. That said, I think that it’s likely it will go over $30 in the next 2 years, due to speculators flooding the markets and other countries signing up. Again, these are conservative numbers are based on total transaction value in USD equivalent.

For those whom subscribe, I will update as new variables are available to my appraisal

Bottom Line
Although it was most definitely created by an insider of the banking industry and does not ‘feel like a crypto’, I personally feel that due to its rapid market acceptance, liquidity and position as legal tender in 3 large economies, Ripple(XRP) is both primed for explosive growth in the near future and likely to be one of the safest value based Crypto-investments we can make today.

Another thing, China is the anchor of the West Pacific, so we should all watch their evaluation of Ripple, very closely. If they were to jump on the XRP-Train, you are likely to see Australia, South Korea, Indonesia and Singapore do the same.

personalfinance,Looking to go back to college - already graduated with a BA and about 30K in student loans,"I'll try to keep this brief. I graduated in 2014 with a BA in Human Development. I've been working as a preschool teacher at a non-profit for the last three years. I make about 28,700 a year with summers off. 

I have been thinking a lot about going back to school for my Masters. At the same time, I really, really want to go back and get a nursing degree and specialize in pediatrics. I LOVE working with kids. I have a newborn who unfortunately had to stay overnight at a children's hospital a few months back. The nurses were amazing and I just keep regretting that it wasn't something I had thought of doing when I first started college. Anyways, this is getting off topic I'm so sorry. 

I have about 30K in student loans. Three loans are in my name. Two are parent plus loans in my mom'a name that I am also paying. They are all federal loans I believe.
Loan 1 - Sub - $2,089 - 3.86% interest rate
Loan 2 -Unsub - $4,850 - 3.86% 
Loan 3 - Unsub - $6,828 - 6.8% 
monthly payment is 165. Unpaid interest is $466. They have been on hold for my maternity leave. Payments start again next month.

Parent plus loan:
1. 11,930 - interest rate is 7.65
2. 4,818 - 6.16% interest
Monthly payment is $232. Unpaid interest is $78.

I have no savings (I know, I know - working on that) as well as a car loan. My only CC is Target and gets paid off (I only use it for the money I already have and would have spent anyways to help build credit).  According to the Credit Karma app, my credit score is fair. My fiancé is willing to help pay for student loans since he has no student debt, or debt in general. 

I'm just wondering how to tackle all this and go back to school. Eventually, my fiancé and I would like to buy a house too but that will be a couple years down the line before baby starts Kindergarten. Would going back be worth it? I would be making more money but also borrowing more. Would a masters in something else relating to Human Development be better? Is this something I should hold off on until my debt is paid down or gone? Help me help myself, please! 

Thank you in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for some perspective on a new source of income, arthimetic check","Hello PF!

Looking to make sure I've a decent perspective on an opportunity at work concerning the fiscal. I'm supposed to ""accept"" or decline Monday 5/22/17 and I was ""offered"" verbally by my general manager Thursday.

Might be a lot to chew...

Here's the gist, I wait tables, bartend, play management usually all at once in what I know is a poorly run restaurant that's part of a concept (company) that's in decline. The company is most likely on a downward spiral because it's not well run and is part of a corporation that I'm confident isn't as well run as it thinks.

There's lots of running that isn't going well...

Because it'll be relevant later, I'm in Oklahoma and because it's relevant now: I'm a decent runner.

With a Front of House manager out indefinitely, I've been covering and closing some shifts at $13 an hour when I haven't had my regular shifts on the floor. Seems like the company president and my General Manager want to replace this manager (the front of house manager) because they still don't have a return date after a month, but can't because of some contractual clause.

Go ahead and check the tldr


**The ""labor""**

So I've been offered an ""hourly supervisor"" at a paid rate of $16.50 an hour for 40 hours a week and overtime for 10 hours a week. I've not seen any paper yet, but I'm confident they expect 50 hours a week over 5 days because there are only 3 managers for the entire restaurant (see poorly run above). 

I will no longer work on the floor making money through tips, and there's a possibility that I move up from the hourly supervisor to the management position once more is known and decided concerning the manager that's been on medical leave.

(Some numbers that might be hourly rates and hours or the diameter of a black hole in light years and something else impressively intelligent)

16.50 * 40 = 660

(16.50 + 8.25) * 10 = 247.50

247.5 + 660 = 907.50


So my math tells me the weekly gross (pretax for anyone unaware) I'm looking at is $907.50, the net I've estimated is $707.84. That net assumes a 22.18% tax rate.

All the pay calculators I've seen have the tax rate between 24%~26%, but looking at my last check I took the current taxes (231) and divided by the current gross (1.044) and got 22.18% 

Am I way off on the net for the week?

A curious side note, the year to date tax rate comes to 20%, (1728.05/8629.92) but I'm guessing the 401k that the paycheck rarely contributes to is the difference.

The yearly gross looks like

907.50 * 52 = 47,190

the hourly rate for the year, $18.15

47,190/(50 * 52) = 18.15

while the yearly net looks

707.84 * 52 = 36,807.68

All that is to say I believe my net for a year's work at the offered rates will come to $36,807 (feel it's safe to say a thousand less because I'm jaded) assuming I hit 50 hours for 52 weeks.

So far I'm not sure if anything over 50 hours will be allowed.

The gross being offered is about 5,000 over what I mentioned it would take to get me to consider the opportunity. I was told by mouth that the reason the gross was so high was because I would not be offered benefits or accumulate any PTO and that if I was offered the front of house management (foh) gross would come down a few thousand.

Here's the drop, I don't qualify for company health coverage and currently get my insurance through the federal marketplace, for four months I paid $459.81 without the premium tax credit (getting paperwork between healthcare.gov and my corporate employer was a nightmare), I now pay 213.81 with the premium tax credit.

I'm assuming accepting this rate is going to require going back to the initial rate of $459.81, which over a year comes to $5517.72 for health insurance. I think this means my net is truly $31,289.28, assuming the company isn't required to offer me health coverage (which I'm unsure I trust their assertion that they are not).

**A deep breath and a push...**

I keep records of what I make each day, and as of the end of April, I was at  $9,321 for an average of $2,330.45 a month.

That average would put me at $27,963 for the year, I'm actually thinking a $2,000 swing up or down. I'm not so meticulous as to log my hours too, but I can comfortably assume 5 hours a shift and I track the shifts I work a month as well days off and per shift average each month.

So for the 4 months, I've a total of 110 shifts, and 27.5 shifts averaged a month, which averages to 137.5 hours a month and 34.3 hours a week. I wish I could say that's all I was there for/worked, but as anyone employed front of the house in food service knows that's never how it goes, I'm certain I'm actually there 40~42 hours a week.

Please spare me the labor board mentions, I've looked into it and it's not worth the time and effort.

That said, on paper in the last four months I've made about $16.90 per hour,

2,330.45 / 137.5 = 16.9

At the moment it looks to me as if I'm being offered 3,000~$4,000 dollars for 8 more hours of work each week over a year, that's taking the net pay and the health insurance price together, is that a reasonable assumption or am I putting on glasses that are tinted rose or black? 

Am I trying to convince myself this is a good deal when it's not, or have I missed something that would make it better or worse?

**One last push...**

I feel like my employer's perspective is that this is a fair deal. I'm not so sure but I'm confident it's at least $3,000 lower than other places. The rub is I don't work at other places and they won't offer me anything.

I've been where I am now for 12 years... and I'm the first they've even considered ""promoting"" from within the store in 8 years and the only ""promotion"" that would stay in the same store.

In the few weeks I've been covering management shifts, I've gotten a better look behind the curtain I already knew was there and gained insight into how disorganized the store is. 

Even though I'm inclined to take on or try too much, I know I can help organize, make improvements, and fight to change the bullshit I've encountered personally.

Part of me really just wants to take on the challenge to see if I can lead this place out of the dismal state it's been led into. I feel like I can see some struggles ahead and make out the shadows of a colossus or two, and while daunting I'd rather encounter them then stare from afar and wonder.

Plus there's this girl in Colorado and if things continue to progress I hope to move out there by next summer....I know, budget and budget some more then stick to.

**Spanking the baby because it has to breathe...**

Because I've never had to worry so much about income tax I want to make sure I've got this correct.

With the tax rates I've seen from 2015-2016 it looks like I'm set for $7,591.75 in income tax, with the standard deduction being around $6,350 I can count on the yearly net dropping to around 29,000 after paying for health insurance.

9,225 * .10 = 923

28,225 * .15 = 4,233.75

9,740 * .25 = 2,435

923 + 4,233.75 + 2,435 = 7,591.75

7,591.75 - 6,350 = 1,241.75

Does all that really come to $30,048.21?

Yearly net minus full price of current healthcare plan minus income tax
{ 36,807 - (459.81 * 12) } - 1,241.75 = 30,048.21

**It's s figuratively beautiful baby...**

(no *tldr* because you don't get the baby without the labor, ever)

Is my math correct, did I apply it properly?

Any perspective I'm oblivious too?

Anyone know if I can work 50 hours a week and not be eligible for company health coverage?

Did I waste all the time figuring and typing this?

Was any of it amusing?

personalfinance,"I'm trying to find a rental property, but I think its a scam?","My girlfriend found a house listed on Craigslist for $800/mo, 3 bedroom 2 bathroom 1,200 square foot house with a fireplace and big backyard. So she sends them an email and the guy replies later, saying that the realtor he was working with had screwed him over (somehow) and now he has taken the keys from them and he is gonna handle all of it himself. He said he was trying to sell the property but his job had him move to another state (California) and at this point he just wants someone to take care of the property for the 3 years that he will be gone. 

So, after some emails back and forth he sends us the applications which were basically written up himself on Word. What I found strange was that we did NOT provide any sort of personal identification aside from references/place of work/past rental history. So I assume there was no credit check. We send the applications back and he says they were approved and that he must handwrite the lease so it might take a few days to get it all typed up. 

So he's asking for $800/month, and $800 deposit. I've looked and the house is listed for sale on various realtor websites too. He encouraged us to go look at the house and look in the windows, look at the neighborhood, etc. He said once we sign the lease and pay that he will overnight the keys via FedEx and give us the receipt when he ships it out.


This is a very much ""too good to be true"" situation. He even mentioned all bills are paid except for trash. What can I do to assure myself that this isn't a scam? Should I call the realtor on the For sale sign outside the property? (He said the sign is still up only because he's out of the state). 

Is this a scam?

&amp;nbsp;


I am meeting with my tax adviser in a few days to see if she has any reservations, but I think you all are a wealth of knowledge who can also help. **Why should I not do this.** Here are the facts/things I like about it (still a WIP):

&amp;nbsp;


**What expenses qualify?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Tuition &amp; fees, books, supplies, and equipment (computers/software/peripherals)  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Room &amp; Board if half-time student **limited to actual cost or University's ""Cost of Attendance"" budget**  

**Who can contribute funds?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Anyone - family, friends, corporations, trusts, partnerships  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Checks or bank transfers, automatic paycheck withdrawal  

**Who controls the distributions/money?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*Account Owner; not the beneficiary  

**Can I have two beneficiaries on one 529?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* No, only one beneficiary per 529. Although there can be multiple 529's per beneficiary.  

**Who can the 529 be transferred too if not used by the beneficiary?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Relationship to the current beneficiary: sibling, step sibling, parent, step parent, niece/nephew, uncle/aunt, in-laws, first cousin.  

**What are the annual expenses?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Investment expenses, Program Management Fee, State Administrative Fee  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Index Equity Portfolio captures all expenses in the 0.17% expense ratio + $10 Account maintenance fee  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* $10,000 invested for 10 years ~$317 in expenses  

**What is the withdrawal penalty if not used for education?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* **Only applies to income earned, not principal invested**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* If used for non-qualified expenses then State &amp; Fed taxes + 10% penalty   
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* If beneficiary receives a scholarship, then withdrawal amount equal to scholarship. Pay taxes only, no penalty.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Withdraw funds from 529 in the same year of expenses or face penalties  

**Max contributions?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Annually - none. $14,000 limit for gift tax exclusion (per individual). $10,000 limit on IL tax deduction (aggregate all 529's)  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Total - $400,000. Good problem to have  

**Investment options/Changing?**  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Change portfolio mix twice a year and with new beneficiary for existing funds  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Currently change mix for new funds added  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;* Plenty of investment options with age-blended mix between equities and debt. Focus on equity index to maintain low expense ratio.  

**Frequency of beneficiary change?**

personalfinance,What to do with $26k gift from Grandfather when I graduate from grad school next year?,"Hello everyone,

I've read this for awhile now and never anticipated being in one of these situations, but here we are. 

I unexpectedly received about $26k from my Grandfather for a total of about $30k in my savings. I have no reason to splurge on anything because 1, I'm not really interested (considering I was living without these funds before) and 2, I am currently on clinical rotations for the next year on no salary. I would love to make this life changing amount of money grow, but I really have no idea where to begin. Some semantics:


1. I will graduate with about $19k in loans. All are subsidized with the highest interest rate being 4.6%. These loans were taken out so I could establish credit faster once I graduated. So I always had a plan to pay them with monthly payments of about $200/month. 

2. I will never want for work once I graduate in my field. Current entry level pay in this high demand, high supply, highly competitive area I am in is about $60-75k, with room for growth depending on the setting I work in. It's also common to pick up shifts on the weekend for some extra money. 

3. I plan to stay in this area for a couple years after graduation because that's where my roots and connections are and my field is incredibly established here. Eventually I will probably move closer to home where the costs of living are much lower. 

4. I am toying with the idea of spending some of the money to see said Grandfather in Europe between graduation and starting my first job. Both as a thank you because I have rarely seen him during my lifetime, and because after being in school for six years, I think it would be nice. 

So what do I do? Pay off all my loans immediately once grad school and my boards are over next June? Invest? Any advice would be immensely appreciated. 

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Carsalesman looked me in the eye with one number, put something completely different on the paper and had me sign it.","Update: After my trip to the dealer, he helped explain a couple things.
1. The $5000 price is the cash price, and due to financing reasons for high risk people like myself, he has to charge $6400 when financing through these second tier finance options.
2. The 15% interest rate that he said I qualified for would have been for newer, more expensive vehicles. I remember this being a thing from when I was talking with Capital One a few months ago. Seems to make sense.
After me going and being a bit upset, he helped me understand these things. He even threw in oil changes for the rest of athe year (a value for me, since I live in an apartment with a garage and drive 22000 miles a year.) Also, he said he would help me when it came time for maintenance, car inspection next year, and tires at a lower cost. Obviouisly I would shop any of his prices around, but all of these bonuses are definitely helpful.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Carsalesman looked me in the eye with one number, put something completely different on the paper and had me sign it.

Looking for general advice on how to handle this situation.

Wow. I really got swindled. I signed for a 2008 Mazda 3 i Touring that was listed on the dealers website as well as a couple third party sites as ""$4995"". I signed papers on it on 5-13-17. It is currently 5-21-17 It is a small dealership.

So I came in. Looked at the vehicle. One sales person asked me what I was looking for, I pointed at the Mazda. We chatted a bit, and I know I was gawking a bit and said ""This is a nice car for $5000"". The salesperson didn't dispute the price. I took it for a test drive with my BF. We liked the vehicle.

Came inside to talk to the finance guys. My plan was to go look at other cars, but I got sidetracked. Ended up running a credit check. I talked to the finance guy about the fact that part of my income is tip money and isn't include in my taxes or paystub, and he said he could work with me. I also told him I previously got a 25% interest rate quote, so I was worried about my credit. The guy runs the numbers through a finance company. He says something to this effect.. ""Hey man, this is pretty cool. So I know you have poor credit, and you got declined by all the banks, except this one finance company qualified you for 15%."" I was shocked. I chattered on for a minute or two my shock at getting 15% interest rate, and that was better than what I could have hoped for. He then said ""So they would require a downpayment of $1800, and your monthly payment will be $250 a month for 28 months."" He didn't say anything about the vehicle price, or any difference in interest rates. Obviously, I didn't do the match to see exactly what those numbers added up to. I felt secure in that he told me I got qualified for 15% interest rate and that the car was listed for $5000 online. I assumed the higher monthly payment came down to JUST the shortened loan period, nothing else.

Because of the better interest rate and the fact that they would work with my tips, I decided to go ahead and try to finish the deal that day. Got my insurance taken car off. Ended up giving him the down payment and signed for the papers. Took it home.

Fast forward to today, and I finally go over the paperwork and read it. I see that the interest rate is 24.95%, and the vehicle price is listed at $6399 + Taxes + title + registration + inspection fee. So it is 6399 + 529.07 in  fees.

So basically, this guy looked at me and said ""15% interest rate"", and no other number, and yet he put somehting totally different in the paperwork. The car is listed as 5000 online, but he put a totally different number in.

What can I do? Tomorrow will be day 10, and I am unsure of any protections exist in Texas for this. I was screwed $1400 on vehicle price, plus about $700 in extra interest.",finance

personalfinance,Would it be a good idea to take out a loan to pay off all current debts?,"I'm not extremely knowledgeable in the world of finance, but I was thinking about the possibility of taking out a loan that could pay off all of my current debts (roughly $8,000) instead of slowly paying off each loan month by month. 

My thinking is that if I only have to make this one payment a month, I could potentially pay a lot more towards the total debt without a bunch of separate interest rates each month, while still giving me some money to put in a savings account. It seems to me that it would be easier (and quicker) to pay off one sizable bill with a single interest rate than 4-5 smaller bills each with their own interest rate.

1. Be a good idea?
2. Be a possibility? (Would any bank or credit union approve a loan like this?)

personalfinance,"$297,578.82 in student loan debt, on PAYE plan with $65500 salary IT junior level job. I need to make decisions. Please help me.","Hi guys, I made this throwaway account to get some feedback on my situation. If there's ANYONE in my boat I'd love to hear how you are doing your financial planning.

tl;dr - I messed up. I want to repay at $10,000/mo so I'll be done with this loan in 3 years. Is it crazy? How can I do it? I have plans (end of this post) - is it doable? Any other suggestions?

------------------Long Form Explanation starts here--------------------

1. Background on the loan: 

Medical school. I graduated but did not enter residency, and realized I don't want to spend the rest of my life as a doctor.
I know I decided poorly, but hindsight is always 20/20. I had fun in the school, realized something I don't want to do in my life, and I consider it a good life experience. I know I made poor life decisions. But I try to think it as one last crazy thing I did before I reached the age where they aren't allowed. Please understand this when you want to comment how I made a mistake. I heard it plenty, I still hear it a lot. I am not gonna budge from my decision that I made the right choice to pivot back to being a software developer.

2. Now:

I was a computer science grad. I love programming.
I am back in that field, working as a junior level full-stack app developer in the healthcare IT sector. 
They offered a $65000 /yr salary. I got a 2% raise on top of that. 

My federal loan (all of it) repayment plan is Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE),
 where it's 10% of adjusted gross income(AGI), for 25 years.
Then, what's left is forgiven in terms of a gift. 
I have to pay tax for that ""gift"".

This year, since my AGI was so low, I didn't need to pay any monthly fee. I still pay $400/mo.

Interest alone is $1,656.14/mo, but I can't do it with my salary.

My family doesn't have any money. We get by by running a sort of a AirBnB business, and my mother works about 11 hours/day with no weekends off. We rented out all our rooms, so I sleep in the garage.
I chip in what I can for car insurance, cable Internet, etc. 

Monthly cash flow average:

income after tax: $3,649.76

- car expense: $400
- tithe: $510
- st. loan: $400 (which can increase to $1100)
- sundry/equipment/books/grocery/etc : $423
- utility (Internet): $106

total expense: $1,839

3. Goal:

I calculated that if I were to repay my loans in 3 years, I would have to pay about $10,000/mo back. 

4. Restrictions:

    a. I have to help my family, so I can't relocate.

    b. I want to start a business, because I think that has a likelihood of ramping up my repayment.
    
    c. After work, minus helping out in family business, leaves me about 3 hours every day, and maybe total 7 hours on weekends.

    d. I can't ask for raise as my company appears to be in the reds. We just had a massive layoff. Plus it's not like I will get anything above 10%, after reading about the norm.


**5. My decisions **

I need to create a multi-pronged approach to meeting my $10,000/mo debt repayment plan. 

1) Get a new job: I love my company, and the IT team - I learned a whole lot. But I believe with my skillset, I can be paid almost 70% more. 

2) Do side gigs: I did Upwork for the first time, and finished a task data-scraping LinkedIn. It took me a week, and about 15 hours, and I asked for $50, since I need reviews first in order to ramp up my game. I could do more as a data scraper, web page developer, etc. 

3) Start a business. I read tons of business books, and active in /r/entrepreneur, and I started two e-commerce companies but couldn't even launch them. High risk, but all I need is just one success. I just don't know where to start or if I can pull it off.

=====================
That's it. Thanks for reading. I would appreciate any tips/advice/hard-love, anything. I hate to look at my debt amount, but I even more hate the fact that I'm financially/socially paralyzed. I literally can't date anyone because of my situation - why cause pain to someone you care about? Better yet to just sulk alone..

personalfinance,"I'm 26, and just accepted a job outside the US. Now what to do with $20k in US savings, my car, and my earnings overseas?","After 2 years of living with my parents and working at a startup company post-college, I decided it was time to leave America behind and do some international travel. I ended up in Israel, doing a short internship at a large tech company, and when they offered me a job, I decided to accept. 

I'm very fortunate in that A) I have no debt, and B) the position I was offered has a comfortable salary (by US standards it isn't high, but by Israeli standards, it's incredible), so my cost of living is covered. I estimate I'll finish each month with a surplus of 4000-7000 NIS (roughly $1,110 - $2,000) after food, rent, taxes, healthcare, misc costs etc.

In addition, I have about $20,000 dollars in a US savings account from my time at the startup, and a car worth approximately $12,000 that's sitting at my family's house. 

So here's the big question: I don't intend to stay in Israel forever, maybe a couple more years. So what are my best options for the following:

- For my Israeli earnings, once I have an emergency fund built, is it best to simply keep them in an account here? Is it worth looking into investment options in Israel?

- For my US savings, I know I need to do something with them that will yield interest. My parents have offered to add the money to their investment fund (they're certainly not rich, but they're fairly frugal and careful with money) which is managed by a financial advisor and they say it's fairly diversified and the interest rate is probably better than that of an IRA. Would I be better taking them up on the offer or starting my own IRA or investment account? 

- At the moment, my car has fairly low costs. Registration is just $100 a year, and I've lowered the insurance to the lowest possible since nobody is driving it ($560 per year). Nevertheless, is it worth keeping for the next couple years, knowing that I would be using it when I move back to the US, or would I be better off selling it now and investing the money?

If transferring the visa's balance to the new card worthwhile given I can only make minimum payments for the near future? As soon as I have an income post-graduation I do plan on aggressively paying down all my CC debt before starting in on my student loans, but for now I'm on a limited income.

personalfinance,"I'd like to work over the summer, but am afraid of losing Financial Aid","Hello,

I'm a junior at a US university, and I'd like to use the free time during this summer to gain experience and earn money through freelancing (in web design/development). I've freelanced before, the previous summer, and earned a decent amount, but unfortunately my FAFSA Pell (Federal) and HESAA (New Jersey) grants were cut as a result. I was forced to pay much more for school than the previous years, effectively making the effort to earn money pointless (and there is no way I could earn enough to pay for school in total, without Financial Aid).

I understand that certain investments, such as the 401(k), are not taxed until they taken out, and used. **Are there similar such investments that could allow me to work over the summer without losing 50% of what I earn to Financial Aid? It's not important for me to be able to spend the money now; I wouldn't mind it being locked in some account.

I am currently 16 and have obtained my GED and started community college as an engineering major with plans to transfer to my state's school for my junior and senior year.

This grows at about 15% a year (on avg). After talking to the financial aid office, the 3k will cover most of my tuition costs for the first year, accruing just over 130 dollars of interest in 1 year.

I'm 25 years old, making about $80k base salary and making 401k contributions up to my employer match of 6%.

I have ~$25,000 worth of federal student loan debt (down from the $67k I graduated with two years ago) and **about $5,000 of that is 6.55% interest**; the rest is a mix of 4.2% and 3.5%.

I can borrow up to $10k from my 401k at **4% interest**, and pay it back over **12-60 months.** Currently the investments in the account are collectively earning between 6-7% annually (I based the mix of funds off of the guide in the wiki).

personalfinance,Advice on choosing the right bank for me and my fiance,"Looking to combine finances with my fiance - we're budgeting and planning for the future, and have already been sharing expenses for years now through separate accounts. Now we're looking to be smarter with our money. We've already started mapping out what we want and how to go about affording it, as well as mapping out our debts and prioritizing them based on amount and interest rate.

For banking, I currently use a combination of BoA for checking (free with direct deposit), and a credit union for savings. The credit union doesn't really have much in the way of perks, other than that it's been a little tougher for me to access, making me think about my purchasing decisions a bit more. She uses a smaller bank that was in her hometown, but it's a good ways away, and the only perk it offers is ATM reimbursement.

What banks would you suggest we look at? We'd like to make our money work for us a bit, gaining interest and all, but whatever we can get with minimal to no risk (say a minimum balance of no more than $2k). We're open to online only banks. List of requirements:

* Minimal to no risk
* Accruing interest (checking only or checking + savings)
* Online/mobile banking (with mobile check deposit)
* ATM reimbursement (or just a high amount of ATMs in my area, about 30 minutes north of Boston, MA)

We've looked into local banks, as well as credit unions, but the ones nearby don't satisfy the requirements.

Ally Bank seems to be a good option - savings accounts with a 1.05% interest rate for any balance. Does anyone have experience with that? Or suggestions as to otherwise?

personalfinance,Use of Residency Relocation Loans for a US Medical Student with significant credit card debt,"I am in a bit of a conundrum. I am an third year medical student soon to be fourth year, and I am up to my eyeballs in credit card debt for various reasons. I have about $20,000 all total. 

So I had a few questions.

Are residency relocation loans a good idea?

Can I use them to pay off credit cards (legally speaking)?

Will they affect federal financial aid (I am still on Unsubsidized Stafford loans)?

My budget is under control now and I am not accumulating any more credit card debt. My plan is to get a relocation loan as soon as I get my next financial aid check, then use it to pay off the credit cards. Then lock all of them away except my travel card, which I will use for residency travel. This would give me the necessary resources for residency interviews, get the high interest credit card debt out from over my head, and give me time to save up and pay off the relocation loans in residency.

Does this sound reasonable?

personalfinance,Need to slightly goose credit score for mortgage. Personal loan or 401K loan to pay credit card off?,"Thanks in advance for your advice. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a rather modest first home, although we live in an expensive city. My credit score varies between 719 and 747 depending on where I look (all from various credit card-provided FICO scores). We need a 740 for the best interest rate from my credit union. Wife has no debt and her credit score is high enough to not matter for this discussion.

I have no missed payments on anything, no collections etc., but I am carrying a lot of debt. About $20k credit card debt, all 0 interest that I've been rolling over from a little personal crisis a few years ago. Instead of paying it off quickly, I've invested the money in diversified index funds (retirement account contributions) and done quite well. I also have about $200K in student loans, with fairly low monthly payments (IBR). I'm about half-way to getting these discharged through public service loan forgiveness. (Let's ignore last Friday's proposed bill to scrap PSLF for the time being. :) ) My job is 99.99% stable and secure: I'm a niche technical expert with strong union protections and my organization has never laid anyone off.

Okay, so decision time: I'd like to jump squarely above the 740 mark. If I give myself a loan against my retirement account, I pay no interest (except to myself), although I lose the opportunity value of those invested dollars. I've been planning to use this money to help with the down-payment. This type of self-loan doesn't appear on my credit report, according to my plan administrator. Alternatively, I can also give myself a personal loan from my CU at about 6.5% interest. My understanding is that, as an installment loan, this would appear as a lower risk on my credit score than the CC debt. In either case, I'd take the money, pay off the 0 interest CC debt, and actually be worse off from a strictly financial perspective. My only goal from this maneuver is to be securely above 740.

Aside from uncertainty about my credit score, we're otherwise ready to pull the trigger on the home purchase. I can comfortably throw $500 / month at the credit debt (as I have been) without compromising other important goals (health savings account, retirement, etc). Waiting until next year to purchase is an option but not one we like since our future neighborhood has a bunch of major (think multi-billion dollar) attractions opening in the fall and is probably going to become more popular.

FWIW we make enough that DTI won't be an issue for the home purchase we're considering and my CC utilization is about 20%.

TLDR: what's the best way, if any, to slightly goose my credit score by playing with debt classifications, i.e. giving myself a personal loan or 401K loan to pay down the 0% interest CC debt?",finance
personalfinance,Does cosigning appear twice on a future co-applicant loan?,"Sorry if the title doesn't make sense!  Here is my situation:

Since they will be pooling our DTI's, will that car loan show up once or twice?

Of course the obvious logical answer is that it would just show up once because it's a single loan and both cosigned parties are also cosigning for the mortgage.

personalfinance,How far can collections agencies go?,"This is a throwaway, for obvious reasons.

TL; DR: The state of Georgia (US) engaged a collections agency to collect $10k+ in state income taxes and penalties from 2005 (that’s 2005, not 2015), which I paid long ago but no longer have proof of payment.

My questions are:
-	Do I need to dispute the charge with the collections agency or can I just stay quiet?
-	Can the agency garnish my wages? (FYI, I’m a contractor with a company up north although I live in FL)
-	Can the agency reach into my bank account and just pull the funds out? (A similar situation mistakenly happened to me)

DETAILS
I lived in Georgia (US) in 2005 and left in 2008 or so. From there I moved around the US, eventually landing in Florida. In the fall of 2016, I decided to buy a place and finally checked my credit report in preparation for getting a loan.

(Side note: Yes, I realize that I should be checking my credit report at least yearly but it had never been an issue since I’d essentially been renting everywhere until I got my current place. Also, given that my only debt has been credit card debt (that’s always paid off monthly), finding out my credit score has never been something that I’m concerned about.)

Unfortunately, my report showed that GA had levied a tax lien against me in 2009, saying that I hadn’t paid my 2005 state income taxes. I found out this information after making a call -- a call that I now regret -- to the tax folks in GA after seeing my report.

(Another side note: I always pay my taxes. Many years ago, my father passed along some words of wisdom that I’ve taken to heart: “If you have to pay taxes, that means you have the money to pay them. Pay your taxes.” I think he was primarily talking about income taxes, not property taxes or anything else along those lines but, because of his advice and because I really don’t want to argue with the tax man, I pay my taxes. Always.)

While I have all of my returns from 2000 forward, I don’t have the cancelled checks or bank statements as I shredded that excess paper years ago. And of course, this was before banks regularly transmitted those statements electronically. I recently checked with my bank but they only keep those records around for 7 years so no luck there.

I decided to just let the lien sit there since, other than getting a mortgage, there didn’t seem to be any other negative effects (I ended up buying my place in cash because I had to move relatively quickly to get my place, more quickly than it would’ve taken to clear up the issue). Whatever damage done to my credit score seemed to be already done.

Unfortunately, that phone call I made seemed to have stirred up the hornet’s nest and GA has recently sent my bill to a collections agency who recently contacted me. I have a couple of weeks left to respond or else, according to them, I accept that I owe this debt. Which, of course, I don’t accept.

So, my questions are:
-	Do I need to dispute the charge with the collections agency or can I just stay quiet? (I’m guessing it would be better to dispute at this point.)
-	Can the agency garnish my wages? (FYI, I’m 1099 with a company up north although I live in FL)
-	Can the agency reach into my bank account and just pull the funds out? (A similar situation mistakenly occurred to me. I was working for a state-related entity out west in 2010 but left midway through the year. In 2013, this western state penalized me for not paying 2011 taxes and reached into my bank account and removed funds without notifying me. I contacted them, proved I’d been out of state for a couple of years at that point, and they refunded me.)

I can’t definitively prove I paid my 2005 GA state taxes, other than to show a pattern of behavior of always paying my state, federal, or otherwise taxes.

Any thoughts or suggestions appreciated.

I just bought a brand new Honda CR-V in April. The total cost was $28,500. I got approved for a 4% interest rate, so we will end up paying a little over $3,000 in interest if we paid it through the full 72 month loan.

Our dog had health emergencies we put on a card, and other things between jobs, and for grad school expenses.

personalfinance,Extra mortgage payments to drop PMI vs more retirement savings,"Throwaway account because I don't want my explicit financial details easily findable on my main. 

My partner and I just bought a house with a conventional mortgage. $550k loan for a $630k house. (We live in the Bay Area so that's not as extravagant as it sounds.) PMI is about $190/mo. Interest rate is 4.35%. 

I contribute to my 401k up to the match percentage and max out my Roth IRA every year. My partner is planning to do the same. However, we could put less money towards the Roths and instead aggressively pay down our mortgage so that PMI drops off faster (which we can do when we've hit 20% equity according to our loan officer). 

Neither of us has any debt (other than the mortgage) and we have a healthy emergency fund, so that's not a concern. However, we can't throw extra at the mortgage *and* max out our Roths unless we want to develop a taste for ramen. And if we could do both, the question would then be, ""extra mortgage payments or more 401k contributions?""

I know that it's typically more efficient to invest money rather than paying off a mortgage faster since 7% returns in the stock market are better than the 4% interest you're paying on the mortgage, and tax-advantaged accounts are even better.

The interest rate i'd get on my vehicle due to the year should be around 3%. My current car payment is $225 and when i called in and got a quote it put the estimated payment to be around $200 for the car payment after the refi.

If I put all he additional towards my students loans it'll drop the total I owe from 21k to around 16k which should put my payment in the $180 range(My rough estimate without doing the math including interest) sO in doing this I should roughly save about 85$ per month.

personalfinance,Nearing the end of graduate school and looking to plan for the future,"I’ve been aimlessly wandering, financially speaking, until last year when my roommate clued me in on the concept of investing in a Roth IRA. Since then I’ve been slowly learning more about personal finance through this subreddit and other online forums and pamphlets (“If You Can” was super helpful). 

I now realize how lucky I was to have benefited from financial aid in my undergrad, which let me go into graduate school with no student loans. So, since last year I’ve maxed out my Roth IRA contributions for ’15-’17. But since I’m a grad student, I don’t have the option to invest in a 401k, and I’ll probably be a student at least until this time next year. 

**This leaves me with ~$30k in the bank, and I want to try and find something more constructive with that money.** I have no interest in buying a house – all the property where I live is insanely expensive. Also, I’m going to be doing a post-doc after grad school so it’s unclear where I'll be living in the next 3-4 years. 

I can’t think of other near-term expenses so I considered opening a brokerage account to put my money into Vanguard index funds, similar to how I have my Roth set up. But the more I’m reading, the more difficult it seems to navigate having mixed tax-advantaged and taxable accounts and keeping everything tax-efficient **(am I wrong about that?)**. So now I’m strongly leaning towards finding high yield savings/checking accounts to keep my money in until I have a job that allows me to contribute to a 401k. 

**I’ve researched a lot of different options and wanted to lay out some of my thinking here to see what advice I might get.** 

**My Plan A**: Switch from BoA to an Alliant checkings/savings to benefit from the 0.75%/1.05% APY. I am somewhat worried about being able to easily access my money, going from a big bank to a credit union, so I’m also thinking of opening a Charles Schwab Investor’s Checking Account. I would especially like to hear from people about services I might lose by switching to a CU, and ways to mitigate the inconvenience. Also hoping to hear advice on how to smoothly close my BoA accounts and transition to my new bank/CU.

In addition to Alliant, I was also considering the following accounts:

* **Ally Bank** (0.1%/1.05% APY for checking/savings): Turned off by their past as GMAC and their repeat issues with the Fed stress tests
* **CapitalOne360** (0.1%/1% APY for checking/savings): No cons as far as I can see, except for the lower rates
* **AMEX Personal Savings** (0.95% APY): No cons except the lower rate, and the lack of customer experiences reported online
* **BankPurely** (0.75%/1.3% APY for checking/savings): Seems way too new to trust, even has some typos on the website. Those rates are nice though 

**I’ve also been intrigued by these really high APY “Rewards” checking accounts from credit unions in Michigan.** I’ve been wondering if it might make sense to keep the max amount in those accounts and treat it like a savings account. However, it seems like there might be frustrating transaction requirements – so I was hoping to hear from anyone who has experience with these accounts. How do you integrate them into the rest of your banking ecosystem? 

* **Lake Michigan Credit Union Max Checking Account** (3% APY, $15k limit)
* **Consumer’s Credit Union Free Rewards Checking Account** (4.59% APY, 20k limit)
* **Northpointe Bank Rewards Checking** (5% APY, 10k limit) 

Is there a catch I’m not understanding with these accounts? Why do these even exist? I don’t understand how they make sense from the CU’s perspective.

Advice on saving and general finances.,"I been working for about 2 months , just a retail job that pays $8 an hour ($200-$250 every 2 weeks after taxes) I save about 40% of my paycheck and the other 60% is general things I spend over the 2 weeks (clothes, movies, etc).

personalfinance,"Moving across the country and starting my first real job soon, trying to figure out how all this works.","I'm 21 years old and just graduated from college. Later this summer I will be moving across the country and starting my first real job. I've been going through the excellent wiki on this subreddit to try to figure out how I'm supposed to be spending my money, how to save for retirement, how taxes work, how budgeting works, etc. Mainly I'm just trying to figure out what living ""within my means"" actually means for me. 

I was hoping someone on here could go through the numbers with me to make sure I'm not making any terrible mistakes. I realize this is a lot of text, so I've bolded my specific questions. Any advice beyond those questions is also much appreciated.

I guess I should start with the numbers: 

I have no student loans or other debts. I have a decent credit score (&gt; 700) because I used a credit card for my daily expenses throughout college and paid it off completely monthly. My company's health insurance plan has $0 deductible with $10 / visit copay and out of pocket maximum of $1500 / year. I have $6k in the bank. This will be my first real job.

My base salary will be $107k per year with a 10% expected bonus, $25k sign on bonus, $10k relocation bonus, and $110k of RSUs vested over four years (25% each year). This brings my total first year compensation to about $173k, but I'm going to plan according to just my $107k base salary and treat the rest as extra (**for savings? investment?** I don't know). My company will match 50% of my 401k contributions up to 7% of my salary.

First, I thought it would be a good idea to figure out how much money I'm actually taking home after paying taxes and maxing out my 401k contribution (**is maxing it out even a good idea?**).

    base = $107,000
    401k = $18000
    exempt = $10,400
    taxable = base - 401k - exempt = $78,600
    tax = $5,226.25 + 0.25*(taxable-$37,950) = $15,388.75
    
    posttax = base - 401k - tax = $73,611.25
    monthly = posttax / 12 = $6,134.27

This means my monthly take-home money after federal income tax and 401k contribution is just over $6k, so I need to fit all my monthly expenses into that. My state does not have a state income tax. **Did I calculate right? Did I miss any other taxes?**

After that, I tried to calculate how much I would spend every month to live the lifestyle I want to live. I've never really bought groceries, utilities, healthcare, or anything like that before so I have no idea if these numbers are accurate. **Do they seem like reasonable numbers?**

 - I already know my rent will be $2150 / month. Renters insurance will be $30 / month. I think $1400 / month should cover other essentials like groceries ($250) + utilities ($200) + internet ($80) + clothing ($300) + Uber/Lyft ($500). My employer provides lunch and dinner on weekdays so groceries only need to cover weekends. I don't plan on getting a car; I will walk to work every day. That puts the essentials at about $3600 / month.

 - After that, I give myself a ""tech"" budget of about $1000 / month. This will go to stuff like computer parts, TV, speakers, phone, tablet, game consoles, etc. Usually I will save part or most of it for larger tech purchases.

 - Entertainment subscriptions like Netflix, HBO Now, etc will be about $100 / month. This is easy to calculate since I already pay this.

 - Social activities like eating out, bars, etc can get $250 a month. I'm afraid I'm lowballing this since that would only cover like two visits to the bar back in college, but I don't think I'll be drinking as much I did in college.

 - $2250/year or $187/month for domestic travel like going to see friends in other cities, traveling to see that eclipse in August, etc.

 - I'd also like to budget for a larger overseas vacation every other year. I'm guessing a two-week overseas trip would cost about $10k, or about $415 per month for a trip every other year.

Of course, some of the non-essential stuff (overseas travel, tech, etc) will be replaced with funding an emergency fund for the first few months. I'm thinking I'll target about a $25k emergency fund. **Is that too much?**

First month costs like furniture and the like will be covered by my relocation and sign-on bonus. Anything left over will be tossed into the emergency fund.

This brings my total monthly expected spending to $5600 / month. Fortunately, that's less than the $6100 I have available. I'm sure that extra $500 or so will be needed for anything I forgot to count here. **Is there anything obvious that I've missed? Is there any number up there that seems too low or too high? Any other important expenses, insurances, etc that I don't know about?**

**How do you recommend actually building and executing a budget? Should I use something like Mint or YNAB?**

**What can I do with my annual bonus and RSUs? What should I do with any surplus money?** Investing sounds like a good idea, but I'm not sure how much I should invest, whether it's too risky to put too much in there, I don't know.

**Is there any other general advice you can give me and anyone else just starting out on their ""adult"" lives?**

Finally, I'd like to say thanks for the excellent wiki you have on this subreddit. There's so much good information on there and I've learned a lot, especially from [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).",finance

I am trying to find ways to reduce my $160k (other things) debt and I know with on time payments Home Loan Modifications will pay lump sums to your principle. we already got them for my fathers loan.

Can I do it again? or should I say as the new owner ""can I"" now refinance under home loan modification and gain those benefits? IE is the home loan modification per house/loan or per person? restarting this in my name might also reset at the lower interest rates which will be even more of my monthly payments to the principle balance.

devops,Dockerized CI alternatives to (Dockerized) Jenkins,"I recently deployed a Jenkins CI server, it's just a single master in a docker container with no Jenkins agents. It currently uses it's own Docker binaries but I mapped the docker sock using volumes for DooD. Each repo it pulls has a Jenkins pipeline file and relevant Dockerfiles (multi stage build, deploy, and testing in separate images). 

Provisioning the Jenkins master is largely done through the Dockerfiles but config, etc. Is stored using the SCM plugin, plugins are fed in via plugins.txt.

I'm not pleased with this setup because although it does work, it seems odd to use SCM as basically a database. Not to mention it felt super hackish to get Jenkins running in Docker and run pipeline stages in other Dockers.

Also not hugely important but I'm a sucker for modern UI and although blue ocean looks nice it's janky to walk in and out of that interface.

Has anyone else had luck with hosting your own dockerized CI? And if so which ones was the simplest and easiest from an immutable infrastructure standpoint and having agent / builds running in dockers?

I see docker.io and Concourse look like 2 good options although I see docker.io is in release preview and Concourse requires BOSH for deployment? Don't have any experience with BOSH.

**EDIT** Looks like 3 good options to look into are:

- Gitlab CI (deployed on Kubernetes possibly, not sure SaaS is an option)
- Drone.io (just assuming this can be deployed on Kubernetes, because it's all Docker)
- Concourse (BOSH for big orchestration, but can use Rancher per u/emcniece, potentially just docker-compose)?",technology
personalfinance,$77k student debt at 8% interest. Need advice.,"Same old story. I was 18, my parents and I signed some papers so that I could get an expensive education and get out of their hair for most of the year. Graduated in 2012, I've been paying for about 4 years, and my balance has increased $5k. Soul crushing stuff. 

I'm on an extended, graduated repayment plan, meaning my payment term is pushed out to 30 years and I start off by making smaller payments. In the beginning this was about $415 / month and will eventually reach $1352 / month in the final two years. 

The twist is all of this debt is in my father's name (Parent PLUS Loan). He has, or at least had, terrible credit because he's bad with money, hence the absurd interest rate on these loans. My parents are divorced, neither makes much money, and so I feel morally obligated to pay this loan, despite no legal obligation.

My initial strategy was to pay as little as possible early and time out the loans (basically, my dad dies and it's discharged. Great way to live). However, I realized that I'm already $20k in the hole and if my 64 year old father lives a long life, that would mean paying 3x what I borrowed.

Now that I'm making quite a bit more than I was in 2012, it's possible for me to pay off this loan in 7 more years, but it will mean I can't contribute much to my retirement in the short term. I have other debts and obligations (car lease, smaller student loans in my name). Trying to downgrade my lifestyle, but I already live quite frugally... I know I probably can't beat 8% growth in the market, so it would generally be wiser to pay off the debt, but this just feels like a gamble.

What might you do in my shoes? Pay off the debt as quickly as possible, or bet on its discharge and pay as little as possible?",finance

personalfinance,Trading in 2 cars for one: the story of our underwater adventure​.,"So in the last year my boyfriend and I (we've been living together for 2 years) have both gotten new jobs where we don't need cars to commute. We use public transit that costs us $2/mo through our employer. We rent, and live in an area where we're paying for parking. ($50/mo per vehicle). 

Our current situation is this: 
His car: Owes $6890 it needs about $1200 in repairs to be in reliable working order over the next 3 months (new tires, brakes, alignment, oil change, and there is a strange new knock) he purchased it 3 years ago at a rather high 8.5% interest rate. Monthly payment of $315, $75 for insurance. 

My car: I owe $14,900 on a car in perfect working order. However, I rarely drive it because neither of us particularly care for the way the car drives. Interest rate of 3.19% Monthly payment of $309, $50 for insurance monthly. 

What we're thinking about doing: trading in both cars for a combined pay of from the dealership of $19,500. That leaves is $2380 underwater between the two vehicles. Looking at a brand new car in the  I amount of $25,500, which is $2000 less than the MSRP. We would end up financing over MSRP if we financed in our underwater loans. Plus taxes and fees. This would leave us with a single monthly payment of around $450 with a 3.1% interest rate. Insurance would be $60/mo. 

I feel like a crazy person over this. Part of me knows that lower monthly payments and a car that we both like and would be reliable seems ideal. Part of me can't wrap my head around going deeper into debt, even if my monthly payments are lower. 

We don't want to sell either vehicle private party, we've been trying for a couple months and there are just too many weirdos on Craigslist and the consignment lot where I've had my car parked for a month has had little interest. 

If your still reading this, you're a saint and I'd appreciate any feedback.

personalfinance,Kill off school loans or try for moderate investment gains?,"I'm a 38 year old computer scientist with no good excuses for how poorly I've handled money in my life. The gist? Poor impulse control, some financially self-destructive periods, lots of credit card debt over the years, and a couple of divorces along the way that left things pretty slim and dismal for long periods of time. 

A number of years ago I got out of credit card debt completely and have no outstanding debt other than my remaining school loans, which totals around $55k at 3.5%. I've owned and sold a home, but am currently renting. I have no retirement money to speak of put aside, but also no children or any long-term financial goals beyond stability and the ability to retire with a modicum of comfort at some point in the far future. I'm aware that I'm rather late to the game here, but my needs are modest these days and so I'm hopeful that I can get myself on track.

I landed a lucrative contract-to-hire gig about a year ago that allowed me to squirrel away a decent chunk of change -- around $60k -- which is enough to pay off my school loans and was my primary intent for saving so much. That contract arrangement turned into a full-time thing and I am making an excellent salary and am continuing to try to improve my financial habits. Better late than never, I suppose.

In any case, the reason I'm posting is because now that the time has finally come to pull the trigger and pay off the rest of my student loan debt -- something I've wanted to do for years -- I'm finding myself a little reluctant. Mostly because I want to make sure that this is the wisest thing to do financially -- so I figured I should ask because I'm the first to admit that I (obviously) don't really know so much good financial decisions.

A friend of mine suggested that instead of paying off the loans, I invest the pile of cash into something low- to medium-risk, as the gains I would get from that over paying off the school loans would likely still have me coming out ahead and letting my money work for me. I think I buy that argument if the numbers actually work out -- the sidebar info said the rule of thumb is that &lt; 4% interest rate might be okay to let ""drag out."" However, I'm also aware that there are some intangible psychological aspects of being successfully and completely out student loan debt that are very compelling to me, given my troublesome history with money management and debt.

**TL;DR**: I have $60k available. Should I kill off my school loans immediately ($55k @ 3.5%) and be debt-free, continue to chip away at them via minimum payments while investing the $60k, or take some kind of hybrid approach?",finance

They cover my rent/car payments, along with $150 a week for food/allowance, all so that I can focus on school. But let me tell you, during the semester, I'm an absolute slave to the school system.

personalfinance,Early distribution from IRA to pay consumer debt,"Hello everyone, 

I realize this action may to counter to what most would consider prudent financial management, but I'd like some help in determining if I should take an early distribution from one of my IRA's to pay down some consumer debt I have accrued. This is not intended to be a discussion of my lifestyle choices, how I should alter my lifestyle to reduce my consumer debt, or anything pertaining to that. I would like to discuss this issue only, as I am currently considering it as a quick way to de-lever. This consumer debt is affecting my ability to build a savings and emergency fund, something I would like to begin to prioritize, and I would like to relieve myself of the stress of this hanging over my head. 

Here is my situation:

* I have $5,100 sitting on a 0% APR Balance Transfer Credit Card with approximately 12 months remaining on the introductory 0% APR period. Each month, I dedicate what I can to making payments towards that card; anywhere from $150-$300. At this rate, I will not be able to pay the entire balance by the end of the introductory period and this payment is affecting my ability to build a savings and emergency fund. 

* I have $1500 in a savings account that I would like to continue growing and would like to leave completely alone.

* I have approx. $4600 in a custodian account with Fidelity after leaving a previous employer. The amount did not qualify to stay in my employer's 401k plan and I have not yet rolled the amount into an IRA. I have a 401K that I actively contribute to with my current employer and another IRA from my first job out of college. Collectively, these accounts sum to more than the custodian account. 

* My projected gross income for 2017 is $67,447, less my contributions to my 401K totalling $2023. In 2017, I will take the personal expemtion &amp; standard deduction, totalling $10,350 (under 2016 tax rules) &amp; the max student loan interest deduction of $2,500. My adjusted gross income, before taking a distribution, would be $52,574.

* My projected federal income tax payments for 2017 are $10,520. 

* If I were to take the distribution from my IRA, totalling $4684, my adjusted gross income would climb to $57,258. Obviously, this would be subject to a 10% early withdraw penalty &amp; additional income tax. Using the 2017 tax bracket to make an estimate of my tax burden, I would be subject to $10,053 in federal income tax plus $468 in the 10% early withdraw penalty.  Using these estimates, coincidentally, my total tax burden due to early distribution would be $10,521, so I would have to write the federal government a check for $1. 


I'm looking for determine if I am thinking through these estimates logically, as well as if my estimates are correct. I need to relieve myself of this consumer debt that I accrued due to some poor financial decisions in my early life after moving away from home. What has happened has happened and I need to take action to rectify that and set myself up for the future. This seems like the most immediate &amp; effective action I can take, but I am open to dissenting opinions as to why this is not the proper action. I would like to not have to write the federal government a check some tax season, but if I stick to my budgeted plan, I will have more than enough savings to buffer for that. Obviously, I am sacrificing the long-term earnings that this cash could make if it were to be invested, but I am comfortable with that for the immediate effect if will have on my financial well-being.

technology,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.",technology
personalfinance,Getting married - taking on student loan debt,"Hello all, long time lurker, first time poster in PF.

personalfinance,Earning money over the summer without losing Financial Aid?,"Hello,

*I made a similar post a few days ago. I apologize for the seeming duplicate, but perhaps I can rephrase the question to be more effective.*



I'm a junior at a US university, and I rely on Financial Aid - namely, the Pell (Federal) and HESAA (NJ state) grants - to help me pay for school. I'd like to use the free time during this summer to gain experience and earn money through freelancing (in web design/development). However, after I earned money by freelancing during the previous summer (around $5,000 - $6,000 in total), a **portion** of my Financial Aid for the next school year was cut (about $1,500). I have confirmed with my Financial Aid office that the earnings were the cause. As a result of this, I am concerned that I risk again losing a portion of my Financial Aid for the future school year, if I earn money over this summer.

I have two questions based on the above:

1. I understand that due to recent changes, the Financial Aid received for a given year is now determined based on earnings and assets from 2 years prior. If this is the case, and I manage to graduate in 2 years or less, then the money I earn this summer will should never affect my Financial Aid eligibility, correct?

2. I believe I read that there is a certain amount that the student is eligible to earn annually without it affecting his Financial Aid eligibility. Does anyone know where I can find a reference to this?

3. If I or my parents opened a 529 savings plan now, and I were to deposit all the money I earn into the account, would it be considered when determining my Financial Aid eligibility? Furthermore, what would happen to the leftover money in the account once all my school expenses were covered; would there be a penalty in taking it out?


*Other relevant info:* I'm currently live in NJ with my parents, and am classified as a dependent.

personalfinance,HOUSING: Is this too much condo for us?,"My husband and I live in SoCal, one of the hardest housing markets to get into. We'd really like to own to immune ourselves from the always rising rental prices, and condos in the area seem relatively reasonable right now...for the area, I'd like to emphasize. Overall it's still ridiculous.

Roughly, our combined yearly income is 83k gross. It's actually probably a little higher than that since he works a lot of overtime, but we don't want to calculate that in, as it's undependable/unpredictable. 

We both have excellent credit. I'm in the 820s, he's in the 760s or so. We've been approved for an FHA loan of up to 450k, which seems like a ridiculously high amount considering our income, but, there you have it. We also don't want to get close to touching that 450k ceiling in order to keep our costs down.

We're interested in a condo in our current city, asking price 365k. With the standard 3.5% down, insurance, taxes, and HOA fees (I know, stupid, but stand alone houses in our area are WAY out of our price range), we figure we'd be paying $2400-$2600 a month, according to the mortgage calculators we've found online. I'm also thinking we could have the lender pay the MIP if we opted to have a slightly higher interest rate on the loan.

Other debt: he has no recurring debt to speak of, some credit cards he pays off in full every month. I am making payments on my car ($316.48 per month at 0.9% interest), and I owe about $5500 at 10.9% on a personal loan I got from Discover to consolidate my credit cards (whose APRs were considerably higher than the loan). Minimum payment on that per month is $213, but there's no early pay off fee if we wanted to pay that off. His car is paid off, and he pays his car insurance yearly, so no recurring amount taken out per month. My dad is paying my car insurance for the time being. 

There are no student loans (yet, husband is considering going back to school), and no other debt to speak of. 

Based on my calucations: roughly $6912.54 per month, - $2400 mortgage (with taxes, insurance and HOA included), - $530ish for my car payment and loan payment = $3982.54 left over per month. Can that be right? Or am I missing something major?

personalfinance,20yo college student with recent passing of mother &amp; incoming overseas inheritance,"Hey everyone. I've been following /r/personalfinance for about two years now and it's vastly improved my financial life. I've had some intense events happen over the course of the last year and it'd be nice to see if you all could help me out. This will be a long read, but any helpful responses will be greatly appreciated. All amounts are in USD unless otherwise mentioned.

**Profile**

I'm a rising third-year undergraduate college student in Raleigh, North Carolina. 

I have two credit cards: WF Student Credit (that I'll be changing to Cash Wise in August), and Discover It Student Credit. I've had both cards for about a year, and I have been fortunate to avoid building up credit card debt.

I have one checking account (WF), and one savings account (Ally with 1.05% APY). Between both of these, I have about $100 but I will be working this summer and making about $2.5k.

I live in a low-income household, and am thus eligible for maximum grants and loans from my FAFSA (including Pell Grants, and Stafford &amp; Perkins loans). As of today, I have been fortunate enough to only need to take out $8k in student loans. I recently opened a Vanguard Roth IRA to start saving early for retirement. More on this later.

I don't own a vehicle.

**Situation**

The day before last Christmas Eve (2016), my mother passed away from leukemia. She lived and worked in the United States for about 30 years as a hotel general manager for a well-known company, but moved to her hometown in Brazil and lived there for the last ten years, where she passed. She was a hard worker and very successful in her field, and thus my older brother (26) and I will be receiving a healthy inheritance from her work in Brazil. We have a lawyer and a cousin working on our behalf to finish up the estate process there now (this process is called an ""inventory"" in Brazil, I'm not entirely sure if the same terminology is used here). Part of my mother's estate includes an apartment in Belo Horizonte, and my brother and I have decided to sell it since neither of us live in Brazil and are able to maintain it. The estimated profit from this is included in the overall estimate mentioned in the following paragraphs.

The inventory process has *not* been finished, and should be done by the end of June if not by the end of the summer, at which point we plan to be paying any lawyer fees and transferring the money over to our respective accounts in the United States.

As it stands, we're expecting to receive an estimate of slightly over BRL $1m between the both of us (slightly over USD $300k total). This won't be divided evenly: since I'm under 21, a portion of that is a monthly pension which will make up about 2% the overall inheritance. In other words, 52% of this inheritance will go to myself, and 48% will go to my older brother.

Despite the fact that I'm much younger than my brother, I'm pretty well-versed in financial management so far and I've been unofficially assigned the tasks of managing, tracking, and communicating all of the goings-on with the inventory process and inheritance.

This situation, aside from the tremendous emotional challenge, has introduced a number of complicated questions, including:

- **How do I transfer this money to the US?** I've looked into direct bank wiring options, and this is supposed to cost around USD $1,500 at the most in fees for the full transfer of $300k (this isn't terrible, but if a cheaper option is available, that would be ideal). Other options that I've found don't look promising as far as minimizing fees goes.

- **When do I transfer this money to the US?** For example, over the last few days the BRL&lt;&gt;USD exchange rate has gone down significantly. From what I've researched, predicting or timing exchange rates is not recommended, but maybe you all have different thoughts about this. Additionally, we will need to be pay our lawyer and cousin (who is serving as our legal representative) at the end of the inventory process. Is it better to transfer all the money we've received so far into the United States to build interest in a savings account here, and then pay them from here when the inventory is finished? Or is it better to leave the money sitting in Brazil, accruing minimal interest, and transfer it all over once the inventory has finished? While there may be significant costs and inconvenience involved in transferring money back and forth, this should be offset by the interest we could be earning on the money while it's in the United States.

- **How do I go about finding out if my mother had a life insurance/retirement account in the United States?** She worked and was very successful in her career while she lived here, but since she lived in Brazil for the last ten years, we haven't found any documentation about American retirement/life insurance policies in her paperwork. I've been able to get access to her TransUnion credit report, but nothing that I'm looking for is mentioned there. In Brazil, the inventory process goes through the federal and local governments and basically results in a print-out of all services and accounts under an individual's estate (based on her social security number). Here, I haven't been able to find a similar process, and I've instead been told to reach out to individual organizations to acquire this information. Social security has said they can't assist me, and the hotel company she worked for is an international company with terrible US customer service which has been unresponsive despite multiple attempts to contact them. I do have ten translated and legally recognizable death certificates provided by the United States Embassy in Brazil, but that's all I have as far as relevant paperwork goes. We can't afford an attorney at the moment, and I've been told that most of what an attorney can do are things I can do on my own. Additionally, since she lived in Florida while living in the United States, local attorneys won't be helpful (since I live in NC). Are life insurance/retirement policies canceled once someone leaves a company or transfers to an overseas branch? I don't know how any of this works.

- **What do I do with the money (roughly USD $160k)?** I've read the Windfall wiki page a few times, in addition to many of the other ones (retirement, credit cards, etc.). This has led me to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard (they are letting me deposit the funds later). I have no idea what I'm doing on their website, but I will be spending lots of time figuring it out once the inheritance comes in (and continuing to reference the wiki while doing so). I plan on depositing the full amount available for me to deposit this year and allocating some for next year into this account (~$5.5k each, $11k total). My father has asked for $30k each from my brother and I, and he's guilting me into giving it to him because he ""would do the same for us."" However, he never asked my mother for money after their divorce (in fact, he was too prideful and angry and actually returned her child support payments), and it's unfair that he's trying to get money out of her death. I plan on giving him some of it ($10k), but not the full amount he's asking for. My brother will likely be doing the same.
I also plan on putting $7k of it into an emergency fund, to account for roughly six months of spending.
This leaves about $28k of my inheritance already allocated, and $132k left.

At the moment, I'm considering four options (but please let me know if there are better ones!):

- **Investing in the housing market.** I should be able to purchase a house in Raleigh, although I likely won't be able to get a mortgage since I'm not employed (any thoughts on this?), so this leaves me with rough housing options. However, this could be a lucrative option since I plan on living with two of my close friends in my senior year (2018-19).

- **Investing in stocks/bonds/dividends through Vanguard (?).** I don't entirely know what this entails yet, but I don't expect it to be as lucrative as becoming a landlord.

- **Leaving the money in a savings account.** This way, I can just let it accrue interest and offset my monthly expenses. This seems like a potential waste.

- One of those three aforementioned options, but also signing a lease with my friends in senior year and use the profits from those options to offset my rent costs. This would potentially let me enjoy my senior year without worrying about landlording.

**Helpful things to mention:**

**Future:** I plan on studying abroad during this coming spring semester at the University of Leeds in the UK. This is incredibly important to me, both for my field of study (philosophy) and because my mother and I always talked about studying abroad (so it'll be for her, in a way). After graduation, I plan on working for a tech company either directly in a software/computer science role, or starting out with human resources and working my way into tech (this second option is a backup because of my major. Not all companies are open to the idea of philosophers having an interest and talent for working with computers).

**Personal:** I've dealt with my mother's death relatively well. Four years of counseling in high school for other issues followed by an excellent support system has made me pretty resilient. On an unrelated note, my father is not very well-educated and isn't really able to support me with any of this financial planning. Also, I'm in a committed relationship with someone about six years older than me, and he's been a good source of support and advice.

Any support and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone!

personalfinance,F'd up and took out a secured loan today - what's the best way to go about this?,"Greetings, friends. 

So, to begin, I know a lot of people in the sub might not agree with my reasoning for taking out a loan but here's my story.

One of my largest life goal's is travel. After I took my first international trip, I made it a goal to step foot on all 7 continents by age 30. Well, I'm 29 now and my cruise departs to Antarctica on the day of my 30th birthday, end of December this year.

I chose the loan route to pay for my trip, as I work long-term contract jobs and I wanted access to as much savings as possible if SHTF. I, looking for the best rate for a personal loan, chose a savings secured loan without even thinking of what ""secured"" actually meant. I borrowed 10k. Then it dawned on me when I signed into Wells Fargo and that 10k is now ""locked"" from touching it until payments are made. This kinda defeats the whole purpose of the loan for me, since that money is untouchable. 

So big mistake on my part, I'm an idiot who needs to pay more attention. I learned a lesson today. Here's the thing, I still have plenty in my savings - enough for at least 10-12 months of an emergency fund. In addition to that, if I lose my job, unemployment insurance is enough to at least cover all of my bills for at least 6 months as well. My biggest issue is psychological I suppose - I have a number in my head of what I'd like to have access to at anytime - and now I don't have that number.

What are my best options? I don't want to ruin my credit - before this loan I had an 802 FICO score and not much debt. I read somewhere that my credit score can decrease if I pay this loan off too fast. I'm thinking a happy medium would be to pay back half ($5000) before the first payment is due, and then pay back the rest over a year. Would this be a reasonable route to go? I'd feel more comfortable with access to an additional $5k, but in fairness, I'm slightly OCD when it comes to money management. 

TL;DR - Borrowed 10k in hopes to have full access to my savings in case things go south, end up locking it in a secured loan, and want to mitigate any negative impact on my credit history/credit score. 

Edit 1: Forgot to include that the origination fee was somewhere between $50-75. The interest rate is fixed at 5.4% over 5 years. 

Edit 2: Forgot a crucial factor - I charged ~8500 to my Chase Sapphire card after the loan was approved, but before I understood the condition of a ""secured"" loan. The idea was to immediately pay off the card with the loan and collect the airfare points / travel benefits the card provides. Now that I have a debt of ~8500 on the card, chances of getting a reasonably priced traditional loan may be tougher now. Think I'll keep this one, experiment by paying down early but not entirely and see how badly and/or beneficial this is to my credit score.",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to get CC debt under control, looking for second opinions on my choices.","Hi all, 

 I think I'm finally getting a handle on the big issues with my finances (student loans not included, but they are on IBR), but I still have credit card debt that I'm looking to manage. Some of my debt was due to helping out my parents for a few months with some bills, while a bit was due to a fairly expensive car repair and service bill. The stuation compounded itself as I refuse to use a debit card (typically less insurance if compromised) and was not staying on top of things like I should have. And then some was due to just stupid decisions. 

My first thought was I wanted to get a personal loan with a 3yr term, but thanks to my fairly lucky pick of credit cards I'm having a hard time finding a loan with low enough interest rates to make it worhtwhile. However, my oldest card religiously sends me a balance transfer offer each month. I was thinking of using it to get ahead a bit, but wanted some outside opinions because my assumptions aren't always the best. I am only considering doing the BT on two cards (marked with a *) but I am including all my cards for a complete picture.

 
CC Debt:
*AMEX BCE: $2,378 / $7,000, 0% until 11/17 then 13.74%
Barclaycard Ring: $5,296 / $7,000, 8.25% (currently doing minimum)
*Cap1 Quicksilver: $1,529 / $10,000, 0% until 6/17 then 13.74%
Citibank Forward: $479 / $10,500, 12.99% (online only card, pay off statement balance every month)
Commerce Bank Visa $1,717 / $15,000, 11.99% (card with the offer, currently paying minimum)

Like said before, my original plan was to get a personal loan, but I would need something sub 10% to put everything into one basket, or find one with a low minimum that is roughly 12% and leave the Barclaycard alone. Between my local bank (Commerce Bank) and Alliant, the closest I can get is about 11%, but the minimum is higher than I would like. This is where the balance transfer offer became a thought. The offer I have is 1.99% for 12 months with a 5% fee (or 10$, the higher of the two). I was planning on doing the BT for Cap1 now so I don't have to pay the interest next month, and then in november do the remainder of the Amex. The fee would be about $85 to do the Cap1 now.

Another option available is I have about $1,200 in a Betterment invesment account that is earning about 4% right now. I could just clean that out, move some savings around, and pay off the Cap1 now, then wait until November and then do a BT on the Amex (probably the better option).

Regardless of what method I use (loan or BT offers), my plan post consolidation is the following:

The Amex and Cap1 are my daily use cards (amex for gas/groceries and cap1 for everything else), and will be paid off every month. The Citi remains an online only card and will continue to be paid off every month. As for the Barclay and Commerce, once they are down to a 0 balance I would probably make them my bill/emergency cards, the bills so they get a monthly charge, and emergency since they are the lowest interest of the lot and can handle carrying a balance for a little bit. 

Any comments would be nice, preferrebly helpful but I'll take whatever I can get.",finance

personalfinance,How do you manage and stay on top of your monthly bills? [x-post r/Frugal],"I was talking with a bunch of friends this evening (who are big into Personal Finance and getting the best value when they buy something) and we came up with what we thought was a pretty comprehensive list of strategies we use to efficiently manage and stay on top of all of our bills. 

Does anyone have any other strategies to try and keep their bills low each month?

1) Identifying and implementing potential opportunities to lower bills

2) Ruthlessly prioritizing which bills to focus on optimizing, going all-out on each one by one

3) Maximizing the use of reward (i.e., credit card, loyalty) and refund (i.e., Paribus) programs, combined with discounts (coupons, daily deals) to get the best price possible for something

4) Reviewing bills in detail each month and disputing any bad or fraudulent charges

5) Extensively researching available plans and alternatives when subscribing to a new service to avoid overpaying

6) Minimizing avoidable fees and charges, like keeping your interest rate low, not using third party ATMs, paying bills on time, etc.

7) Constantly reevaluating subscriptions on an ongoing basis to make sure as soon as it's not used, it's canceled

8) Knowing the best ways to resolve common issues and what to ask for as compensation when things go wrong

9) Closely monitoring the status of outstanding refunds or credits to make sure they actually happen and arrive in the right amount

10) Knowing all the important details about subscriptions (renewal dates, prices, available alternatives, etc.)

Thanks!

Throwaway because I am terrified to post anything about my financial situation online, but here goes. I am a 26(f) engaged to a British 29(m). Los Angeles/London. 

I have quite a bit of debt that I hold from school (undergrad and graduate school) - all federal. Right now I am on an IDR Plan, so this debt is manageable at the moment, but will likely be unmanageable off that plan/ once we are married. On top of this I have CC debt, as well as a personal loan and car loan. Yes, I fully realize this is not a great position to be in, and I am working on trying to get out.

I've tried to do research on the subject, but I can't seem to find a great answer. I want to know, if I were to move there, how much of my debt travels with me? What about a credit score?

When I'm done, I'll come back and rewrite a post explaining my process &amp; hopefully help anyone else in my position! (:

Before the dealership:

1a. Determine what my budget can afford and what I'm willing to put toward a car for a down payment. (10% of car price for an used car, 20% for a new car.)
2a. Decide the length of a loan I'd like and use an online calculator to then determine what you can afford.
3a. Find a car you'd like, that fits your needs, etc.


1b. Get a approved loan from credit union (and get proof of it in a printout.)
2b. Check the reputations of any and all dealerships my radius.
3b. Get an interest rate quote.
4b. Prepare a separate email/get Google Voice to avoid spam and harassment.

*I'd really like help with how phrasing should be done with the emails, if possible!*


1c. Email all reputable dealerships within my radius at the beginning of the month, providing the specifics of the car I'd like and ask for an out the door. Provide the dealerships with the date I plan on coming to get the car.
2c. Slowly weed out dealerships who aren't willing to lower prices, and send the lowest price offered to the other dealerships. Once the prices are within $100s of eachother, pick the lowest price and contact the dealership. This would happen near the end of the month; to pressure any dealers that may be trying to reach a quota into a lower price to get an easy sale.

At the dealership:


1a. Check out the car, make sure all is working as anticipated, etc.


1b. In the finance office, say no to extras. Including warranties, as they're all overpriced and practically useless anyway.
2b. Show the preapproved loan with the interest rate. (I'm not quite sure how I would get the dealer to then quote me with a lower rate to go through them for financing instead. Help?)
3b. At the end, carefully read over the contract to confirm that there are no extra charges and it matches the verbal agreements made.


Important things to remember:


1. I am doing the dealership a favor by making a purchase, they are not doing me a favor by selling me a car.
2. Stay firm; don't be afraid to speak up. The dealer may not like you, but you're going to like the results better if you do.
3. If you end up going to the dealership to negotiate and you're outside: wear sunglasses. The dealer can't read you as easily and it gives you a bit of an edge.",finance

investing,What Happened To The US Market Last Week (Summary),"Equities were helped in part by the latest economic data. Initial jobless claims fell by 4,000 in the latest week,  the second-lowest reading of the economic recovery, which began eight years ago. Continuing claims were at their lowest level since 1988. 

Separately, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index jumped to a reading of 38.8 in May from 22 in April. While investors have been holding firm in light of the drama out of Washington, Wednesday’s revelations caused the market to question whether controversies surrounding the White House would derail President Donald Trump’s economic agenda, said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial, in an interview. “Investors wanted a pullback and they got one,” Cavanaugh said. “We’re still looking forward to pro-growth policies and no matter who is in the White House, we’re still looking for pro-growth policies.”

“Even though optimism for Trump’s pro-growth agenda has mostly unwound, if this political crisis deepens and elevated volatility persists, equities could see further weakness in the short-term driven by deleveraging across fundamental and systematic strategies,” J.P. Morgan wrote in a note to clients, adding that “fundamentals remain supportive.” Wednesday’s decline came after the New York Times reported that Trump had asked former FBI Director James Comey to  drop an investigation into possible ties between his inner circle and the Russians. Among other things, the controversy was seen as making the passage of Trump’s economic agenda — something analysts say is necessary to justify market valuations — less likely.

Wall Street could continue to be driven by the news coming out of Washington. Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and others on Trump’s campaign team exchanged at least 18 undisclosed phone calls or emails  with Russian contacts during the 2016 presidential race. “The scandal is so dominant at the moment that I guess it doesn’t take a lot to spook investors,” said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, in emailed comments.

personalfinance,Paying off a mortgage worth it.,"I have a rental property that makes me 900 dollars a month in income.  The mortgage on the home is 550/month, and I owe ~65k on the loan.  

I have a windfall on the horizon,  enough to pay off the outstanding loan on the home. 

My idea is I would pay off that mortgage,  and then use the extra income money to start paying extra on the principal of the mortgage For the house I'm currently living in.  

I have my emergency fund,  I contribute the max for  employer match to my 401k, and me and my wife opened a Roth that we try hit the max on every year.  I also have around 3k on a credit card with 10% interest rate,  but I can't pay it off completely without the card closing so I'm hesitant to do that because idk if I can get an interest rate like that anymore.  

I was hoping to get some input because I'm not sure what I would like to do with the money and I don't want to just have 65k sitting around in a checking account.  I also wanted to make sure I didn't overlook anything simple that I could do with it that would serve me better.",finance
personalfinance,Continuing using balance transfers to pay off credit cards?,"I had 3 cards: Chase Freedom, and Citi Diamond and Discover. I recently balance transferred all the Diamond debt and as much Freedom debt onto the Discover card at 3% fee for 9 months. I'm down to the Chase and Discover. Discover is now maxed but not accruing apr. Freedom is at $9k at 7.5%  I can pay ~ $1000 each month. Originally I was going to put $700 into Chase and $300 into Discover (~$180 minimum maxed) akin to ""pay highest interest rate first"" until the apr runs out then switch amounts since Discover will be at 14%. This transfer offer has been available for a few months and could be available for a few more (hopefully).  Could and should I pay all $1000 onto Discover then transfer $970 ($1000 minus $30 3% fee) back onto Discover until the offer expires? My statement just posted so I received $73 interest charge on the chase, so in the end it would be $100 in fees for this next month but assumingly the interest charge would decrease since I ""paid off"" 970 vs 700, but in the end am I spending more in fees than saving over all?

EDIT:
I should add, Discover is at $9000 maxed, so $18000 over all. Already I can tell this probably isn't worth the hassle (which is what I thought anyway).

Originally I said $700 to Chase and $300 to Discover but let's change that to $800 and $200 (since Discover's minimum is $180 and I like round numbers). With this scenario I'd pay $1000 to Discover then pay $970 to Chase in the form of a balance transfer. As suspected, that $30 fee every month for the next 9 (coincidentally when the 0% apr ends and I'll be about clear on Chase) would be $270 and I don't think I'd save that much in interest charges by adding only $170 to each Chase ""payment"". My Chase interest charges would have to be more than $30 a month, which is impossible.

personalfinance,"Three credit cards paid in full, my credit score went down 25 points, why is that?","Hi all,

First a little history; I had excellent credit, got engaged, fiancé had bad credit. We figured since we were getting married, in order to help his credit score go up, and a better outcome for both of us in the long run, I opened accounts with him as secondary (he needed new equipment for work); he made all the payments.

Skip ahead a few years, we split up last summer. No biggie, he still made payments. He recently got a raise and was able to pay off 5k off in full to the credit cards with highest interest rate, which is half the amount of total due. 

His credit score went up 32 points, mine went down 25. How does this work? How can I fix mine? I have about 8k left due to student loans, of which I've never had a late payment on, I have an account in collections due to an emergent medical procedure two years ago that keeps bouncing around insurance companies (out of my hands and currently being disputed) my utilization is 25k, he still owes 5k.  (I am paying off the higher interest rate loans first)

Was him paying off three accounts in full that took a negative impact on me? Will it positively impact me if he paid off slowly versus in full when he gets his next payment from his job ?

financialindependence,How to account for mortgage in FI calcs?,"I, like many others here, have a low interest mortgage (3.25%).  There's no way I'm paying that off early.

But it seems like it's not appropriate to consider mortgage costs like other costs in FI calcs.  My annual mortgage spending (P+I) is $26,124.  My non-mortgage spending (charity included) is $40k.

FI without the mortgage is $1M.  FI with the mortgage is $1.65M (and years of additional work).  But the mortgage gets paid off in 25 years and is no longer an expense.

Is it reasonable to consider my FI target to be $1M plus my mortgage balance (decreasing over time)?  Assuming the stock market will always on average return more than my mortgage interest rate plus inflation, and given that mortgages end, isn't $1.65M too conservative a goal at 4% SWR?

Seems like at minimum some sort of halfway point between $1M and $1.65M is appropriate when a large portion of annual spending is a mortgage and that ((25x non-mortgage annual expenses) + (current mortgage balance)) might be reasonable.  Under that scenario the mortgage could be paid off at any time, leaving just the investment balance needed to sustain non-mortgage spending.  Thoughts?

EDIT: I should add that in my specific situation, our home is most likely our ""forever home"" and I don't consider it an income-producing asset.",finance

$15,000 is set aside specifically six months of expenses in case of job loss.
  
I've got $7,000 set aside for a down payment on my next car and $2,000 set aside for car maintenance. I've got a pretty old car, so it's somewhat needy as far as repairs goes. I've got a 2002 Chevrolet Prizm with ~93,000 miles on it. Pretty low mileage for a car that old, but it suffers from a lot of rust and rot in the undercarriage. I've also got $1,000 set aside for car insurance.
  
I've got about $5,000 set aside for miscellaneous things like gifts, vacations, replacement cell phone/laptop, etc. Another $5500 towards next year's Roth IRA contribution.
  
If my math is correct, this leaves about $25,000 unassigned. I might put it towards a down payment on a condo in the future.
  
I'm feeling somewhat uncomfortable leaving all of this in cash due to inflation risk. What sort of tiering strategies would you use to get some extra return? I was thinking about putting some into a municipal bond fund for my state, but the only funds I can find have fairly long durations and thus more risk than I'd be willing to tolerate in a rising interest rate environment.

worldpolitics,A Brazilian tale: Nine fingers,"In the latest, businessmen from several companies told the Federal Police and Public Ministry prosecutors facts regarding hundreds of acting politicians.

Those facts involved a lot of money. Self-claimed donations that weren't taxed, invested or used for political campaigns. Instead, they became bribery.

This sounds like a corrupt scheme that can happen to any town in the world. What scares here, is that in this Brazilian tale, some of the companies reported have been around for over four decades. And these companies basically ""chose"" for the people with their money and political power, faking democracy for a long period.

The building company Odebrecht had been paying over 81 politicians in a report brought by the Federal Police. The Odebrecht Foundation started in 1970-1972, at the same time Paulo Maluf was appointed mayor (1972) and President of the Federal Savings Bank (1969). Yesterday, Paulo Maluf was sentenced for 7 years by the Supreme Court because of money laundering.

Supposing that from 1980-1990, politically, the same businessmen owned the political scenario, it is evident that their interests predominated in 2000-2010. Today, out of the 108 most voted members of the National Congress, 40 are being investigated. The names of the President of the Senate, of Governors and recent appointed Ministers by Michel Temer, Dilma and Lula are also in. Another company, named JBS, reported that Dilma and Lula had a shared bank account with 150 million dollars in it. And most recently there's a tape recording JBS bribery-handler talking to Michel Temer, the acting President, where the bribery-handler reveals indirectly the bribery path, the President comment that pushed crisis and protests, was, ""You've gotta to keep that going"". The so-called operation Car Wash maintains itself in a rough soil poisoned by unethical law. If businessmen own the Senate, the Congress and pays bribery to the acting and its two former Presidents, it's an assurance to get political power for control.

What is more worrying, is that Brazil made itself a bit of a communist puppet by investing money in communist and socialist dominated regions. For an example, the National Bank of Development, nicknamed BNDES in Brazil, paid 682 million dollars for the construction of Port Mariel in Cuba. This same bank also paid 728 million dollars to build subway lines in Venezuela, and in another time, also in Venezuela, paid 300 million dollars for the construction of a bridge. Why worrying? All those constructions were performed by the Odebrecht company.

I have a checking and savings account at my credit union, into both of which I allot a percentage of my paycheck every week.

My problem is that basically every week I end up transferring the money from my savings to checking to cover the slim margin that my income-spending leaves me (long story).

My question: Is it possible/wise to open an online savings account (potentially with a higher interest rate) from which I can't easily access or transfer money to my checking account?

Other info: I currently contribute 6% of my check to a 401K and 4% to a Roth 401K. I tend to consider this a 'non-liquid' asset as I basically can't touch it or spend it.

I also put money into an Acorns account on a weekly basis, that I treat as a somewhat 'liquid' savings account, because it takes 5-10 days to transfer to my checking account and I'm not likely to bother transferring out of it.

TL;DR I find it difficult to avoid spending the money in my savings account because it is easily accessible. Is it possible to open a different savings account through another institution (Ally?) that would be even marginally more difficult to access or withdraw from?

I'd also like to know, in your opinions, who the best alternative lenders are currently and why you'd select them over others.

**Goal**

Ultimately, I'd like to lower my interest rate (like everyone else). From there I'd like to pay these suckers off ASAP and the biggest struggle I have with my interest. While they aren't stupidly high I'll take another inch back in my favor if a lender will let me.
 

**Financial Situation**

Below I've denoted all my Student Loan information that I thought was pertinent. If I've left something out that would help in your advice giving let me know and I'll amend my post. When I graduated I had multiple student loans that sat with Sallie Mae and when Navient split off they adopted my loans and consolidated them from 6 unsubsidized and 2 subsidized down to 1 unsub and 1 sub.


Guarantor: Dept. of ED/Navient

Total Loans = 2 (Both Federal Student Loans) -Repayment Plan: Graduated Repayment

 - 1 Direct Loan Consolidated (unsubsidized) @ 6% Fixed Rate; Amount: $29,081.34

 - 1 Direct Loan Consolidated (Subsidized) @ 6% Fixed Rate; Amount: $6,159.97


**Final Notes**

Due to youthful ignorance I racked up credit debit and I have a car loan as well. A story for another post. However, I wanted to mention it to paint a complete picture. I'm not drowning by any means but after expenses I'm left with just a couple hundred to put in savings each month. Hopefully with some guidance I can take the right step in paying more towards principle in my current situation until I pay off the credit.

TL;DR - Need guidance and opinions on consolidating and refinancing loans to obtain lower interest and pay down principle.",finance

personalfinance,Interviewing while being trained for long-term,"Hello /r/personalfinance. I had a question about what my obligations here are, and what to expect. I put a tl;dr at the bottom.

I graduated with a B.A. in healthcare management last May. Currently, my student loans amount to $19,000. I had a 10 week internship, saved roughly $4000 dollars from that, then moved back home with family. I had a lot of trouble finding a job because I didn't have a lot of work experience, even though I had been in two internships during college and volunteered for over a year at a hospital doing data-collection for a research study. 

I managed to find work in November. I’ve working as a receptionist at a private urgent care clinic owned by a larger corporation. I’ve been here for a little over 6 months now, and I’m earning $11.00/hr for  40 hours a week in a large California city. The receptionists do quite a bit more than the job description states. My supervisor is currently training me to be the hospital’s first Intake Clerk to compensate for this. He and the CFO are working on the job description, but for now I’m the only receptionist (out of 4) being trained in the work that the new job will require because I have the most ""free time"" to do this training. I haven't asked about a wage increase because it hasn't come up in conversation.

I initially planned to work at this job for a year to get work experience, but started to get really burnt out around March when I realized I wasn't earning enough to pay back my loans even if I were to put my entire check toward loan payments for a year. I have been job-hunting since then. 

This month, I have gotten a second health-education job that pays $18.75 an hour, but is per-diem, and I haven't had any shifts pop up yet. I'm in the last steps of interviewing at a university nearby for a per-diem role (No wage has been disclosed yet, but they told me they'll likely expand it to full time after the summer and some change. I meet the coworkers for an on-site ""interview"" in early June). I also have had two other interviews for county-level roles (salaries roughly equal to 40-50k), but the wait-time on these has been very slow and I don't expect a call-back anytime soon.

In a few days, I have an on-site interview at a biotechnology company as an Intake Specialist (No wage disclosed yet. When asked what I was expecting, I said roughly $20 - 25/hr and I wasn't shot down, but wasn't given an exact wage either). That role is for a 6 month contract , but most people at this company have become full-time after their contract, and I see that happening here because it's a completely new role they've made out of necessity. The other people interviewing only have offers for 3 month contracts, but I was offered 6 months when I e-mailed them to essentially say ""Hey, moving for a 3 month contract is going to be impossible for me at this point."" I would need to move into an apartment in a high CoL area for this to pan out (33% of the wage range I suggested would get me a single room in a shared apartment).

Should I make my current employer aware of these interviews going on? Should I use these as leverage to ask for a wage increase? There has been a lot of turnover recently, and I feel bad for having all these potentials panning out when I'm the only one being trained a job they're going to want everyone at my current job tier doing. My supervisor really likes me, so I don't want to burn that bridge, but I feel like walking away now when my department has already had 4 people leave within a 2 month period would be a slap in the face.

If I get an offer at the biotechnology company, should I take it, or should I bide my time with the per-diem roles (and government roles)? I'm afraid I'll lose out on the other potential offers coming up, but it feels like I'm meeting *everyone* for the on-site meeting and they've described it as more of a coffee date, so it seems like they're really likely to give me a good offer. 

I feel like I'm jumping the gun, especially since I'm blessed to not have to pay rent where I'm at right now, but my current job is very, very taxing and I'm tired of it. Even people in the middle of a health crisis have approached me, seen how much I'm doing, and stated ""Wow, you need another pair of hands!"" We're constantly under-staffed and it's frustrating because we have the feel and workload of a small clinic, but the bureaucracy of a corporation (wages and job descriptions seem like they are dictated by corporate). 

Not sure what my course of action should be here.

tl;dr Should I take the more immediate out and burn bridges where I'm at now with a 6-month contract role, or the slightly-less immediate route and try living on the per-diem jobs while waiting for offers from the county? Also, does it make sense to use potential offers to negotiate a higher wage, or should I stay hush-hush even though my supervisor has long-term plans that assume I'm going to stay long-term?",finance

personalfinance,Clarifying retirement contribution limits and benefits,"Hey all, had a couple questions and wanted to make sure I've got this right. 

**None of what I'm about to say is guaranteed to be correct, so please correct me if it is wrong and do not take it as fact until I get some feedback to assure it's accuracy.** 

So ground rules that I understand (or at least, think I do):  

 **Pre-Tax Contributions**

You can put back up to $18,000 of your paycheck per year without paying taxes on it. It grows tax free, but you pay taxes whenever you withdraw it during retirement. It continues growing tax-free even while you are in retirement. I think of these as ""deferred"" taxes, since you're going to pay them eventually whenever you withdraw. This is your ~~Traditional IRA and~~ 401k plan. You can't withdraw until your 59.5. If your employer kicks in money on this, it doesn't count against the limit.  

*Another* $5500 ~~of this~~ can go in your Traditional IRA. If you make over $69,000-- you ~~have to pay tax the~~ can't defer the contributions on your taxes, so you might as well contribute them to a Roth IRA (so that they will not be taxed when you withdraw them later, more on this later).

**Special Considerations**

You can use your HSA as a ""Super IRA"" because money going in isn't taxed and (as long as your withdrawing for medical expenses) neither is money coming out. This is only useful if you can afford out of pocket costs for your healthcare items. This works because apparently there are no rules against saving receipts from 20 years ago to use on the HSA later. You actually **want** a HDHP to minimize the amount you pay for insurance and ""maximize"" the amount you pay out of pocket so that you can save money now on insurance and be able to withdraw from the HSA later. Max yearly contribution is $3,400. After 65, you can withdraw for any expense as long as you pay normal taxes, but can still pay for medical expenses tax free. If your employer kicks in on this, it *does* count against your max contribution. Other than having to wait an extra 5.5 years (59.5 vs 65) and the reduced contribution amount, the HSA is superior to the Traditional IRA.

**After-Tax Contributions**

You can pay taxes up front on what you're trying to put back for retirement. You still pay taxes later though, unless you use a Roth IRA. Then you don't pay taxes whenever you withdraw, other rules are generally the same. The $5,500 IRA limit is a shared total, so you can't do $5,500 in the Roth IRA and another $5,500 in the Traditional IRA.


**Other Notes**

You can actually put back up to ~~$53,000~~ $54,000 per year **total.** ~~, with $18,000 being the limit on your *Pre-Tax Contributions*~~ So assuming you max out your ~~Pre-Tax~~ 401k Contributions, you could put back another $35,000 in *After-Tax Contributions.* Whatever your employer kicks in to your ~~Pre-Tax~~ 401k Contributions doesn't count towards the $18,000 limit, but it **does** count towards the total limit. So if you put in $18,000 and your employer kicked in like $4,000 then your max After Tax Contribution is $32,000.   

It is possible to roll money every year from your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You can abuse this such that you pay less taxes rolling over than you would have if you went straight in to the Roth. You have to pay taxes as usual, but you can control the exact amount you roll over. If you are making less money than normal (say your retired early or out of a job for a year) then you'll be rolling over your Traditional IRA money at a lower tax bracket than when you earned said money. You can potentially pay no taxes at all rolling it over this way.

**Questions**

* So the rule about not being able to deduct Pre-Tax contributions if you make &gt;$69,000 applies to both the Traditional IRA *and* the 401k? If I am understanding this, Traditional IRA and 401k's are *absolutely worthless* to someone who makes &gt;$69,000/year.
* What if your married? Does that change anything on the deduction rules?
* For the HSA ""Super IRA,"" would it be ideal to just not have insurance at all? Purely hypothetical question.
* Do contributions towards the HSA count towards the Pre-Tax Contributions limit?
* Are HSA deductions affected by income like Traditional IRA and 401k's?
* How on earth does the taxing for Roth stuff work? Say I make $50k before taxes, single, max contribution to my Roth IRA. How much do I actually pay out of pocket? How much actually goes in the Roth Account?
* Any input on Roth 401k's?

**Creating a Generally Optimal Strategy/Order**

* Always meet the match an employer gives you.

Assuming no other debts are held, you would first...

* If you can afford for medical out of pocket, max your HSA Contribution.
* Then, assuming you make &lt;$69,000, a Traditional IRA/401k may be a good option. From what I understand, you are essentially gambling on the future. Do you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you are retired? Then go IRA/401k. If you have a way to roll over to a Roth afterwards, do that as well.
* If you make more than $69,000, max out your Roth IRA, then put as much as you want/need in to a 401k

Assuming you have student debt or a mortgage or car payment... look at the interest rate of that debt as a guaranteed return. If that peace of mind in paying it off + interest rate is comparable to whatever the market is putting out, do that first.

personalfinance,Confused by which job is a better financial decision? One job is less pay but provides great benefits and summers off and the other pays more but no benefits? Please help. Thank you!,"Hi there.  First off let me thank all of you for your assistance.  I really appreciate it and love the help provided on the personal finance threads.

I am 33 years old.  I currently work as a public education teacher (4 years) and have been picking up some hours in the evenings working as a therapist making $30/hr.  I have just been offered a full time position with the same company as a therapist on the private market however they do not offer any benefits or retirement.

Option 1: 
In my current job the financial incentives are

Annual Salary- 44,635.52 (before taxes)
Daily rate of pay- $238.69 (I work 187 days)


Benefits paid by yearly by district

Retirement (pension)- $8,852- I will be paid out 60% of top three years salary after 30 years (Looking at the salary schedule this will be about a top salary of $65000 to $70000)
Health Insurance- $5,340
Dental Insurance- $408.00
Life Insurance- $27
Long term disability- $107.13
Federal Taxes (FICA)- $647.22
Workers Compensation- $305.31

Total Cost of Benefits and Salary- $60,353


Option 2:
The other job that I have been offered as a therapist offers financial incentives of:

$45 an hour for billable work and I will get 30 hours a week= $67,500 for a 50 week work year
$20 an hour for 10 hours a week of administrative tasks=$10000 for a 50 week work year
Total= $77,500

Additional Info
I would be a W-2 employee and not a 1099
Any hours accumulated after 40 hours a week will be comp time and can be exchanged for paid vacations
no benefits offered with the job (no health, no 401k, etc.)

Option 3:
The third option is to keep the teaching job and pick up hours as a therapist over the summer and in evenings at $30 an hour (my current rate).  I believe I can earn an annual total of $10,200 (gross before taxes) on top of my teaching salary if I go with this option.


If people could please weigh in on the best financial option I would appreciate it as I am a newbie and a bit overwhelmed by the numbers and comparing a pension to 401k",finance

If so, what type of bond classes?",finance
personalfinance,"About to move and will sell for about double what I purchased, what to do with extra money (~$50k)?","First off I want to thank PF for helping me get through a stressful financial time in my life.  In only the last few years, I was able to knock off over $20,000 of debt (mostly high interest CC's), and it feels great to finally have some breathing room again.

&amp;nbsp;

I purchased my house in 2010 for just over $100k, and I will be putting it on the market next week for $190k.  Based on quick initial calculations, I will be looking at:

* 185,000 - estimated offer I'll take after haggling
* -85,000 - current mortgage
* -15,000 - current HELOC
* -3,500 - last CC with balance
* -14,800 - 8% seller closing costs (including 6% commissions)

* $66,700 - Amount leftover after sale and payoffs of debt
* -11,750 - 5% down on $235,000 home (still looking in the $180k-250k range)
* -7,050 - 3% buyer closing costs

* $47,900 - amount after purchase of new home

&amp;nbsp;

I have practically zero liquid funds, so I was thinking starting with an emergency fund.  I read on here 6 months of expenses would be a good, so say $2500 x 6 = $15,000.

&amp;nbsp;

I also have a car that I am extremely upside down on (KBB shows 7k, owe about 15k), but the interest rate is really low, less than 2% if I recall correctly.  It would be nice to not have an extra $300/mo car payment, but with such a low interest rate, not sure if it's worth paying it off or using that 15k on something ""better"".

&amp;nbsp;

I could put some more down on the new house.  The mortgage guy that I am working with said he normally recommends to his clients 10% since the sub-20% PMI is normally low anyways, having the extra cash on hand may be nice.  He told me there was a minimal difference between 5% down and 10% down in terms of PMI (something like $85 vs $60).

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure if this is relevant, but I also have a 401k with Vanguard already established that I contribute about 6% to (company has safe harbor matching, 3% @ 100%, 2% @ 50%)

&amp;nbsp;

Should I do something else with the leftover funds?  Even after the emergency fund, should I still have extra cash on hand besides that?  If so, how much?  Once I reach this amount, should I use everything over this amount (on increasing 401k, etc)?

personalfinance,Need help withunique cross-border debt repayment strategy (US/CAN),"**Situation**

- I am graduating an american university in one month, which I have been attending for the last 4 years.
- 4 years ago when I started the program the exchange rate was 0.92 USD/ CAD
- Today the exchange rate is 0.74 USD/CAD
- I am a Canadian citizen. 
- I have accepted a job in California which will guarantee me a minimum of $12,000 USD up to $22,000 (before taxes) a month starting August. I am also offered an employer 401k match of 6%

- $20,000 CAD - Can checking account 
- $10,000 USD - US Checking 


**Question**

- I am a bit lost in designing an optimal repayment strategy. 
- Since the exchange rate is currently so favorable for the US dollar, it makes me think that I should take advantage of it and repay my Canadian loans as soon as possible. In an ideal world, I would accept a new American loan to pay off the Canadian loans immediately but due to my non-immigrant status in the US, it would be difficult to find a loan under 10% interest rate for me (the US loan I have is through my university). Perhaps after I start earning a US income this could change.
- Due to the low-interest rates, I would have liked to allocate maximum funds towards retirement savings accounts and make minimum payments towards my loans but this exchange rate is challenging this idea for me. 
- I am wondering if anyone has an opinion on what exchange rate I should adapt my repayment strategy. Does anyone have any recommendations for my repayment strategy?

personalfinance,How I raised my credit score by ~80 points in under a month,"I recently decided to finally get my credit card debt under control and climb out of the ~$15k hole I was in. I had debt spread across four cards: two have an introductory APR of 0% for 18 months and two had balances of 7k and 4k with 19% and 21% interest respectively. I contacted both companies asking for interest rate reductions and both declined (that stung a bit). I had also signed up for Credit Karma so I could more closely track changes to my credit and see my debt laid out for me all in one place. On all four cards, I was at ~75-90% utilization and learned that that was putting a huge damper on my credit score. I was [hovering around the mid 600s](http://imgur.com/a/8cFDz). I will be apartment hunting soon and anything below 700 would make my life really difficult. I knew I wouldn't be able to significantly knock down the utilization percentage on any of the cards before then without a huge influx of money. 

I stumbled across an offer for a personal loan that would give me 11k (to cover the two high interest cards) at 11%. Way better than my average of 20%! So I bit the bullet and applied for the loan. The hit to my credit from the hard pull was negligible, about three or four points. Then I paid off the first card. The following week, Credit Karma showed my scores increased by ~40 points. All of a sudden I was back at 700! My second card payment date wasn't until the 1st of June but I was so excited by that first huge jump that I paid it early. This week CK showed another similar jump by 40 points. All of a sudden [my score is higher than it's ever been](http://imgur.com/a/qw9P2)! I'm certain that if I didn't have such high utilization on the two interest-free cards it'd jump even higher but for now, mid-700s is good enough for me. 

Obviously now I have to pay off the personal loan, and the minimum payment for it is higher than the minimum payment of the credit cards, but my budget can handle it, and I deliberately got a short term on the loan anyway so I can be free sooner rather than later. I just wanted to share this with anyone who felt like they had to slog it out before they could see real changes. I don't really see personal loans encouraged here but for me, it made a *huge* difference. Good luck y'all!

$32,0000 from Canada Student Loan, 
$12,000 from a student credit line (interest is 3.7% which has to be paid monthly),
$7000 on my credit card (19.99% interest which has to be paid monthly).

I went to school twice and the second time going, I was not approved for anywhere close to the amount of money I needed, hence why my credit card ended up run up.

I'm pretty good at monitoring my finances (I have them in a excel sheet which I monitor month to month) and can live on a budget pretty easily. I've worked it out that even with all my finances, I can get by and start paying down my credit card gradually. 

Here is my question though, should I attempt to consolidate this? It doesn't make sense to me as my student loan and credit line both have such low interest rates, that I feel like the consolidated interest rate would be higher, but I'm honestly not sure. Obviously, my credit card interest is killing me actively, which is why I'm considering consolidation.

Can I even be approved for consolidation though? I actually don't have bad credit, even with all my debt I make my payments, so I've always been in good standing. But, I've pretty much borrowed all the money I can for my credit range and capped myself out with my personal bank. I'm not too sure what my options are and my bank wasn't very helpful.

April second I got into a car accident, someone hit me on my passenger back tire, my car is still in the shop, they said it might be done Friday. It is a 2016 subaru legacy 2.5 limited, I have about 16k left on the car. I have three credit cards, one apple Barclay card with a 2000 dollar balance for two iphones 18 months no interest and have about 12 months left to pay it off. I have a best buy store credit card for 16 months left with a balance of 400 dollars left and then my bbt credit card with 9800 on it. All these expenses happened after accident. I have no interest on the best buy card and should be able to pay it off slowly. I pay 450 dollars a month for my car, 160 for insurance. My interest rate on bbt is 10.9, Barclay card on things not bought from apple is 20.74. I have no savings account or anything stored away. I am just getting into this field, never saved or invested and am very interested in learning. What may I do guys? Should I get a balance transfer card? Because the interest on the bbt card will cost me like 200 a month or so. If so any recommended ones? My credit score as of now is above 715, credit limit on both cards are over 9000. Any advice would be truly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Trying not to freak out about my student loans, but I think I have a plan.","I just got off the phone with Sallie Mae and they're telling me that my loan payments will equal out to $1311 each month with no way to lower them. I could stall them for up to 12 months with forbearance but I've heard that's not advisable. I also have federal student loans, which might be around $350 a month if I get an extended payment plan.

So that equals out to around $1600-1800 a month of student loan payments for years to come. 

My current job is a 1 year contract that pays $55k a year. I am not a Cali resident and will be working in the state. My finances are:

* $1700 Student Loans
* $78 phone
* $300 food
* $750 rent (if I can get the place I'm currently looking at)
* $250 healthcare (I was told I can get cheaper, but I've never bought healthcare)

[This site](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#AIN3hbpi8j) tells me that after taxes, I should take home about $3,487 a month. After deducting my expenses, I'm left with roughly $409 a month, or $4908 a year. I admit I've been freaking out a bit. I can't imagine only having $400 a month for the next 20+ years. I can't buy a car, when I run into any medical issues I'm going to be royally fucked. So I've come up with a plan that I think will help me out. If you have any additions you'd like to say, please say them. I really need all the help I can get.


1. During my grace period for the next 6 months, I pay off all of my credit cards and work on my emergency savings. This will give me about $6000 to save up as an emergency fund. Plus paying off my credit cards will increase my credit score.
2. Find a second job ASAP. I already have a 9-5 job, with overtime pay, but I need more money. I eventually will get a higher paying job but I need a sort of quick fix. So I look for any jobs I can get where I can work 20 hours on the weekends. I haven't started my job yet so I'm not so sure if I'll be able to handle working a evening shift on the weekdays. But a part time weekend job could bring in about $1000 a month at $15 an hour, and after taxes. If I can land this, I can put that towards paying off my smaller private loans. I have to small loans (currently at $5400 and $2800) that when paid off will give me an extra $110 a month. The next loan, currently at $8900, will give me an extra $179 a month. If I can snowball these two loans within two years I can have an extra $300 a month. 
3. Overall just snowball my private loans. Sallie Mae does not do any payment plans. You pay one rate and that's it. Thankfully the government loans can be adjusted. Since the Sallie Mae loans are fucking me over the hardest, I'll snowball them. I'm not sure if I should with that remaining $400 a month I'll be getting, provided I don't get a 2nd job, since I should probably be putting it towards my emergency savings until it reaches around $8000. If I can't get a job once my contract ends I'd be able to live for about 2-3 months just on my emergency savings if it's $8-9k.
4. Refinance my Sallie Mae loans. Honestly I have no idea how to even start on this but people keep on telling me to refinance my loans. I understand that usually this requires having a job for a while and having good credit. Right now my credit isn't up where it needs to be, but paying off my credit cards should increase that amount. I was told to look into SoFi, and eventually refinance my loans again after a few years for a lower interest rate at a bank or another company. But I've also been told to avoid SoFi.
5. [Just die, so my loans are forgiven. Then they'll never have any of my money. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6MlHxAzLXA)


Please, please, please, if you find any errors in my plan or wish to add more please tell me. I'm so scared right now but I'm trying to keep calm with this plan.


**EDIT**: One major detail I need to point out is that I haven't graduated from college. It was either I continue to accumulate more debt that would add an additional $300 a month to my student loan payments, or I get a job in the industry that I went to college for. From what I understand it's more difficult to refinance student loans when you haven't gotten your degree. I want to finish my classes, but they won't transfer to other schools so I have to wait until I move back to take them.


**EDIT 2**: Thank you everybody for the feedback. I greatly appreciate anymore that I can get. I want to add a few things. One is that the industry that I'm in can very much lead to higher paying jobs, and it's possible to get a $90k job within 2 years at certain companies. I'm not saying I'll be getting paid that much in 2-4 years, but I can see my pay going up to $65k within 2 years. I won't budget myself for that prediction though, as nothing is ever guaranteed. If that happens I'll use that extra money to pay off my student loans even faster. A lot of major companies will even provide healthcare for their employees, or at a discount, so that could save me up some money as well. As far as a specific method for paying off my loans, I'm going to go with a snowball method for the next 1-2 years until I pay off my smaller loans first (equaling out to around $15k with average 9% interest.) By doing that I'll have an extra $300 a month. There is another loan for about $10k that if I paid it off after those three, would give me an additional $180 a month. I'm going to settle for a few weeks at my new job once it starts so I can figure out if I will be able to work some evening shift jobs during the weekdays. I don't want to burn myself out doing this for 10 years, but I do want to do this to ease up my private loans enough and while I'm still in a lower position at my main work. I'm already looking around the area that I'll be moving to for a 2nd job that can be done over the weekends. Plus considering how broke I'm going to be, I'd rather be productive over the weekends than just sit around and do nothing.

**EDIT 3**: It looks like some people have gotten their Sallie Mae payments/interest rate reduced by going through their ""Rate and Reduction"" department. Basically you need to provide documentation of your financial hardship in that having a lower payment will help you out. You have to stick to it and call them multiple times but apparently they can do this, and sometimes will only go on for 6 months to a year. I'm definitely going to look into this as I'm hoping that if I can get this done, then I will continue to pay the $1300 they normally require but on the smaller loans, thus paying them off faster. 

**EDIT 4**: I'm also seeing that Sallie Mae has it to where if I pay more than the total amount due, that amount is reduced the next month. So if my total amount due is $100, and I pay $150, then my next billing statement will be reduced by $50. So paying $200 will reduce it down to $0. I'm trying to figure out how I can use this to my advantage. Perhaps if I know I'm going to be short on money the next month, I can make a larger payment which will reduce the next the following month.",finance
Ripple,Discussion on Ripple's potential future value - banking,"I'm working on fleshing out some numbers and would love to get some feedback from some smarter investors than myself.  The following is my personal thought process, I'd love to have you guys correct me where appropriate and discuss.  Just to put out a disclaimer, I don't have a banking background, the text below is my interpretation and could be wrong in many areas:


A lot of the hype about XRP on this subreddit centers around the adoption of the coin for bank useage.  I'm just a casual personal investor, but I try to center around value analysis for most investments.  To date, crypto has been tough for me to value...is your value derived from the asset, from the potential of the company, or its use as a currency?  Usually, the answer seems to usually be some combination of the three.  To try and value ripple, I've tried to  look at how much value XRP would **need** in order to be used by the banks.  I'm not an international banker, but I did some google research and would categorize bank transfers into three categories:

**1.  Large Value Payment Systems (Wholesale)** - These are contractual/operational arrangements between banks to transfer large time-critical funds.  These are ""instantaneously"" settled through systems such as CHIPS or FedWire, and account for about 75% of the bank daily transaction value.  There's roughly 3.5 trillion dollars exchanged daily here (not primarily international transfers, but all types of settlements). These transactions are not the target avenue for XRP.

**2. Correspondent banking** - Agreements between banks to provide payment services for each other.  In the most normal cases, 2 banking institutions employ a third service-providing bank.  This is where XRP wants to be, mixed in with nostro, vostro, loro account transactions.  There is about 1 trillion dollars of daily turnover here.

**3. Retail Payments** - Generalization of a lot of payments, but for simplicity we'll focus on the big one: remittances.  This is a big secondary market for XRP.  There are about 86 billion dollars of remittances transferred daily.

So, you'll see with options 2 and 3, we're talking about some heavy volume of potential XRP to be moved daily.  Great news, right? The potential buzzkill is that XRP only needs to be held momentarily in this scenario by the banks.  In a days' work, they'll buy and sell from market makers to meet their needs.  Per ripple's own guidance, the banks will only need to keep their highest expected daily transaction value.  To quantify that value, I did some digging and found this report put out by the Eurosystem:

[report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/8thsurveycorrespondentbankingineuro2013en.pdf?3cb50ccaf39b43acb639100f72871374)

This survey encompasses 24 of the largest banks within their purview, so we're talking about banks that are largely the service-providers in the nosto/vostro transactions.  You'll say this is a small sample size, but per the report, the 30 largest banks make up 99% of the daily turnover.  The interesting thing to me was the AVERAGE transaction size.
  *12.2 million loro transactions at an average of 72,536 euro each

*37,000 nostro transactions at an average of 420,000 euro each

Of course, there's a variance within that average transaction size and banks will keep a daily value that is several times their average transaction.  But, lets say that a bank is holding 20x their average daily transaction and they have an account size of 8.3 million euro (~9.5 million dollars).  Looking at the largest 30 banks doing 99% of the turnover would have a combined $300 million dollars in XRP accounts between the banks on a given day.  This also assumes that all international currency is traded through XRP.  In the short term, we know they're targeting illiquid markets (developing nation currencies and the like).  Doing a rough scale of third-world nation GDP's (say from Ethiopia on down, real rough guess), I'm estimating this to be 5% of the total transactions.  This would drop that $300 million down to closer to $15 million.

From my perspective, this tells me that bank adoption of XRP would result in heavy trade volumes between the market makers and banks for a potentially very stable price, but not much demand for a price increase (especially spread out over 100 billion potential ripple).  Of course, I could be way off with my assumptions here.

Just wanted to throw it out to the group to get some feedback and discussion going.  I'm sure I've made some erroneous assumptions here, let me know what you guys think.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,The Interest rate on my fixed rate student loan arbitrarily increased and don't know why,"Hi,

As the title says, my fixed rate Discover student loan from 10 years ago previously changed interest rate from 2.5 to 3%. I got this loan fixed rate sometime in 2006. 

I received the following message from Discover:

""The interest rate on one or more of your private student loans has changed due to either a change to the associated pricing index or due to a change in a borrower benefit."" 

I have no idea what this means. Has anyone else experienced this before and if so how did to correct it? I don't think it's fair that my student loan randomly increased out of nowhere. I don't think anything has changed and they never cited to any portion of our agreement to do so.",finance
personalfinance,Credit rose over 100 points - high interest car loan,"Hello! Recently I was able to pay off my credit card debt so my available credit is much higher. My credit is now excellent, from my poor rating about 6 months ago. 

Anyway, I have a car loan that has a 14% interest rate (I know I know, but I needed a car and had a past repossession) but I want it lower. I owe $5500 as of now. What do I do? I don't want to run out and open a new line of credit, but at the same time, this interest rate is ridiculous. 

Should I go to a credit union to get advice or ?? What do I do next that will keep my credit high but help me get that rate down? Should I try to renegotiate the loan?",finance
Bitcoin,Fees must come down or we're going to blow it,"Right now, Japan is the opportunity of a lifetime for Bitcoin to actually achieve true adoption.  For people familiar with Japan, it is still a heavily all-cash based society.  This is very different than places like China where WeChat and Alipay already have everyone locked up as customers, and very different from the US where everyone uses some reward credit card and can't see the benefits of using Bitcoin on a daily basis.  Japan is a nation where people still hand each other huge stacks of cash because most shops don't take credit, don't take any kind of digital payments.

And at the same time Japan is a nation where their interest rates are literally negative, so everyone is holding tons of cash that keeps disappearing unless you actually hold onto tons of paper notes which is a ridiculous concept.

So it's not surprising that now that Bitcoin is legal people in japan are going crazy for it, it solves their problems with negative interest rates and a devaluing currency and for the first time it provides a digital payment platform and prevents people from having to hoard sacks of cash all at once.  So now merchants are accepting it, which is wonderful.  Except if the current fees keep up by the time it's fully legalized in Japan this summer (keep in mind that this current run-up is still prior to full acceptance as a currency this summer) then we will blow our chance at actually becoming the defacto digital payment platform in Japan.

I mean this is craziness guys, we actually have a shot at becoming THE digital payment platform in an advanced nation, but we're bickering and infighting while the biggest opportunity ever is in front of us.  If we can get one country to adopt it successfully then it will be much easier to get others to follow.  So we can't blow this.

We need a solution to scaling and we need it ASAP, optimally right as Japan fully legalizes Bitcoin we should have a solution to get the fees down.  I think segwit needs to be activated and clearly the majority of bitcoiners agree, but I don't think it's a good idea to throw around any ideas that would split the chain or cause any fear amongst normal folks right when Bitcoin is fully legalized.  I think whatever solution we finally 100% agree to needs to be unanimous but I also think we all need to think 100% in terms of collaborative work and working on solutions together instead of constant attacks and animosity.

Don't blow this.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage Refi Debacle,"So once upon a time my wife and I decided to build a house.  We’re getting ready to wrap things up with the build (mid June), and we’re trying to set up a strategy to reduce our debt load.  


We net ~$8,700 a month, and after fixed bills (everything except credit cards), we have $3,400 a month left over.


Format for below is total owed / payment amount 


Mortgage: 10 year (9 years left on it) interest only construction loan 4.25% ~405,000 / $1600
Student Loan: $59,551 / $649
Personal Loan: $26,141 / $710
Car: $23,185 / $329
Credit Cards: ~$33,000 (most of it is at 0% for the next 11 months).  


So here is the crux of the matter.  Our initial plan was to refi our construction loan into a traditional 30 year, with a cash out at 90% LTV.  We should appraise for somewhere around 505-525k.  On paper this give us 49,500-67,500 as cash in hand (before refi fees etc).  We were going to use those funds to wipe out all the credit cards and the personal loan.    


However my broker is telling me that they can’t do a conventional cash out for 90% LTV, and instead are pushing me towards a conventional mortgage plus a HELOC at prime plus 1.99%. They want to appraise the house, and give me the remaining valuation as the HELOC.  If we come in at the high side we should have a LTV of 77%, with 13.9% left over for the HELOC or $72,975.  To pay off everything, we’d essentially tap 59K of the HELOC out of the gate, which seems stupid as I’d be converting most of the debt which is at 0%, to a 15 year HELOC at roughly 6.9%.  


Option two, would be to keep my construction loan for a couple years.  My payments are only interest (which sucks), but they are super low, around $1600 a month.  Given the we have a surplus of $3,400 a month, I could keep out say $500 a month for play money/unknown things, and put the rest towards debt.  This pays off the credit cards/personal loan in roughly 30 months.  However this option delays converting my interest only loan to a traditional loan by 2.5 years.  



One last option would be to just refi now into a 30 year, start paying down my mortgage, and also whittle away at the debt.  Going this route, we’d have 2400 left over before credit card payments.  I could probably sock away (after min payments), maybe 1000 a month.  So roughly 4.8 years.   



My main worry is that interest rates/inflation is going to go crazy in the next year or two, and mortgage rates will go through the roof, and possibly price us out of our own home.  (Estimated mortgage payment of P&amp;I plus prop tax is $3300/month at 7% vs $2500 at 4.3%).  


Not that it’s germane to this but incase it comes up in the thread discussion; I’ve already maxed my retirement contribution (18k a year), and my wife is putting in 7% (roughly 4500/year) so we’re already saving for the future.",finance
personalfinance,"I sold my old car to help pay for necessary bills/medical bills and now that I've moved to a new state, I'm beyond ready for a new car. Need advice and tips for saving up!","Hi there! First off please don't rip me a new one guys lol I know my finances aren't the greatest. 
    So my boyfriend and I have been sharing a car, and getting up at 6am, going into work myself or having a full day of doctors appointments, then going and driving there and back is really taking a toll on me. 
    I have fibromyalgia, so I don't get enough sleep and not only do I tire more easily than most, I also get a different kind of, and more severe, exhaustion, than most people. I just got a job after being unable to work for a long time. I'm REALLY, REALLY tired. Sharing a car is taking its toll on me. So while I wasn't working (I broke my back and had other issues), all my credit card accounts got closed out and I have a handful of stuff in collections. My credit score is around 575 right now. I feel like shit about my credit but I'm working with the creditors and collections agencies to get my ~&lt;$10k of debt gone. 
  I was wondering if anyone has any input as to if it would be bad to try to finance a car, I'm thinking something that gets me less than $200/month. I found a car that's well under market value and even if I got a crazy interest rate like 15% I'd still be within market value. Before I broke my back I actually sold cars, so I know the criteria for cars for people with bad credit very well. To me, if I could get approved, and have an installment loan on my credit in good standing, financing a car is good in more ways than one and I won't be as exhausted. However, my boyfriend sees it totally differently and freaked out about it. I agree with him as well that I shouldn't add any debt regardless of the circumstances. Which is frustrating because his parents have $70k sitting on interest for him and he complains about his debt and finances. Needless to say he's more uptight about finances than me. I asked if I could get $1000 for a car and he said no. 

Regardless of anything, I need to save at least $1500 for a car. And its been hard to have the discipline. I think I'm just gonna hand the money to my bf every week so I can't touch it. 
 So....TL;DR, want to finance car but know I shouldn't, any tips with discipline in saving money and how to realistically save money? I need to save enough to buy a car that isn't a lemon but enough that I don't die of exhaustion before the year ends. I wish I had parents that could help :(",finance

personalfinance,Student loan vs credit debt payments,"Hey all,

In order to get out of a bad and abusive housing situation, I ran up a lot of credit card debt. I don't regret it because I'd rather be safe than debt-free! However, I do now have a situation where I'd like some advice.

I was having trouble getting the balance down, so I called the card company and I'm now on a financial hardship plan, which in this case is 12 months of a significantly decreased interest rate (I just can't use the card, which is fine by me). Obviously I would like to pay this off as quickly as possible, but I have another large bill: my student loan payment. 

This payment is already as low as I can get it, and I've been paying it off religiously for the last year and a half after putting it on deferment for a bit. 

An aunt suggested I might want to put that loan back on deferment (or whatever the option is called where it still accumulates interest) and put that payment toward my credit card so I can get it down as much as possible in the time allotted for the hardship program. I have about five or six months left of that and I have not paid off nearly as much as i would have liked to (only about 10%, making as large of payments as my budget will allow in that time). 

I'm not sure what to make of her suggestion, basically. Is this a sound financial option? If I did it, I would be able to pay the card down at least another 30% of the balance, vs another 10%. But I don't love the idea of continuing to let my student loans sit.

Would love your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"Want to quit my job but my responsibilities, obviously, doesn't allow me and I need help.","Okay, so let me preface this by saying that this is my first job and my first time dealing with something like this. So, I work at my local Jewel Osco(Albertson Corporation's chain here in Chicago) and I've worked there for almost 9 months. I'm 18 years old and want to quit my job because the summer is coming up and they aren't willing to work around my schedule and I want to have as much fun in my youth as I can with my friends until I grow older and succumb to the responsibilities that come along with age (having a child, getting married, bigger purchases like cars and houses). We planned a weekend about 2 months ago where we would go to my one friend's lakehouse. Well, turns out that they denied these request off days and I wasn't notified of this until the WEEK OF. I wasn't even told that I was denied, the way I found out was that I went on the request-off book and it said denied because ""holiday weekend(memorial day weekend) - everyone needs to work so its fair"", but this was also written down to everyone that also had requested-off that weekend. I would of like to been notified in-person before hand that I didn't get those days so I could talk to my manager or store director on fixing the dates or getting them changes or something along those lines. On that note, I need the money because I still need to pay my phone bill, gym bill, etc., and I don't know how this will affect my future work history. I don't know if how this will affect me getting a different job and if they will look into it and be like, ""we called jewel and they said you just left"". On that note, they are going to lose 3 workers because of retirement that have been working there for 10+ years and they will be heavily short-staffed. Also, the store is known for begging/asking workers to stay because they need all the help they can get. What should I do? Tomorrow was suppose to be the day I quit but I'm stuck and don't know what to do. I'm aiming towards an ultimatum situation because I know 90% chance they will beg me to stay and that I can say that I'll stay if I get the weekend off for this trip, but that's the only option I really have for me? Do I have a good chance of getting a different job if I quit?

Reminder, these are national guardsmen, so after deployment, they will be back in the civilian world. So that is why I am coming to you guys. I need a guideline on what to cover to cater to the majority. 

The class can be however long as I have all the time in the world to spend in a non-wifi base and them not be distracted on phones. Below are some topics off the top of my head. 

TSP and what options are available in it.
 Difference in Roth and Traditional  
 Compound interest calculator  
 Importance of Emergency Fund  
 Debts and interest rates on them  
 Civilian lingo for retirement (401k,529,Etc)

Other than that, I'm not sure what else would be good to cover. I need help putting these ideas in order as I feel like they are everywhere in my mind. Also, I chose here instead of /r/Militaryfinance because of the larger community (longtime lurker of both). 

Thanks in advance guys,
 SGT T. 

EDIT: Most of these guys will be returning to the civilian world/workforce after deployment as they are National Guardsmen.",finance

My FMLA time has been exhausted, as well as my sick leave and vacation time. I am not sure if/when I will be able to return to work, but my manager is desperate to keep me on staff because I fill a specific role and the agency does not currently have the budget for hiring new people.

After months of living off savings without any pay coming in, I was surprised to see that I received a direct deposit from my employer last Friday. My manager used advanced leave for the entire pay period without my permission, and without explaining to me the terms of repayment if I am unable to return to work.

Advance sick leave is essentially like a loan, in my understanding, and this seems fraudulent to have taken out a loan on my behalf without my permission and without informing me of the terms of repayment.

I contacted her in a non-confrontational way over the phone and asked about the deposit. This is how I discovered that she had advanced sick leave without my consent. She openly admitted to it, and thought she was doing me a favor. I have asked her to provide me with exact language detailing what are repayment terms of this money if I am unable to repay through accruing more sick time by returning to work.

What else should I do? Should I speak to her again and record the conversation to prove that she did this without my consent? Should I be reporting this somewhere?

Thank you for any advice and guidance you can provide. This is an incredibly stressful time for me right now with my health situation, and having this to deal with on top of it is a challenge.

personalfinance,Please help me figure out what to do with my debts. Do I get rid of my car and can I finish college?,"I need some help and advice big time. This will be a two part question. 

&amp;nbsp;

Part one.

Back in 2013 I bought a brand new 2014 Mustang with a take home income of $1600/month. I know this was a huge stupid mistake but being 21 and having a family that believes if you can afford the payment you should buy it I dug myself this stupid hole. Anyways I was able to afford the payment as I worked full time but now it’s starting to hinder me because I’m starting to pay on my student loans and I can’t save any money.

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly income: $1,600 (take home)

Car payment: $465

Rent: $250

Insurance: $150

Gym/utilities: $150

Student loan/credit card: $150

Leaving $435 for gas and food for the month. I’m getting by fine because I live with my fiancé and he helps if I ask, but I would really like to fix my situation. Should I try to trade my car in on something cheaper? I don’t think I would get what I owe out of it so they would probably tack on a couple thousand to whatever I buy. Would this be worth it or should I try to refinance (current rate is 7%) and get a lower payment? OR should I take out a small loan and get a cheap $2000 car and try to sell my car to a private buyer for what is still owed?

&amp;nbsp;

Part two.

In 2014 I decided to start college, probably another big mistake. I ended up over borrowing on student loans thinking what I borrowed would be for all 4 years instead of each year (dumb). Fast forward to now and I have dropped out of college because I couldn't decide which route I wanted to take. The school was an expensive public school so I'm only a sophomore and already $35,000 in debt. $15,000 of it is private and the rest is federal. I now have found a much cheaper online university with a degree program I am very interested in and would cost me roughly $20,000 to finish. Should I go ahead and finish college and take out more federal loans to get a degree or should I just try to take one class at a time when I can afford it? OR should I just say screw it and not go back? Also I haven't entered the repayment phase yet because I just dropped out a couple months ago. I'm worried once I do have to start making payments that I won't be able to afford it. This is another reason I am considering starting at the cheaper online university to push out my repayment date.

&amp;nbsp;

*Also should note I have about $1,100 in credit card debt too I'm working on. I'm paying a little more than double on the minimum payment and I know this isn't enough so I would like to start paying more on this too.

&amp;nbsp;

Really appreciate any insight you guys could add to my situation!",finance

economy,No there is not a $2 TRILLION error in the budget,"**No, Trump's budget does not contain a $2 trillion 'math error'**

By Dan Calabrese

For the past 18 hours or so, the mainstream media has joined online lefty sites with the seemingly big news that the 10-year Trump budget plan contains a $2 trillion “math error” that makes the premise of the entire thing totally laughable. What they’re telling you is that the White House counted the same positive numbers twice - once assuming that economic growth would render tax rate cuts revenue neutral, and then counting the same economic growth as the cause of an entirely different $2 trillion in new federal revenue.

Even if you can assume the tax cuts will spur economic growth causing an additional $200 billion in revenue, the left and the media claim, the White House screwed up by counting that revenue twice when in fact it is only going to happen once.

The media and the left are wrong. Or lying. Or both.

**The crux of their mistake is their failure to understand why the White House believes the tax cuts will be revenue-neutral**


The crux of their mistake is their failure to understand why the White House believes the tax cuts will be revenue-neutral. Resulting economic growth is not the reason for that assumption. Rather, it is the intention to couple the reduced rates with the elimination of exemptions and deductions in the tax code.

**Think about it like this: If you make $100,000 and you pay a 35 percent rate, but you can deduct $20,000 from your taxable income, then you’re only paying 35 percent of $80,000, which comes out to $28,000. Now let’s say your tax rate is cut to 28 percent, but your deductions are eliminated. Now you’re paying 28 percent of $100,000. Your tax? Why, it’s $28,000, just as it was before.**

The Trump tax cut proposal is designed to work like that. Now, you might wonder, if everyone is going to pay the same, then what’s the point? The point is that it’s unproductive to spend a lot of time and effort hiding income to avoid being taxed on it. **Make as much income as possible taxable, but cut the rates, and you’ll spur people to direct their capital in more productive directions. That will result in economic growth.**

The media and the left completely miss this. They think Trump is counting on faster economic growth to make the tax cuts revenue-neutral. In other words, they’re assuming the rate cuts are not accompanied by any change in exemptions or deductions, such that they will reduce revenue at the exact same rate as the rate cuts themselves. But that’s not true, because eliminating the exemptions and deductions results in more taxable income and thus higher revenues to offset the rate cuts. The media and the left totally miss this.

Why? Because they’re stupid. And dishonest.

**OMB Director Mick Mulvaney tries to explain to New York Magazine, not that they’re listening:**


Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters that his plan assumes the Trump tax cuts would be revenue neutral — which is to say, **for every dollar of lost revenue through lower rates, it would produce another dollar of higher revenue through reduced tax deductions or loopholes.** And then the revenue-neutral plan would produce so much growth that overall revenue would rise:

“We stand by the numbers. We thought that the assumption that the tax reform would be deficit-neutral was the most reasonable of the three options that we had. We could either assume that our tax reform was deficit-neutral. We could assume it would reduce the deficit. We would assume it would add to the deficit. And given the fact that we’re this early in the process about dealing with tax reform, we thought that assuming that middle road was the best way to do it.”

An OMB official gave the same explanation to Politico’s Michael Grunwald: “A senior OMB official told me the double-counting accusations are wrong, because the budget assumes tax reform will be deficit-neutral without taking growth into account.”

New York Magazine goes on to completely dismiss the explanation, but at least they reported it. Most of the media who are wetting their pants over this “mistake” or “scam” aren’t even taking Mulvaney’s explanation into account, let alone understanding it.

**Media are being dishonest with you when they claim Trump is double-counting the growth estimate in his budget projection**

Now to be sure, the assumption of 3 percent growth or higher is a very optimistic scenario. If it happens, it will represent much better growth than we had at any point during the Obama years. But the whole point of cutting taxes and simplifying the code is to create a more positive environment to spur that kind of growth. **So is the administration’s move to end Obama’s nonstop harassment of the business community via regulations, investigations, lawsuits and unionization campaigns.**

There is no doubt in my mind that if the entire Trump agenda is implemented, we’ll get the growth envisioned in this budget plan. The question is whether Congress will pass the whole thing.

Either way, the media are being dishonest with you when they claim Trump is double-counting the growth estimate in his budget projection. He’s not. The elimination of exemptions and deductions is one factor. Expected economic growth is an entirely different factor. The fact that they’re still telling you this is a lie, a mistake or a scam shows that they either don’t understand the tax code, or don’t understand economics . . . or are simply liars.

personalfinance,"PhD student, medical bills, CC debt, 401k (ack!)","Hi,

28, f, no children.

* Assets:21,000 in 401K
* Income: 1650 a month
* Medical Debt (on credit cards): soon to be $15,000, interest rates between 15% and 25%, might have some tricks to lower interest rates, but alas... 

I am having surgery in June, and some of the costs aren't covered by my insurance. I am running the math (have used YNAB for about 3 years straight no) and I am having a hard time seeing how I can pay off this high-interest debt with my current income.

It would be very hard for me to get another job, physically due to medical issues. I am pretty bound to desk-type work. I have a BS Chemical Engineering and an M.Eng Environmental Engineering, so I have qualifications, but with my PhD work I don't have too much time to increase income. I have thought about quitting my PhD to try to find a job again after I heal up. this is my dream though and I would like to stick it out just 3 more years to get my PhD. I encountered medical issues recently that have wiped out a lot of savings and left me with just my 401k and impending debt

I have been working with a Debt Payoff Calculator and after rent, cell phone, saving 20 a month for the dog, allowing for 0 spending money and 20 a month on fuel etc, I can contribute 800 a month to debt. In this time I might accrue about 5000 in interest.

This might be a rare case in which early withdrawing my 401k might make sense. I would have roughly 15,000 to work with after my penalty, and the money lost almost matches the interest I would pay if I didn't do this. I also simply do not think paying 800 a month is sustainable for two years. I am sure I will need to buy shampoo at some point. I already use food stamps and would only eat on food stamps (no restaurants) for 2 years. I would have to sell my car and pay no auto insurance and always use my boyfriend's car for this to work also. I can try it but it doesn't seem sustainable. 

Cashing out 401k is such a disastrous move. I simply don't know what to do. My insurance really boned me on this one. I thought I had all my bases covered but they decided not to cover a portion of this surgery. I am appealing the decision, but want to have a financial plan set.

Also - I can take out $5800 in student loans at 5.8% three times a year, which I could use to really reduce the interest rate of my debt, but it would simply shift it out of sight. That is another solution. Stay afloat as best I can, max out these student loans, then pay off the student loans. I think this makes more financial sense than killing my 401k.

* Option 1 - Try to use 50% of my income towards debt when I already make less than 20k a year, might not be sustainable
* Option 2 - Take out student loans to pay off the credit card loans (phd student benefit) and then worry about those more in 3 years when I get my engineering phd
* Option 3 - Wipe out my 401k right now, with the $6000 penalty almost matching the interest I would already pay if I live on $900 a month for the next two years. I would use the next few years to build back up my emergency fund (which is gone) and such

personalfinance,"Help! Slave to my car payment, and not sure of my options.","Hi everyone, thanks for reading - this is my first post here and it's great to see everyone helping each other out.

I'm currently in a tight situation regarding my car payment. I bought a certified pre-owned 2013 vehicle back in 2014. Right now my interest rate is incredibly high at around 13% due to bad credit back then. My monthly payment is around 337/mo with an outstanding balance of $8,809.29, with 31 payments left. I feel like I'm getting robbed, especially when I make 40k/year before taxes.

I was thinking about getting rid of this car, and finding something more reasonable so I can significantly lower my monthly payments, or eliminate them completely.

What do you believe to be the best way to go about this? My fear is that I will sell this car and get a cheaper one, but still have money owed. Not sure what to do here or how car trading/selling works.

Anyhow, I decided to have some fun with it, and have it calculate my exact FIRE date.  Obviously, there's too many variables for this to be accurate to the day, especially if your FIRE date is way in the future.  It's not accounting for the likes of Social Security, or a change in expenses, etc.  Consider the FIRE date to be just for fun, and don't start holding me to anything :)  Of course, it will become more accurate as you get closer to your FIRE date and you continue to update it.

personalfinance,Federal limit on account transfers /mo - and my automated savings setup,"My online savings account has the option of creating up to 25 savings accounts on one login so that you can easily earmark savings.

However they say there is a federal regulation limiting the total number of withdrawals from one account to 6 per month.

I like to use the accounts to earmark different savings goals and have a monthly budget set up to save for each one. This gets transferred out of the main savings account, where my paycheck is DD to, and then gets transferred to each sub-account.

However I can't make it very flexible with only 6 xfers per month! My only other option is to have my paycheck DD into 2 different savings accounts so I get a limit of 6 withdrawals * 2

* Paycheck Direct Deposit --&gt; to these 3 accounts
    * Day-to-day checking account [  enough for known and budgeted monthly expenses e.g. rent, food, gas, bills, spending  ]
    * Main Online Savings Account [ enough for known and budgeted savings goals ] 
    * Online Savings Sub-Account [ bonuses and everything else (for investments) ]


* DD from Paycheck --&gt; main online savings acct --&gt; autotransferred to following sub-accounts
    * car replacement fund (83/mo AUTO)
    * car maintenance fund (50/mo AUTO)
    * vacation fund (125/mo AUTO)
    * emergency account (if I spent any on an emergency, very rare, MANUAL) ^*emergency refills come from short-term spending budget
    * short term spending acct, e.g. house projects or upgrades / consumables ( $200/mo, MANUAL)

* DD From Paycheck --&gt; Online savings sub-acct
    * investment (all left over $$) --&gt; from here I transfer out quarterly to vanguard

I determine manual payments by this rule set, which is based on my annual budget for certain things.

Car Maint | 50 /mo | AUTO | unlimited / cap @ 5k | --
Car Replacement | 83/mo | AUTO | 10,000 | 120

Short Term Spending | 200 /mo | AUTO | varies | --
Emergency | x | MANUAL | 20,000 | --
Invest | remainder | MANUAL | 25,000/yr | 12

so thats 5 transfers right there on one account, leaving me 1 spare transfer for moving money around if I need to do anything special. I guess to complete this I'll have to split my work's direct deposit! they only allow us 3!

So each month on the first I go through my accounts, figure out how much each MANUAL transaction will be according to my rules, and perform them while logged into the bank. On this day I also pay my CC statement.

personalfinance,Navy Federal Credit Cardholders now get free Fico® Score 9 based on Equifax data,"Hi PF. First post here. I just stumbled upon this new feature when I logged on today online. I own NFCU CashRewards and when I logged in, this was a new feature and it was under my Visa Signature cashRewards.

Unlike other CCs that has this free Fico score feature, they will update the data twice a month. it looks like the same layout as Discover It and AMEX's Fico page so you'll be able to view history as well. This is good news to those who want to keep tabs on their credit scores without paying extra for the service.

I am glad to see this new feature since I already have Discover It card (Transunion Fico 8) and AMEX BCE (Experian Fico 9) in my wallet. This completes the big 3 for me with the introduction of Equifax Fico 9 on this credit card.",finance

personalfinance,College student with two jobs. Tips for organizing my income and saving money in general (particularly in the summer)?,"Specific questions are at the bottom of the post.

&gt;WORDED SUMMARY

I'm living on campus this summer working part-time with my university. I started this job on May 15th. The job only pays $8 an hour and the hours are pretty shitty, but a huge benefit is the university gives me a free place to stay which means no rent/utility bills. I make about **$144-$192  per week** with this job and get paid on the **1st and 15th of every month.** I will be working at/saving from this job for **11 weeks** starting June 1st.

My second job is at a textile mill. This job pays more and generally gives more hours. At this job I make **$12.22 per hour**, for the first 5 weeks I will start off full time (due to training) making **$488.88 per week**. After those five weeks  are up, my hours will be cut in half so I will  make **$244.44 per week**. This job pays **bi-weekly**. I start this job on June 1st. I will be working at/saving from this job for **11 weeks.** with the opportunity to continue into the fall depending on my performance starting June 1st.

I do not own a car (although it would be beneficial). There are free buses in the town which I live and I also bike around places. My only needed expense is food which I spend ~$100 on per  month with help from my mom. Financial aid and scholarships pays for my college expenses. I literally have $1.52 until I receive my first paycheck from job number one and my final paycheck from a  job I recently left on Jun. 1st. These paychecks combined total will only be ~$400.

I'm also going to start donating blood plasma at a local bank twice a week, bringing in $60 per week. And I will also be receiving a $1,500 scholarship that will be deposited into my bank account at the start of the fall semester. Since, my school bills are already covered, I plan on saving this money.


I have $-2.33 in my bank account at the moment. $0 in Savings. I owe my previous bank $58 dollars, and I have maxed out my main credit card and am ~$500 in credit card debit. I have an Old Navy credit card with a limit of $5,000 that I don't use so my credit score isn't too bad off 656. 

Some big purchases I plan on saving up for are a cheap used craigslist car which I hope to have by August and an apartment in which I plan to have by January. For the car I hope to find something in the $2,500-$3,000 and for the apartment I want to find something $700 a month or under (which isn't hard seeing as how I will be living with a roommate and housing in my state is relatively cheap). I want to  save up at $3,000 for apartment expenses (rent/utilities/furniture/etc.) I don't have to save up too much for this particularly this summer, I just want to get a head start. I plan on working in the fall to save up for the majority of this.

My cellphone bill $30 per month. My minimum credit card payment is $25. An investment  I'm looking to make is  into driving classes because I haven't got a license yet. These classes will cost a total of $350.

My college is in a very rural town so I will not spend a lot of money on leisure. Mostly because I will be working or in class. All the leisure activities such as fishing, hiking, camping are free. I'm not a big shopper either and I refuse to go out dining, all my meals will  be home cooked. My only completely unnecessary expenses will come from purchases of beer and weed. Which will probably total about ~$60 per month.

&gt;QUESTONS

1. My plan is to pay off all my debt and for my driving classes in June. As well as set aside money for food,  leisure, and phone bill for the rest of the summer.
I will receive my first pay check on June 1st. It consist of hours made through training at one of my new jobs and a few hour worked at a job I recently quit (for a better one). This check will be under $400.
Should I use this money to chop off a large chunk of my credit card bill? If so how much of this check should I dedicate towards the credit card bill? Should I disperse the money evenly upon all my debts? How much money from this , should I save for personal expenses? I don't get paid again until the 14th/15th and this check should be about around the $800-900 range.

3. Should I even approach the debt with urgency? Is it ok if decide to use my first check to pay for the driving courses instead? Can't I just completely wipe out the debt with one of the more substantial paycheck  I'll receive in the following week?

4. How much money should I dedicate weekly towards saving up for the car and apartment? The car I hope to buy by August, so it is more of an urgent situation. The apartment however, I have until June to save up for.

5. How much money in general do you all suggest I should keep in my checking? How about for savings? I am 20 years old if age plays any part in it. Should the majority of my earnings go into my savings?

6. Is there a certain amount  of cash I should carry on me at all times.

7. Any money saving apps or desktop downloads out there that would be helpful?

8. At my age, should I be looking into the stock market/investments? I know nothing about this stuff. Any sources that could explain the basic to me in a way that is easy to understand.

9. What additional expenses can I expect to come with a used car bought directly from an owner?

10. What hidden expenses can I expect to come with an apartment.

11. I will have about 20k in federal student loans by time I graduate. If I can afford to pay this all off at once, should I? Or is it smarter to keep that money for other expenses and just pay the loan payments.  I don't think the monthly loan payments will be that big of a burden compared to how much I will be making by time I graduate.

12. Is there any balance between monthly income and how much you should spend on leisure?

Lastly, any random tips or advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Recent grad with decent starting salary ($65k) and subsidized loans. Should I pay off the loans early? + Other questions,"My situation is better than many college graduates, and I want to make the most of it and deal with my loans correctly. I have a few things going on, so hopefully I can lay it out clear out that we can reconcile all of the moving parts.

* My income is pretty good at about $65000 gross income with $47,486 estimated after taxes (sin 401k benefits). I start early August.
* Until then, I am living at home pretty much for free with $2000 in my checking/savings accounts.
* My loan is pretty small, at $5,500 with a subsidized 3.78% interest rate for six year starting in December 2016.
* I have a Roth IRA account with Edward Jones (I know. I know. I intend to make a move to Vanguard or another firm during this summer) worth of $18k. As far as I know, I can deduct funds from my Roth IRA to pay for educational expenses, but I figure that is probably unwise.
* I just opened a Chase Sapphire Preferred Card because I'll be traveling a little for work. If I don't reach the 4-month minimum of $4000 spent. The card should get here in 2 weeks. I got the card sooner than my start date because I figured I can get pretty close to the minimum spending using my employer's full compensation of my relocation expenses (e.g., flying out to scout for accommodations, shipping, etc). In case I do not get close enough to the minimum by the end of the four months, I figured I can pay off my loans equal to the amount needed to satisfy the minimum.

My questions: 
* Should I simply pay the minimum on my loans for a while or try to reduce it sharply in the first few years?
 * Is using my credit card (while paying it off every month) to pay off the loans a smart way to reach the minimum if necessary? 
* How pressing is it that I drop Edward Jones for an IRA elsewhere? 
* Once I start, should I max out both the 401k (for employer match) and IRA ($5,500?)? How should I prioritize paying off loans and building my retirement vs. building an emergency fund to last 3-6 months?",finance
personalfinance,Which credit card should I apply for?,"I'm almost 21 years old and have never had a credit card.

I downloaded the Credit Karma app to check my credit score and this is what I have:

https://imgur.com/a/4VfU2

In 2015 I took a year off from college after my first semester. After the first 6 months, I had to make monthly payments on my federal student loans since there's only a 6 month grace period. Once I returned to school, I didn't have to make payments anymore so I stopped. I just finished my sophomore year and so far I have about $12k in federal student loans that I used to pay for college. I'm guessing that making those monthly payments while out of school brought up my credit score a bit. Not bad for 2 years at a private university:

https://imgur.com/a/ZXsXY

Anyways, I figured now that I should open a credit card and start building my credit. The main reason I want to do this is so that I can build good enough credit so that I can apply for private student loans for my junior and senior years at college. Unfortunately, I do not have anyone to cosign (parents are out of the question), so I want to get the best rate when I apply for these loans in August. Also, federal loans will not be enough to cover the cost of tuition + room &amp; board so it's really my only choice. 

On credit karma, I see that I have offers for three different credit cards:

https://imgur.com/a/hs7sf

Which one of these three cards should I apply for? I don't really know much about credit cards so that's why I came here to ask. To me, it seems like the Capital One Journey Student card is my best option (if I get approved). 

I honestly don't expect to use a credit card that often. I plan on spending maybe $40-$50 max a month and just paying that off at the end of the month.

Can anyone chime in and help me pick from these three cards? Besides these three cards are there any other credit cards I can apply for with my status?

personalfinance,I haven't filed taxes in 6 years and I'm default on student loans for just as long. How do I turn this around.,"Theres this crushing weight of impending doom and anxiety that has kept me from doing anything about my taxes but I have a bit of courage at this moment so here we go. Throwaway account because idk. 



I run a freelance DBA photography business out of MA, on paper it started June 2010 when I opened a business account with Bank of America. Due to the nature of my business, all of my work was paid for in cash and deposited in cash. Theres no record of who paid me and how much they paid me for most of my time, it was all just deposited. All expenses were made through the bank account but sadly all of my personal purchases were too. In recent years my payments have transitioned to checks, wires, venmo, ect. The past two years have been entered in quickbooks self-employed but I still havent made it to a CPA with my financial mess out of fear. 



I would say I average 35-40k a year. I have no savings and live month to month. 



In 2011 my parents were unable to continue helping me pay my student loans so thats when the payments stopped because they were so large that I couldnt make payments. I couldnt get them readjusted because I didnt have my taxes done. Originally my loan was through Sallie Mae but the last few times i remember getting a call the loan was under a different company. I dont know how much I owe or how many loans there are. My FICO credit is 630. I do have a car loan under my name that was made before the student loans went default, i was somewhere in the high 700s. 
**EDIT**: Loans are federal, taken out in MA
I'd like to add my school is apart of the Art Institutes, the one sued by the justice department and has since closed down. 


My whole life is held back by the fact that I dont have my taxes done. I cant get state health insurance, I cant get credit, I cant rent better apartments or work spaces, I have to pay for all my equipment upfront which is very difficult to navigate when Im month to month. I'm sick of having this weight on me and need to move forward with my life and business.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my credit card debts with a loan?,"So I am in debt. It's manageable but it's not really going down. It has come about after a few years of faffing about, some screwy shit that happened with my previous job (didn't get paid a fair bit), and then a long stint of being unemployed. 

Either way I am in debt now. I now have a reasonably well paid job and own a flat which I get rental money through, but I live in London so everything is super expensive. 

I have three cards. One is 0% so that's fine, has about £4k on it. 

I have an Amex with £7k on it, and another card with just under £3k. This doesn't take into account as well my overdraft, which is about 2k.

So I'm around £12k in interest paying debt. I'm paying probably £150-200 a month in interest. 

I earn £1800 a month after student loans, tax etc, and also get £910 rental income. Main outgoing is paying my rent (£725, all bills) and then travel, which is probably £100 a month. 

When I get paid I pretty much pour all my money into my cards. Half into each pretty much, and pay the minimum on the 0%. Yet each month they just come back up. They have gone down a bit, but not as much as I had anticipated since the start of the year. 

I have been considering taking out a loan. Interest rates are super low (12k over 3 years at 3% ain't too bad) and I have a good credit rating still somehow. I hear people scowl at the idea of taking out debt to pay off debt though so I am unsure what to do really. I thought I would post here for advice. 

Should I continue what I'm doing (maybe implement a better pay off plan on my credit cards?) or take out a short term loan with the bank and pay off my cards that way?",finance
personalfinance,Rolling over EE Bonds,"From what I understand, a single person can take out $10000 of EE bonds per year. They have a stupid low interest rate, but at the 20 year mark, they instantly double. $10000 can be broken down into $833 dollar monthly investments, which, after 20 years, will cash out to $1666 per bond. 

I want to know if there's anything wrong with using those bonds as a circular form of income. After those initial 20 years of payments, that money is doubled and could simply be rolled over without having to use any other outside funds. Is there anything wrong with this logic? I was thinking cashing a bond each month could be another form of income during retirement. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,Advice needed - Not sure if I'm utilizing all of my resources / What more can I do?,"Hello Reddit,

This is my first post, so bear with me. I am a 25yo who  (this time last year) got out of a pretty bad situation (mentally) and decided to turn everything back around. Long story short, I currently have an amazing career in IT, live with parents, and have minimal bills. 

I have an annual salary of about 40-45k (base salary, mileage reimbursements, quarterly commission). I save most of that due to only paying for my cellphone and car note (~$500/mo). I have just over 16k left on my auto loan. I have $15k saved in a checking account. I do not have a savings account due to not wanting to open another account, seems pointless with pretty much nothing as an interest rate. I signed up for a Simple IRA in Jan with Fidelity via my employer who matches 3% of my annual salary. I only automatically have 3% taken from my pay to throw in there - currently $504 in IRA. I have not moved my money around from my default ""short-term"" asset allocation. (Not sure where to put it, how much, ect.) I have an account with Acorns; though it doesn't do much, I do like the idea of round-ups being placed away. I recently purchased some Ethereum after doing massive research and truly believing in the future and deployment of the technology.

I wanted to ask the best community for some advice on what more I can be doing to get the most out of my situation. How to invest, where to invest, should I take a bulk amount of my total and drop it on my car loan principal? What would you do?

I'm living off base, which means I get Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH - which varies based on the cost of living of the area I'm currently assigned... $800 to $1,300 or so per month seems to be the norm). The cool thing about BAH is that I get to pocket what I don't use for housing, which right now is a little under $100 - the rest (about $1,000) going toward rent and utilities at one of the cheapest local apartments I was able to find.

I hate seeing that much money disappear each month just to pay rent, and I've got it in my head that a camping trailer may be the golden ticket to pocketing MUCH more of my BAH each month; and keep me equipped with a roof over my head even if I get orders to another base (the idea of being able to just up and move my entire 'house' is extremely appealing to me).

That said, I have no idea what the cost of living would look like for something like this, and I'm concerned that what I save by not paying rent will just get eaten up by costs I'm not familiar with. That and I've seen quite a few of these trailers on sale on base, which kinda tells me that other Airmen have had the same idea and found that it wasn't what they had hoped.

Anyway, I'm hoping to find some insight on what all I would have to pay for on a monthly basis with a setup like this - if any of you have lived or are living that life, how did you go about it? Just rent a spot at one of those RV campsite type of places, or are there better options? Were your utility bills noticeably more or less than what you'd expect in an apartment/small house? Would it be plausible to have things like a legit internet connection, or should I expect to rely mostly on cell networks?

Also, how would I tackle that initial purchase? I've got an 'okay' little car right now, but it definitely couldn't handle any kind of trailer; so I'd be looking to buy both the camping trailer and a truck to pull it (and probably sell the car, which looks like I could expect around $3k for). Or should I consider and actual RV? (a truck/trailer combo seems a lot more versatile, since I could leave the trailer parked, and the use the truck for everyday transportation... but I'm open to suggestions). So, 5K in the bank and an extra 3K if I sell my car makes a truck and trailer look pretty out of reach... I guess I'd have to get a loan, but my only experience with those if from college, and I'm already getting my ass kicked by interest (even though it's reasonably low interest [thank God!]) so I'm super hesitant to dig myself even deeper.

Or should I just shut up and keep paying my rent?

Thanks all!!",finance
personalfinance,Loans - HELP,"I'm trying my best to understand loans and would love any help. I currently have 3 loans out with different amounts and different interests rate for each.

Loan #1: interest rate of 6.21%
Loan #2: interest rate of 5.84%
Loan #3: interest rate of 5.31%

It seems like there's different ways to pay off loans and I'm not sure what is the BEST way to save the MOST money.

Option #1: Pay off interest for all 3 loans first, then pay principal beginning with the loan with the highest interest (#1) and working your way down.

Option #2: Pay off the ENTIRE loan #1 (principal AND interest) because it is the highest interest rate and work my way down that way.

Also, I am STILL in school and STILL adding to my loans, so another option is just to pay my tuition cash this year and not take out loans.

Can anyone shed some insight onto which would save me the most money and is financially the most feasible?",finance

personalfinance,"Was $30k+ in debt, now $16k. How to beat the interest. (Steps)","Everyday I see on reddit that people are in debt and unsure how to overcome it. I was the same way and have tried all the methods I've seen and just kept getting further and further into debt. Now as an analyst for a government company, I see a lot of wasted money and have to figure out how to stop the bleeding for them, but never could do it for myself...

My debts included (not including student loans because I will die with those...)
$12k auto loan @ 9.94%, $22k in credit and store card ~22-24%.

My credit score hung around 600 on a good day so I know many of you will understand the high interest rates.

I'll put this in step by step form so if you want to try it out, it may make things a bit easier.

1. Get you income amount after taxes (the amount on your check), subtract all your expenses (rent/mortgage, insurance, food, gas, utilities, going out money, etc) and overestimate that, never underestimate or you will be charging back to credit. It's best to break these expenses down weekly or bi-weekly, depending how you're paid.
ALSO STOP BUYING USELESS SHIT.

2. Take the remaining money (after tax amount - left over money from expenses): ex. $500/wk - $350 expenses = $150 free money.

3. Now get a breakdown of all your account balances and the interest rate for each account and put them into an excel spreadsheet (column A put the account name, column B put the balance, column C put the interest rate), if you are not good with excel you can handwrite this all out and use a calculator.

4. In column D you need to find the daily interest rate (%interest / 365) you should get a number like 0.000627
*Picked daily compound interest as a way to normalize all numbers and make them more simple to calculate and rationalize.

5. In column E you need to find the monthly interest you are getting charged (first get the balance x the daily interest in step 4. second multiple that number by 31) ex. for $2200 @ 23.7% you are paying $44.36 a month in interest.

6. Once you have done this for all accounts, you will see what you are paying each month in interest, now take the highest number and pay your $150 free money to that card.

7. Update your spreadsheet with the new balance and do this week after week. Pay ONLY the highest balance down. If you have another card due, pay the minimum and deduct that from your free money and pay the rest to the highest monthly interest card.

I did this for 6 ish months now, and pay about $400/week and have got down from over 32k to 16k. A did get a couple thousand back from taxes and that went right into it too. Also my credit score is now up to almost 700. So I plan to refinance my car at a much lower rate...

Good luck and remember that you can overcome debt, took me 6 years to find a job where I had some extra cash but now I plan to be debt free by the end of 2018.

TLDR; Had $32k in debt, paid all my extra money to accounts I paid the most interest every week, now down to $16k in less than a year.



EDIT: Added the notation of daily compound interest to step 4.",finance
personalfinance,Buying home with as small of a down payment as possible. Options? Details in post.,"Hey everyone, my mom is prepping to buy her first home since getting divorced in 2000. She's been renting at an upscale apartment complex for 17 years now and with climbing rent costs and low interest rates, the time seems to be right to buy.  


She found a house that she wants that is in her price range at $145,000 in great condition. Pretty much everything was remodeled or updated within 5 years and it is immaculate. The problem is, she is worried about coming up with a down payment as she doesn't want to be ""cash poor"" going into a new home. She currently has $5,000 saved but the down payment with the FHA loan that she qualifies for would be around $4,000. The monthly payment would be cheaper than her current living situation ($1,040 a month plus utilities at the apartment) so she would be able to save more than she can now once getting into the home.  


What is the best way to come up with the down payment without using all of her available savings? The realtor suggested adding it into the mortgage, but the loan officer didn't make it sound as easy as the realtor did. She has a substantial 401k but she would like to refrain from borrowing from that too. Is there something we're missing here? The house is not in the qualifying USDA map area either so that option is spent. Please help with any suggestions!

Edit: We're in PA if that helps with anything

Edit #2 (5/26/17): She was given pre-approval for an FHA Loan at 3.75%. Payment would be $976 with mortgage, insurance and taxes escrowed. $5,076 would be due down and the realtor is pushing for seller concession to pay the closing costs.",finance

personalfinance,I lost 47 points off my excellent credit score for my first ever late payment in 14 years. Am I SOL or can I do something about it?,"So I had a very good credit score, in the 770 average between the 3 companies.    Then I went out of the country, and I thought my credit card was paid off.  It got a 17 cent interest charge from daily interest rate calcs, I did not check the account for about two months, it got $40 in late fees, and sent to the credit bureaus. I lost 47 points off one and 46 off another.  The card is thru a small employer credit union, who only sends paper statements.  You can pay online but they don't even send email notifications. I immediately paid the bill after I got an email from credit karma notifying me of a delinquency on my credit reports.

I can't believe that I lost so many points for such a tiny infraction. On credit karma, I went from 100% on time payments to 99.6% and lost almost 50 points.  I emailed the credit union, and they said it is reported by a vendor and they don't even get notified until it is 60 days late.  They gave me the phone number for the vendor.  I could call them, but what do I even say?  Ask them to do me a favor?  Why should they?  Its a legitimate charge, I just didn't see the bill because I was out of the country and they don't send email notifications.

This is particularly upsetting because I will need to buy a new car soon and since I dropped below 750, I will no longer qualify for the rest interest rates. I could pay thousands more over the life of the loan because I once was late paying my $0.17 bill.  WTF!?

Am I shit out of luck or is there anything I can do about this?  How can they possibly justify docking me so many points for such a tiny amount on one single bill?  I have heard most credit repair companies are scams, but I have never looked into them in detail before.  Is this true?   I really want this removed from my credit report entirely.  Just marking it as paid will really not be good enough.  Help please!",finance

personalfinance,Pay raise after 3 years - not including retroactive pay.,"I've been at my company for 3 years. I had not gotten a yearly raise the entire time. It came to a point where I was fed up so I went to HR to ask why. I had asked my manager for weeks but could not get a response. HR said they would take care of it. It took 2 weeks but I checked my pay stub today to see I got a $2 pay bump, from $15 to $17/hr. That's ~4.3%. I've been told the max is USUALLY 3%.

I am an hourly employee, so I did the math from my paystub. The total gross pay only shows the total hours + the hourly rate (i.e. $17 x 40hours). No addition from retro pay that I can see. According to my calculations, I was given ~4.3% raise. I don't understand. 

Did they factor in the retroactive so they bumped it up to 4.3% THIS time instead of the regular 3%? Did they do this instead of giving me retroactive pay? Aren't I still owed a different check for 3 years of retroactive pay even if they gave me the yearly raise? What is my course of action now?",finance

personalfinance,Would love some help understanding federal loans and deciding whether to use them. I also have tuition benefit through my job. Torn between saving money and advancing my career.,"Hi PF, I am working on my MPH (just started last semester) and working full time. I am allotted 9 credit hours of free tuition every academic year (across fall, spring and summer semester). Before I started the MPH, I applied for financial aid, was denied, and then I forgot about it. I just finished up my first semester all paid for by my employer. Today I got an email from my university that I've been awarded a ""federal grad PLUS loan"" and a ""fed direct loan-unsubsidized"" that amount to what I would need if I were paying for the degree myself. 
I've been going back and forth (long before I got the notification of these awards) about just taking out private loans and knocking out more classes per semester in addition to my tuition benefit, because I'd like it to not take me 3 more years to finish the degree. A few reasons for this:
-I can make more money in my field once I have the Masters
-I'm not totally wedded to working for this employer for the next 3-4 years, I'd like to have some flexibility to get a different job in the future, but as long as I'm working on this degree it makes sense to keep working here. I do love my job, but there are also so many other great opportunities out there that I have the skill set for now, but wouldn't take because they don't pay for tuition and I know in the long run I need that master's degree for my career.

So. I am in the very fortunate situation of not having any student debt from undergrad. I'm not sure how to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of student loans. I hate the idea of taking out loans. But I love the idea of advancing my career faster. I'm not sure how the federal loans I mentioned above work. Should I consider accepting them (or rather a portion of them) and paying for some of my schooling to get done faster? I know some of this is a personal choice but from a financial perspective, is it just dumb to even consider given that I have the tuition benefit?
Every time I window-shop for jobs in my field I see ""Masters required"" and I think to myself, oh someday.. I mean I'm already working in my field but not at the level I would like to get to.
Thank you in advance for your insights and advice.",finance
personalfinance,"[21F] Just lost my job, starting college in the fall. Considering relocating for a job.","So I just lost my job working full time. My expenses are as follows:
$475/mo rent
Half of utilities which are usually $75 for internet and ranges from $100-$150 and since I'm in Florida this WILL go up because it's going to be a hot summer.
$138 phone (I am still financing a phone or I'd down my plan some)

I used to work from home so I have no car. I have a pretty good stockpile of food because I've lost my job before and running out of food is one of my biggest fears so I can hold off on groceries for a bit. 

I have three credit cards, one is 0% through early next year, the other has a high interest rate but low credit limit so I've always paid it off in full each month, and the last is an Amazon card with a few hundred dollars on it some of which is 0% for six months. 

I live in Tampa, FL and my dream is to go work as a manager in human resources for Disney. My boyfriend has a higher up job with them and I used to work for their reservation center which is how we met. We both have dreams to move out to Orlando but I don't think he's going to want to move in with me just yet because we're just not there in our relationship and he has a house far from where we both want to be. 

I have an interview for a job with Disney as a housekeeper. It would be a pay cut from the $15 I was making per hour to around $11 an hour, but it is full time and respectable work I think. It isn't the most glamorous job there is but I feel like I would be good at it. I have a few more jobs with them that would be more money but they haven't contacted me about those yet so I'm hanging tight to see if they want me for those positions which would be better. 

I have nothing in savings cause savings went to bills. I was planning on maybe subletting my half of the apartment I'm in, finding someone looking for a roommate close to where I'll be working if I get the job and taking the bus every day while I finish up school.

I have two semesters left for my AA. I have accepted subsidized loans to cover these but since currently I'm enrolled at a state community college the tuition is pretty low so I think I may be able to pay those off before they start accruing interest if I can get a full time job. All of my classes are online except one I have to physically go in for the midterm and final but I expect as a one off type of thing my boyfriend will take me in his car or my mom will help me out. After that I had planned on transferring to UCF and thus moving out to Orlando to get my BA in communications and then my masters. The best case scenario would have been my saving up for it until my AA was finished THEN moving out there, but that isn't really an option at this point. I know it may seem silly for an hourly housekeeping job but I feel like it's better to get my foot in the door ASAP with the company knowing I want to use my degree with them. It'll look better later on having already worked for the company for a few years after my degrees are done and I want to go for that manager spot. 

I don't really know how I'm going to pay for college after finishing my AA. Probably the lowest interest loans I can get and hope to pay them off after I get that good corporate manager position I'm aiming for. 

It would be a tight squeeze because of the pay cut and trying to pay off those loans but I could go ramen noodle diet for a while. I just don't know if this is absolutely crazy or not. My parents have jumped from job to job to job all their life and lived paycheck to paycheck for most of my life. I want more than that. I want a good job that I don't hate and a decent house down the line and I feel like if I want that then I need to fight and take some risks for it.

I guess I just wanted to come here for some advice. I don't know if this is insane to go uproot my life, but I've ALWAYS wanted to move out there and I feel like it might help me get what I want.",finance

personalfinance,Should I take full Direct unsubsidized federal loan for grad school or use investment?,"Hi personal finance,
I'm wondering what the best option is for how to pay for grad school. I have 4 years of school and I was offered $40,500 direct unsubsidized federal loan for the first year. With my limited finance knowledge, it seems best to keep my money invested and take the full loan as long as the investment return is higher than the interest on the loans (I don't know what the interest on the load will be or when it will start accruing). Also considering going into the military and I think the govt would partially repay the loans if I did? However, I am not committed to the military option and don't know if I could get more assistance through FAFSA next year if I had less invested.

Investment info: I have $82,000 in investment (60% stocks, 40% bonds, 11.4% time-weighted return over last year), $36k in trad IRA, and $11k in Roth IRA.

Thanks for your insight.",finance
personalfinance,Anxiety over student debt while in school?,"From what I know about PF, this probably isn't the best place when you're anxious but...oh well. I need real advice (this is a throwaway account btw).

I'm going to be entering my sophomore year of college at a fairly prestigious private university. Price wise the school was definitely affordable especially with the payment plan, however the aid wasn't quite enough. Because of a few issues with my app **I've had to take out close to $10,000 in loans for one year.** $2k of that is private, but the rest is mostly unsubsidized plus the usual amount of subsidized loans. I accepted this because 1) my state university was only cheaper if I lived off campus (many reasons why I chose not to and I think I made the right choice) and 2) Because of issues with the noncustodial parent my financial aid was late. However talking to my FA adviser she said they had still met my full need.

Financial aid for next semester comes out mid-June which is ridiculous. Like if I can't afford to go I'm pretty much stuck, especially because with our payment plan the first payment will be due in July. I'm really anxious because last years aid was barely affordable (even removing those special circumstances) and ou r income has risen so I feel they will screw us over doubly. My mom doesn't seem worried about the loans, she says worst case scenario I live at home--that sounds horrible but it's something I'll d0 if my loans keep increasing at the same rate. I'm really hoping to just take the normal $6500 in Federal loans this year and if that continues I won't graduate with more the ~$30k which isn't bad for an accounting major coming from a very strong program (**average salaries for accounting grads at my school is about $60k but many are on track to become CPAs**).

**But at this rate I'd graduate with about $40k in debt.** I have a summer job which I'll be using 90% of the income to start paying off the federal loans. But that's a drop in the bucket and will mean little if I have to take out another $10k. I feel like $40k is too much, especially since it's not guaranteed I become an accountant, and I might take an extra semester to meet the 150 credit requirement to sit for the CPA exam.

This probably all sounds like a massive jumble and rant, but I already feel trapped by debt and I don't know if I'm overreacting, and even if I'm not I don't see any way out.",finance
personalfinance,Is this...balance transfer? going to benefit me in the long run?,"So, I have one credit card with a 22.5% interest rate with roughly a $2100 balance. I also have a line of credit with just under $2000 in available credit with an interest rate of 14.5%.

*Car loan:* ~$12k

*Credit Card 1:*~$5k @21% APR (I just had to check this and now I feel like sticking my head ever further into the dirt...so ashamed of myself!)

However, this will need to happen after our finances are sorted out.  One thing at a time.  *Our monthly expenses (including groceries, gas, and medications) comes to ~$3210.* 

Finding a job in general which is suitable (aka does not pay minimum wage or require you to risk your life) in my area has proven difficult; we are in a very remote area with a total population of 14,000.  I just recently got hired part time after putting in 15-25 applications daily for a solid month, with the promise of being trained for full time eventually (although I hope to have my own side business by then).  My husband works for his father, so his job is secure and he has been getting raises quarterly. 
 
We have been working on our credit as well;  We have already paid off 2 separate student loans as well as 2 credit cards.  However, we have yet to contain the wildfire.

personalfinance,"[Question] Confirming a Debt Calculation through ""Unbury.Me""","Tl;dr - Using the Debt Avalanche method, should I be making my largest payment to Loan 1 ($30,000 at 4.895%) or Loan 2 ($19,350 at 4.950%)



I have two school-related debts that I am refinancing to pay less interest and allow me to pay more aggressively than I had been before. The loans (and interest rates) are the following:

* Consolidated Federal Loan - $30,042 (4.895%)
* Private Loan - $19,348 (4.950%)

I used Unbury.Me to run my numbers through them, and filtered my results through the Debt Avalanche payment scheme. The monthly payment structure seemed off to me, however. 

Unbury Me has made my highest monthly payments to the private loan because it has a slightly higher interest rate. But my own calculations (Principal*Interest to yield Projected Amount paid as interest) seem to indicate that paying off the federal loan more aggressively would be better since it generates more interest ($1,470) over the term of repayments than the private loan ($962). Might Unbury Me's suggestion be inaccurate because my interest rates are so similar? Or am I making a silly accounting error?",finance

financialindependence,Questions about FI Progress Specifically Related to Living in a HCOL Area and Buying vs. Renting a Home,"Hi all. First time poster on the subredddit, but moderate-term purveyor of FI searching for some motivation, clarity, and advice on specific questions from the community. Details below. Thank you in advance and my apologies if I'm asking anything dumb or obvious. 

Life Situation: Married filing jointly, one kid (2 years old), living/working in Virginia, 32 years old. I am a federal employee. 

FIRE Progress: Provide details about where you are on the road to FIRE. If possible, provide expected FI/ER dates.

Gross Salary/Wages: $125,000/year

Yearly Savings Amounts: $18000 in 401k (traditional); $11000 in IRAs (traditional/Roth); some in cash

Current expenses: Rent: $2200 (small 2 bedroom apartment); not posting a specific breakdown but we save a significant percentage of our take home pay. We budget monthly and proactively look for ways to cut expenses. 

Assets: about $100,000 in 401k (index retirement date fund); $11,000 in IRAs, $130,000 in the bank. 

Liabilities: None

Specific Question(s): 

(1) What role does/should owning a personal residence play in FI? We are at the point of considering whether to keep renting or buy something to live in but real estate where we like (Washington DC metro) is very expensive. Do people in this situation pursuing FI typically buy or just rent until FI and move elsewhere with a lower COL? At that point, do you buy or continue renting indefinitely?

(2) The money we have saved in the bank was/is for a down payment on a home (see question #1). If we determine to continue renting until FI, what would be the best way to invest most of that money--save a emergency fund--as a lump sum? I understand that one of the pillars of FI is having a certain amount of money invested so as to generate passive income that can continue to cover our basic needs without a traditional paycheck. 

(3) I feel like I am floundering in my quest for FI. My salary has ranged from about $75k seven years ago to $125k now. Not likely to go up much in the future. Assuming we could live off of $30k a year (is this feasible in a LCOL area for a small family), how long do you think we have before being able to achieve FI? $30k/year @ 4% withdraw rate would mean $750k invested, correct?",finance
personalfinance,"Trying not to freak out, but I have a plan pt. 2","So despite the fact that I have a plan, sort of, I still can't help but just be on the fence of having a complete mental breakdown. I'm typing this up to give a few more updates, the pros and cons, etc. [Link to first thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6d6ghe/trying_not_to_freak_out_about_my_student_loans/)

Here's the positives of my situation:

* The job I have can in fact lead to higher paying jobs, it's a really great starting position in the industry I'm going into. There's overtime pay here and I could potentially get a raise if I get signed on again for a 2nd year. Plus some of these bigger companies do offer benefits.

* I'm not paying off any loans until January. During this time I'll be able to gather up a savings that will come in handy if I'm down a couple hundred dollars for a bill (hoping Sallie Mae doesn't fuck me over and increase my rates.)

* I called up the group handling my government loans and they said that I'm qualified for a lower payment plan ($351 a month for 20 years.) While this will increase my total federal loan amount to 100k, it would only take me about 5 years, saving up $1500 a month, to pay that off (provided I am not handling my Sallie Mae loans at the time.) 

* While I haven't graduated from college, there are banks that are known for refinancing student loans for drop outs. Citizens Bank is one I've seen, so I'll be checking them out. 

* If I get a job back in the state that I've been living in, I won't have to pay state income tax. 

* In the event that I can't get a 2nd job on the weekends to snowball my smaller loans (which could free me up of $300 a month), the job that I have will cover all of my bills. Yeah I'm only going to have $100-300 a month that I can put into the bank or to a loan, but at least I won't have to worry about not making any payments. Plus with overtime pay, I'll be able to make some extra cash on the side. There's also the fact that not having a second job would allow me to work on some personal skills that can increase my chances of getting a higher paying job.

* Paying interest on my loans can help me out with my taxes come next year.  I'm not expecting to get tons of cash, but even if I get a few hundred bucks back on my taxes that will help out.

The things I need to keep on telling myself:

* This isn't permanent. I just need to look at some of the things I listed above and I can see that my situation will get better with time. It might not be within a year, but I can see 2 years being better than the first few months when I get a few private loans paid off.

* Honestly my life style will not really change thinking about it now. I don't go out to bars. I don't go out to the movies except maybe every other month. I don't own a car. I don't have kids. I don't have a house. I regret not going out and living life for the past several years. But I know with this job I'll have the chance to possibly experience a bit more than I normally do. Nothing major, but I won't be slaving my life away for the next few years. With my current lifestyle I do not go out and buy a bunch of stuff, except CDs from Goodwill. So when I stand back and look at the situation, I can see it's not like my life is over.

What scares me

I think what scares me is that I'm not going to live life. My friends tell me about how they get to go to Disneyland, or New Zealand, or cross country trips. There's so many sights to see and things to do, and it destroys me to think that I won't be able to really live my life until I'm over 35. I don't see why anybody would want to be with me when I have so much debt. 

I'm also scared that I won't perform well at this job, and I'll end up getting fired. If that happens, I literally don't know what I'll do. I have a cosigner for my loans, and they certainly cannot afford $1300 a month in loans. I'm not saying I'd kill myself so they wouldn't have to pay my loans, but I'm just so fucking scared about my future right now. I don't want them to suffer for my mistake, and I want to live life. As long as I can hold onto my job, they won't have to pay a dime, and with time my chances of getting a higher paying job increases. If I get a job that pays around $65k a year, I'll end up having $1000 a month that I could put towards my Sallie Mae Loans (separate from the $1300 I'm paying.) That's around $12,000 a year, $24,000 over two years. Honestly that would be amazing since that means within 2 years I could pay off most of my 2nd highest Sallie Mae loan, or 2 other loans that equal out to that amount. So within 5 years, by the time I turn 32, there's the possibility that my Sallie Mae loans could be halved, pushing my monthly payments down to 700 a month (and $1000 total for all my loans.)",finance

personalfinance,A gift (but really a loan) from our respective parents,"This is a little unique, so I wasn't able to get full closure from some of the linked information.

**Full back story:**

My wife and I own our house outright. It's worth about $250k. We are buying a new house for $410k. We want to put down $225k on the new place. However, our house won't be sold before we close so we won't have access to $225k to put down. This is where my dad and my wife's dad come in.

They are each going to give us $100k in order to make the down payment. We will throw in the other $25k. The mortgage company says that our parents have to sign a paper that says it's a gift in order for the bank to do their thing. We will do this in order to get our mortgage approved.

That being said, this is *not* a gift. It's really a loan. As soon as our house sells, we will pay our fathers back the $100k that they each gifted (loaned) us.

**The questions:**

* If our fathers sign a paper with the bank saying that it's a gift, do they have to pay gift tax (keeping in mind that it's **really** a loan)?
* If we do consider it a loan and pay them back before the end of the year are there any tax implications for us?
* If our house doesn't sell in 2017, but in 2018 it does, and we pay them back in 2018, will the $200k repayment be seen as a gift to our fathers and result in us having to pay gift tax?

**tl;dr**

If a *large* loan is reported as a gift, how screwed is everyone from a tax perspective when the repayment is complicated?

I have been reading this sub for years and it was finally time for me to buy my first vehicle. Thanks to many good threads on here, I think I finally found a great deal. I ended up with a 2011 Subaru Forester with 68k miles for $12,200. The financing is at 4.89%. My Equifax came up at 711 at Bank of America so they offered me that slightly high rate (I see people get a way better interest rate with that credit but remember the only money I have ever borrowed was on my student loans). I plan on paying the loan off in less than 1 year so that I only pay around $500 for the privilege of borrowing the money. I also put $1500 down.

Now starts the unimportant details: The dealership tried to offer me 8% financing but I turned it down and said I had arranged my own at the best rate I could find. The financing guy acted like he couldn't beat it and told me to bring in that letter. When I got back, I dealt with the sales manager directly and he actually offered me the same rate! I wanted to give the dealership that extra kickback because they actually respected me asking them not to try the four square bullshit, so I allowed the loan to go through them at the same rate I had pre-approved.

I shopped around majorly in the area, including calling around at several dealers once the price was agreed upon to see if anyone wanted to beat it. I wanted either a Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, or Honda CRV and the Subaru was the best deal I could find.

Let me know if I could have done better and I will save that advice for next time! Thanks for all the knowledge! I have put about 1k miles on it the first week and it has been running flawlessly. The only thing I was kinda disappointed in was my interest rate, but I think I have been comparing it to new vehicle financing.",finance

personalfinance,"New job, $63,000 salary, California, financial questions and budgeting concerns","As a recent college graduate, I have left my parent's house and secured a job several states away. As far as budgeting goes, I know very little and now with more responsibilities I need some advice on what I should be spending and saving for future use. 


From this [tax calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes), I see that I will be paying $16,464 in state and federal taxes. Lovely... so take home is looking around mid $46,000.


The job offers several beneficial offers including healthcare and 401k matching. With the option of traditional or Roth plans the company will match 50% of the first 6% deferred with an annual cap of $18,000. Should I choose a traditional 401k or Roth IRA? Also should I be capping the max amount I can invest into this as possible?


On top of retirement savings, how much should I aim to put towards a saving's account every month?

Day-to-day necessities:

- I need transportation. My commute is 30 miles each way. Is it more cost effective to buy a beater car (say $3,000) than to purchase into a car loan. I should mention I have around $3,000 in spending funds currently. Let's say I go the car loan route, what's the most you recommend I can spend comfortably with insurance included?

- Food is averaging around 300-400 a month between my girlfriend and I.

- Rent is essentially covered with me spending $200 month

- Phone may be covered by employer, but lets say that remains the same at $100


Are there any allowances I should claim as well? I will be filing for my W-4 soon and I still feel out-of-the-loop for tax breakdowns?

Bitcoin,Can someone explain what's stopping central banks from buying large bitcoin positions to control the currency much like any other physical currency out there?,"I keep hearing that these crypto currencies are the future because they bypass central banks etc. However, you would still need to buy them using funds in USD for example so what's stopping the fed from printing enough money to let's say buy 30-40% of bitcoins out there and then controlling the market? 

From reading about bitcoin it seems that for a while 35% of the currency is inactive and has never moved meaning that it's either lost (unlikely) or people are just sitting on it which I find strange. I hope someone can explain why many people out here say this currency gives freedom from central banks and how it does that?",cryptocurrency

I have called several times to ask for my interest rate to be lowered, only to be told I am not eligible because I am receiving their best rate based on my card type and then they increase my balance.

She suggested I consider their platinum card, and I haven't looked into those details yet.  I know my parents card is 7.99% so they do offer better interest rates.

I stopped contributing to 403B (no matching). My take home now is 5900/month after fully funding HSA. I recently got some new quotes for refinancing and wanted to get some thoughts.

I've been making standard monthly payments of about $1,200. I'm starting to get more aggressive with them and shooting for 2K/month to pay them all within 4-5 years. With this goal in mind, does it make sense to refinance? I did an estimate with Sofi, offered 5-yr 4.62%, 10-yr fixed at 4.875. 7-yr variable at 3.5. ELFI gave 2.97% variable 5-year. 

* Total interest paid: My Fedloan Standard plan 5.9% in 5-years, $1,756/month ~ $13,450. 
* SOFI 3.5% variable 7-years rate 3.5%- paid off in 5-years (assuming rate stays constant, big assumption) $1,633/month ~$8,213.
* Elfi 2.97% variable 5-years (again, assuming rate stays constant) $1,612/month ~ $6,940

* I have about $17,000 in checking/savings; 45k in retirement/investments.

What is a full node?

You can read about it at the below links. Although its about bitcoin full nodes, everything still applies to doge full nodes since we run on the same technology.

https://cryptojunction.com/glossary/full-node/

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/you-really-should-run-full-bitcoin-node-heres-why/

**edit 3:**

Can the core dogecoin wallet act as a full node?

Yes, if you set it up correctly.  You need to make sure you have checked ""Allow incoming connections"" in your doge wallet settings. Also, you need to make sure if you have a router that you forward port 22556 to the computer that you have your wallet on. When you have it all set up correctly you will have more then 8 connections to the network.
If you have 8 connections or less, you are only pulling information from the network, if you have more then 8 connections, you are adding information to the network.

**edit 4:**

Running a full node will burn up a ton of bandwidth. So make sure you have plenty available if you plan on running a full node.  It could also slow your internet connection way down so that is something to look out for.

Also just to be clear, we are not having network issues. We are just trying to be prepared for big influxes of users. Bitcoin went through the same motions of getting more nodes for more future users. This is only smart and common sense. The more the better.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off home mortgage vs investing in stock market,"I am 27 years old and owe about $134k out of a $160k loan I took out a couple of years ago to buy a house. The loan has a pretty low interest rate, 3.5%, for a 15-year term. 

Over the past couple of years, I have managed to save up about $110k, and I would like to just pay off the loan in one swoop. I have allocated about $50k of my savings to play with on the stock market, the rest is stored strictly for emergency. I looked at my loan and it appears I am paying around $4,500 a month for interest. My stock account has managed to make a profit so far this year of $6,200 so far, and seems to keep climbing. 

I mentioned this to my parents the other day when they inquired about the loan and they said my tactic is not good. They are worried that my strategy is too risky and I could loose everything. Ideally they feel I should just continue to make small payments towards my principle whenever I have extra money laying around to pay off the loan faster, and don't bother with the stock market. I don't understand this logic when I am turning a profit on the stock market, which is effectively using the money I have saved up to ""cancel out"" the interest I am paying on the mortgage. 

I feel at my age of 27, with a healthy 401k, no kids, single, and no other debt, that now is the best time to take a risk to make some money. I will admit, I am a total novice on the stock market, but I can say with confidence that if the companies I invested in crashed, I'm pretty sure the whole market would be in trouble. 

How do you guys feel about this scenario? Am I making a smart move, or potentially setting myself up for disaster? I almost feel like continuing to make regular payments on my mortgage and just keep allocating funds to the stock account to turn an even bigger profit.

financialindependence,FIRE and Happiness: a plea for help,"So I decided to make a ludicrously long writeup in order to, in essence, seek advice. I think my situation isn’t particularly unique (but only within the confines of this sub). I also think that the kind of personality drawn to FIRE is likely to be similar to mine. Which is why I’m basically airing out all my dirty laundry and “sob story” here. 

Some of the “toxic” advice I’ve read and adopted (more on that later) seems to be thinly veiled beneath the surface of a lot of interactions between members of r/FI as well.

It doesn’t escape me that I’ve written some brutish things here. But I really do hope that where you see anger, you’ll rather consider seeing a person hurting and a genuine cry for help. I’m writing this from a pretty dark place, and I hope that my “putting myself out there” as I am here will be interpreted as a man asking for help with his tail firmly tucked between his legs, rather than an attempt to bait anyone into a political debate for the sake of stirring up shit. 

To be clear, I'm willing to share quite a bit of non-identifying personal information to anyone willing to engage me in conversation.

For what it’s worth, I am an INTP, PhD student, in my late 20s, ~40K NW. I lead a 20K/year lifestyle.

I enjoy traveling on a motorcycle. It's actually my life ambition to FIRE and travel across the world someday. Something like [what this guy did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85VErvTqgWc)

I've already taken some adventures like that on my own, across the US and Canada. I've taken a few summers off and took a tent and just camped and stayed on strangers couches along the way. It's been great.

One of the rituals I've most enjoyed from my travels is asking hosts (usually over a beer) to tell me what they think the key to happiness is. 

The answer that has stuck with me the most was from a retired biker in his 50s who lived in Florida with a wife that didn't care too much for motorcycling, but who respected each other nonetheless: 

""The key to happiness is having financial security and emotional security.""

It was among the shorter, cleaner answers I've gotten so far. And it fit neatly as an equation in my head. Which is helpful for someone prone to being brutally logical the overwhelming majority of the time. I always question everything, including my own thoughts and opinions. It's a source of never ending anxiety and cognitive dissonance: worrying that I am committing logical fallacies. It also rubs people the wrong way because I often treat conversational partners as sounding boards for me to think out loud; and I am willing to entertain ideas that often go against the grain.

**My stated intent is to ""pursue what is true"" in the most philosophic sense of the statement.**

I'd always been reasonably frugal, but I only stumbled upon MMM and such around 2014. At the time, I was going through the motions to get into my PhD program with the girlfriend I had at the time (who was doing the same.) 

Things didn't work out. She didn't get accepted into any program, and shortly before we were set to go on one of these motorcycle trips she ended up cheating on me and going off with another guy. It really ruined the flavor of the pre-phd vacation for me but I tried to make the best of it. It was particularly difficult because I was truly head over heels over this particular gal, as we had history dating back to when we were preteens. 

I lost half 'our' savings when we split up. It should go without saying that I was by far the higher earner. I didn't want to argue with her because I was still hanging on to the idea that we'd get back together. (I found out about the infidelity much later, and during the breakup she was stringing me along in case things didn’t work out with the new guy.)

I went on the trip on my own, started my program, and have been doing okay. The breakup was helpful in that I eventually found out about mindfulness, which helped me along. It made me have quite a bit of introspection into my life, happiness, and all of these things. The one biker's idea of ""happiness"" kept echoing in my head, and it dawned on me that if: 

Happiness = ( Financial security ) + ( Emotional security )

then I had grossly neglected half of the equation. That is, my folks had always pushed me to do well in school, and I was (and still am) on a path to earn well. But I realized that I've gone through life just feeling ""bleh"". 

I don't really get happy or excited about anything. And I realized that, in a way, FIRE was just another way of accepting unhappiness. That is, for a long time I’ve told myself I couldn't be happy “because I wasn't dating a particular person” I was hung up on. *Then* I dated that person and I still wasn't happy. *Then* I was lost and confused because I couldn't point at an excuse for my own unhappiness anymore, I had to face it was because of *me*. **FIRE gave me an excuse in that I could say ""I'll be happy when I get there.""**

And it's become obvious to me that there isn't going to be some magic switch when I quit working that is going to make me happy. I need to learn that today. 

I got myself into therapy and such, and I've already been doing that for over a year. It's helped, but obviously not enough. I still feel ""meh"" and I find myself at a loss for where to move forward.

One of the things I most craved growing up was a best friend. A friend that was going to be there through thick and thin, that I could always count on, that I would take a bullet for, that I would go to college with and continue to stay close to for the rest of my life. I craved that like the desert craves rain. It wasn't necessarily a sexual partner, I have also fantasized about motorcycle-gang-esque connections that resemble brotherhood.

I wanted someone whom my self-identity was going to be invested in. Looking back, I can recount several attempts at this with friends growing up. Guys that I’d try to rescue when their lives resembled shit hitting the fan. And time and time again it was a thankless endeavor, and the ‘bro-love’ was unidirectional. The latest attempt at a connection of that depth was with that gal. And, well, you know how that went.

I learned that when a person falls to pieces after a breakup, it's not because of the particular partner that just left them, it's because there is a fundamental weakness in that person. In this case, a particular problem with me.  
Emotionally healthy people go through a process quite similar to grieving, and are able to close the chapter in their life and move on. An inability to do that points to problems with oneself.

And so began my long quest for finding myself. A quest that continues to this day. I was fearful of approaching women. My self confidence was through the floor. 

I became quite stoic in my thoughts.

I stumbled upon some advice for men that is quite controversial. I didn't like it. And to be honest, I still don’t. I wish it weren’t so. But being an academic I tried following some of it. And it worked. I found myself going on several dates and having ""success"". I was finally a ""manly man"" because I could get women into bed. It was almost a 'high' - being successful at something that a younger me had seen as so difficult and mystifying. But it quickly got old. And it made me extremely jaded. 

I realized how trivial sleeping with someone was for women of my generation. And thinking about how easy it is for them made me angry. Because with as much success as I was having, it came with a lot of effort. And it made me angry that women could put a 1/100th of the effort I put in and achieve the same result. It also bothered me that the success I was having was with gals that typically lacked a college education or good looks, I genuinely felt like I should be able to do better - as much of a dick as I feel when I write that. ""I'm a good looking PhD student with his shit together, I don't want to end up with someone who I can run intellectual laps around"" would often echo through my head. 

It also made me jaded because something that a younger me had seen as so sacred, important, and valuable was worth little more than a coffee cup and a half hour of telling them what they wanted to hear.

It made me feel like ""what's the point in all of this?"" There's never a gal that's yours. She's just yours until the next guy comes along.

Combined with the priors I already had, the idea of finding a woman that is BOTH at my socioeconomic/intellectual/educational/moral/values level AND *loyal* seems implausible at best. Add in the FIRE path and the desire to live out life on a motorcycle around the world and it seems a fool’s errand.

I don't know how to continue with this discussion without reducing people to numbers, as unpleasant as the thought likely is. But at some level, I think most people can understand that person A can be *objectively* better looking/educated/funny/etc than person B. There's plenty of gray, don't get me wrong. Some people may disagree, and the “weight” of any one attribute is likely to be different for different folks. But in general, there are certain things that *objectively* make one person, *on average*, more desirable than another.

Part of the advice I’ve read *was* good in the sense that it achieved its stated purpose. However, it was bundled in with quite a toxic attitude towards women. And what bothers me the most today is thinking that that gal (ex) still somehow has sway over my mind - that my new negative attitude towards the opposite gender is somehow anger I still hold towards her and I am misdirecting at women as a whole.

That last paragraph is a great example of me always questioning myself. Even as I’ve wasted an hour or two today getting baited into arguments with SJWs about the non existent gender gap, or whatever else: I still ask myself “why do I care?” And “is wasting my time being angry – even if I’m right in my arguments – worth it?”

It’s often the joke among the toxic advice that women that have a negative attitude towards men are just bitter because of an ex. Was (am) I committing the same fallacy that feminists are accused of having? Or did I really learn something about dating dynamics and simply become angry that the Disney fantasy I’ve been spoon fed all my life about relationships were a lie? Or maybe something in between?

I don’t know. I guess maybe I’m still bitter? Or maybe the bitterness is a byproduct of reading the toxic content I have? Maybe I’m delusional in not seeing myself as being bitter but rather simply as finally seeing the full scope of the ‘rules of the game’? 

The majority of what brings me joy nowadays is the rare occasion where I get to add a little cash to vanguard and then going on mint 3+ times a day.

I can’t continue like this. The meaning of my life can’t simply be to sit and watch wait for the water to boil. 

I’ve tried making friends. Going to motorcycle meetups. Considered getting into relationships. 

But I feel like I have so little in common with a 45 year old married biker that wants nothing more than the next newest truck and for his sportsball team to win. Or I find myself reading into every little thing about a girl as a red flag. 

I’ve fantasized about a Charlie Sheen-esque life where I’m FI and ride motorcycles and sleep with gals. But I don’t really think that’s going to make me happy. And the opposite end of the spectrum – the “2.5 kids and a dog with a white picket fence” is nauseating to me. (And no longer viable, I might add).

I guess I’m looking for a Mr Money Mustache esque “punch in the face” - but for the other half of the happiness equation.

You can be angry at me if you like. A lost unhappy 20 something year old’s misguided views on life shouldn’t matter enough to incite anger in you, but if they did, perhaps I’ve struck a nerve. And whenever someone had struck one of my nerves, I’ve found it useful to run towards that idea and beat it over the head with logic until it confessed; that I might find out what it is that managed to make me uncomfortable. At least, that’s what’s been the biggest sources of growth for me.",finance
personalfinance,Help me figure out how best to use $6000 to change my life for the better.,"I'm not good with money. I came from a family with too little money to manage, so I didn't learn how to manage it until I was making my own. Severe ADHD makes it hard for me to do something like sit down and work out a budget, and also makes it hard to control impulses that lead to wasteful spending. I work at a nonprofit full-time and have a second job, and I'm still pretty broke most of the time. I just found out that I'll be coming into about $6000 soon, and I want to make absolutely sure that this opportunity isn't wasted. Here's a list of some things I have to consider:


* I have about $2600 in credit card debt that could/should be paid off immediately, and that alone would push my credit score from the ""good"" range into the ""excellent"" range. 


* I want very much to get out from under the insane rent inflation in my area when my current lease is up. I know I'll need a down payment to purchase. BUT. The real estate prices are also so ridiculous that it may not actually be feasible for me to buy. So it therefore may not be necessary for me to save a down payment at this moment. Again, I'm not good with money and this is something I'm really uncertain about but want a lot. 


* I do currently have student loans, on which I'm only paying interest (IBR). I'm enrolled in the federal service work forgiveness thing (working at a nonprofit) and I'm on track to have those loans wiped out in a few years, so I don't see much point in paying more than the mandated interest to keep me in the program. 


* When all that is said and done... There are some things that I want but don't necessarily *need* and haven't been able to afford. Chief among these is a new bed to replace the $200 Discount Mattress Warehouse clearance sale thing I've been sleeping on for the last 8 years. Is it wise to spend some of this sudden windfall on stuff like that? 

This amount of money, though it seems trivial to a lot of people, is literally life changing for me. Help me put it to its 100% best use, Reddit. Please don't let me fuck this up.",finance
personalfinance,Will need a car for the next ~1-1.5 years. Should I buy new vs. buy used vs. lease?,"I am currently in medical school, and I will be starting clinical rotations in November this year, for some of which I need to travel to an outpatient site. After about a year of rotations, since I am in an MD/PhD dual degree program, I will be starting PhD, for which I don't believe I will need a car. It would be convenient, but I am not sure it is worth the expense when I will be spending ~7-80 hrs/week in a lab, which is walkable from my place. Also, parking is really bad at my school, so most people with a car don't end up driving to work.

Currently in about 20k debt, but it was all fed subsidized loan so no interest accrues until I finish with both MD and PhD, which is expected in 2023-2026. I don't plan to pay this off until I am done with schooling.

I have about 35k in saving right now and I get about ~26k/yr post-tax as a stipend. Rent+utilities+cable cost me about $900-1000/mo. I end up saving anywhere from $100-1000 a month.

I do not need a great car. I do not think I will travel many miles during the rotations (the farthest rotation site is probably just a few dozen miles away, which I may not even be assigned to). I will use the car for commute, grocery shopping, but nothing else really. I will frequently be in a time crunch, though, so I cannot afford the car not starting or breaking down every other week (which is a reason why I am hesitant to buy a used car). 

The options I thought of are:

1. Buy a new Toyota Corolla or Honda Civics, or something in that price range. After 1-1.5 years, I will have &lt;10,000 miles on it and sell it.

2. Buy a used car in 1.5k-10k range. I have no idea how to go about this.

3. Lease. I don't even know how this works. I heard it's usually not a good option.

Thanks very much in advance!

personalfinance,Bigger Down Payment vs. Paying Off Debt,"I am looking to buy a house/condo within the next few years and am looking for some advice from you amazing people in this sub.

personalfinance,Refinance $5000 in student loans for sole purpose of getting a $500 sign up bonus- stupid??,"I'm graduating from med school with ~$60,000 in loans. There's a private refinancing company offering a $500 bonus if you refinance with them (minimum $5000 refinanced). Since I'll be a poor resident physician, I am trying to deduce whether it'll be worth the trouble to refinance $5000 in order to get the $500 sign in bonus. The payments will be $100 per month while I'm in training, so it be feasible financially to pay the new loan and old ones. One downside is that I will have to manage more loans as a result, but I don't mind. Another consideration is this refinanced loan's APR is about 0.1% less than my current federal loan rate (so I won't get screwed by a higher interest rate on the $5000).

Is this worth the trouble?

personalfinance,"Victim of fraud, how should I go about cleaning up this mess?","I am a victim of fraud and I have etransfered 950.00$ to a person who claimed to be connected with Apple and could get us heavily discounted products (trust me I know I'm stupid).

The scam (presumably) was run through a Instagram account and required me to etransfer the person the 950$ in exchange for a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.  At first it seemed legitimate because the person we were purchasing from was a friend of a friend who could be easily found if something went wrong.

We talked to Sarah (scammer), who was supposedly going to deliver the products, via text and she agreed to deliver them on a Wednesday, the day came and she said that we would have to wait longer because a national holiday (Canada day, also I live in Ontario if that matters) held up the shipment of the products (legit enough, or so I thought).

We rescheduled the delivery for Saturday of the same week and she claimed to be 3hrs late on driving to the designated destination then after making us wait for 3hrs told us something came up and she could not make the delivery.  

At this point we were fed up with the horrible service and just outright asked her for a refund, to which she hasn't replied.

Throughout the entire transaction we kept detailed notes, saved screenshots of her name, email address, and her agreeing with a verbal contract to meet and deliver the products to us.  The notes are very well kept and are very obviously a scam attempt in the making.

I am 21yo and unfamiliar with how to go about reporting this through my bank and am scared I will lose the money for good.  At the very least I would like to see her charged with theft (over 5000$ from others I've talked to about their fraudulent transactions with her).

What I'm asking is: 

1) is there anything I can do to make myself more likely to receive my money back?

2) how can I best go about filing for fraud with the Ontario Police in Canada (if that makes a difference)?

3) What is my best course of action from here on out?",finance
personalfinance,"(US, IL) My sister just got disowned by my family. What can I do to help her?","Long story short, my mom is the posterchild for r/raisedbynarcissists, and today my 20-year-old, unemployed-and-job-searching sister moved in with me and my roommate/partner.  The two of us do NOT make enough money to pay the rest of her tuition to college for the summer/fall (~$6k out-of-pocket). I have a couple of questions.

 * 1. Who is the best company to get private student loans through? She's maxed out on her federal subsidized/unsubsidized at the moment, and my mother's sister is footing the bill. Obviously, this will stop. She is currently a junior at a good 4-year state school and just got accepted into a really good Nursing program, so pulling her out of school is the absolute *last* option.
 * 1a. She's also got the other various costs associated with college and being a nursing major: she needs scrubs, shoes, a stethoscope, books, etc. for this semester. Could a private student loan possibly cover all of the things she needs for the semester?
 * 2. How common are ""dependency overrides""? At this point, I will be providing half of her support, so she will legally become my dependent (I will fight it out with family when they try to claim her). She is still under 24 and needs her parents' information; could I give mine instead? 
 * 3. My mom pays for my sister's phone at the moment, and is cutting her service off soon. What's the best cheap prepaid phone plan?
 * 4. She will also be without insurance. I am past the enrollment period at my job; is adding a non-child dependent generally allowed as an ""extenuating/special circumstance""?
 * 6. She's on a joint bank account with my mother at the moment, and my sister has a $1k scholarship (EDIT: apparently it's a loan, not a scholarship) for school coming into that bank account. Is there any way to make sure that my mother doesn't touch that money? (My sister is in the process of getting her own bank accounts.)
 * 5. I'm her big brother and I hate seeing this happen to her. Not really PF-related, but any advice on how to be there for her?

Thanks so much guys. She's in the next room freaking out and I'm trying to take steps so that she can still succeed to spite my mom for kicking her out and disowning her.

EDIT: Holy shit thank you for all of the great responses! Since there are people asking about the situation, I can give a small part of the story that I feel comfortable sharing. Basically, my mother is a narcissist, and is losing control of my adult sister. It exploded when my sister smoked marijuana with one of her friends and my mother threatened to take my sister's mode of transportation away for it. This was the straw that broke the camel's back; both my sister and I have been emotionally manipulated throughout our childhoods, as well as consistently being pitted against each other (why can't you be more like your sibling?) and made to distrust each other. My sister, other than occasional marijuana, is a great kid: she's got a 3.0 GPA at a prestigious university, and got into the Nursing program there (she was one of 60 that got in out of 300+ that applied). My mom is treating the situation like she's smoking crack out of a dead hooker.",finance

personalfinance,Financial advice on moving forward with a few things and clearing up some debt.,"So reddit, hoping someone can give me some advice about my situation. I've got about 6k in debt, paid down from like 12k, which was not an easy feat, I've read the ""what to do with money"" section of this sub, but I'm still unsure of what to do. I'm upside down on a car loan, but I'm going to be turning it in voluntarily for a ""waiver of deficiency"". I'm unable to get a loan from the bank to cover the cost of selling the car privately unfortunately. Reason why is further down. 

The other thing is that, I'm about to get some money from a house sale that my ex and I purchased together, but it's looking like I'm going to have to turn in the car well before that money comes through, or I would suck it up and pay the overages in order to get out from under the loan. As well, since it's a two door, it's considered a sports car (it's a scion tc hatchback) so with that, the insurance is absolutely murdering me. I owe 15, 450 on the car, kbb and nada values for my car put them around 10-11k. My interest rate on that loan is 12%.

The payment from selling the house is going to be around 13k, and I'm planning on paying about something towards higher than minimum to each debt I owe (one is a care credit card, the other is a small personal loan). Care credit is 150 a month at like, 18% interest, and my personal loan is 82 a month at like, 2%interest. I make 13 an hour, but I only work about twenty hours a week, and yeah, I could try to get another job, but with my medical problems it becomes an issue of ""who is going to hire that guy with the Service Dog?"" and the fact that I'm legally disabled. I can probably bump my hours up to close to 35 a week. Finding another job is not easy when you show up to the interview with a Service Dog.

I also need to have surgery soon, and that's good to cost me at least 6500 by itself. I have put this surgery off for years, but it's getting to the point where it's painful.

I also need to move out ASAP from where I'm living. I pay about 250 a month (dirt cheap, but I live with relatives). I will also need a vehicle to get to work and such, but I'm also planning on a trip around the USA.

This is what I was thinking of doing. Buy van for ""tiny home"" deal, outfit it as cost effectively as possible, while I'm doing that, get in as many hours as I can to put money towards the surgery, because I have to pay that out of pocket and the cost is almost prohibitively expensive without coming into money like this, lol. So, buy the van, outfit it (if I could do that and come in under 6500 that'd be brilliant) and then if I had to dip into the leftover money a time or two, put back double what I took out.

The reason why I want to go ahead and get out is living with these people who are all terrible is killing me, and I just gotta go. The other reason for getting the van first is the wait list for this surgeon is anywhere from four to six months ahead, and I figure that should be enough time to put more money into a fund for saving and for the surgery.

I just paid off a huge debt on a credit card (I honestly have no idea how I managed to do that, lol) and I'm definitely on a shoestring budget, but if this were a perfect world, I could bank half of that and put it somewhere so that my money is making me money.

I think that I could probably pay off both card and loan, and have surgery, but I'd be left with no money and still stuck here with bitching relatives who all probably hate each other. 

I definitely didn't do myself any favors, because I was unemployed for about six months, and I had such a small cushion it was ridiculous. It also killed my credit score, which was at like 712 or something and knocked it down to the high 500's. That was from juggling through card I paid off, and the second card I still have. Care credit at least only works at doctors offices (and veterinarians, hah) So I'd also like to try to get a little bit of money going into an emergency fund, as well as funneling towards the remaining debt.

So to reiterate I pay 307 for the car, 205 for the cars insurance, sometimes as much as 250 for my phone/Internet, 250 for rent, usually 85 on my personal loan, and the minimum amount on the care credit card which is like 143.

Anyway, that's me rambling. Any advice is appreciated, because I honestly don't know what I'm doing, and I grew up super poor, so I've never learned how to manage money effectively.",finance

financialindependence,Thoughts on leverage to speed up FI,"In this subreddit, most posters strive to be debt-free. 

However, given the expected long exposure to the market, could it not make sense to use some leverage to boost long-term returns? This could be especially useful for young persons starting out. 

I am not talking about huge margin loans. In my case my broker allows margin lending at 0.99%, far lower than the return I expect longer term, as long as certain conditions are met. 

Yes, a massive interest rate hike and a market crash could hurt, but that is true irrespective if you have loans or not. I realize, of course, that such a scenario would simultaneously lower the price of shares as well as make the loan more expensive to finance. I do expect interest rates to stay rather low for a while however.

Here's the deal. We currently have a 300,000$ mortgage for a 330,000$ home we bought 2 years ago, but we have had our mortgage for 7 years total (this is our second home). Our monthly mortgage payments are 960$ bi weekly and our interest rate is 3.4%.

It's time to renew our mortgage and we were informed that interest rates have gone down and were offered 2.5% and would lower our payment to 900$ bi weekly. 

Here's where the rub comes in. Our house has skyrocketed in value and has been appraised at $550,000, with some houses on our street (same model ) going for $600,000. I'm also not sure how much equity we actually because of the value increase.

We have a line of credit for $24,000 (6% interest) and about $2000 of credit card debt. We also have two car loans (11,000$ at 0% interest and $32000 at 3.5%.)

We might be able to refinance our mortgage and pay off our existing debts And keep our mortgage paymentd relatively the same. Is this a good idea? What are the pros and cons of refinancing to pay off debt?

personalfinance,Credit Union with high APY checking vs. Building Credit on rewards credit card,"Hi PF -

Recently I've been researching bank alternatives to switch away from PNC bank. There is one credit union, Consumers Credit Union, which offers 3-4% APY on checking balances provided you meet certain requirements (such as be under a certain balance, do X number of transactions, spend X $$$ with your card per month).

While it is possible for me to meet these requirements, I do not spend enough per month to meet the debit spending requirements and also use a credit card. I have a 2% cash-back rewards CC that I use on pretty much everything, and an Ally account with the 1.05% APY in savings. I have a good credit score (800+).

While the increase in interest between Ally and the Credit Union is clear - I'm having trouble reconciling a couple things:

1. If I stop my moderate Credit card useage (20% of credit limit or lower each month) will my credit score be harmed?
2. Is building/maintaining my credit, plus a 1% return on savings + 2% return on spending worth missing out on a 4.6% return in a CU checking?
3. Am I missing something here about this checking interest rate? It seems like a too-good-to-be-true deal.

personalfinance,"20 years old, studying abroad, 2000 dollars in debt, recently had to dip into my ROTH IRA for emergency funds. I now have 600 dollars to spend over the course of three weeks. Where should I go from here?","I've always been good with my money - my whole life I've saved diligently, and until last month I had 4500 in savings with zero debt.

However, this summer I decided to do a study abroad program for engineering in Canada. The program was expected to cost 3500 total. The enrollment fee was 2000 Canadian, or just above 1600 US. I decided to put this on a credit card, because I knew that I had enough in my savings to pay it off immediately if necessary. 

For this trip, I had around twelve hundred dollars saved, which I assumed would be enough for a few weeks. But I ran into a few problems - the week before the trip, I had my car inspected, and I failed inspection. The repairs cost me three hundred and fifty dollars. On my way up, gas and food ended up being more than I expected - around a hundred. And then, once I arrived, I was hit with an unexpected five hundred dollar housing fee, which was around 350 US.

The total impact of unexpected expenses was around 700 US. This was a heavy hit on my budget, and it took me down to five hundred US. This was still quite a lot of money, and I was doing fine until last Thursday. 

The five hundred was spend like this:

100 for cooking supplies.

125 for food (I had no idea groceries were so expensive!)

100 for a few nights of cheap drinking and one bad, bad night of expensive drinking. (First experience in a bar, wasn't thinking properly.)

20 for gas.

I was stupid with my card, and I maxed it out. 

-----

After two weeks, I was at 155 US remaining. This situation was unideal, but my biggest expenses had been paid for, and I felt as though I could stretch it for a while. However, I wasn't expecting to be hit with 140 US in bank overdraft charges after I went grocery shopping. I had assumed that the money would automatically transfer from my savings, and while I was in the store I didn't bother checking my account. I didn't There were four charges each totaling 35 US. - three from each grocery store I went to, and one from ""Audible"", which I didn't understand, and it is currently in dispute.

This made me broke, save for the credit card, of which thought I had a hundred US left on. 

Last night I went out with some friends and had a few beers. When the time came to pay, I gave them my credit card - it was declined. After a long conversation, I decided to leave my Passport and Drivers license at the bar as insurance, and I promised to return today and pay my balance (35 Canadian) in full.

After we got home I checked my card - remember that bad night of drinking? I'd used my card instead of my debit card. Instead of 50 dollars, I'd spent a hundred. That, combined with lunch earlier in the day yesterday, had maxed out my account.

-------------

The current situation: 

I owe the bar 35 dollars, which I have to pay by 8PM tonight. I have a four rolls of dimes and four rolls of nickels, which I can exchange for Canadian dollars - this should cover by bill plus tip, I already have it all worked out. 

Bank Account:

The bank has refunded me the $140 in overdraft fees after I called them and asked why I wasn't notified as they were occurring.

I can't use my card because I had it disabled after the audible purchases. I have to drive to TD bank and get a new one once I have my license.

I am currently in the process of transferring an additional 100 dollars from my Venmo account, and I am also transferring 500 dollars from my ROTH IRA, which I intend to pay back within the next three months. This should create 

Credit card: Maxed out. My interest rate is disgusting, 25%, but for some reason i have no minimum payment due for this month.

At the moment, I am broke, as none of my money has finished moving.

I have a good summer job lined up back in the states that should net me just enough to cover my credit bills. I also intend to take a second job that will earn me enough to restore my ROTH IRA safety net, plus a little extra for good Karma, and some pocket money for when I have to buy schoolbooks. 

Otherwise, I'm not sure what to do right now. I'm hungry, I'm out of food, and I'm broke. 

On the plus side, I have a warm bed and my pet fish Charlie.

I can’t pay tuition without resorting to student loans right now. What is this subreddit’s take on private student loans?
Also, am I realistic about my financial situation?
__________________________________________________
I have until July 10th to move out of my current place. 

I have about $2,000 to my name.

I am twenty-one years old, a rising junior, double majoring in computer engineering and electrical engineering; however, I am nearing the point where if I won’t be eligible for financial aid. I never applied for much in the past, but I was considering taking out student loans so I could finish, but after junior year I’d be ineligible for federal student loans. 

That being said, I did talk to the financial aid helpline for my university, and they did say that even if I hit that credit ceiling, I wouldn’t have to start paying back my student loans until 6 months after I hit half-time enrollment or 6 months after I graduate, hoq can I verify that?

If I keep going to school full-time after my junior year, I would have to consider private student loans.

My parents are helping me by letting me use a car (that’s under their names) and claiming me as a dependent so I get free healthcare. I’m not exactly the sickest kid so I don’t know if that part’s worth it but I digress.

My monthly expenses come to about $650 if I leave room for eating out on occasion and gas. That’s about as much as I make now. I’m considering talking to my boss tomorrow about possibly getting a second job that’s closer to school and either cutting back or leaving my current job once the fall semester starts up.

This Tuesday I’ll be meeting with my potential landlord and signing the lease for a year, I really want to finish my degree, is there anything I need to be aware of or am underestimating regarding my plan?",finance

It had a good run the last year but after the earnings report for last year it plummeted and is now moving basically sideways. 

Simultaneously, BNP Paribas performed much better (and Santander too but I don't own any of it). 

Should I just take the losses and try to get it back with another stock? I was pretty found of HSBC honestly. They are very big in Asia and have a reasonable market share in European countries. I really hope that they will become bigger in Europe in the long term. 

But what alternatives are there? I want my money to stay in the financials sector since I already have enough money in other sectors. As mentioned Paribas and Santander already had a good run. The big Japanese, Chinese, Canadian and Australian banks don't look really desirable to me and I don't know much about them to be honest. 

Leaving the American banks. If I'm not mistaken BAC would profit the most from interest rates being raised but the current political situation makes it a bit volatile. 

Any thoughts to share?

datascience,Is this wrong application of PCA?,"Hey reddit

I think im applying PCA wrong. 

I have a time series financial data that has time, price, and bunch of factors that affect that theorteically the price, such as inflation, interest rate, unemployment, etc.

I'm using PCA to find out which components have 0 eigenvalues (i.e. ignorable) with respect to price so I can ignore them in my future code (in case anyone is wondering, beta factor modeling).

Here's the code I am using

        
    	df = collect_df() # basically compiles many pickles into one giant DF, indexed by time... minus PRICE. Nothing fancy
        df.dropna(inplace=True)
    
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        df_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df)
    
        pca = PCA()
        pca.fit(df_std)
    
        variance_ratios = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
        factors_and_pca = dict(zip(df.columns, variance_ratios ))
        pprint(factors_and_pca)
    
    
        plt.bar(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.values(), align='center')
        plt.xticks(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.keys())
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show() 

Here are couple of problems and questions

1) I noticeed that the 1st column almost always has the highest variance ratio. If I remove this col (col 1) via (del(df[""col1""])), the next column (i.e. col2) becomes the highest variance ratio column. 

Here's the original graph: https://s2.postimg.org/uzfaj0xjt/plotted-1.png

After I remove the first column (quandl-FRED-BASE), i get https://s2.postimg.org/vdgmimhnd/plotted-2.png

In other words, every time I shift the array over one, the graph always says that the 1st column has the highest variance ratio (which naturally sounds wrong)

Am I misunderstood? Is this not how PCA is used? 

2) I am still confused - how can PCA figure out variance ratio w/respect to the price if the price column is NOT passed into PCA?  I've been following this guideline (http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html) that uses Iris data packaged with scikit learn.",technology

personalfinance,Paying off interest for all Student Loans First?,"Hi, So I am currently in grade for student loans and I was looking into how I'd go about paying them online. Apparently the site is telling me I had to pay interest of all loans first before I can pay an individual loan? 

I'm using Great Lakes in order to pay my loans, and they have an auto allocated system that will choose where to place your loans (highest to lowest interest) vs custom allocation. 

-------Standard
&gt;Once scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, excess will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time. *read footnote
    Done automatically.



--------Custom
&gt;Once scheduled monthly payment has been paid, excess will be applied to the specific loans of your choosing.
 You set manually.


What I don't understand is why can't I get out of monthly payments and just pay whatever loan I want individually. Why must I pay monthly payments, then the individual loan? Is the monthly for just interest?

personalfinance,Most likely staying in the same tax bracket. Does it matter between Roth IRA and Traditional IRA?,"This is a throwaway account just because I'm going to be giving a good amount of personal information in this post.

I just graduated college and accepted a position for 70k near DC. (cost of living is much higher near DC). They have a pretty nice retirement plan (457(b) where they match 9% for my 5%). However, I will have a bit more disposable income and was looking to invest in an IRA. 

The benefit of a Roth IRA is that you pay taxes now rather than when you take out the money. Also, I know exactly how much I'm going to be taxed rather than if I were to get a Traditional IRA which could have a higher tax rate than the current tax bracket.

With a Traditional IRA, I can count that towards my AGI.

Being that I am in the 25% federal tax bracket and I'm planning on getting married in the next 10 years, I will most likely stay in the 25% tax bracket the rest of my career.

personalfinance,26 Slightly Late Bloomer in NYC. What More Can I Do? (US),"Hello Everyone,

This is a newer account, but I have been reading PF for about two years now, and in that time I've gone from almost $16,000 in immediate credit card debt and initial student loans off a crummy $12/hr wage job to fully paid off credit cards, a better job, and some basic investments. I read the Frugal subreddit, learned to cook my meals, learned to budget better, studied my ass off for job upgrades over the course of 2 and a half years, and set aside considerable money for savings, investments, etc, but now I'm wondering what to do next.

My current set up:

- Working for Ad Tech Firm as a BI Analyst ($70k base) just started two months ago). No bonus structure, but decent benefits.
- Up to $50 reimbursed for gyms/ month
- Options for training relevant to job
- Healthcare covered %100 in NYC (because it's a Canadian company)
- Reimbursable MTA pass (factored into Net pay b/c weird system)
- Net Pay (after taxes + reimbursables): $4125 a month
- Catered lunch on Fridays
- Credit Score of 760 - 780 range

Current Liabilities:

- Student Loans: $3300

Assets:

- Traditional 401k (that I still need to rollover): $12,500
- Stash Invest ETF Funds (5 Funds at around equal distributions - AOR, ITA, ROBO, CIBR, GURU): $14,500 at 9.24% total return
- Digit Automated Savings Account: Variable, but usually rakes in $300 - $500 a month. Used as a travel fund.
- 180k miles with Chase Reserve at 16,500 credit limit + 7 other cards all paid off.

Basic Budget:

- Starting Monthly: $4,125
- Monthly Transit: -$120
- Gym: -$25
- Rent: -$600
- Stash Invest ETF Funds 5 x $125: -$625
- Parent Support (I help my parents out with some bills): -$150
- Student Loan Payment: -$150
- Food (for meal prep): -$260 (average)
- Food/ Going out (NYC social life/dating expenses ugh): $600 - $1,000
- Home Supplies, Internet, Electrical, Gas: $100
- Digit Savings (Mostly for travel funds, but any extra goes into Stash Funds currently): $300 to $500
- Current guilty (but necessary) purchase - Leesa mattress financed through Affirm at 0% APR for 6 months around $170

**Leaving a net operating income of around $425 to $1,025**

Need to Dos:

- Rollover 401k of $12,500 from previous company
- Open up Roth IRA or go with Company 401k plan (theirs is full vestment in 6 years).
- Find other sources of investments/ passive income


Goals:

- Career Path Decisions: Product Manager, Manager of Analytics, Data Scientist?
- Begin acquiring cash flow rental properties as equity building tool (goal of net $500-700 dollars cash flow for first property as realistic goal. Hopefully possible this year)

Stumbling Blocks/ Future Headaches:

- Parents will need a contribution of $500 dollars a month after selling their home to fund their ""retirement home/ last and final house."" They are shooting for a $300,000 ballpark house with a $60k down payment most likely in North Carolina (They still have to sell their house first so this will take maybe 1 to 2 years by my book).



I managed to make my life in NYC fairly simple with some added benefits by moving to a nice 2BR apartment in Queens and choosing to rent out my living room at $500/month (saving me and my other room mate $250 a month). Since eating out is expensive, I choose to cook for at least 4 out of the 5 days for lunch and dinner (most days), while I have catered lunch on Fridays at the company. I also started to learn more mixology and choose to ""pre-game"" with my whiskey collection rather than buy $15 bud-lights at bars/clubs. Helps to have a wholesale liquor store next to my apt and buying duty free for more quality liquors for my personal bar. I love to travel so almost all my expenses outside of rent go through my Chase Sapphire Reserve (which is paid off 100% every month). I mostly use miles for travel and build up a budgeted fund through Digit's Automated Savings account for travel expenses grabbing cheap airbnbs.

I have realized that investing in a 401k/Roth IRA is a good stable (and necessary) investment. Last job had a fully vested 100% match on 4% of contributions, current company's fallback is that it has a 6 year vestment schedule at 5% match for 5%, but not sure if I'd stay long enough to enjoy that benefit since hopping jobs in the advertising/tech industry leads to more experience, exposure, and raises.

I realized true positive returns come at increased risk. With national inflation at around 3% average, a mere savings account will not do for the growth I want to achieve.

Been able to write off the interest for student loans paid on taxes year after year (so basically paying principle in the end), but with Trump, not sure if that is possible for next tax season.

I am thinking of rolling over my old 401k and then contributing solely to a Roth IRA and max out the $5,500 limit every year with the net operating income I have.

The cash flow property goal I have is more risky as things can go south with bad renters or bad management of buildings/ law suits, but I have been reading more into this with housing laws, property investment blogs, and co-op rules and come from a background in building/ construction management (that $12/hour, $34k job).

My motivations are to make as much money and smart investments so that I can treat my family and be able to take care of my sister (who is mentally handicapped) and would need me to be her guardian when my parents are no longer able to support her.

I know my salary could definitely be higher, but I believe I positioned myself in the best way I could from around $34k a year when I was 23 years old as an assistant construction manager to $42k - $55k as a Marketing Analyst at 24 to 25 years old to $70k a year today as a BI Analyst as a 26 year old in NYC. Helps that the new company provides lots of benefits that I never experienced like the fully covered health monthlies and catered lunches (minus a good IRA option). Somehow I survived the tumult, but what else can I do? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can do better/more or what IRAs to look into or if I'm not making some good decisions? I'd love to hear some input cause I feel like there is always something more/better.",finance
personalfinance,Digging myself out of a hole,"I made some dumb decisions in life, and grew up with certain circumstantial handicaps. I got married very young, had two kids (4, 6) and then divorced. I'm 29/yo and I moved to the US (I'm a citizen but was born abroad) six months ago and left them behind. It's my dream to be able to bring them over and create a better life for them. I miss them a lot.

I feel like I'm missing something regarding my income and expenses, and would love to hear some advice from people as objective outsiders. Does anything jump out at you?

**Assets and income** 

Home overseas - I have about $100k in equity on a house (after paying back mortgage and ex). Its value is always going up and I'm disinclined to sell it so that my kids have more stability. But $100k would take me a long way right now.

New home in US - just bought a house one month ago with almost no money down. Valued at 150k, mortgage is for 130k at 5.7% (they bundled in PMI). I plan on renting out the other bedrooms to cover the mortgage but haven't found anyone yet. Current payments are $900/m. I am interested in real estate investing and pushed myself with this property to get my foot in the door.

Job - my 9-5 job pays me about $60k, I bring in $3600 or so a month net. I'm lucky to enjoy my work environment and have a generous and flexible boss. It lets me explore other ventures if I want to. He also gives me some bonuses and sales commissions. That said, supposedly I could be making over $100k a year in my profession as a UX designer but I'm not sure how realistic that actually is. I'm also studying to get my real estate agent license.

**Liabilities and expenses**

Child support - $1800 in half of this is paying down the mortgage on my overseas house.

Mortgage and taxes on house listed above - $900

Debt payback - I currently owe about $23k in loans overseas, interest rate at 8.5%. It's a 7 year loan and I pay about $600 a month for it. Would love to consolidate in the US but keep getting rejected for insufficient credit history. My credit score itself is great (680-730 depending on bureau). I'm currently in the process of withdrawing my overseas pension and compensation which sucked anyway and I didn't have control over, that should give me $10k to pay back some of it.

Car loan - $300. I am a new driver and desperately needed a car. So I bought a 2013 Hyunday Elantra with 30k miles on it. It's valued at 10k, but currently have a 13k, 7 year loan at 6.5%. My payments are supposed to be $240 and I've been putting in $300 to pay it down faster.

Car Insurance - $380. This is a killer. I've shopped around and can't believe new drivers pay this much but I can't get anything lower. I've got 300/100 coverage, am currently using the tracker gadget to lower costs a bit, bundled it with my homeowners insurance, but still, it's stuck at that amount. Am I missing something? I'll have my new driver status for another 2.5 years, just got my license when I moved.

Internet - $70

Phone - $50

Gas - $100

Groceries - $200

Haven't gotten any other utility bills yet.

Health insurance - $30 I'm currently on very cheap ($1 day) travelers insurance from my old country. That'll eventually need to change.

So starting out with a bunch of debt, no savings whatsoever, but a lot of talent and ambition (which can sometimes backfire). I build websites on the side but it wears me down after 8 hours of doing it at work. Probably make between $500-1000 extra a month from side hustling. What are your suggestions? I really need some encouragement that I'll get off of this hamster wheel sometime soon.

Until recently, I have been planning on living at home for a year after I graduate to pay my student loans before interest accrues, then create a starting emergency savings (estimated $6k which should cover me for 3-6 months). However, I have come to the realization that I am miserable at my hometown. I do not have many friends there, and there is very little opportunity to mingle or grow. I am considering moving to the Pittsburgh area once I graduate (plans on living with 1-3 roommates) so I can push my life forward. I have been in the town with friends from college and I enjoy the city/lifestyle a lot. There is so much more to do and many more opportunities to be with people my age range.


***COST PROJECTIONS [i](Monthly):***
 
***If I were to stay in my hometown:***

* $1,800 income per month after 401k contribution and taxes (based on $35k salary).

* $20 spent per month on cell phone expense.

* $100 spent for food expense (I usually spend $50, but estimating worst case).

* $50 spent for gas expense (travel, etc.)

* $70 spent for car insurance
 
**Left Over:** $1,560
 
 
***If I were to live in Pittsburgh:***

* $2,050 spent per month after 401k contribution and taxes (based on $40k salary).

* $12.50 spent per month for Renter’s Insurance (Assuming $150 yearly)

* $700 spent per month on rent expense, after roommate split and utilities (includes cell phone).

* $200 spent for food expense (I usually spend $150, but estimating worst case).

* $100 spent for gas expense (travel, etc.)

* $70 spent for car insurance.
 
Left Over: $964.50
 

My biggest questions are:
 

1. Can I financially afford to move to Pittsburgh straight out of college? While I am positive on my leftover income, I wish to be sure that I am not missing any details. I am usually pretty frugal and do not spend a lot of money most of the time.

2. Do my budgets look reasonable? Food and gas are costs that I have estimated based off of my Mint history but the yearly income, rent/insurance are all estimates.

3. Should I be more worried about financial stability or personal happiness? From what I am seeing it looks like I can survive moving out financially but it would dent me a bit due to initial costs (security deposit, furniture, moving, etc). However, while I would be financially better off to live at home it would take a toll on my mental health.

personalfinance,Beginning steps to investing in my IRA,"Hi Guys,

I've been doing a lot of reading and lurking for a while and I'm a little stuck on what to do next. Here's some background info, and hopefully it's enough.

I'm 24, working in IT at a University, single, making $58k annually, and have the following accounts:

* Traditional IRA (rolled over) - $2,500 
* 403(b) - $1k 
* Savings (looking to open a Ally Savings account and move money there) - $15k

IRA currently has no investments.

403(b) is split into 60% trad contributions and 40% roth. The current funds I've invested in are which may be a little repetitive are: Vanguard Target Fund 2050 (75%) and 2060 (20%) and Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (5%).


I've read several articles and know that there is constant mention of tax-free growth with an IRA vs. a Brokerage account, and also the tax implications with double taxing via capital gains tax (if you hold less than a year?) and income tax. Overall it seems that investing in Index Funds and some stocks seem to be the better option in the long run with an IRA than in a Brokerage account. 


I know the key is to try to hold stocks for at least 365 days in order to be able to pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax instead of the short-term capital gains tax at your regular rate. It seems like for stocks you want to hold for short-term that you're better off using an IRA, and to put long-term stocks in the brokerage account instead.


With all this in mind, my question is: Would it be a sound strategy to invest and max out the IRA first with investments in mostly Index Funds, and then some Stocks/ETFs (short/long-term stocks)? Or would I be better off maxing out the IRA with Index Funds and opening a Brokerage account to invest stocks in (mix of short and long-term stocks).",finance

investing,Why don't negative interest rates create a market for matured bonds?,"Swiss short-term interest rates are close to -1%. If one has bought a 10 year bond in 2007 (say) which has recently matured, then one can hold it past maturity for however long and delay cashing it in. So one would be better off selling it on the market for higher than the nominal price. I can't think of a single scenario where one would be better off cashing in a matured bond rather than selling it at a higher price since people are actually willing to pay the government to hold their money. So why isn't there an ever-increasing market of matured bonds?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan payment strategy,"I had trouble finding information about this, but I want to know if this is a good idea or if I should watch out for anything.

I graduated college a few months ago and will be starting a job this summer, paying about $80,000 a year. I have $15,750 in federal subsidized student loans, broken down as follows:

* $4,500 @ 4.7%
* $5,500 @ 4.3%
* $2,750 @ 3.8%

They all start accruing interest and exit their grace periods at the same time, and these are my only debts. Given my income and loan situation, and that I will be able to live with my parents to save on rent, I think that I will be able to pay somewhere in the $1,000-$2,000/month range towards my loans. So I think that I will be able to repay them well within the next 2 years, if not next 1 year.

Anyway, since all of my repayment plan options have minimum monthly payments ($90-$500/month, roughly) well below what I can afford, is it a good idea to select the payment plan with the lowest minimum monthly payment, so that I have a larger excess payment to allocate to the highest interest rate loan first? For example, the level 10-year repayment plan would have payments of $130/month, and the graduated 10-year repayment plan would start at $90/month for the first 2 years, and higher thereafter. It's the difference between the 2 monthly minimums that I wonder if it would be better spent on that 4.7% interest rate loan. My main goals are to pay as little interest as possible so that I can be debt-free faster.

Hope I gave enough detail, and thanks for any and all advice!",finance

personalfinance,Medical Student CC Debt,"I am an MD medical student who will graduate in 2018 with about 200k in student loans (pretty average for medical school debt). In the years before medical school I accrued 20k in credit card debt. I realized it was a bad idea, but was stuck at the time and didn't look into other ""loan"" options. Since starting medical school I have used part of my student loans each month to pay the interest on my CC's (both have about 10k and interest rates around 18%), but it's pretty hard to pay them down with the loans I am getting. Obviously my credit is bad having such a high amount of debt and I have had to occasionally be late on payments waiting for loans to kick in. 

Are there any options to combine my CC's at a lower interest rate? I feel I'm in a bit of a unique scenario as it's impossible for me to get a paying job at the moment, but I will be making 300K + in 5 years barring a catastrophe. I will be a resident 1 year from now and will make around 60k for 4 years (average take home is ~35k after paying on student loans).

personalfinance,"Trying to help my Grandma figure out what to do about her debt, any advice is appreciated.","I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible but I tend to ramble. Also she's actually my SO's grandma but she's still family to me. 


So grandma is struggling to make all her payments each month and we are trying to help her figure out what the best way to deal with her debt is. She has several lines of credit that she's paying off, including a mortgage on her house. 

Her monthly deficit is a bit over $3k, and her current monthly income is about $3.5k. For the moment she's getting by, but her payments are going up by about $400 in September (maybe October, have to double check) and she may be losing several hundred dollars of monthly income which will upset the precarious balance she's had until now. 

Currently she's paying $1,720 per month towards her mortgage — though I'm not sure what the total amount she owes on it is — about $530 per month in utilities, and the rest is credit cards and loans from Chase and BoA, one of which is about to go up in its minimum monthly payment from $400 to $800. 

Her income is coming from Social Security (~$600/month), her job (~$1600/ month, but may soon go down significantly as she may be losing her biggest client), and renting out the front half of her house, $800 from her son and his family in the main house w/ 3 bedrooms, and $500 from her other tenant who is resting just the den area. 


She's considering several different possibilities:

•Reverse mortgage (not sure if that's the right name, where the government slowly buys the equity of your house from you) to pay off all her other debts and then focus on the house

•Trying to sell the house on the market (but we don't think it's worth as much as she wants)

•Increasing her son's rent or kicking him out and finding a new tenant. A few of my friends and I have offered to pay her $1700/month for the front house if he leaves, and she would still have the $500 from her other tenant in addition to that. But she could probably rent it out for much more than that to someone else. 

•Moving out of the back house where she's currently living and trying to rent that out for more than whatever an apartment would cost her to rent (which I think is unlikely. 

•Going to a credit union or other institution to do debt consolidation to reduce her payments, but she seems to think that the costs of that outweigh the benefits.



We'd really appreciate any advice you might have, and if you need more information I can ask and reply/edit it in. Thanks in advance!


Edit from comment: 

I don't have the interest rates but I will try to get them.

$50($225.09)

$160($8,163.60)

$420($82,732.30) but this payment is going up to ~800/month. I think the explanation is that the $420 is just the interest and she needs to start paying the actual balance. **Edit:** as far as I know this isn't actually a credit card, on her Bank of America statement it's titled ""home and equity"" but it's not the account that holds her mortgage.

I’ve just been hit with an odd situation that I’m not sure how to handle. If y’all could give me an idea of how I’m doing financially, and give me some guidance, that would be great. Here’s my financial breakdown:

2% Non-Elective 401(k) Contribution =1401 USD / Year
3% Bonus = 2101.50 USD / Year

Job #2 (Mechanic):

Base Wage = 12 USD/Hr @ 20 hours / week = 11520 USD / Year + 1 free meal per shift

Job #3 (Freelance Technical Writer):

Monthly Earnings = 150 USD = 1800 USD / Year

TOTAL INCOME = 90375 USD / Year
---------------------------------------------------

Rent= 0 USD ( I live out of the bed of my truck, but we’ll get to that later. )
Food = 2880 / Year
Fuel = 3840 / Year
Insurance = 680 USD /year
401(k) Contribution = 18000 USD / Year

REMAINING CASH = 36920 USD / Year

-----------------------------------------------------

Basically, I’ve got 36920 USD to play with each year. I’m contributing a total of 23500 USD / Year to my retirement accounts, so I’m definitely not fucking about with my cash.

My loan is a medical related loan for family and we all chip in for their treatment. However, I’ve got a pretty big problem. There’s a former ladyfriend that helped me out through college when most of my family hung me out to dry or flat out didn’t support my decision to attend university. She got caught up in drugs, I and her family put her through rehab and have gotten her mostly back on her feet. Here’s where things get tricky. 

She had me take a look at her finances and she got fucked. Badly. She’s about 5 grand in debt, her 401(k) was wiped out, and she’s only brining in about 2k a month not contributing to anything. I’m trying my best to get her back on track. Her current job doesn’t offer a 401(k). I’m thinking about offering a dollar for dollar match up to 2750 USD to get her putting something in an IRA. We might not have a future together anymore, but I’m not about to watch her rot after she invested so much in me. 

Anyways, your thoughts and recommendations are appreciated. I’m 26 and haven’t the slightest damn clue what I’m doing with my life.",finance
personalfinance,I was alerted to fraudulent charges on my credit card by text messages twice in two weeks.,"Just wanted to tell you all about what's happened with my credit card in the past two weeks... 

I've previously set up my checking and credit card accounts to send a text message to my phone whenever any transactions occur on them.  Back on May 17, I received a text message from my Citi DoubleCash card about an $0.11 transaction at ""Good Clean Food"" in Glendale, CA.  My immediate reaction was, ""oh, crap!"" since I was at work at the time in a completely different part of L.A.  The credit card was in my possession.  That first message was quickly followed by a second one for $15.00 from Lyft, in San Francisco, CA.  As I was on the phone with customer service to report the fraudulent transactions, a third text message came for $7.00 from Uber (no city in the text message, but also in California).  Customer service cancelled my card immediately and marked the transactions as being reported fraudulent.  They also sent me a new card overnight via FedEx.

I didn't use the new card until this past Saturday to buy some stuff from the supermarket for a barbecue I was hosting.  Two hours ago, I got another text message for $11.48 from Lyft in San Francisco.  I reported the fraudulent transaction again, same routine, card cancelled, new card is being sent out to me.  Looks like I got it cancelled this time before any more charges could be made.  Like before, the card has been in my possession the whole time.

I have two takeaways from this experience: the first is that text message alerts are good to have - very good!  The second is that I don't know how this is happening, and I don't know if something I am doing is exposing my account information to thieves.  I've noticed that both times this happened, I visited the same Ralphs supermarket the two days before the fraudulent charges occurred.  I don't know if that's where my account info is being stolen, or if it's an inside job at Citibank (doesn't seem likely to me, because twice in two weeks?).

Is there something I can do to better protect myself in the future?",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) What are typical rates for a debt consolidation loan?,"I have a few credit cards that I have been slowly paying off, but the interest rates (20%) make it very difficult to make a big dent.  I went and talked to my bank about the possibility of getting a debt consolidation loan.  I am going to meet with them tomorrow, but on the phone they said it is looking like they could give me one to cover all of my CC debt for 9.2% interest.

Obviously this is much better than the 20% I am currently paying, but I'm wondering if anyone knows if this is a typical value for somebody who is in CC debt and likely doesn't have the greatest credit score?  If not, any advice for trying to get it lower?

Thanks.

Bitcoin,What determines the fluctuations of value in bitcoin? What are bitcoin even backed by(if anything) for that matter?,"I have taken macro and micro economics courses in college and habitually read economic literature(even my favorite fantasy book series was largely based upon European economics in the middle ages) so I am not coming from a place of pure ignorance as far as economics goes. I can obviously tell that as more businesses accept bitcoins and as more people use bitcoin the value will increase proportionately that is just basic supply and demand at play. However What I do not completely understand is why the value drastically changes erratically? I remember 2 years ago Bitcoin was around $200 and the next month it jumped to $430 and then dropped again and now it's like $2,200+ for one bitcoin? I am really kicking my own ass for not jumping on the bandwagon earlier but seriously what is up with the dramatic price changes so fast where is the logic to it all?

With that said I am aware it is an extremely volatile investment and traditionally you are advised not to invest your entire savings into it due to the volatile nature but assuming you buy during a low value time and it spikes you can only benefit id imagine.

However I am concerned about the potential for Bitcoin to bottom out entirely at some point in the distant future due to valid concerns such as increased regulations on bitcoin or another cryptocurrency conquering it somehow dropping even lower than historically seen and never recover. So I am curious what forces exactly dictates the ever-fluctuating value and what are bitcoins even backed by (not that this issue seems to matter given the dollar has been off the gold standard for decades and has been irresponsibly reproduced by the fed yet paradoxically remains the world reserve currency)? Off topic I would also really like to know how the dollar retains it's buying power despite the fact there is literally nothing but promises from the federal reserve of it's value with nothing of substance backing it up.

I also would like to know if there are any recognizable patterns anyone has discovered in the fluctuations of bitcoin value and if so are they worth taking into consideration of when to invest(like an investors almanac perhaps) or are they largely superstitions at this point with no actual proven link to a cause-effect relationship?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,A list of things to do when a loved one dies,"First--I am not a lawyer or a financial planner. I am a 31-year-old high school teacher who had the misfortune of having to deal with the loss of my husband last year after a long illness (though it happened suddenly, without time to prepare). So here is what I have learned from the experience of losing a family member suddenly--here is what you need to do in the immediate aftermath and the time following. Note that this does NOT include anything having to do with the care and keeping of children under the age of 18 for whom the deceased may have been the primary caregiver, as I don’t have any experience in dealing with that. 
 
1\. Immediately after your loved one dies
 
If you are in a hospital, you will be asked immediately what funeral home you want your loved one’s remains sent to. I chose one based on my late husband’s best friend’s recommendation. Hopefully you will know of one ahead of time. If not, the hospital will likely be able to give you a list, and you can call and inquire about pricing. Delegate this task if possible. 
 
If you know what your family member’s wishes are in terms of organ and tissue donation, talk to the hospital staff about whether that is feasible. In our case, I wanted my husband’s remains to be used for medical research into his genetic condition, but this was not a possibility due to the infection symptoms he was exhibiting at time of death. 
 
The hospital will have a chaplain. Use them. I hate the hospital where my husband died more than words can describe, but all three chaplains we saw during the last day he was alive were wonderful. 
 
Chances are that there will probably not be an autopsy. If there is, it will be performed by the county medical examiner, and after cause of death is determined, then the remains will be released to the funeral home you’ve chosen. It is also possible (though expensive, and not usually necessary) to have a private autopsy done. These would usually take place at the funeral home. 
 
2\. Funeral home stuff
 
Questions to consider:

Did your loved one have a preference between burial and cremation? 

Did your loved one make any pre-arrangements? Do they already have a burial plot? 

Will you be having a funeral or memorial service? If so, do you want to hold it in a church or at the funeral home? (There are no right answers to these questions. If you know what your loved one would want you to do, then do that. If you don't know, then do what feels right to you.)
 
The funeral home will also ask you how many copies of the death certificate you would like. The short form death certificate will not have the cause of death on it, but the long form will. Get several of each. You need the long form certificate for filing life insurance claims. Most places will want the short form. 
 
The funeral home won’t tell you this, but you don’t have to buy things like urns and whatnot from them. I chose to, because the prospect of receiving a plastic baggie with my husband’s ashes that I would have to deal with was horrifying. A friend bought an urn for his father’s ashes on Amazon. There are options that are cheaper than the funeral home, but I chose to pay the obscene markup so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the logistics. 
 
Take someone with you to the funeral home. Don’t try to do it yourself. The funeral home, many times, will take payment from the life insurance proceeds. I didn’t go this route so can’t speak about it. 
 
Make funeral arrangements, write obituary, etc. Ask for help. Don’t try to do it all yourself. 

Edit: If your loved one was in the military, even if they have been separated for a long period of time, they may be eligible for military funeral honors. The funeral director will ask about whether they were in the military and share this information with you.

If your loved one was a member of a fraternal organization (Masons, Shriners, etc.), you or a family member may want to contact the organization's leadership to share the news of their passing. My husband was a Mason and it meant a lot that representatives came to his memorial service.
 
3\. Dealing with assets
 
First--determine the following. Where did the deceased have bank accounts? Did the deceased have life insurance? Was the deceased employed at time of death? Do they own a home or a vehicle? Do they have a retirement account? You need to know the answers to all of these questions, and I’m assuming that you do in my next steps.
 
Next--does the deceased have a will? If so, then the next step is locating it, finding an estate attorney, and getting the estate filed. From there, all assets will be distributed through the estate, with the exception of the ones below.
 
Life insurance does NOT pass through the estate process--it goes to the beneficiary listed on the policy, or if there is no beneficiary listed, it goes to the next of kin as determined by state law. (Tip: ALWAYS LIST A BENEFICIARY.) If the life insurance policy is through the deceased’s employer, then the person in charge of benefits at their employer will be able to help you file the necessary paperwork. You will need a certified copy of the death certificate to file the life insurance claim. 
 
Any other joint property also does NOT pass through the estate. This tends to apply more if the loved one who has died is a spouse, rather than a parent. Bank accounts may have a payable-on-death beneficiary, in which case they do not pass through the estate, they go directly to that beneficiary. In some cases, an estate will have no assets, because all of the assets will pass directly to the spouse. (This is what happened in my case--all of his assets went to me.) Tip: Ensure that any bank accounts, retirement accounts, etc., have a payable-on-death beneficiary. 
 
If the deceased owned any real property, you will need to have the death certificate recorded in the county where the property is owned. If the property is jointly owned, this will remove the deceased’s name from the property. I believe that if the property is solely owned by the deceased, this puts it in the name of the estate. 
 
Notify Social Security. There is a small survivor’s benefit (like $250) that the surviving spouse receives if he or she was living with the deceased at the time of death. If the deceased was receiving Social Security benefits at time of death, and you receive a check after the person dies, you have to return that check to Social Security, but it will be reissued to the next of kin. You will have to call your local Social Security office to report the death, and they will be able to help you with what benefits, if any, you are entitled to. 
 
Notify the plan administrators for any retirement accounts the deceased had. If you are the only next of kin, then their retirement accounts can be rolled over into an account for you. 403b or 401k accounts are rolled into traditional IRAs. 

Edited to add: Personal property, if there is a will, needs to be disposed of according to the will. However, if your family member didn't have a will, or if there is personal property not mentioned in the will, it is going to be up to you, the next of kin, to dispose of it as you see fit. Don't be a dick. If you know your spouse would have wanted his parents to have had something, give it to them. Don't get rid of stuff just to do it in order to hurt someone. Similarly, don't let other people take stuff before you're ready to deal with it. If siblings or parents or whoever are pressuring you to give them X item because ""Dad said I could have it when he died"" and you aren't sure if that's true, just say ""can we deal with this at a later time"" or similar. This is really more of a /r/relationships issue. That being said, this part CAN get extremely complex if it turns out that a particular piece of personal property ends up being wildly valuable and you had no idea. This happened to my grandmother and her sister when my great-grandmother died--a painting my great-grandparents had bought for $200 in the 1940s wound up being worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, which they didn't find out until AFTER the estate was closed and my great-aunt had wound up with the painting. This will not happen to the vast majority of people. 
 
Finally, if you intend to file any type of wrongful death or medical malpractice lawsuit, then you must open an estate. Only the estate of a deceased person has standing to file a medical malpractice suit, and any settlement that is received as a result of a lawsuit becomes an asset that is a part of the estate and would be distributed according to the will or to the next of kin if there is no will. 
 
4\. Dealing with debts, estates, etc.
 
  IMPORTANT EDIT: The below information does NOT apply in community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin). I know very little about what does happen in community property states, other than that the spouse of the deceased CAN be held responsible for marital debt even if the debt was solely in the name of the deceased. Thanks to /u/discontentedwinter for pointing this out--I have no experience with this. 

First--it is important to know that no matter what debt collectors try to tell you, YOU ARE NOT PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DEBT INCURRED BY THE DECEASED. This includes medical bills! You have enough expenses to worry about. Do not try to pay these bills. 
However, bills you SHOULD plan to pay are anything that is in both your name and the deceased’s name jointly (such as mortgages and car loans). Edit: Also, even if the mortgage and car loan are only in the name of the deceased, if you want to keep these items, you should make arrangements to pay them. Again, talk to your estate attorney. 
 
All unsecured debts become part of the deceased’s estate. If there are assets that do not pass automatically to the next-of-kin, those also become part of the deceased’s estate. Any debts must be paid out of the assets in the estate. If there are no assets, then no debts can be paid and they will be discharged. 
 
When you go see your estate attorney, he or she will ask you for a list of any creditors that the deceased owed money to. Once the estate is filed, your attorney will send notices to each creditor and give them the opportunity to file claims against the estate. These claims take precedence over the distributions to the beneficiaries of the estate. However, each creditor has a limited amount of time after they’ve been notified to file a claim. If they don’t file a claim in a timely manner, then they lose their opportunity to do so. 

Edit: Federal student loans are forgiven when the borrower dies, as are PLUS loans where the student for whom the money was borrowed has died. However, documentation must be provided to the student loan servicer. In our case, his loans were in forbearance while he was out of work due to his illness, and somehow (not sure how) the servicer got word of his death, and sent me a letter saying that they could be forgiven if I sent them the death certificate. 
 
5\. All those other accounts
 
* Joint bank accounts--contact each bank. Inform them that one of the account holders has died. They will require a copy of the death certificate (usually a photocopy is okay). This will remove the deceased from the joint account. If the account is only in the name of the deceased, it should become part of the estate. 

* Cell phones, land lines, cable, internet, etc--decide whether you are canceling or changing the name on the account. Sometimes you will need to cancel the account in order to change the name on it. 

* Credit cards--this one is advice from personal experience. If you are an authorized user on a credit card account where the primary cardmember is deceased, you should remove yourself as an authorized user BEFORE canceling the account. Otherwise you may find your social security number flagged as deceased. (Way to go, Citi.) Make sure that any expenses that are automatically billed to those accounts are changed. Then cancel the accounts, sending a copy of the death certificate if necessary. The credit card companies will notify the credit bureaus so that no new credit accounts can be opened in their name. 

* Frequent flyer miles/hotel points--you may be able to transfer the points or miles belonging to a deceased person to the next of kin. This will depend on the individual programs. Expect to have to provide a copy of the death certificate.

* E-mail--I left my late husband’s e-mail account open. I knew the password so that wasn’t an issue. I would rather have access to it than to close the account. I also don't want to lose all of what he had stored across the Google ecosystem. You may feel differently. 

* Facebook, other social media--Facebook has a memorial account feature. If you choose to memorialize your loved one’s Facebook profile, you will be able to manage what (if anything) is posted on their page, and no one will be able to log in to the account. 

* Digital media (Kindle books, purchased music, etc.)--every issuer is different. For Amazon content, your best bet is to add your loved one to your Amazon household so that the content can be shared. I don’t know about purchased music from other services but I understand that they can be difficult. If anyone has experience with getting other digital services (purchased music through iTunes or Google or similar, Steam, etc.) please feel free to share.

* Medical insurance--the death of a family member is a qualifying event to change your insurance plan. If the deceased was the primary person on the insurance plan, then you will need a new insurance plan. You will be able to sign up for insurance through your employer even if you are outside of your normal open enrollment period. If you don’t have access to insurance through your employer, you will be eligible for insurance through COBRA for up to three years. If the deceased was on your insurance plan, then you can remove him/her to save on the premiums even if it’s outside of open enrollment. 
 
6\. Taxes
 
You will need to file a tax return on behalf of the deceased when it comes to tax time next year. If you were married to him/her, then you can file a joint tax return for that tax year. It’s much the same as filing taxes for anyone else. If the estate is open for more than a year, you will need to file tax returns for the estate as well (not the same year that the person died, this is after that). Talk to your estate attorney for more details on that. 
 
7\. Things you would never expect
 
* As soon as you file the estate and/or record the death certificates, you will start getting letters, and if you’re very unlucky, phone calls and text messages, from realtors and investors. They will be offering to buy your house for cash quickly, help you liquidate the estate, etc. These people are the scum of the earth and deserve to be publicly shamed. If you are a better person than I am, you will ignore them. If you are like me, you will post pictures of these letters on the internet so your friends and loved ones know not to ever work with these people. 

* You will be amazed at what service providers will need copies of the death certificate. I had to provide a copy to cancel our internet service because it was in my husband’s name. I had no problem at all canceling his credit cards. YMMV. 
 
I hope this is helpful to some of you.

personalfinance,Help with my ETF portfolio,"Well, my mom's to be more precise. She is 60 and definitely looking to retire in the next decade. Now, for my own personal portfolio, I have a heavy stock weighting because I am young. however as I've read multiple times one should increase bond exposure with the investor's age. Thus, I seek to construct a more conservative portfolio with low volatility for her.
However, I am concerned about stocks being overpriced at the moment (Shiller's PE ratio currently higher than pre 08 crash levels) so I want to hedge out exposure to stocks. However, with bonds I am concerned about interest rates rising in the near future, thus decreasing bond principal significantly before any benefit can be reaped from reinvesting the dividends. Thus, I am trying to hedge against both by adding an especially high (15%, maybe even up to 20%) stake in REITs. My logic is that REITs have been incredible performers, add uncorrelation to bonds/equities, with dividend yields exceeding bonds, and annual returns exceeding the stock market, even through the 08 housing crisis. Also, as the population grows in the next few decades, I can't see housing prices coming down significantly and reducing REIT principal. However, I'm not sure the logic above is sound, if anyone sees a flaw in this let me know. Here is my proposed portfolio using Vanguard ETFs:
30% VTI - total us stock
10% VXUS - total international stock
30% BND - total bond market
10% VCIT - intermediate term corporate bond
20% VNQ - REIT
Doing some conservative backtesting from 2000-2017 (so through the DOTCOM bubble and the great recession, and assuming that I invest at the worst possible time for the market), I found that this does pretty well (https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1999&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2017&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=05%2F29%2F2017&amp;initialAmount=2500000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=0&amp;showYield=true&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=30&amp;symbol2=VGTSX&amp;allocation2_1=10&amp;symbol3=VBMFX&amp;allocation3_1=30&amp;symbol4=VBIIX&amp;allocation4_1=10&amp;symbol5=VGSIX&amp;allocation5_1=20).

personalfinance,"(USA) My friend needs money to enroll in University, What would be the best way to approach this?","Greetings /r/personalfinance Users &amp; Readers!
**I'm not in the USA, however my friend is and I'm posting here in order to see if there is a better course of action to help her**, thus I'm not too familiar with how the USA education systems work.

Tonight I come to you in an effort to obtain resources in order to devise a better plan for my friend's University Funding.

She is an Immigrant who is now a Citizen, currently resides within California and is 21 years of age, never borrowed money before, planning on attending University but lacks the funding required to do so, last year she asked her family for funding in order to pay for the university costs but they let her down and didn't give it to her after she passed the interview (this was before she was a citizen, thus she was unable to attend the University and had to wait another year to apply for another interview - continued below).

Now she made through another interview and is awaiting her results, I devised a plan for her to apply for a Federal Loan (Governmental loan -- if that's what its called I'm not exactly sure), however I've done a bit more research and it seems that (according to my Google research) that she may be able to apply for state, educational instutions, and or private agencies (foundations) student aid in the form of grants, education loans, work-study and or scholarships, *unfortunately I don't know which one would be better for her in the short term and in the long term.*

Please advice on the best way to approach this situation if you know of any, thank you for your time reading this, have a pleasant day!

Note: she requires about 150K for her University Funding, as she is going for a more expensive University as far as I am aware.",finance
personalfinance,I'm between jobs and can't afford to pay my federal student loans for a few months. I used my 6 month deferment right after graduation (~7 or 8 years ago). What are my options?,"A bit more info: My student loans are directly taken from my bank account each month and I haven't ever missed a payment since they started in 2009.

Well, now I live in another country and have been out of work for a few months while I am setting up my own business.

Would forbearance be an option?  (I'm not 100% clear on the difference between these two).

technology,Why Net Neutrality is irrelevant and the actual issue of internet quality and speed!,"The big issue for internet in the USA, but really anywhere in the world is competition and Techdirt actually had a great article on this how state governments(not actually the federal government) are the biggest problems due to their rules and regulations preventing new ISP from starting or others, smaller ones increasing their coverage and becoming more competitive.

If you want to champion a cause for better and faster and even more open internet, then petition your state and local governments to remove the rules and regulations that impede or even prevent competition altogether! 

""Net neutrality"" was codified into bureaucratic regulations in mid 2016, so why is it that the ""end of the earth"" didn't happen before ""net neutrality"" was put in place? Why didn't the ""terrible"" things that are going to happen now, why didn't they happen before? From mid 2016 back to the 90's when the internet started taking off? 

Because ""net neutrality"" is a fake issue with no correlation to number of ISP's, quality of internet service, access to the internet of anything else!",technology

Bitcoin,The Tale of BitcoinAir,"Once upon a time, there was an airline. It was called BitcoinAir.

BitcoinAir did not allow carry-on luggage. All luggage had to be stored
in the hold. At first, this allowed BitcoinAir to offer tickets at a
very low price.

Over time, BitcoinAir became very popular. So much so that the holds in
its planes could barely cope with the amount of luggage. Passengers were
forced to wait longer for a flight which could accommodate their
luggage; prices rose as people fought to get on the earlier flights.

BitcoinAir did not have a boss. Well, they did, but he had gone out to
lunch several years ago; he had yet to return, and was presumed fed.

In his absence, the staff of various departments tried to cope with the
issues in their own particular ways. 

Many of BitcoinAir's luggage packers formed unions. These unions
negotiated their fees based on how fast they could security check
baggage and get it on the plane. One union even went against company
policy and created its own packing strategy, allowing them to load
planes 30% more quickly.

What *they* really wanted were bigger planes, with more room in the
hold.  True, this would ultimately require
co-ordinating the replacement of the entire fleet, procedures, booking
systems, and so on. But, they said, that's not as difficult as it may
appear.

Some of the customer service reps, and a number of engineers, wanted
instead to allow carry-on luggage - in fact, they would mandate it! By
forcing passengers to take luggage into the cabin, the luggage allowance
in the hold could be made smaller, allowing for more passengers per
flight, and passengers may end up having access to smaller items
in-flight - oh, the convenience! All that would be needed would be to
fit overhead compartments and a few changes to the holds. Of course, the
redesigned holds wouldn't fit luggage from the *old* planes...

And some staff said that the best thing to do would be to wait. To try
to reach a consensus before trying to change anything.

Nobody liked their opponents' solutions.

The challenge was the passengers.

If they decided to wait, passengers would remain inconvenienced.

If they decided to replace the fleet, there could be huge technical
challenges with the new, bigger planes, leading to some passengers
losing their luggage.

If they decided to force passengers to take carry-on luggage and reduce
hold allowance, passengers could get stranded unless the whole fleet
upgraded together. A passenger who flew out on an old plane without
carry-on luggage wouldn't be able to move their luggage to a new plane
for the next leg of their journey.

One day, one of the carry-on contingent made a bold decision. They
would, from a certain date, roll out carry-on luggage to a proportion of
the fleet. There should, so their reasoning went, be enough capacity to
support passenger journeys even without upgrading the entire fleet. Many
carry-on proponents supported the idea. They even gained support from a
few of the luggage packing unions.

They argued that once people saw how great the upgraded planes were for
passenger experience, more of the fleet, and more of the packing unions,
would get on board (they chuckled to themselves at this pun).

Naysayers felt very concerned. What about passengers who booked on
the old style planes? If most of the fleet *didn't* upgrade, the passengers
could be stranded mid-journey!

Some felt the fleet should stand firm, and refuse to upgrade. Eventually
the silly new planes would be cancelled, or go off and form their own
company.

Some felt the whole fleet should just commit now to carry-on luggage,
and in doing so prevent any problems for passengers.

The passengers who read about the internal arguments just got worried.
Should they cancel their tickets and rebook with another airline?

And somewhere, the boss glanced at his watch, and wondered if he should
be getting back to the office. ""No,"" he decided, ""I'm probably better
off out of that mess. Waiter, another beer!""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,401k matching or Credit Card Debt,"I currently have $333 per month going to my 401k from my pay check. This is the 4% needed to get the max 2% matching from my company (.5% per 1% match up to 2% from company). I also have a credit card that is sitting between $26k-$29k on any given month. All my other ""bad debt"" (anything over 6% interest; mostly student loans) has been paid off. Should I stop my 401k for a bit and get the CC down to a more reasonable level? My available credit to debt ratio is near 50% due to this, which isn't hurting my credit too badly yet, but also isn't helping. interest rate on the CC is 11.9%. My return on my 401k is 21.9% year to date and was 13.2% last year. This is where I'm having trouble making a decision. If my 401k returns were lower it would be easy for me to stop contributing and move that money to the CC since I wouldn't be beating that interest rate with my return on the 401k.

Edit: Already have a zero based budget that we've been following for 2 years. My student loans and a few other debts were paid off first. This is the last one. The fluctuation comes from normal monthly things that are paid for on it for points along with bigger items that are paid off immediately. Its the rest of the balance thats going to take time to get rid of just like my student loans took awhile. All our extra money goes to this CC now once the month is over.

personalfinance,Mortgage question regarding paying a fee to re-lock my interest rate,"I'm a first time home buyer and am in the process of finalizing the mortgage paperwork.  I previously locked in my rate at 4.125% a couple weeks ago.  I noticed that the rate has since dropped to 4.000%.  

I called my mortgage broker and they are willing to work with me and have offered to ""re-lock"" my rate at 4% for a one-time fee of $585 or a one-time credit of $585 to keep my rate at 4.125%.

personalfinance,Repairs are more than car is worth. At what point to consider new car &amp; at what cost?,"Spouse and I share a 1998 Oldsmobile sedan with 62k miles, Kelley Blue Book private sale value of no more than $1600. This is our only car and is necessary to get spouse to work.

We inherited the car about 3 years ago after his grandmother passed. The car was in good shape, but had only ever seen light use and mostly sat in her driveway for 17 years.

We recently drove it cross-country for a move, and in the past 5 months we've spent over $2000 on repairs (massive coolant leak, major wheel alignment issue that included replacing 2 tires in April, etc).

A bunch of service lights came on this week so we took it to the dealer. The inspection for these issues cost $550, and now we are looking at an estimate of repairs over $3775 (speed sensor harness damaged causing anti-lock brake light and trac off service lights in car, two important lamp bulbs need replacing, transmission fluid pan is leaking, front brake pad and rotor replacement is necessary, multiple areas of oil leakage). We are not car experts and do not have the knowledge, time or desire to learn how to do work on the car ourselves.

We were also told previously the car would need new suspension within 2 years at a cost of $1000+.

I've heard that when repairs cost more than the car is worth, it's time to look at a new car.

We have $18500 in student loans at 6.125% interest, no consumer debt and have never had a car payment before. We had been aggressively paying down the student loan, but could theoretically redirect some of those funds to a car payment (ugh).

We make a combined $135000 gross a year, and have $3000 earmarked right now in a new car fund as well as $2100 we are waiting on from a state tax refund. We have about $6100 for the honeymoon we never took, but may be willing to use that on a car if push comes to shove, so total possible car downpayment of $11200. We'll still have around $13k in our emergency fund after paying for the car diagnoses.

Thoughts / advice / opinions on what to do here? Get brakes fixed ($615) so car is technically safe to drive and save aggressively to replace car with a $15k reliable model in 2 to 5 months in cash? Find out what our rate would be for a new(er) used car and start looking today? If we can get a really good interest rate, is it worth it to finance the car even if we could pay for it outright in order to keep laser focus on paying down high interest student loan?

If we need to buy, we would like a good, reliable car that will last us 8 to 15 years. Husband drives to work (20min highway one-way) and we visit family across town (30min highway) regularly.

While I would prefer a small SUV as we plan to start a family soon, I think it's smarter to get a sedan or hatchback to save money. Was thinking Honda Civic or Accord or a Toyota Camry, probably in the 2010-2014 range with less than 50k miles, running around $15k where we are.

Is this more car than we need? Are there better options for us? Open to any and all advice and opinions.",finance

-------------------
That budget is all post tax and does not account for ~365 401k monthly contribution or ~420 monthly HSA contribution. We are replenishing our e-fund at the moment due to a lot of medical and dental bills that ate through the HSA, along with some car repairs. We have over 1k in there again and our e-fund needs are less than others given our living situation and HSA savings. Of course that may all change now and I'm interested to hear what others have to say on this. This budget is new. We plan to apply the surplus to e-fund and/or student loans. 

Anyway, Wife just got pregnant! Also, I recently posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/67hm12/when_to_give_up_on_an_old_car/ 

Well, it turns out that a large, dead, mold covered branch crashed down upon that car and it seems like I'll need a new one sooner rather than later. 

As for income, mine may be about to go up as I'm being aggressively pursued by a good employer. However, it would require a decent commute and I currently work at home, so the benefits of the increase may be tame in the short run. As for my wife, she is in the very early stages of trying to launch a furniture/design company from home. We are not counting on this for money at all. 

We are fortunate enough to live with her parents who also plan to pay for a cloth diaper service. So daycare and diaper costs should be pretty much nil. 

Okay, so. I know I need to add term life insurance for myself to the budget. How do I shop for that? What should I look for? I currently have a 1 year's salary policy for free from work. Just in case that impacts anything. Should I explicitly add anything else to the budget? Am I saving enough for one time baby costs when considering we will get a lot at the shower? 

Now, insurance. We have a HDHP with a 3000/6000 deductible and a 6000/12000 out of pocket max. The baby is due in February. I imagine I should switch to a low deductible plan during open enrollment if I stay at my current job? Or enroll in one upon receiving a new job? And all maternity care will be covered despite her being pregnant when we enroll and us being on a HDHP when we first found out? 

I just don't know what to expect insurance-wise. I kinda regret the HDHP now. However, it seems like most crazy medical costs would be incurred in 2018, right? So maybe no big deal? 

Thanks so much for any insight. Much appreciated!!

personalfinance,In-laws want us to cosign their refinance,"As the title stated, my husband's parents want us to cosign their refinance because they cannot qualify in their own. Dad is retired with a pension (we think 50k/yr) and mom is a preschool ""teacher"" earning we think ~ $35k/yr. When the dad retired early, my husband took over their mortgage for years until we got married and needed to start saving for our future. They wanted to keep the house, do some construction to separate living quarters and rent it out so they could pay  for the house. We found out they had to borrow money to pay for the construction and now they want to take equity out of the home to repay the loans and use some of it for a vacation. Here's the nitty gritty:

- They still owe ~$300k on the home

- Their current interest rate is 3.25%

- According to them the house is now worth ~$600k

- They want to take out $30k in equity 

Is this even a good idea to consider since it's only 30k in equity? I feel like they won't get a better rate than the one they currently have so they'll be paying a higher interest for who knows how long just for $30k. We technically can loan them that money but we recently just bought a house ourselves and feel like they are somewhat financially irresponsible and I don't want them to be used to us bailing them out all the time. We do love them and of course want to help them but we also want to make the right financial decision even if a bit of tough love is required. Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance student loans? $8k private at 11% interest and $35k federal at 6.25% interest.,"Currently using the avalanche method to pay down all of my debts, just about finished with credit cards and moving over to student loans. Current plan is to tackle the 11% private loan and then move towards the federal, but wondering if I should refinance all of them if I can get a lower interest rate. 

Credit Karma is showing me refinance options with lendkey interest rates between 2.27% - 5.10%. So a 3ish% interest would be pretty good. 

I am putting about $2200 a month towards paying debt down.

Current plan is to throw it all at credit cards and the private loan, and then switch to a three way split of a savings account, retirement, and fed loan debt.",finance

personalfinance,Help with loan repayment strategy,"Hello /r/personalfinance. I was hoping I could run my loan repayment strategy by this subreddit to see if I am going about this in the most optimal way.

I am starting a 4 year medical residency making $51k in July. Here are all of my federal unsubsidized student loans, the first 2 remain from undergrad. I am about to enter the repayment period so principals include the capitalized interest.

Loan | Interest | Principal
---|---|----
1 | 6.8 | $7,289.35
2 | 6.8 | $9,653.38
3 | 5.41 | $43,006.63
4 | 6.21 | $44,879.42
5 | 5.84 | $39,235.31
6 | 5.31 | $40,584.88
---|---|---
Avg | 6.06 | $185,929.69

My estimated take home pay is $3,652.00, and basic living expenses total ~$1,225/mo.

I was planning on doing the REPAYE payment plan during residency to get a low minimum monthly payment ($280/month) and then start dumping the most money into the highest interest rate loan. (Otherwise, on a 10-year standard repayment plan it's $2,039/month x 10 years which seems hard to do with my current paycheck.)

When I finish residency my income will probably start around $300k with room for upward growth depending on my motivation. At that point I was planning on refinancing with SoFi for a cheaper interest rate and then pay off the loans.

Does this make sense? Is there something I should think about or is there something that I could do better?

Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Young professional sitting on a lump of money,"Hey all, this is my first post here after lurking for a bit and I wanted to see if I could get some of the community's insight into my situation.

I'm 23 with stable employment and have saved up a good portion of my salary by being prudent - i.e., saving money everywhere I can, opting for cheap rent. After 1.5 years of working, I've saved up $17,500, and as of yet, haven't done anything productive with the money.

I currently have $17,300 in student debt with a rate of 3.75%, and I have been putting in a small monthly payment of $136. 

I am almost tempted to pay off all of the loans at once, but with such a low interest rate, it's hardly worth it.

So my question is, how should I manage this money? Should I invest all of it, except a portion for an emergency fund? Should I invest it on my own or go see a financial planner first? 

Would it also be wise to increase my monthly student loan payments?",finance
personalfinance,Goal Advice for 2 Twentysomethings with 235K Debt Left.,"Before anyone gets excited about income, I should preface neither myself nor my fiance are doctors or lawyers.  We both came from lower middle class families and opted to get vastly overpriced bachelor’s degrees (think of the dumb decisions you made at 18 before beating us up).  We left college with 290K in student loan debt.  I’m older than my fiance and I graduated a few years before.


I’ve been making solid progress on my debt, taking it from 114K down to 65K, while building 17.5K in savings (4+ month’s expenses), 3K in my HSA, and 27.5K in 401K.  Fiancé is up to 6K in savings (2 months expenses), but no other investments.  Her debt has gone from 176K down to 172K.  


We don’t live super lavishly, we’re always slow to spend money and rarely make upgrades.  Our one vice is that we do live in a nice apartment that costs 1900/month.  However, downgrading to a worse apartment would sacrifice a bit in gas as the commute would get worse, as well as potentially put us in an unsavory neighborhood.  If we did that it could save us approx. 300 month in rent.  The other vice we have is that we eat pretty clean so we spend a fair amount on food, but the percent of income used on food seems in line with the average American.  

     
I’m making 94K/year (with 3% employer match on 401K) and fiancé makes 54K (plus approx. 200-300/month in side hustles).


90 cellphones


400 groceries


1900 rent


300 utilities


1970 loans


465 cars


95 insurance (hers is paid for by parents)


275 gas


600 discretionary (i.e. birthday gifts for family/friends, new shirt, dog food, unexpected expenses e.g. my running shoes finally kicked it after 5 years this month so I needed new ones)


400 restaurants/To-go/Take out (Trying so hard to whittle this down…)  


 With these current expenses as well as maximizing my HSA for the tax benefit we come out roughly 700/month in leftovers.   We are torn between four options:


-Purchase a small home in an ideal neighborhood that would reduce our monthly living expenses from 1900 down several hundred dollars/month after all considerations (taxes/insurance/pmi/1% aside for repairs).  We would put 5% down which would be about 11K for a small 2 br/2 bath house. 


-Be even more aggressive with debt repayment.  Start tossing all spare cash at the loans and snowball those bastards faster.  


-Build up savings more so we can put more money down on a home in another year or two providing additional rent payment relief in the future. 


-Start investing in ETFs or increase 401K/IRA to diversify and ensure stability in the future.  


Lastly, I want to point out that all of our interest rates on our student loans are pretty favorable despite their size.  The exception is the federal loan fiance has for 19K that is eligible for forgiveness in 8 more years since she works in nonprofit ((how badly we wish her other loans were federal)however, I suppose this could change now with the proposed education changes)).  This loan is 5.49%.  She is currently paying the least amount possible on this specific loan simply to maintain eligibility.  The rest vary between 3.8-4.47%.  Our credit scores are both very high 700s. 
Any insight you can offer is appreciated.

personalfinance,"Living in a weird, glutted area and looking for help re: rent, mortgages, lump sums.","We're living in a rural location with a major university. Both of us are attached to the university and have contracts for the next five years (we are not students). We are having trouble with figuring out our housing/life.

We currently rent a dilapidated cottage for five hundred dollars a month, we pay all utilities. When I say dilapidated I mean it, but we've managed to make it work. However, we feel like we're spending more money on keeping the place habitable than we'd like, especially for a rental property. We're also living in about 300 square feet and it is starting to wear on us- we can't have friends over, only one of us can stand in any ""room"" at a time, etc. 

I started looking around for other properties to rent but the lowest thing I can find is 650, no utilities paid, for a tiny, musty one bedroom apartment in a not great part of town, that wouldn't allow our dog anyway. To get into a not great apartment in an okay part of town, we're looking at 750-800, no utilities paid.  Rental houses are no different, with a small two bedroom house going for about 1200-1500 per month.

We've thought about buying, but I'm not sure its a good idea. The market here never really burst and by all accounts, even at the height of the recession there was no trouble selling houses, which is good to hear.
 Currently our finances are:
Income: 4,000 per month for 9 months of the year, then 3,000ish for 3 months of the year. I also mystery shop and do baby and pet sitting so have random cash coming in as well. 
Debt: 36,000 in federal student loans on deferment, 30,000 student loan at zero percent interest paid at 400/month.
Other expenses: Food-350 per month, medical expenses 100/month, cell phone- 100/month, car and rental insurance- 100 month, Netflix- 15/month, internet- 25/month. We own our car outright (we bought it new and paid it off five years ahead of our loan)

To make this even more complicated, we're getting a 25,000 dollar insurance payment. One of us wants to use this as a downpayment on a house. One of us wants to pay down the federal student loan and save 2,000ish to bulk out the emergency fund, because one of us feels like we'd be stretching to take on a mortgage now. However, we did get approved for up to 350,000 for a mortgage? Which we would never do, when we sort of browse for homes we're looking at 175,000 and under. 

I guess I just don't know what to do. We want to change/improve our living situation, but moving to a different rental is prohibitive and feels like a lateral or even downward move, but buying seems not smart when we have student loans. Pros in favor of buying include the area we're in and that we're here long term.  The lump sum is confusing things as well.

Direction or advice appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Bank is saying I can get a 3.85% interest rate on a mortgage, I am skeptical.","I have an accepted offer on a house with 20% down. I am going between credit unions to get the best overall deal. In research, everything led me to believe a Credit union would most likely offer the best deal.

I randomly was referred to BMO Harris bank by an acquaintance. The guy says they are offering a 3.85% interest rate on a mortgage, as long as my credit score (760ish) and background checks out. Before I started the mortgage process, my credit scores were all over 800. Due to repetitive credit apps and being unfamiliar with the process, these credit pulls have dropped my scores to between 750 and 760ish.

I don't want to waste my time doing another credit app to find they can't beat my current credit union offer of 4.125%, or have a horrible experience if I decide to go with a ""Bank"". 

Is there anyway I can weed out this bank? Or are they most likely just giving me false hope to get me to come in and do the application. What bothers me is the credit unions came off more straightforward, and this bank guy had a lot of hot shot lingo like hes been to those classes were they teach you how to be credible, smooth talking.

personalfinance,Leasing vs Buying a car as a recent college graduate,"I just graduated from college a few weeks ago, and I will be needing a vehicle for the commute to my new job and whatnot.  I would like to purchase sooner rather than later, as my commute is either an hour train ride or 30 minutes in car. 

In college, I managed to save ~$9,000 between working summers and part time during the year. Fortunately, I don't have debt from scholarships.  I will be moving far from home, so I'm projecting about $2,000 in relocation expenses.  I also have no credit history because I've only had a checking/savings account. 

The cars I'm looking at are used Toyota RAV4 or Honda HR-V, with a max budget at $23,000. 

My pros and cons thought list:

BUY- If I buy the car, I'd put $3,000 down to maintain a safety net in my savings. I'm worried I won't get a great interest rate because of my lack of credit. Because I'll be buying a relatively new car, I would plan on driving it for 10+ years. 

LEASE- From what I've seen, there are basically two deals: 0 down with a higher monthly payment or ~$2,000 down and a lower payment. I would be looking at a 2 or 3 year lease. Over the course of the lease, I would build my credit and save for a much larger down payment than I could currently put down. Side note- my commute is 11 miles one way, so I would need to be conscious of 12,000/mi/year cap on the lease, but it likely won't be an issue. 

Which seems like the better option financially? Any advice would be great to hear!

Pretty sure it was under this sub but I have a low success rate using reddit's search function. 

I just got a job for the federal government two years ago and thought my student loans were covered under PSLF but due to that post I decided to double check. 

Sure enough, my repayment plan I was under was not eligible PSLF. I was under a 25 year repayment plan. 

Just got word that my change over to an Income Based Repayment plan (a PSLF eligible plan) after submitting the proper documentation has been accepted!

So I got that taken care of and it even lowered my payment from $320 to $190. The forecasted forgiveness amount will be around $39,000.  

To be elegible for PSLF you have to make 120 payments towards your loans, etc etc etc. any payment I had made before this change took over does not count against the 120 payments....but better to start counting down now than 10 years later figure out my loans weren't elegible.

personalfinance,Will we ever get ahead? Advice needed.,"Hi PF-

I find myself entering my 30's at the end of the year and thrown into some realities from some changes coming in my life. 

I'm getting married in a few days. I am excited, but I want to do the best I can to help plan for our future and have realistic expectations of what we are able to do as a household. 

The Good:

Me, 29, Bachelors working in Insurance field
Salary: $80,000/yr
401K: $43,000 balance, I contribute 10% of my salary with my company matching 6%
Cash: $22,000 in a savings account

Her, 26, Doctorate Allied health field/medicine (just graduated)

Salary: $67,000
401K: $4,200
Cash: $40,000 in savings
Stocks/Bonds: $3,200 (mostly old i bonds)

The Bad:

Me
Student Loan Balance: $18,000 (all between 3.8% and 6.25%)
Car Loan: $6,700 @ 3.2%

Her:
Student Loans: $152,000
20 different loans, undergrad and grad school between 3.4% and 6.8%

My future wife has been working at a non-profit hospital for just under a year. As she was working in a non-profit, she began her loan repayments under IBR (at $0/month) and was pursuing PSLF. However, I am being relocated and we have found that in the field she wants to work, non-profit opportunities are not as vast as we would like. I am finding it difficult to find her a job in her field that is both non-profit and with the patient population she wishes to work with. 

Our plan was to stick out PSLF, and contribute the money that would have gone toward us aggressively paying down her debt into a S&amp;P 500 index fund and hope that at the end of 10 years if for whatever reason the loans aren't discharged we would have at least kept up with the interest rate.  

I am also concerned that with the current administration PSLF may not exist very much longer, making our pursuit mute and all the while burying ourselves in interest. 

My questions:

1.) How fucked are we? I realize we have a pretty enormous amount of debt and not the income to make up for it. Luckily, the fields that we work in are high demand/low layoff but both of us don't have very great earning potential (although I could reasonably expect 6 figures in the next 4 years)

2.) Should I talk to a financial advisor about our debt repayment strategy

3.) Is a house in our future? Even with the amount of debt that we have could it still be smarter to buy if we are moving to a high rent area and can buy something in the $165K - $265K range?

4.) Any insight into PSLF?

5.) Any people who had this much debt and made it work, please let me know how you tackled it

Thanks in advance!

My degree is interdisciplinary but will position me best to work in ecology or archaeology. I doubt I will have the CV necessary for an R-1 faculty position—I haven’t done a good job of bringing in extramural funding, for instance. Aside from pursuing a research post-doc to keep the dream of a plum R-1 position alive, I would be happy in other career paths: teaching faculty at an undergraduate-focused college, researcher at a federal agency, researcher at a conservation NGO, land or heritage manager for a Tribal government, project lead in environmental or natural resource consulting. 

There are pros and cons associated with each of those career paths. I’m not going to get into them here but from my perspective each one is a tradeoff and there is no clear best choice. One priority for me, though, is to create the financial stability to retire at a reasonable age so that I can pursue my passions and not fall into the role of wizened sage taking up space.

So, my questions are for folks who have entered a volatile job market with an advanced degree and had to choose between very different career paths. **What path did you choose? How has it gone? Have you switched paths? What would you do differently? Are you now in a good place, financially speaking?**",finance
personalfinance,College student thinking of new truck,"To make this short, I am 2 years out of college for construction management degree. I am currently working with a very large popular GC that is well known and trusted in this field, but it is just an internship.

I have about 20k in student loans, with COL to graduate including tuition is 40k, about 7k covered in scholarships.

I drive a very old very crappy truck that with a few hundred in repairs could last until I graduated.

I was planning on using money that I work for to pay for housing and things for the semesters in school. I will have to take out more loans no matter what, but I am not too worried as I am in a promising career field.

Now, upon graduation (or sooner) I WILL need a new nicer truck. Yes it has to be a truck and has to be nice and newer due to a lot of traveling.

Now, I can wait until I graduate, and take out an auto loan for 8-9% interest, due to my lack of credit history. Doing this, I would not only be bombarded with a new truck payment + insurance ( I don't pay now but will when I graduate ) and I will also have to start repaying student loans.

Or I could take out extra student loans now, at a lower interest rate. Use my money from working to save and pay for a truck payment, with some down money put on it and start paying the truck off now, that way it is halfway paid off when I graduate and I saved insurance money. And take out extra student loans for ""housing""

This is just a random idea that popped into my head, I'm not sure if it is just terrible? It makes some sense in my head, but that's because I want something newer sooner of course.

The way I see it, if I can make the truck payments now, why not? Technically I would be saving money with the lower student loan interest rate compared to an auto loan?

I would still have to get an auto loan now, but the interest rate would be lower with the money I can put down instead of saving it for housing payments?

I basically just need people to tell me why it's a bad idea, even though in the long run I would be spending the same amount either way, just have more debt now, but less as soon as I graduate? If this makes any sense.",finance
personalfinance,Would it be unsmart or unsafe to publicly share how much I take on in student loans?,"Hi there! Really excited as an 18 y/o to start my financial future now instead of later and this is a great place to help start me off, I think. :)

That being said, I use my social media for a mixture of positive things in my life and being honest about things that I consider important to share. As someone with a lot of friends younger than me, and people out of touch with the cost of college, when I do take on a federal loan this spring to pay for state university tuition, I'd kind of like to write and share about this process on my Facebook and how much I've taken out.

Would this be an unsmart move to put publicly on social media? Whether for safety in some vein (sharing how much debt I'm putting myself in) or the possibility of future employers knowing this information?

This maximum rent that can be charged is calculated at 30% of the 60% of median monthly household income less a utility allowance which is determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

**VIEWPOINT:**

Preserving and developing Germany's nuclear expertise

Despite Germany choosing to phase out its use of nuclear energy, the country must not lose its nuclear expertise, research and industry, writes Ralf Güldner.

Nuclear expertise is important for research, for industry but above all for the state itself. Many people may simply not be aware of this.

The topic of preserving and building up nuclear expertise by shifting operational responsibility to federally-owned companies will gain relevance particularly in the waste management sector. Taking into account all the authorities and public companies that operate in this sector, we could soon be talking about up to 4000 employees. Together with the civil servants and government employees in other areas of nuclear technology, in expert appraisal and in research, it may be assumed that in the future at least a sixth of the more than 30,000 employees in the industry will be assigned to the public sector.

personalfinance,My family just sold a business,"Basically I'm about to receive an offer for $100k, and it would change my life. My dad is receiving money from a business sold that is under a family trust, the total beinng roughly $200k. He wants to split it with me. I would love to hear what reddit has to say.

I don't know what is relevant, but I figured I'd include as much as I can since the common mistake is not enough info. First time poster, occasional lurker.

Backstory: My grandparents(both dead) had 5 kids. A business and a house. The sale of the house was a nightmare(drama) when my grandma died. The business was leased for 5 years as agreed upon by the lessee and my grandparents, the money made by the business was split 5 ways and divvied up quarterly. The term of the lease ran out, the executor of the estate didn't have his affairs in order when he died. Lots of legal stuff I am ignorant about happened in this time. And now the car wash has been sold. I assume for ~$1mil. I have no numbers and my dad doesn't either. So there is money in the trust leftover from the lease payout, and the money from the business.

My dad:
He has late stage AIDS, more debts and bills than you can shake a stick at and filed for bankruptcy in the past. He receives social security and medicaid.

He won't move back here. I won't move out there.

I don't know if I should take half the money, or try to have him give up his ownership in the trust to me, or if I should just walk away from it all. I support taxes.

This money would change my life, but I've only had 72 hours to process the information and all I can think of is ""PROTECT YOURSELF."" I don't think I'm greedy, and my priorities are 1) My dad 2) College 3)Small amount of adventure gear 4) House. But I'm willing to walk away from all of it to protect my future.

I am 99% sure my dad owes the IRS. I am 100% sure he owes thousands to one of those 25% interest rate loan places. I'm 98% sure he has arrest warrants out for himself in several states. He also wants to keep receiving his Social security, without which he would surely starve.

I started a contract about a year and a half ago with Protect America. Protect America is a company that issued a security system for personal homes and businesses.

I purchased the system being told if I bought the equipment that I would not have a contract and just month to month, this was stated over the phone. 600$ later I bought the equipment and set it up in my home. Today I contacted the company on an attempt to cancel my 65$/month security subscription and they told me that the contract I agreed to was a 36 month term. Which I stated the operator said there's no term for purchased equipment. The operator stated that's not true and I must've miss understood.

I have a few questions for a situation I am in. I am currently in debt because of school. I have school loans that are currently being deferred until October. These are not the issue, but I believe it will be when October rolls around. Therefore I want to get a step up on them. This issue right now is that I have 3900$ in debt with Chase cc at 24% interest and 3100$ in debt with Wells Fargo cc at 18.5%.

I was at Wells Fargo recently talking to one of the bankers and he mentioned a personal line of credit that could consolidate all my other CC's and have an interest rate around 8% potentially. Is this a wise decision? It feel likes I would have less payments and less interest accrued in the end. 

I'm skeptical as it's Wells Fargo. Any advice would be great as I'm planning lots of financial expenses coming up soon as I leave for language school. I would like to be able to live with less stress while abroad. 

Also is it possible to defer student loans for a language school or does it have to be home country schools?

Just as the title states, wanting some guidance/advice on where I should go from my position:

-Roughly 50k/yr salary.
-30k in student loans (Fed Loans, I believe)
-4k in CC debt 

-Planning on going back to school Spring '19 for an accelerated BSN program that's roughly 30k tuition and probably pursue a Masters a few years after.

-Also thinking of getting another car as my current is a clunker, probably a pre-cert around 15k I guess?

personalfinance,Help me compare offers from lenders? Buying a house.,"So I've been speaking with different lenders trying to get the best deal. There's a few different offers for the home loan but I'm having trouble identifying what the best choice is. 

Offer 1: 5% down-payment assistance, $3600 closing cost. 5.3% interest rate. Standard lender.

Offer 2: 4% down-payment assistance, $3900 closing cost, no points on the loan, 4.375% interest rate. Credit union.

Offer 2: 3% down-payment assistance, no quote on total closing cost, 4.2% interest rate. This one is quicken/rocket mortgage.

My up front is higher obviously with less down-payment assistance. Assistance is provided through the state for first time buyers so those rates are what you get locked into through the program. The first lender in particular was aggressive in saying I could refinance within the first year and then viola I saved 8k up front in comparison to Quicken. 

But I don't think you can really bank on being able to just refinance to a lower rate, right?

So does it make sense to take a lower interest rate up front and come out of pocket a little more with no points? If the total monthly payment is that much lower assuming a 200k house, do I end up getting back the extra up front cost over the first two years or so anyway?

I keep sending a fee sheet from Lender 1 to other people to see if they can do anything better for me before I put an offer in on something. Is that the right move?

personalfinance,Can you pay off a personal line of credit with a balance transfer card?,"Hey Loves, so I was trying to do research on this, and couldn't seem to get a straight answer.  Just to preface, My boyfriend and I have been together long term, and he admittedly is horrible at finances.  He gives me a wad of cash every week to pay our bills, put money into savings etc. One of the bills I pay from this is his credit line.  

The credit line wasn't the smartest of financial decisions, but at the time it was needed.  We needed a quick $5,000.00 to replace his truck that went caput, and I figured although we'd pay a high interest rate, it could be paid off in 3 years like a car payment.  

Right now he has about $4,000.00 left on the loan, math doesn't add up right?  At first I was letting him pay it monthly himself, until I realized he was only paying the minimum (which would take 21 years...) so I started including it in our regular bills.  This is when I realized he was also pulling $20.00 here, $20.00 there when he needed it, and really didn't understand what he was getting himself in to.  I sat him down, explained what he was doing, how it would hurt us, and I just take care of sending the check every month now.  

I just really want to pay this truck off, and I would rather do it from monthly income rather than savings.  

One way I thought might be good, is to get a balance transfer credit card.  There are a lot where there is 0% APR for 9-21 months, and since he refuses to touch a credit card, since he doesn't trust himself, I thought we could just pay off the truck and stick it in a drawer. (He actually has a credit card from this same bank because they somehow convinced him he was making a payment on his truck and he signed up for a credit card, so I'm serious about the ""it will get stuck in a drawer"" bit, he has never used it) 

He has a credit score of about 725, so I'd say his approval odds are good, but I can't seem to figure out if, since this is a personal line of credit and not technically a ""credit card"" if we would be able to transfer this balance.  I throw about $250.00 at the loan monthly now, but I can throw more at it, I would just rather not throw that money at interest.  

Any help (or additional ideas) would be appreciated, thank you!

Edit: to clear up confusion, we would be getting a new credit card, solely for balance transfer, different institution.  We would not be using the card he accidently signed up for.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Order matters attention mechanisms,"Hi guys,

Recently I read the paper [Order Matters: Sequence to sequence for sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06391.pdf) by Oriol Vinyals, Samy Bengio and Manjunath Kudlur. 

I am trying to understand how the process block works. As it says, it is trying to obtain an embedding which is permutation invariant to the inputs. To obtain this, we have to use the attention mechanism proposed in equations (3)-(7). I understand the idea of this attention mechanism. For the computed memories in the reading block (m_i) it is deciding which information should be read (a_it) using q_t (hidden state of the LSTM?). Then this information is read into r_t and concatenated with q_t.

The step that I am not able to understand is equation (3). It states that it is an LSTM without inputs or outputs, therefore, we only have the context and the hidden state. Firstly, I thought q*_t would be fed as the hidden state, but it has a different size since it is a concatenation between r_t and the previous hidden state. If someone is familiar with this approach, it would be nice if he can give me a glimpse how this block works.

On 28May2017 I then made my regularly scheduled monthly payment of $50.47 to this loan. The interest rate is 5.25%. I looked at the account today and the principal is now $389.92, a whole $10.08 lower than the original $400. Why isn’t the principal lower and what happened to the other $40.39?

Our debt is 23k (this includes car loan, capital one credit card and a jet blue credit card)
Emergency Fund $1,000

I also qualify for a 100% finance loan at the same rate as the mortgage to cover 3.5% downpayment and closing costs. 

We also have another source of ""under the table"" income that we can bring an extra $500 a week approximately to help out with expenses if needed.

personalfinance,Saving isn't always good,"The people on this sub will go through hell to save money for retirement and decrease their debt. However, I'm not sure this is *always* the best move.

For instance, I continually see people on this sub being praised for being debt-free, but it is rarely explained that paying down low-interest federal student loan debt is almost always a way to *lose money*. This is discussed in the wiki, but people seem to ignore it when they congratulate OPs for paying off their student loans when they should be telling them to do the opposite. 

A second more nuanced idea - that I almost never see mentioned on this sub - is the idea of marginal returns to your dollar. Most people get less and less utility (happiness) from each dollar they have. This basically means that busting your ass to save $10 from your $40K salary is not necessarily worth the $30 you'll have in retirement when your income is $100K. 

Basically, if you expect your salary to increase faster than the rate your investment would grow (e.g. you are in an industry that gives lots of promotions and raises such as financial services, marketing, etc. etc.), it might make sense to *not save money*. Simply put, $1 means more to present you than it does to future you - even when you factor in the compounding you would get from investing it. For example, being able to afford a nice dinner date today might create more happiness for you than a nice dinner when you're 65 yrs old and eating fancy dinners every night.

What I'm trying to say is that this sub needs to be less dogmatic about save, save, save. When people ask about their personal savings, it makes more sense to weigh the different investments available and what the person expects their future outcome to look like.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing,"Just a simple question looking for a quick answer. I've spent the past 3.5 years since graduating college living at home with my parents to get a handle on my student loans while I progressively moved up the career ladder and the payments got easier. 

I'm at a point where I am ready to start moving forward and making life decisions, but I wanted to know if anyone thought it would be a good idea to refinance my private student loans. I've already refinanced once; the loans were $80K at 6.75% for 15 years after refinancing. I've always taken my remaining monthly cash on hand and  paid extra towards my loans so I could get rid of them as quick as possible. This is something I still plan to do until they are paid off.

Currently I would be refinancing about $45K. I was thinking about refinancing at another 15 year term and lower interest rate. My credit is significantly higher than it was the first time, and I just took a job at a new company a month ago that came with a promotion and a 35% raise. I figured refinancing would lower my rate hence save me money, but I would also have a lower monthly payment to increase my discretionary income. 

The purpose of the increased discretionary income would be to have more cash on hand just in case of an emergency while I move forward taking on more bills. I would also continue to pay as much free cash per month as possible towards these loans on top of my minimum payment, like I have been all along.

I have since switched positions in the company and only commute 2 miles to work and rarely have to go any farther than 30 miles outside of my region. I'm thinking of downgrading my truck to something simpler and cheaper. I owe $13,000 on my truck and it's worth about $23,000.

I know the answer seems fairly easy on this one but my concerns are that I've put about $2,000 into my truck in maintenance and tires these past few months and I feel like I'm throwing away that money in selling it.

Banking,[QUESTION] Can someone please explain the legality of overdraft fees?,"I've been a loyal member of a credit union for almost 40 years now. Until today, they have been a great credit union. Here's what happened: I have an AutoPay of $45 set up on my account to pay my work vanpool the first of the month. For whatever reason, it paid today. I had a pending charge of $0.99 that was held for some reason on 5/29/17, and then magically, everything pays out today, for a total of $45.99.

I put the majority of my paycheck into a shared account that pays for our house, car, bills, etc., and keep very little in my personal account. Between my personal checking and savings accounts, I had a total of $45.92; meaning that when the bank processed the pending transactions, I was short $0.07.

I called the bank, spoke to a few people, including a manager, pointed out that I've been a member for a long time, have ample money in at least 4 other linked accounts, and do not have a history of this sort of activity. I was met with policy and $48 worth of fees ($24 for $45 payment and $24 for a $0.99 payment). Remember that $0.99 payment that was held on 5/29/17? I wouldn't have been charged a fee if it wasn't held; I also wouldn't have been charged if they had just processed it first, but they didn't. I also informed the manager that I had checked my account last night and there wasn't a $45 payment pending, otherwise, I would have moved funds into that account. I presented all of this info to the manager who stuck with the policy. I even offered to compromise and pay the fee associated with the $45 payment, as I legitimately did not have the money in my account. Nope. Nothing.

Doing some research, I found that there was a policy enacted by the Federal Reserve Bank in 2010 that made it illegal for banking institutions to auto-enroll new accounts into their overdraft protection program. This was enacted due to the extraordinary amount of overdraft fees that banks were charging to their customers. In August 2010, banks were supposed to ask existing account holders if they wanted to continue to participate in the program. I was enrolled in 1996, and was never sent any correspondence or given an option to opt-out of the program.

Can someone please tell me if I have any legal recourse in this situation? Will the absence of an opt-out save me from these fees (I have a record of the chat conversation where a rep informs me that I have not been asked if I would like to un-enroll from autodraft protection)? Is there something else that I should be doing (other than not keeping enough money in my account)?

personalfinance,Paying Student Loans off ASAP or Setting Aside Money for Investments,"I'm a recent college grad with $48,000 in student loan debt who's set to make a base salary of $55,000, plus a $16,000 signing bonus, and a $5,000 relocation bonus. Currently, I'm struggling with the decision of staying at home or finding an apartment closer to work, which is about a 45 minute commute. Ideally, I'd stay at home, but my work schedule is four 12 hour shifts a week. Furthermore, I'm going to be expected to work close to 70-80 hours a week during peak season. In my ideal scenario, I'd stay at home and put a good amount of money towards investments and student loans, but as I think about my work situation more I realize that I may get burnt out very quickly between my hours and commute and it would be best to find an apartment close to work. The difficult part in realizing this is that rent in central NJ is about $1000-$1400 for a single or studio, which would eat in heavily to my budget. Although, with a roommate I can get rent down to the $700-$900 range.


Sorry for all the background information, but I guess my main questions are is it a dumb financial decision to get my own place? Furthermore, regardless of living situation how should I allocate my funds towards my student loan payments and investments? Should I pay off my student loans ASAP and worry about investing later? Should I put the bulk of my extra money towards student loans with a minimum for retirement, or vice versa?


Thanks for anyone who's willing to help!

Edit:

I figure it'd be helpful to give a rough picture of my mandatory monthly expenses:

Mobile Phone: $35

Car Payment: $391 

Gas: ~$120 (If I commute from home)

Tolls: $52 (If I commute from home)

Car Insurance: $75

Health Insurance: $25 (I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but this is in the form of an HSA)

Dental Insurance: $7

Vision Insurance: $2

Student Loan: $500 (Minimum) - Grace Period ends February 2018

Total: $1,035 (Note: This doesn't include Tolls/Gas)

-Some Background about the Student Loans:
I have 8 Federal Student Loans ranging from 3.86% to 4.66% interest and one federal student loan from my school at 5% interest. 

-Some Background about investment opportunities:

I have listened to these guys starting back in mid 2015 right before the market dipped a little bit in september and october of that year. I still don't know enough about the market to really fully comprehend if what they are talking about is right on the money or BS. Each week it seems the situation gets more and more dire with the sky is falling messages. Mannarino is especially bad at that with clickbait titles on his YouTube vids. They seem one in the person and that is why I lumped them together.

financialindependence,Need advice for reinvesting significant amount of stocks and stock options,"Hello,
 
I recently stumbled upon the FI/RE community and have been gobbling up many of the articles and advice in this forum and other blogs. I'm looking to solicit some advice specifically for my situation, and thus I'm using a throwaway in order to disclose some numbers.

**TL;DR: our household currently has a significant percentage of our net worth invested in a few individual companies in the form of stock options and stocks:
(1) What strategies can/should we employ to minimize the tax impact of divesting parts of these holdings
(2) How should we reallocate the proceeds of said divesture into other investment vehicles in a safe and diversified manner?**

Some details:

* Married, both in our early 30s
* Total net worth in the mid seven figures: $N,000,000
* Non-qualified stock options (fully vested) in company A in the low seven figures (~40% of net worth)
* Restricted stock units (all held &gt; 1 year) in company B in the mid six figures (~10% of net worth)
* Stock from employee stock purchase plan (all held &gt; 1 year) in company C in the low six figures (~5% of net worth)
* Rest of portfolio spread across broad index funds and a comfortable amount of cash
* Live in VHCOL area, only a couple years into a standard 30 year mortgage at 3.5%
* Monthly expenses around $10k (includes mortgage and property taxes)
* All available retirement accounts are maxed yearly

I'm not specifically targeting FI/RE at the moment, but would like to utilize some of the concepts in order to plan our strategy.

First, it's pretty obvious that we should be getting rid of our holdings in companies A, B, and C, given the significant portion of our net worth that is in those companies. However, companies A and B have had stellar performance over the last several years and continue to improve and maintain great prospects. I also happen to be still employed at company A, so that's even more risk exposure. However, I know that there's a good to great chance that the company will do even better in the future. Am I greedy to want to hold on longer?

The risk averse side of me knows that we need to diversify, but I would like to do so in a slow, controlled way by perhaps selling a percentage on a yearly basis, and to do it in a tax efficient way. Since the holdings in company A are non-qualified stock options and are taxed as income upon exercise, the only strategy I have for this is to sell more during years in which we have less income (perhaps due to time off) or more deductible expenses, but I don't foresee many of those opportunities unless we switch jobs and take significant time off. Another caveat is that batches of the stock options for company A will start to expire in a few years, so there's a finite window on the horizon. Are there other strategies or tax efficient vehicles I'm missing here?

The second part is how to take the proceeds and reinvest in a smart manner. I think broad index funds spread across domestic, emerging, and developed markets is my no-brainer default choice, and I've also started looking into choosing certain bond funds to get more bonds in the mix. Our biggest bond holding is VWAHX which gets us federal-exempt yield, and I just started looking into a state-specific muni bond fund which would get us federal and state exempt yields. However, the lack of geographic diversification worries me there, so I might opt to go for both continuing VWAHX and adding a state specific muni fund. I've started looking into other passive income options such as real estate investing, but the required effort is high and my experience is low to nil. Are there other strategies I should be considering?

Thirdly, since we're likely to get large chunks of cash at a time from selling the aforementioned holdings, is it wise to invest those chunks directly into various broad index funds in bulk, or to spread it out over time and dollar cost average? If we dollar cost average, we'd end up with large chunks of cash earning near zero interest, which doesn't seem ideal either. How should we deal with that?

Thanks for any thoughts or ideas you may have. Happy to provide more details if needed. I'm also probably going to post this in the /r/personalfinance at some point to get more advice, but I thought I'd start here since the FI/RE philosophy is in general quite in line with our approach.",finance

personalfinance,"Is it better to ""snowball"" student loans (paying off one at a time, rolling payoff savings in to the next loans) or to refinance and pay extra?","I've got a moderate amount of student loan debt spread across 9 loans and I'm buckling down and making extra payments.  My goal right now is to eliminate the smallest loans first, regardless of interest rate, simply to reduce my monthly minimum (currently around $900/mo).  

The issue I'm having is that my interest rates are so extremely varied...it's up to 12.5% on some of my private loans, but less than half that for my government loans.  

My initial thought is that I can pay off loans individually and reduce my (rather high) monthly minimum (currently making quadruple payments for the smallest govt. loan), but I'm wondering if the interest I'm accruing by just paying minimums on the larger, higher-interest loans makes things worth it.

I've done some reading online and things seemed pretty conclusive with ""refinance"", but I don't really like that idea because I won't notice the progress I'm making for several years to come.

Is this question properly worded for you guys?  Do you understand where I'm coming from here?  If so, any advice?",finance
personalfinance,"I think my local housing market is going to bust sooner than later, thinking about selling my home and banking the equity, thoughts?","I live in the Colorado and the housing market is insane. ""Experts"" predict that the bubble's going to bust soon and I hate to lose the $100,000+ in equity I've accumulated in just over 3 years. I know you can't time the market, but even to the layperson it's obvious that these prices aren't sustainable for much longer. As far as my house goes, my interest rate is locked at 3.5% and I can easily afford my mortgage. This is ""less"" house than what most people with my income have but it's more than enough for what we need as a dual-income household with no children. We like it here but it's just brick and wood; we're not attached.

Coincidentally, my father in law is building a house on a piece of property about an hour away. I'm thinking about selling my house, paying off my student loans, banking what's left of my equity, and living in a trailer (which I'd have to buy) on my FIL's property until the market becomes more favorable for buyers and/or buying land and building a house. This could happen next year or in 5 years, who knows, but with paying off my student loan debt and not having a mortgage, I'll save upwards of $2000 per month and have an additional $50,000 in the bank. 

On a side note, I couldn't commute to my current work from my FIL's property; it's just too far. I earn six-figures but I hate my job. I can find work near my FIL's property and I'd still earn a good living, but I'd likely take a significant pay cut (&gt;30%). My significant other works remotely so it doesn't matter where she lives.

personalfinance,How much student loans should I take now? (x-post r/student loans),"Background: I am a medical student and I was offered ~35k in loans for my first year at 5.3% interest. Fortunately, I had enough saved up that I didn't need take the loans. This year, I will need loans since I have used up my savings. I will probably get another ~35k in loans but the interest this year is higher (6%).

Question: I have a week to decide if I would like to take my loans from last year (at 5.3%) before they are lost to me. Obviously, taking 5.3% loans is better than taking 6% loans. My question is how much of it should I take - I anticipate spending about 20-25k/year (tuition, living, etc) so if I take 35k it could last me 1.5-2 years. Should I take just enough for the upcoming year or all of it? Any loans I take out start accruing interest immediately so I want to be conservative but if interest rates keep going up it might be better to have all of it.

I've tried various online calculators to determine what would be the best option and I'm leaning towards taking enough just for the next year but I just want to see if anyone has any insights I might be missing. I just finished my first year of medical school and I don't really have any idea what specialty and where I will be geographically so I can't really say how long it will take me to pay the loans off (if that makes a difference). Once I finish residency I will try to pay them off ASAP. I anticipate being ~90-100k in debt after I graduate.",finance
personalfinance,Where should I put this $60k that I plan on using at some point in the next year?,"Sorry for the throwaway, I don't really want all this info about my savings in my main account's history. Hope this is okay!

Anyway, I recently sold a decent chunk of equity from a previous company I worked at, to the tune of $58k. I plan on holding onto this to use as a down payment for a house within a year or less, so I don't _think_ I want to invest it (seems too risky?) and I can't do a CD (not enough time). I'm thinking an Ally savings account at 1.05% is probably my best bet, right?

I have another chunk of equity from my current job that I'll be selling within the next month or so to pay off a student loan that's currently got a 6.8% interest rate (waiting 'til next month as that's my last payment on the payment plan to get it out of default and I want to be out of default prior to paying it off... right?). I then have an additional student loan ($9k) with a 4% interest rate that I figured I'd pay off in January when I get my next chunk of equity (assuming the stock price stays about where it is now).

Realistically, I'm looking at houses/condos in the $375k-425k range, and would probably be putting 10% down, so I wouldn't _need_ more than $43k for my down payment (out of the $58k I'm reserving for my home buying). Should I pay off the $9k loan out of the $58k now, rather than waiting the year? Realistically, that would be a 4% return rather than the 1.05% Ally would give me, but I don't want to leave myself too strapped if I buy a home within the next 6 months if I need it for closing costs or immediate repairs/upgrades.

Thanks in advance!",finance
