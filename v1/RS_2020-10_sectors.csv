personalfinance,How to juggle 2 different Credit Cards without sinking myself.,"Hey all!  


I have hit a weird road.  
I'm in my 30s now and have had credit cards before, got my first CapOne back in 2006 and it did wonders! I had a 727FICO at age 21, and I effed that up. Then I got a crappy secured card in 2015....and screwed that up. My credit is now BLAH (low 600s), but I've been trying to fix that.  


  
Back in Jan I applied and got approved for Discover Secured IT with a $300 limit. Well, a few weeks ago I got a letter from a craptastic card about being preapproved and looking at the offer it was pure dog poo! Later that night I went to my credit union's site (NFCU) and applied for an AmEx card and got approved for a $4,700 limit!  


Fast forward to this week, Discover is upping my limit to $750 and moving it to unsecured.  


How can I manage both these cards without sinking myself? My AMEX has better rewards than Discover does. I don't want to carry a balance on either card, but I also don't want to pay a min payment on a card that I haven't used.   


I've also thought about making a big purchase on Discover and carry the balance for a few months (I know I'll be paying interest on said item)  


Anyone have advice, TBH I'm kinda scared with this now large amount of available credit.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will extend its ban on share buybacks at the largest U.S. banks, although banks will still be allowed to pay out dividends.

The Fed’s announcement Wednesday extends the buyback ban and maintains the cap on dividend payments into the fourth quarter of this year.

The decision to extend the share buyback and dividend limitations through the fourth quarter was agreed to by four of the five members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Lael Brainard, who also dissented against the action in June, dissented against the decision Wednesday.",finance

personalfinance,[US - MO] Parent is purchasing a new car and gifting me their old one. What should I do for taxes?,"My parent is purchasing a new car after the first of the year. We have agreed that they would transfer their old car to me, and in exchange I would give them my old car to use for trade-in on their new one. KBB puts the value of their old car around $17,500 and the value of my car less than $1,000. Both cars are paid off, or at least will be when the sale happens.

I have heard that it is possible for them to ""sell"" the car to me for $1.00, or some other low amount, in order to lower the amount of sales tax that would have to be paid. But this feels shady. Is this OK to do?

As I understand it, ""gifting"" the car is off the table since, while there is no gift tax for the state of Missouri, there is still a *federal* gift tax that the gifter would have to pay on any gifts over $15,000, which this car certainly is. If this is the case, I have not been able to find the exact percentage of tax owed, everything I have read places it somewhere between 15% to 40% of the value of the gift.

Which path would be the most legally correct and financially cheapest to take? Or is there another option that I am overlooking?",finance
investing,Why I'm Bullish on Lumen Technologies(formerly Centurylink),"On the surface, LUMN technologies looks appealing, with a 10% dividend yield and a P/E ratio of 9.

Of course, investors should always be careful when chasing yield. There's no guarantee a dividend won't get cut, so it's important to do research to ensure the company is in a position to maintain its dividend in the future.

If you take a look at the history of CenturyLink/Lumen, it doesn't look too pretty. Their shares are down 75% over the past 5 years, and the dividend has been cut twice. So if you had bought LUMN in 2014 and sold today, you would have significantly underperformed the market. 

These figures can be concerning, so I did a bit more research.

The most recent dividend cut was not because the company could not afford the dividend, but because they felt their earnings are better used de-leveraging than paying a higher dividend.  And I generally agree with this- deleveraging not only decreases risk, but can also can land the company more favorable interest rates on bonds, allowing for greater returns in the future. Another thing to consider is this cut happened at the very peak of the interest rate cycle when the federal funds rate peaked at 2.5% in early 2019. So the attitude at the time may have been a concern that interest rates would continue to rise, which was a risk the company had to address before interest expenses got out of control.

With the federal reserve committing to low interest rates for 3 years(and possibly longer if unemployment remains high and inflation low), this puts Lumen in a better position to restructure their debt that matures over the next 5 years at a more favorable interest rate, reducing interest expense. It also reduces the likelihood of a dividend cut fueled by debt concerns.


In my opinion, the company is in a position to continue paying their dividend. It's only about 33% of free cash flow.

Overall, I think LUMN technologies is a good buy and hold stock. Even with the pandemic, businesses still need access to internet/voip, and they're pretty well diversified with many acquisitions they've made in the past. I don't view them as risky as other high dividend stocks like Exxon Mobil that literally depend on oil prices to recover or REITs that risk losses from vacancies or non paying tenants.

I'm not expecting explosive growth at the same level as companies like Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft have seen, but I'm expecting the company to remain stable and continue to provide solid income.

personalfinance,Rent out my current home or sell it and invest the profits in the stock market?,"Hi all, 

My wife and I currently live in Tucson, AZ but I have accepted a job in Sunnyvale, CA and will be relocating in the next few months. I'm an engineer and make decent money. The only debt we have is the mortgage on our home in AZ and about 40k in student loans at a 4% interest rate (Cars, Credit Cards, Other Loans all paid off). We will be renting in CA. We don't plan on staying on CA long term, more short term (about 3-4 years). 

We have talked to a real estate agent and have gone through the numbers of selling the home in AZ, and we would make between 40k - 60k depending on what the home sells for in the next couple of months. The market in Tucson has been really great this year. We bought the property last year for 254k and now it's appraising around 305k.

We've talked to a rental management company and they said we would be able to rent our home for around 1800 - 1900/month. They would take out 10%. Our escrow payment (mortgage, insurance, taxes) is 1320 a month. So all together we need 1500 - 1510/month. Our cash flow should be between 300 - 390/month which is not much, but over time it will increase and the house (hopefully) will appreciate, as well as the tenants paying the home loan down. 

Simply put, should we:

1) Sell home, make 40k - 60k, then invest in the stock market?   

2) Sell home, make 40k - 60k, then pay off 40k of student loans at 4% interest rate?

3) Keep home, rent it out, cash flow 300-390/month, let tenants pay down loan, and let home appreciate?

investing,"$AMZN - Jefferies gets ""logistics expert"" to analyze Amazon's fulfillment network","""We hosted a conf call with a supply chain / logistics expert to discuss the current state of AMZN's fulfillment network. Key takes: 1) Increased customer demand is causing AMZN to expand capacity at an unprecedented pace, 2) Expanded same-day delivery could be just 12 months away, 3) AMZN is taking over delivery for legacy carriers, 4) Recent moves in grocery suggest AMZN is shifting to a self-distribution model, with potential to drive margins higher.""

""**AMZN is expanding fulfillment capacity at unprecedented pace**, adding 2.25M sq ft per week, or the equivalent of \~40 football fields. AMZN's footprint has grown by \~53M sq ft (+33%) in the U.S. alone between March through September, and our expert believes could reach an additional 117M sq ft by the end of 2020. Our expert estimates another 36M of sq ft is already planned for 2021, but could end up being significantly more. To put this level of expansion in perspective, WMT operates just over 140M sq ft of DC space in the U.S., which took \~50 years to build. Interestingly, a large portion of this new capacity was already planned prior to the pandemic.""

""**Expanded same-day delivery could be just 12 months away**: Our expert believes that AMZN is building out same-day capabilities by morphing its traditional delivery stations into hybrid facilities (opening up to 700K sq ft facilities vs traditional 100-150K sq ft) that can handle the dual function of being a delivery station and fulfillment center. The strategy helps bypass sortation centers, cutting down on time and costs, with an initial focus on fast-moving consumer goods (top 30-40K SKUs) within the top 50 metro areas. Currently, AMZN operates 336 delivery stations, which are expected to grow to \~430 by year-end and to 1,000-1,500 over time, enabling AMZN to eventually reach 85% of the U.S. population. Our expert believes these capacity additions may position AMZN to announce expanded same-day delivery offerings within the next 12 months.""

""**AMZN is disintermediating third-party carriers**: Our expert estimates Amazon Logistics will handle 5B+ packages in the U.S. during 2020 (or 67% of total), double the \~2.5B packages handled last year (or 50% of total). For comparison, our expert estimates UPS and FedEx will handle 5.3B/3.1B packages in the U.S. during 2020. As AMZN builds more delivery stations and moves closer to 85% coverage, a diminishing portion of volume will go through third-party carriers. Once AMZN's network reaches full scale, our expert believes UPS will be primarily handling “out-of-region customers” (where AMZN does not have any facilities) and USPS will be handling low-density parts of the country.""

""**AMZN is making initial moves toward self-distribution in grocery retail**: In an industry characterized by economies of scale, AMZN is taking initial steps to compete more effectively against the leaders in grocery by becoming a more efficient and profitable operator. AMZN recently leased a 1.1M sq ft grocery distribution center in Orlando, Florida. Eventually, our expert envisions AMZN building a nationwide network of 10-12 dedicated retail grocery distribution centers, which would involve a capital investment of $1.5-2.0B over the next 5 years.""",finance

personalfinance,Need Advice (28) Three Month Hourly Contract ahead of full-time offer through a recruiter who found me on LinkedIn.,"Hello Everyone, to provide a little context, I recently completed a part-time master's degree in December 2019 and have been working full time for the last three years as a management consultant for the federal government. I decided that there are limited opportunities for professional and financial growth at my current job and have been fielding interviews by networking and sending applications out.

I'm getting responses and feeling like a hot commodity, but here is where I need some advice. A recruiter reached out to me with a role that requires 5+ years of experience in data analytics, financial analysis, and data cleansing. It is for a large management consulting company that wants to take mass amounts of old excel data and organize it into a SharePoint Database to then create live dashboards and reporting solutions.

Being a Finance professional with 7 years of experience and 3 of those years getting sophisticated with excel and coding tools, I feel like I could do the job with a little bit of growing pains and research. Talking to the recruiter, I made a mistake of saying that I would only move for 15% over my current salary and telling him I would only consider an offer over 95-98k. I currently make about 78k. I quickly recognized that the upfront data cleaning will be a huge effort and told the recruiter that I'd consider the opportunity for 120k. The terms of the opportunity is that I would be hired on an hourly rate, without benefits with the intention of being hired full-time at the end of the three months if things go well. My annual salary would be negotiated before I start and created as a part of my initial contract.

I'm a little spooked at not having insurance. The recruiter offered that his company has a three month insurance program through it, that I can sign onto but he doesn't recommend it. I'm a bit intimidated by what seems like a risky situation since I currently have a full-time job with plenty of free time to keep job searching and building my skills. I am confident I can perform the responsibilities of the job but I'm really curious is anyone sees any red flags here.

Does anyone have any experience with recruitment companies and short-term employment contracts? I suspect that I am also asking for too little money and that I should be calculating an hourly rate that should also include the lack of work benefits and insurance for the three months as well as the additional risk of possibly not being hired full-time at the end of the contract.

Am I missing anything? Could really use a second opinion. Editing to end with a question.

**EDIT** I will likely express that I am not interested in an hourly rate as bikethenhike suggested. I will add at the end of my email that I would otherwise consider an annual rate that is higher than I would expect for this role as well as a 1.5X-2X hourly rate in the three months I would be in limbo.",finance

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

I have a somewhat complicated situation that I need to figure out before I can make a major life changing decision and I was hoping someone on here might be able to offer insight.

Last year I made the decision to leave my federal job to move out of state to be closer to family and also to try out a new career. I have determined that this was a mistake and have been offered the opportunity to regain my federal employment and move back. I'd need to temporarily rent a room or stay with my dad until my wife and kids could rejoin me at the end of the school year.

The biggest issue right now is that I purchased a home at the very beginning of the year. I'm not sure how moving to a temporary situation like the one I described would impact how the government views my residency for the purpose of capital gains taxes. I know that I will be subject to significantly lower capital gains taxes if I can at least show this is my primary residence for a full calendar year. (at the moment the market has increased substantially from when I purchased at the beginning of the year).

Would moving to this temporary living arrangement cause issues with hitting that year mark? I would not have any sort of documented rent or bills at the temporary residence.

Thanks in advance for any insight.",finance

Personally a used sedan perfectly suits my lifestyle. Ideally, nothing with more than 90,000 miles, and hopefully nothing earlier than a 2014.

Nothing too crazy or beyond reasonable, as I'm also willing to put a down payment of $8-10,000 cash, then put the rest somewhere in an effort to build credit.

As far as I'm aware my options are:

\- Buy the whole thing cash

\- Take out a bank loan

\- Go through the dealership's loaning service/bank plan

\- Go through a credit union

Complete transparency: Nobody taught me how any of this garbage works. What *exactly* are credit unions? How do I get some sort of loan through them, and how do I even apply that to the dealership? How do I know I'm not getting screwed over by any and all parties? I understand hardware basics of automobiles enough to know rentals aren't safe buys, and stick shift is pretty inconsequential living in suburban Florida with nothing but turns and I-4 traffic.

personalfinance,Soliciting opinions on my mortgage vs invest debate,"Hi r/personalfinance

It's time for me to solicit opinions instead of giving them away. Using a throwaway due to personal info. I am going through the agonizing decision process of whether or not to unleash extra cash on my mortgage or put it into my taxable brokerage account index funds. Here are the particulars: 

* 38M - $134K salary + 11% bonus - single filer
* Maxing out 401k/IRA/HSA and contribute 5% to ESPP
* I currently put $900-$1000 per month into a taxable brokerage account and invest in index ETFs 
* 1 year into condo mortgage, balance is $260K @ 4.25% (10/1 ARM)
* No other interest-bearing debt (car loan is 0% APR) 
* Emergency fund of $18K sitting in cash (1.25% APY credit union savings account) 

My monthly spend is not outrageous IMO. $350 for groceries/dining out, $150 for transportation/gas/car maintenance, $150 for entertainment/subscriptions, $85 for cell phone. Car, home, life and disability insurance totals $143/month. 

I subscribe to the theory of leveraging low interest debt to maximize long-term investment returns. However, I'm still debating if it makes sense to pay additional to my mortgage. The Prime Directive would put my mortgage into the ""moderate"" interest debt but it also ""excludes"" your mortgage. My rate of 4.25% is in the gray area of the great debate: guaranteed return vs. potential future return. Two other factors are important to consider: 

1. I took advantage of a first-time homebuyer product and only put 3% down (with no PMI) so I don't have the equity to refinance into a conventional 30-year and get an interest rate that would make this decision easier. 
2. I do not expect to live in this place long-term. I feel a little buyers remorse that I didn't hold off on buying until I could put more down. I fell into the trap of friends telling me I'm ""throwing money away"" by renting. If the condo market falls off a cliff like it did a decade ago, I could very well be underwater when I want/need to sell. 

I wish I better understood how to calculate refinance options that include PMI and whether there's any scenario where it could work out for me. My hunch is no because of the likelihood I do not own this place for more than a decade.  Thoughts?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Oct 1. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities’ third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting September’s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks’ report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September’s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we’ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

**Highlights**

* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. 
* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.
* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near-record low-interest rates.

So I’m 28 years old, I support myself financially (no other dependents) and am carrying ~$12,500 in credit card debt. I had some pretty bad spending habits when I was younger, but now I only use my credit cards in an absolute emergency. The debt is across three cards which are all starting to accrue interest. I used to transfer balances from card to card to avoid paying interest but I knew it wouldn’t work forever, and here we are. The only option I can think of is to apply for a consolidated loan. My credit has always been excellent up until recently. I had a score of 800 a few years ago but now I’m down to 709. I always pay my cards early and always above the minimum payment.

cybersecurity,Paying ransomware demands could land you in hot water with the feds,"Businesses, governments, and organizations that are hit by crippling ransomware attacks now have a new worry to contend with—big fines from the US Department of Treasury in the event that they pay to recover their data.

Treasury Department officials made that guidance official in an advisory published on Thursday. It warns that payments made to specific entities or to any entity in certain countries—specifically, those with a designated “sanctions nexus”—could subject the payer to financial penalties levied by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.

The prohibition applies not only to the group that is infected but also to any companies or contractors the hacked group’s security or insurance engages with, including those who provide insurance, digital forensics, and incident response, as well as all financial services that help facilitate or process ransom payments.

Enabling criminals

“Facilitating a ransomware payment that is demanded as a result of malicious cyber activities may enable criminals and adversaries with a sanctions nexus to profit and advance their illicit aims,” the advisory stated. “For example, ransomware payments made to sanctioned persons or to comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions could be used to fund activities adverse to the national security and foreign policy objectives of the United States. Ransomware payments may also embolden cyber actors to engage in future attacks. In addition, paying a ransom to cyber actors does not guarantee that the victim will regain access to its stolen data.”

\~2mm in various ETFs, \~1.5mm invested in the companies we work at, \~400k in our 401ks, \~30k cash on hand.  Our current combined income is around 2mm/yr.

Ideally, we'd be able to put as little down as possible and invest as much money as possible taking advantage of the (expected) spread between returns in our investments and the interest rate on our mortgage.  We chatted with a mortgage broker and he said that we would probably need to always put down 20%, is this true?  Our mortgage broker also mentioned that mortgage lenders won't care much about our current net worth and mostly just cares about our income, our 401ks (as the they claimed net worth over 400k doesn't really matter), and credit score (both 800+).  Should I be shopping with one of our current banks (schwab / fidelity) for better rates / less down where they have a fuller financial background when computing our rates?

Are there any other things we should be thinking about in terms of finding the best mortgage?  (i.e. jumbo vs putting a lot more money down vs refi down the line)",finance
personalfinance,"Help me math out/options my high apr car loan, and my student loan so I can get out of debt!","So, I back in feb 2020 I wanted to get a newish car that I did not have the money for, so I financed it. This being said i am in my early 20's and had pretty much no credit, this lead to me having a fairly high apr when getting ""guaranteed financing"". 8 months later I am looking to make a quick cut way to paying this off and then my student loan after to unburden myself from debt and move out of my parents house. Using this following information what would you guys/girls recommend as a plan forward as the best practice to pay this off. 

useful information- weekly check after taxes is lets say $580, almost everything i make is money i save besides about, lets say $350 a month for a couple bills and a little bit of spending money. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the car loan- this loan started feb 4th, was $14,162, 60 month loan with a 23% apr, and a monthly payment of $399. I have been paying $500 on this per month so far. 

the options i can think of is 1.) continuing my monthly payment saving up the payoff amount and paying it off. 2.) refinancing it with a higher monthly payment, shorter term, lower apr. 3.) stay with this company(which is obviously high apr) but just start making a lot larger payments but how much would this save me compared to option 1 of just paying it off in like 4 months all at one time but still having the money in the bank?

&amp;#x200B;

for my student loan I owe $15,047, with a monthly payment minimum of $104. this is broken into a few different loans both types being subsidized stafford and unsubsidized stafford which I believe the interest rate on these in between 4-5%(currently zerod out on my loan site due to covid putting them into forbearance until dec 31st). so my main question with this one is after the car loan should i focus on paying this off asap, or should i use the chunks of money in a different way that would net me more than the 4-5% interest that this is accumulating? how much money do i save paying this off asap vs paying the minimum over the 10 year length of the loan? 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously i know its smart to just get out of debt but im curious if theres one way or another its cheaper while working my way out of debt, or once i get to the student loan if im 'wasting' money not using it in a smarter financial way since the interest rate is low on it.

personalfinance,Leased a Tacoma - Have the option to buy out lease at much lower interest rate.,"This last September I decided to lease a 2020 Tacoma Off road. Even though I have been dreaming of owning this truck for the past 6 months, the buyer's remorse has not worn off and all I keep thinking is that it was a mistake.

The money factor on the lease is .0032, or roughly 7.68% APR (horrible I know). After the 3 year lease is over, the total paid amount on the car will be $21,540, and the residual will be $30,059.

I was approved at my local credit union @ 2.49% to buyout the lease. Total is $37,600 not including state+local taxes which would be 7.45% in Utah. Loan would be for $34,000, and I would pay any difference and taxes out of pocket.

If I was planning on driving truck until it fell apart, or at least 5+ years, then the best decision would be to buy out the lease now. However, I think I would be perfectly happy getting a cheaper and more fuel efficient car like a used Prius for $15k, and honestly wish that's what I did to begin with.

Should I stick with the lease and try to sell it above residual value to recoup some costs when the lease ends, or buy it out? Like I said, easy decision if I plan to keep it forever, but I think I'd rather get a cheaper car.

I ran some numbers for how much interest is paid over 3 years:

Interest paid over 3 years:

$37,600 @ 7.68: $6,423.29

$34,000 @ 2.49: $1,826.75

Difference: $4596.54

Difference factoring in purchase taxes ($2801.20): $1795.34.

&amp;#x200B;

My info:

$96,500 salary, \~16k student loans, renting 2 bedroom ($1500) with partner with some costs split. Still have a fair chunk of salary left over for savings and retirement, just having anxiety that it is much less than it could have been for more important life goals.",finance
Bitcoin,Crypto.com regulations,"Hey just wondering if anyone has had much experience with Crypto.com. I started buying MCO because they have incredible interest rates on the coins you deposit with them. The debit card is super cool I enjoy 5% back in CRO on all purchases and receive 100% back in CRO for my Netflix Spotify and Prime purchases. As I received more benefits from this platform, I saw an opportunity to convert a lot of dollars I had earned over the last few decades (mostly in property) into bitcoin and stablecoins like DAI and TUSD and earn 12% APY interest + 2% interest in CRO. These are better returns than I have on most rental properties I’ve owned, without the headache of shitty tenants, asshole city council members, and constant maintenance and taxes. So when i had the cash at my disposal, i quickly and with velocity started purchasing large amounts of bitcoin ethereum DAI paxos tusd through the crypto.com app and began making deposits. They upgraded my debit card. It’s cool. Rose gold. I deposit tusd onto the card and it converts it to fiat and I go spend it and I get crypto back which earns 18% APY!! It’s great. All of a sudden, the bots and auto responders are asking for proof of source of my funds and that if I don’t provide the documents, that it will impact my account. They won’t even give me a phone call. They tell me and my tax attorney to email their support@crypto.com email. I talk to bots and auto responders. I get one of them on the chat and they say they need the documents for their report so they can stay compliant. I tell them that their report is of no concern to me. I report to the irs, I followed every agreement to purchase the crypto and use the platform. No brokerage account I have traded on has ever requested this information or documents as proof. If they needed the proof of my source Of income or wealth, they should have asked before selling me the crypto.
This whole exchange wouldn’t bother me so much if I could just move my funds to my cold wallet. The worrisome thing is that they have control of everything that’s still locked up in a 3 month deposit period. Obviously I can’t take those funds out until the term expired.

1. economy is artificially floated by the fed and stimulus. fed is already at 0% and big gov will likely need to pump another 2 trillion to keep everything floating for another 6 months

3. business is dead. you can see it in towns, malls, airports, hotels. most people are home. sure you see news of parties/weddings but that's not done in scale. 

if I do some back of the napkin math, we need likely 2-3 more stimulus to buy enough time for this country to have herd immunity. by then, we've accumulated ~ 6 -8 trillion in debt as a nation. so question and title is what do you think will happen across the board and how one should invest or just hold on to cash?",finance

personalfinance,debt reduction vs debt settlement vs other options,"I am massively in debt, credit cards and unsecured loans, about $60,000. Please don't criticize me for my past mistakes. I recognize how I got here. I make $65,000 per year gross. Have a high mortgage payment, car lease, regular living expenses and the aforementioned debt, and frankly not enough net income to cover everything owed.

Debt consolidation loan is not an option, as my credit disqualies me from further borrowing. 

Debt settlement is one option, but you owe income taxes on the savings, so it seems like it costs more money to settle. Most of the settlement companies leave this aspect out of their pitch.

Debt reduction is a less common option. They tell you to stop all payments to creditors and let accounts go to collections. Then send the collections letters to a law firm which then uses a federal law to challenge the collections agencies (apparently creditors are not legally allowed to transfer personal information to a collections agency) and have the debt written off. The customer pays the debt reduction company about 50% of the owed debt which is basically legal fees. There is a hit on credit by having multiple delinquencies but they claim that is temporary. My credit is already about 500 so that's the least of my worries.

Dave Ramsey would say get another job and/or use the snowball method. I hardly have the energy to do my current job let alone another one in the evening or weekend which would likely be relatively low paying retail. Side hustles seem popular so I am looking into something I can do from home on the side.

The snowball method requires having enough income to pay off debt while keeping up with minimum payments on everything. Unfortunately the minimum payments are pretty high.

So I am between a rock and a hard place. Short of bankruptcy I'd appreciate any ideas you all may have.",finance

personalfinance,Massachusetts: Office of Unemployment Hasnt Paid for Furlough in July,"So back in July, specifically the week of July 6th, my company had everybody take a one week furlough to help cover losses due to COVID. This was the second of such furloughs, the first occurring on the week of May 4th. For both instances, I had applied to the Massachusetts unemployment department to collect benefits. The first furlough, I had no problems. The claim was approved and I had money within a week of the end of the furlough.

However, on the second furlough, my claim was put on Hold. It has remained on hold sense, and I have been unable to get any measure of progress on this account. I am really concerned, as this is over $1000 that would really help right now, plus a big part of that is the $600 federal addition that I am concerned I will loose out on. I started keeping records after the fourth employee I talked to was unable to give me any real advice, and I will state the timeline below:

July 6th-July 10th: On furlough

July 12th: Claimed previous week for benefits

July 14th: Employer confirms that all wage requests and verifications were sent to department of employment either in paper or digital form (differing for some employees)

July 28th: First phone call to unemployment. Was told that a senior member of the call center staff could assist, was put on hold. While on hold the unemployment call center closed for EDO, was told to call back in the morning and someone would help.

July 29th: Called first thing in the morning. Was told the account would be resolved within 10 days, which would be August 6th.

July 29th: Employer confirms sending out more questionnaires requested by unemployment.

August 7th: Third call. Was told that it would be another 10 days.

August 14th: Fourth phone call. Was told that the account is in arbitration (and was assigned on the 9th, but I forgot to ask of what month. Assumed August). Was told that arbitration could take up to 28 days and to call back in to check on the status. The reason for this was due to a miss-answered question on my application. I had selected ""Leave of Absence"", when I should have selected ""Termination"". I understand the error now, but at the time and from their provided definitions Leave of Absence had seemed the correct answer.

August 21st: Fifth phone call. This time it felt like I was actually talking to someone who knew what they were talking about. Was told that, although my account was in arbitration, it had not been assigned to an arbiter, and that this process could take an indefinite amount of time, with no visibility to the call center. He said I never should have been given any sort of timeline. Was told again to call and check if I had been assigned to an arbiter yet, as that was the only thing the call center could see.

October 2nd (today): Was told again that I had not yet been assigned, and that this would still take more time.

At this point I feel like I have no options left. I have had to borrow money from family and friends to cover this weeks loss of payment as my household was already tight on money due to COVID. I am concerned that if the year ends without payment that my taxes will be somehow affected. Does anyone know of any recourses that exist that I could use to help speed up this process? Is there an office I can call, or should I take some other steps?",finance

personalfinance,FHA vs Conventional with higher interest rate,"Hi everyone!

So my fiancé and I are working with a realtor and purchasing a new home in a subdivision. We've been presented with two mortgage options that seem to be the same and we really can't figure the pro / con of either long term. I'll do my best to explain each option.

We have ~30k for down payment and closing costs, and make a combined $127k annually. The home is $240k.

Option 1:
FHA with a 5k interest rate buy down. We would put down 3.5%. This option will give us a 2.25% interest rate due to the buy down. 

Being an FHA, we know we would be stuck with PMI ($160 / month) for the life of the loan unless we refinance. Refinancing seems like it wouldn't be an option down the road because i can't see rates being lower than 2.25% at any point. 

The builder would be ""generous"" enough to credit us $11k of closing cost credit because we are using their lender.  We would be bringing $19k to the table after all is said and done (down payment, remaining closing costs, rate buydown, escrow) and have a $1548.90 per month mortgage payment.

Option 2:

Conventional 30 year mortgage with a 3.125% interest rate. We would be putting 3% down for this option.

Being a conventional, this option seemed like the more desirable at first. The ability to drop PMI seems great despite the higher interest rate. The issue is the builder went ahead and did a ""PMI Buyout"" and our PMI on the balance sheet is $0. This makes us feel they are up to something shady because almost the entire cost of PMI just happens to be squeezed into ""Principal and Interest"" on the sheet due to the higher rate.

The builder credit is limited to 6200 by the rules of a conventional (news to me). So even without the interest buydown from the FHA, we still spend 5k on the reduced closing cost credit from the buyer. 

Overall, using this option, we would be bringing $17949.09 to the table and paying  $1481.33 monthly.

So dow we just take the conventional and accept the 60 bucks a month savings at a higher interest rate? Our understanding has always been that the ability to drop PMI is the main reason you should get a conventional if you qualify, but that doesn't even matter in this scenario due to the buyout. 

Any guidance would be great. Any questions PLEASE ask!

CryptoCurrency,Yield farming platform APY.Finance locks $67 million in first hour. What is behind?,"Today [APY.Finance](https://APY.Finance) opened its liquidity mining program. Within 1 hour of the launch, the platform witnessed a total of $67 million added to their smart contracts.

**Why such high interest:**

Since the closure of [APY.Finance](https://APY.Finance) private sale round, the team worked out on a plan to cheer-up community sentiment and designed liquidity mining in order to have the fair distribution of APY governance tokens in the hands of the community members, thereby truly decentralizing the power over platform economics decision.

I believe such high interest may be due to some yield farmers forgetting that they are participating in the distribution of governance token. Users who are adding funds to [APY.Finance](https://APY.Finance) platform is not participating in yield farming any DeFi strategy but mining APY governance tokens. This was already mentioned in the earlier blog post ( [1](https://medium.com/apy-finance/introducing-the-apy-token-edac64d0cf6b?source=collection_home---6------1-----------------------) and [2](https://medium.com/apy-finance/apy-finance-liquidity-mining-launch-c37f0d2a1172)) by the team. The first month will see 900,000 APY tokens mined and incentive details will vary month-to-month. The total amount of APY to be mined will be total of 31.2 million tokens or 31.2% of the total supply.

As of this writing, I see a total of 1000+ addresses already interacted with the APY liquidity mining smart contract address. This is just one day and that already represents the companies goal to make APY governance token truly decentralized and owned by the community.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing remarks:**

In my belief,  the team also did not expect such a high-interest level and may now have to get back to the drawing board to review the reward scheme. Something similar to SNX staking wherein rewards are generated through the inflationary monetary policy. Usually, stakes in Synthetix are escrow for a year, and the SNX staking rewards enabled by the inflationary supply are set to decrease gradually until 2023.

Currently, the governance tokens minted from [APY.Finance](https://APY.Finance)'s liquidity mining program are escrow for 6 months and available only for one month.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"The Implicit Government Bank Bailout Subsidy Was Estimated to be as High as $300 Billion In 2011, Three Times that of all U.S Bank Holding Companies Annual Earnings in the Same Year","” If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to come from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts perverse (unnatural) market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors recognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured depositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost (accept lower interest rates or higher fees) to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and regional banks that face the risk of failure”. (all italicized text is my own)

“This TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by the Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government guarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two notches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller competitors”.

“Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates the current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”

personalfinance,Putting money I am saving to pay off student loans in ETF/Index fund until I have enough?,"So right now I've been saving quite a bit of money and putting it into a high interest savings account...but its only still like 0.8% APY.

Right now I have $21k, $20k of which is my emergency fund money (took awhile to save that up finally).

I'm going to be getting $5k from a sign on bonus at a new job in the new month or two and also around $12k of PTO money I didn't use at my current job that they will be paying out to me. So all in all, $18k extra saved aside from my emergency fund.

I was planning to use that money to buy out my car from it's lease, as it ends in June and I don't want to keep leasing....just drive this Corolla into the dirt.

It's $12,264.83 to buyout now and ~$10k to buyout in June but still $260 a month in lease payments. 

After that though I plan to start paying out my student loans. I have ~$40k left, half private with a higher interest rate I was going to tackle and half a pretty low federal rate I maybe will ride out longer.

While I build that up though, it might be another year or two tbh. Should I put it into an index fund or ETF to save? Then once its where I want pull it out? Could I in theory save it faster if the return is like 8%-10% instead of 0.8% ?

Tbh I don't know much about investing, I just know index funds and ETF is the ""don't put your eggs in one basket"" way and investing in all the top 500 companies. I think it be better than just throwing as much as I can each month to the payment in case I need the money for other issues or change my mind and rather ride out the loans. Also since it can grow faster year over year.

**TLDR** Want to start saving up full amount to payoff my student loans, should I start just saving it in an ETF/index fund gradually for two years and pay it out once I have the amount?",finance
personalfinance,Best order of operations for selling current home and buying another.,"I am ready to sell my house of 10+ years with ~$100k equity. I want to get a new home in a better neighborhood while the interest rates are low. As I see it I have 4 options.

1) Sell the house now, put my possessions in storage, and rent till I find my next home. This allows me to have a 20% down payment right off the bat, but makes moving and shuffling around with my pets an issue. 

2) Look for houses at the same time I am selling mine and make a contingency offer an my next home hoping that the seller is ok with that. Moving would be easier, and the down payment would be available, but I’ve been told that some sellers are apprehensive of this. 

3) Buy a new house before selling with little to no down and sell my house later putting 20% down after the sale goes through. This would give me time to move and do some fixes on the current house. I would have to float two mortgages plus the mortgage insurance in the mean time, which I don’t foresee as a big issue with my situation. 

4) Keep both houses and rent the first house out. I’m not sure I’m interested in being a landlord, so I would probably use a management company. This would mean I would pay mortgage insurance for a while as well till I can get 20% down on the 2nd house.

personalfinance,Help Pleas. Getting the run around from The Home Depot and FedEx.,"Last week I bought 14 of the same item from the Home Depot online. 

For some reason it was broken into 2 separate shipments from of 10 items &amp; 4 items. Today, both are marked as delivered from the two separate Tracking Numbers but I only received the 4 item package. The other 10 were delivered to Florence, KY per the tracking information (I live in PA). I reached out to Home Depot service who pretty much said there’s nothing they can do and that it’s on FedEx. When I reached out to FedEx they gave me a case number and said that they would look into it and see what they can find out. They admitted that they could see on their end for some reason it said delivered to Kentucky, however started following it up with idiotic questions given the scenario of “did you check your garden and back door”, “ did anyone else in the family accept the package”, after in the same breath admitting that they’re tracking information indicates that it was sent to Kentucky. They said keep the same tracking number and could not give me any further information about when it would come or when I should expect it. I tried explaining to them that the tracking number listed it as “delivered” so how could I track it and would they fix this so I could still follow the package along its path and they couldn’t even answer that question. It says the package was already signed for by somebody else in Kentucky so what are they going to do go knock on their door and ask for it back? After the conversation was ended I did not feel confident that I will ever be receiving this package based on the ineptitude of the person I was speaking with. How should I proceed from here? Should I ask for a charge back through my credit card although I did receive four of the items. I can’t return it to Home Depot because they think I already received all 14. I’m not sure what to do...

personalfinance,Can my HSA help me stay in a lower tax bracket?,"Hello. Fairly new to reddit, throwaway for privacy. Recently turned 26 and enrolled in an employer sponsored HSA. I know the account is tax advantaged and contributions lower my taxable income. However, curious if this means I can use my HSA to keep me in the same tax bracket next year. I’m currently at the top of my federal income bracket, so our yearly increase will likely push me into the next one (from 12-22%).

personalfinance,"Warning: For those looking at debt consolidation loans, dont go to Upstart. Here's why","Coming into 2020 I had about 19.8k of credit card debt along with a small loan (3k) for school that I was paying off. To lessen the impact on my credit score (by reducing utilization), I took up a loan with Upstart which offered a 17.7% APR and a 7.7% origination fee. In total the effective APR (25.4%) was similar to my credit card interest rates. The ultimate goal was to bring my credit up and secure a secondary loan at a lower interest and fully payoff the upstart consolidation. My personal credit union offered me this exactly at 10.5% less than what my current Upstart loan. Here's where it gets interesting:

In my promissory note, as i'm sure it is written in yours, Section 10 'Repayment' states that \* 'A full repayment of the Note within six months of the Origination Date may result in a partial refund of the Origination Fee'. \*

Given that I was able to secure this personal loan from my credit union in less than 3 months, it would be reasonable to assume that I would receive a refund on the origination fee (7.7% or approx $1800). I would not expect the entirety of the refund due to the 3 months. When i contacted support, I was told by the Lead and by a loan officer that they were unable to explain how the amount is calculated. This was not sufficient for me and I asked for further explanation. Their only response was that if I was to pay the total principal amount and interest today I would receive approximately 98$ back on the origination fee. To put that into perspective, i would lose more than 90% of my origination fee even if I paid back the full amount BEFORE 3 MONTHS. To me, that's absolutely rediculous. I understand origination and underwriting is a major part of any banks business but the 'algorithm' which they leverage and do not clearly explain is almost criminal.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR If your plan is to consolidate debt and potentially look for lower interest rate loans when your credit score rebounds, don't go to Upstart - they have ridiculous origination fees that they will never give back to you.",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan advice ELI5,"Excuse the formatting as I am on mobile sitting at a dealership right now. 
I am looking for some advice regarding my current vehicle and potential purchasing a different one. I currently have a 2009 vehicle with 100,000 miles with around 35mpg city. This vehicle was purchased by a family member (details can be found on a different post of mine). 

The amount financed was 7574. The cost of finance was 6957. Total 14592. The interest rate was listed as 24.1%

My monthly payment on this vehicle is 201. 

I was taking this vehicle for a repair today and happened to see the vehicle mentioned below. 


I recently looked at a 2019 vehicle with 11,000 miles on it. I was told due to my credit being in the ""very good"" range my interest would be between 2.5 to 3.9% 

I have never financed a vehicle myself before and I am kind of daunted at the aspect of it. Is anyone able to explain how much my monthly payments could be or is that something that would be discussed upon the negotiation of the purchase of the vehicle. Also is there a way to figure out what my total cost of purchase would be of the agreement was 24k at 3.9 percent. Does the interest increase over time etc? 

Also, should I not look at new vehicles as it would screw over said family members credit if i returned the vehicle they negotiated a 24 percent interest deal on.

Just for reference, one of the lenders has an interest rate of 2.375% and an APR of 3.048% for a 30-year fixed mortgage; whereas another lender has an interest rate of 2.875% but an APR of 3.012%.

personalfinance,"For the avalanche method of debt repayment is it better to pay off the loan with the highest total interest rate first, or the loan with the highest interest added per day?","I know the avalanche method of debt repayment leads to the lowest amount of total money paid by paying off the loans with the highest interest rates first. However, I am confused about a significant detail. 

My student loans have simple interest and thus have interest applied only to the principle each day (interest rate divided by 365 * principle). I have one loan with 6.8% interest and a principle of $5,000, and another loan with 6% interest and $15,000 principle. The avalanche method seems to be stating that in the long run I will save money by paying off the 6.8% interest loan first, however, because of the high principle, the 6% interest loan actually accrues more interest per day.

So my question is which loan would be more financially beneficial (in the sense that I will keep the most amount of total money in my pocket) to pay off first?

personalfinance,Debt Catch 22 &amp; How to Get HELOC w/ Bad Credit,"Hi Everyone,

To solve my financial predicament, I need to lower the monthly payment on some sizable debt by obtaining a lower interest rate and longer terms.

- From a manic episode, I racked up $72,000 in CC debt that I can only make minimum payments on which is roughly $1,700 / month.

- My mortgage payment including insurance and property taxes is $1,600 / month

I gross $55,000 / year and after making minimum CC payments and mortgage nets out to +$150

Luckily, family helps out and covers anything else, but it's just a perpetual cycle since I'm never making a dent in the CC debt principle and don't want to a) rely on help and b) not save anything.

A home equity loan for $74,000 at 4.5% variable APR over 30 years is $340 / month.

*If* I could get this loan I could afford the home loan payment, mortgage, utilities, necessities... everything.

My credit score is 590 on one and 600 on the other, only due to high utilization %. So the banks computer would = reject. There's no human element anymore.

However; if you look at it from a human element, logically, it seems like an OK risk for the lender. The loan (secured) would address the high utilization and low credit rating, but I can't get the loan to resolve this. Catch 22.

QUESTION:

A) If I put in the contract that the bank upon originating the loan pays the CC companies directly so I never touch it and agree to close the accounts.... Wouldn't this eleminate their risk?

B) Also, I have 70% equity in my home which is appraised @/ $550-$600. So, hypothetically, if I didn't pay the $340 / month and defaulted on the home loan the bank would forclose and the proceeds would more than cover the remaining mortgage and the $74,000 loan leaving $ leftover.

So no matter what the bank will get it's money back, right?

tl;dr for heloc if the equity % is high enough to secure the loan no matter what and the loan is paid directly to the higher interest debt upon origination can I slip by the credit score and the algorithms that have automatic rejection criteria?

Looking at this logically it makes sense...

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the court grants in part and denies in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss the sixth and seventh causes of action for violations of California Business and Professions Code § 17200 and § 17500 is GRANTED with prejudice as to all defendants. The motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action for the predicate violation of California Corporations Code § 25401 is DENIED. That said, because plaintiff failed to allege any statement in support of his first through third categories of purported fraud with the requisite Rule 9(b) specificity, he may proceed on that cause of action solely on the basis of Garlinghouse’s alleged misrepresentations at paragraph 52 concerning the scope and character of his XRP holdings. As previously decided by the court in its prior order, plaintiff may, of course, also proceed on his remaining first, second, third, and fifth causes of action against defendants for their alleged sale or offer of unregistered securities in violation of federal and California state law.

hydro,Looking for advice on indoor cilantro and salad mix,"Hello everyone. I am looking for someone with experience who can advise me while I create a hydroponic setup to extend the length of my farm's salad and cilantro production.  I used to have a large farm but last winter moved to a small plot of land so I could better utilize a warehouse for mycology cultivation.  The plot of land is very shady and already my salad has almost come to a halt from lack of sun, but fortunately I have access to 200amps of electricity and a spare garage, plus an exterior greenhouse I recently built connected to the warehouse.

I am planning on doing a NFT system with channels and long strips of grow media that I'll grow a hedge row of cilantro, lettuce and mustard on, as opposed to the drop in plug channels.  I plan on making 4x4ft nft tables, that dismantle so I can operate them in a greenhouse when it's warm, or bring them inside during the winter and stack them for space.

My biggest question is about nutrients, does anyone have experience with non-synthetic nutrients? They don't have to be OMRI certified, but if there is a cost effective nutrient or even a recipe to DIY from organic field nutrients that I can convert into water soluble, through some vortex or air/bacteria method, I would love to hear whatever you all have to suggest.

I did a test hydroponic system this year, it was more of a planter pot garden on a lawn with the best sun, that the landlord wouldn't let me turn into garden beds.  I fed them primarily every week with 5-5-5 fish, as well as cal-mag and bloom for strawberries, plus preumpt micro nutrients.  It was a great success, but I would like to take the soil out of the equation for obvious reasons, as well as make it more compact, faster to construct, and be profitable in any indoor situation, while creating about 20-30lb of salad a week.  I plan on doing this with panda plastic that goes ontop of a metal frame of channels, this way cleaning will be easy as pulling the plastic out will also pull the substrate.  The substrate will sit on top of drywall vinyl inside corner bead, which has holes in it and will allow for water to flow underneath in theory, while also being rather durable for longevity.  the nft run off will go into a gutter.

Thank you everyone for any advice you have to offer, very excited to take another step forward in this dream of hydroponics I've always had.

economy,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

*“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""*

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:

*""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""*

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

Bitcoin,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

*“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""*

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.

# **Trump’s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump’s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.
*****
&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.
*****
&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.
*****
&gt; “The market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it’s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. “Will we see him in person in the next week in any form? What’s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.”
*****
&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.
*****
&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.
*****
&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.
*****
&gt; “What you’ve done from a campaign perspective, is you’ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,” said Emanuel. “The president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it’s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.”
*****
&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can’t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. “We’re in a tough spot but overall we’re still pretty constructive.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.
*****
&gt; “The underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there’s going to be stimulus,” Emanuel said. ”’Whether it’s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It’s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.”
*****
&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.
*****
&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.
*****
&gt; “I think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “He’ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a ‘V.’ Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that’s the kind of outlook he’s going to give. It’s going to be full-throated.”
*****
&gt; September’s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.
*****
&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed’s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.

&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!

&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.

&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**

&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.

&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**

&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?

&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.

&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.

&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.

&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History

&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**

&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.

&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again

&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.

&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.

&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.

&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows

&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
Forex,The Return of Setup Saturdays (Kinda...) - EURUSD Outlook,"As most of you probably don't remember, I used to show potential setups on pairs which I did for a couple Saturdays a couple of months ago. However, it actually turned out to be a lot of work and with my busy schedule I just couldn't consistently put out posts since I usually had to spend 4-5 hours of my Friday night working on those posts. Recently someone on this Subreddit sent me a message saying they wanted me to put out more posts and I had some free time tonight so I decided why the hell not. I'm currently working on a little project (not really little) that involves exclusively trading EURUSD. Since I have to meticulously break down EU every week for this project I thought I would just put out my notes on a weekly basis since it's pretty much very little extra effort on my part. Even if nobody reads these posts I guess I could just use it for cataloguing my ideas and writing out my thoughts will probably actually benefit me so I guess It'll be beneficial for me.

Let's get into it then.

&amp;#x200B;

[EU Weekly](https://preview.redd.it/4y2v7r0e7tq51.png?width=1253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bc6eb672e7b4697a72a859ce622cd2b1ac5a00)

Looking at the weekly chart you can see that EU looks like it bounced off a prior zone which had acted as prior support and resistance since back in 2003.

&amp;#x200B;

[EU 4-Hour](https://preview.redd.it/cpd16kd3atq51.png?width=1253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb04c4ec1a14f460a8581354d723efab3178cc)

Looking at the 4 hour it looks like EU produced a H&amp;S pattern at that strong level we saw on the weekly chart. We also recently the neckline and rejected it meaning we have good reason to believe it'll continue to fall. Also take notice how we received a near perfect bounce from that 38.2% Fib level. I know some of you view Fib levels like they're meaningless but I love using Fib levels. I'm going to look for shorts going into next week on this pair unless it breaks the neckline back to the upside which would nullify the H&amp;S.

[EU 1-Hour](https://preview.redd.it/k8kk6uzmktq51.png?width=1253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51b2742f810eb12042c27d6edf7e7b4efa45a707)

Looks like we got another head and shoulders pattern forming at the neckline of the previous head and shoulders pattern I drew on the 4 hour chart. If we can get a neckline break, retest, and rejection you should have a golden trading opportunity on your hand. One more thing I want you to take a look at is that blue ray I drew in. That's the the price which the monthly candle opened at and price went up to test that level quite a few times so I have a sneaking suspicion that this level will play an important role in the future so keep it an eye out on it as the month progresses. Also the head of that H&amp;S pattern aligned up really well with that 61.8% Fib level. 

If we reject the neckline of the 1 hour H&amp;S then I could see price going down to test that low at around 1.613 which is where you may want to be careful as price will probably create a double bottom and bounce back up. I'll explain more on why I think we'll get a double bottom as opposed to a break. If we get a strong bearish break through that level then the next area to keep an eye on is 1.500 which has a prior resistance zone there and it also acts as a psychological level. This means it's very likely we could get some kind of bounce or pullback beginning at that level but I don't really see price reaching that area this week so we can come back and revaluate the situation next week assuming we don't get strong bullish pressure on EU which nullifies all these confluences. If that happens I'll probably be back in the middle of the week and provide an update on my outlook for EU.

All my technicals make me confident of a EU short however the equity markets are making me quite nervous. If the feds decide to keep rallying the stocks then the SPX will continue to go up causing the Dollar to lose strength which is actually a very likely possibility. The S&amp;P500 seems to have been rejected from the high from the pre-Covid drop meaning we could potentially see a drop here.

Looking at the SPX, it looks like it retraced back to the 50% Fib level from which it got rejected from which suggests it'll drop a bit more but also keep that range I drew in your head.

Let's head into fundamentals which is everybody's favorite topic. Heading back to the SPX we are at an extremely critical level where the entire market is watching for the stimulus package and/or the election results. Until we get either of those events to occur I don't think the SPX will break 3400 or 3200 and we'll just trade in a range between these two values. If/when the stimulus gets passed then I'm extremely confident it'll give SPX the juice it needs in order to break that 3400 side and continue the rally. If we don't get the stimulus then the election results will determine which range side will break. If Trump is re-elected then we'll take out the 3400 side. If Biden wins then we'll break the 3200 side. Due to this range, EU will also probably range which is why I stated earlier that EU will probably create a double bottom at 1.613.

These are just a couple of my thoughts that I paraphrased here but at the end of the day don't get stuck up on predictions and remember to be reactive to whatever happens. There's a chance that every single word I said will get nullified by first Asian session so remember to be adaptive. Feel free to call me a complete idiot if you feel like everything I just said is ridiculous.",finance

cybersecurity,Russia’s Fancy Bear hackers likely penetrated a federal agency New clues indicate that APT28 may be behind mysterious intrusion disclosed last week.,"A warning that unidentified hackers broke into an agency of the US federal government and stole its data is troubling enough. But it becomes all the more disturbing when those unidentified intruders are identified—and appear likely to be part of a notorious team of cyberspies working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.

Last week the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency published an advisory that hackers had penetrated a US federal agency. It identified neither the attackers nor the agency, but it did detail the hackers' methods and their use of a new and unique form of malware in an operation that successfully stole target data. Now, clues uncovered by a researcher at cybersecurity firm Dragos and an FBI notification to hacking victims obtained by WIRED in July suggest a likely answer to the mystery of who was behind the intrusion: They appear to be Fancy Bear, a team of hackers working for Russia's GRU. Also known as APT28, the group has been responsible for everything from hack-and-leak operations targeting the 2016 US presidential election to a broad campaign of attempted intrusions targeting political parties, consultancies, and campaigns this year.

The clues pointing to APT28 are based in part on a notification the FBI sent to targets of a hacking campaign in May of this year, which WIRED obtained. The notification warned that APT28 was broadly targeting US networks, including government agencies and educational institutions, and listed several IP addresses they were using in their operations. Dragos researcher Joe Slowik noticed that one IP address identifying a server in Hungary used in that APT28 campaign matched an IP address listed in the CISA advisory. That would suggest that APT28 used the same Hungarian server in the intrusion described by CISA—and that at least one of the attempted intrusions described by the FBI was successful.

personalfinance,Unsure if I should Refinance My Mortgage,"So I have a mortgage for $94,000, at 5.75% interest rate, fixed 30 year mortgage. Owned the house for two years so far.

I got an offer for 2.62% interest rate, fixed 30 year mortgage.

The catch is I have a $6,000 homebuyers grant that will need to be repaid via the new mortgage loan IF I refinance. Each year $2,000 is forgive through the homebuyers grant (if I stay with that mortgage).

Is it worth it to refinance?

I’m looking at the homeequity calculator and it looks like I save, compared to the 5.75% rate, an extra $780 a year by it going directly to equity and not interest. I also save $141 a month in mortgage payments. ($1700 a year).

The refinance costs total $2100. And it resets the mortgage back to 30 years. I only plan on living in the house for the next 3 to 7 years most likely.

**Does my math look like it is in the right ballpark?** 

**I can't believe the amount of Equity I get by lowering my interest rate.**

MY MATH:

**At a 2.62% Interest Rate:**

i =2728          $2728 A YEAR IN TRASH MONEY (INTEREST)

p= 2338        $2338 A YEAR IN PIGGYBANK MONEY (EQUITY)

monthly payment=421.91      yearly total=5066

**At a 5.75% Interest Rate:**

Year 1 delta ---- INTEREST (MONEY IN THE TRASH)=5405-2728= 2677

PRINCIPLE (MONEY IN THE BANK)= 2338 – 1402 = 936

personalfinance,Girlfriend wants to take out $3500 on 0% interest credit card,"Hello,

So basically my girlfriend is wanting to start selling things on Amazon with Amazon FBA. She's done her research and I believe she really knows what she's doing and can succeed. She's also always been super careful with money and paid off her student loans within 8 months of graduation by being very frugal and maximizing her payments. All this to say I'm not too concerned with her work ethic or debt awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

She needs about $3500 to get started in this venture. She looked into a personal loan from her credit union but they were looking to be around a 10-12% interest rate due to age, credit history, etc. On the other hand, she just recently obtained a credit card with 0% interest for 18 months. She thinks it would be fine to purchase the things she needs to get started with that credit card and just pay the monthly minimums so it doesn't ding her credit score. She is also continuing to work full time at her day job, so even if her venture with Amazon doesn't work out, she should be fine to pay off the $3500 before the 0% APY ends.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind, it's just a bad thing to willingly enter into credit card debt, but in this situation, I can't think of a good reason why. What are we missing?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loan slow vs fast,"Got a doctoral level education and along with that came with \~$250,000 in student loan debt -- all federal loans. The average interest is 6.5% which I know is hefty. My job is barely 6 figures in income, and I am on the REPAYE (Pay as you earn) plan which means my payments are only around $700/mo. I could feasibly pay down another \~1k/mo on top of this, but that would also mean not investing much. I am only 4 years into loan repayments at this point. My understanding is that after 30 years of regular payments, the rest will be discharged.

Simply put: Should I be paying down the loans as quickly as possible, and repay them in \~20 years vs 30, while losing 20 years of investment, or should I do the pay as you earn as long as possible until 30 years are up?

Bitcoin,Analysis of good and bad advice for investing in Bitcoin,"A common advice platitude that is carelessly thrown about in /r/Bitcoin is something to the effect of ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset; no one can know how it will play out and it could go to zero.  You should never invest more than you can afford to lose""

I find this to be a particularly meaningless and nonsensical statement.  First the assertion that Bitcoin is a speculative asset should immediately disqualify the person from giving advice.  Not only does this statement reveal that the person making it does not know if Bitcoin is going to increase in value, it also implies that **no one else** can know this as well.  This is a profoundly arrogant claim and is of no use.  Contrast this to [this article](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/end-the-fed-hoard-bitcoins/) written by Pierre Rochard  back in February of 2013.  At the time of this article Bitcoin was worth $22/coin and was widely viewed as toy money and ridiculed as a joke.  Pierre's article assesses the monetary policy of this ""toy money"" and concludes that it has a superior monetary policy to the US Federal Reserve and will therefore necessarily grow to overtake the US dollar and end the fed.  Bitcoin has increased in value over 500x since Rochard's article was published.

If you hear someone giving advice and they say that ""no one can know if Bitcoin will succeed"" they are revealing their profound ignorance of monetary economics and their arrogance that no one else could possibly know something they fail to understand.  Conversely we have people who have looked at Bitcoin when it was considered a joke and correctly concluded it would grow to take over the global economy and kill every central bank in the process.  It should be obvious who is more qualified to speak on the matter and who should be ignored.

The last part of the advice is rather curious and reveals a glaring and very dangerous status quo bias.  What is meant by ""Do not invest more than you can afford to lose""?  More importantly, if you choose not to invest in Bitcoin you are necessarily invested in something else.  The investment in something else--USD perhaps, is dismissed as if that investment cannot lose.  No one ever says ""Do not invest more in the US Dollar than you can afford to lose"", but perhaps they *should*.  Considering the fact that the USD has been rapidly losing market share to a new currency competitor with a monetary policy unlike anything humanity has ever seen, perhaps this would be the best possible advice as it suggest there is a risk most people are unaware of.  

My personal advice to people is this-  If you do not understand monetary economics you have no business investing in a currency because you have no idea what you are doing.  Most people would agree with this if I state this with regard to Bitcoin, but it is also true for holding significant amounts of US Dollars.  Currencies can and do fail; currencies perceived as stable and ""strong"" collapse when they encounter competition from a currency with a superior monetary policy.  If you do not understand this, you should educate yourself perhaps starting with people who correctly predicted Bitcoin's rise when it was worth $22/coin.",cryptocurrency

vet,Puppy suddenly died i don’t know what happened (serious),"Hello, I’m not familiar posting to reddit and I’m not sure if this is going to sound strange but I figured I’d come here because I don’t know what else to research to understand what happened to my maltipoo. 
So just some background, I received two maltipoos from a family friend and we got them September 26th, they were both friendly, excited, but the girl, Sunny was more energetic compared to my male dog, Sage. Now, we assumed Sage was just very nervous, while Sunny was the one guiding him and playing with him to make him feel more welcome. They used the bathroom outside, they learned pretty quickly and overall are the friendliest and softest dogs ever. However, we have a path that runs behind our garden, and Sunny would go absolutely nuts running through it, but Sage never did. It didn’t stop him from being a very affectionate dog, though. He ran on the grass and pavement we had outside, and sneaked up on his sister, and they both pretty much had a good time each day I took them out and played with them. 
Now, we scheduled a grooming appointment because their hair, was unfortunately matted at the bottom, and we wanted a specific cut so they could breathe easier, not let the poop touch their butt etc, etc. 

My mom received a call from the groomer saying that Sage has “kennel cough.” I did a bit of research and kennel cough is very contagious in dogs, much like the common cold to us, but when we went to pick them up, Sunny was perfectly fine, excited to go home and Sage was wheezing and breathing funny. We scheduled a vet apt as soon as possible, October 5th to be exact and in the meantime, we made sure he was happy, loved, fed, and given so much attention as well as Sunny. He came home, plopped on the pee pad and was very lethargic and breathing the same as he did when he left. I put him on my lap, pet him and I had to put him back in his cage on the soft bed so he could rest while I finished up homework. An hour later, he’s on the cage floor and dead. I don’t know if him not running like Sunny did through the path meant anything, I want so assume he had a heart/lung condition before we got him, but if anyone has a thought as to what happened to my Sage, please let me know. I’m not familiar with the illnesses dogs could get, but yeah. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you reached all the way down here.

financialindependence,How an extravagant car set me on the path to financial independence,"I should start by saying that I am not financially independent.  I'm happily on my way, but not there yet.  I thought this post might be an interesting insight into how something generally considered to be amongst the worst uses of money... a *new* (gasp!) *luxury* (cringe!) *vehicle* (faint!) actually wound up being a good thing for me.

So how on earth did something so universally vilified within FIRE circles actually work out in my favor?

First, a little background.  I grew up in a ""wealthy"" middle class family but had relatively little financial education.  My parents made sure to educate us on the perils of things like credit card debt (""if you pay it off in full each month, it's a free loan.  If you don't, it's tremendously expensive""), but beyond that, there wasn't much (no investing/budgeting/tracking spending).  If we're being totally honest, I would classify my family as ""big income, big spenders"" as typified in The Millionaire Next Door.  (I am by no means trying to disparage my parents or my otherwise exceptionally privileged upbringing, just making an observation about how money was treated growing up.)

I attended the US Air Force Academy for college, which was an excellent financial decision as luck would have it.  I got a world-class education for no money (though you do pay in other ways).  I had a stable, guaranteed income for the next 10 years of my life (after pilot training).  No debt.  Various tax-free allowances.  Free socialized healthcare.  And a less-known perk of the military called a ""career starter loan""--a 5 year loan of \~$30k at a low interest rate (usually \~1%).  I invested some of mine (haphazardly at the advice of some USAA financial advisors), used some for a down payment on a new car (no, not the car referenced in the title...just wait), and loaned some to my siblings to help them through college.  This is all relevant because...

Once I graduated, had my incredibly stable income via the military, and monthly payments to make on both my car and paying off the loan, I realized that I *hated* having monthly payments.  I paid both off ahead of schedule.  Even though the loan \*on paper\* is something I should not have paid off ahead of time (it's pretty easy to beat 1% interest in the stock market)...but I just hated knowing that bill was due.

Fast forward another year and I find myself developing a mild interest in ""affordable"" sports cars (mustangs and the like).  I'm a pilot, so I like to think I have an appreciation for high-performance things, even if I'm not particularly a ""gear head.""  So 25 year old me is researching these cars, and there's one catch.  Fuel. Efficiency.  I'm very much an environmentalist and the prospect of getting a coupe or sedan with less than 30 miles/gallon fuel economy was just unacceptable, regardless of how nice the car is.

Enter [this comic by The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s).  That was it.  Game over.  Checkmate.  You're telling me I can have the acceleration of a sports car, the practicality of a 4 door family sedan, the safety of a tank, all with a pittance of the pollution produced by a gas guzzler?  Count me in.  There was just one little catch...those things are expensive.  Real expensive.  And remember the part about me hating to have monthly payments for things?  I was not about to have a monthly car payment equivalent to a mortgage.

So there was only one thing to do:  start saving.  My Tesla goal, in conjunction with a hatred of debt, got me to start saving quite early in my career.  I started with $500/month...enough to buy a Model S in cash after *just* 10 years.  But 10 years is a long time, and I found that I really didn't notice my extra savings impacting my lifestyle.  So $500/month became $500/paycheck, which became $750/paycheck and continued to grow from there.  I intended to pay cash for that thing when I finally had enough.  So, **the first thing that car did was get me to start saving early in my career and at a much higher rate than I would have otherwise, because I had a goal.**  Not the most financially savvy goal, but I was saving quite a bit anyway.

Next, somewhat fortunately, I had a general intuition that my .01% interest savings account wasn't a great place to keep my money, and I had gleaned some basic knowledge of the stock market through coworkers.  I knew that with a long enough time horizon market risk was lower, and that there was at least an opportunity to make some extra cash.  I also figured that even if I did poorly, it would just mean a little be more time driving my perfectly serviceable Hyundai Elantra (great car, btw).  So I started throwing my monthly savings into an individual brokerage account.  I didn't have the knowledge about index funds I do now, but fortunately my stock picks weren't bad either.  In the end, I essentially matched the S&amp;P 500.  The takeaway here, however, is that **my ridiculous car goal also got me started investing my money.** **because I was already saving and my time horizon was long enough to stomach market variance.**

A byproduct of my investing was that I also had regular conversations with coworkers about investing/personal finance.  I wasn't confident enough to dispense advice, but I enjoyed banter about what stocks people liked, how company X was doing on a given day, etc.  Enter a man named John, who mentioned that I should check out a blog called Mr. Money Mustache.  I must admit I dismissed it at first, strictly based on the name...but his stance on bicycles (ironic, given overarching subject of this post) was what sucked me in.  Then I read [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) and my whole world paradigm changed.  I suddenly gained direction in my life.  Instead of some nebulous concept of working until 65 and then figuring out some form of retirement, I had concrete dollar amount to strive for.  I cut my spending way back, generally grew happier, and greatly accelerated my savings (no longer with the solitary goal of affording that Tesla model S).  **And thus I landed on the path to FI, all from the humble beginnings of trying to buy a car.**

Some of you, especially those familiar with MMM, may now be wondering if I wound up following through with buying that *new, expensive, luxury depreciation-mobile.*  The remainder of that story goes like this:  my goal swapped from a model S to a model 3, as it met my expectations at a more moderate price point than the S.  I put down a day 1 reservation around the time I started reading MMM.  When I was finally notified that I could order one (about 2 years later), I had read quite a number of blog posts from reputable sources vilifying such purchases.  Was I really willing to throw 1/5 of my net worth into something that frivolous?  Could I delay my retirement timeline by about 1 year of savings?  Conversely, was I willing to let go of a goal I'd worked toward for over half a decade? And a chance to support a company doing incredible good for the environment and climate change?  Ultimately...

I did it.  Some things are worth more than cutting a little bit of time off of my retirement timeline.  Like occasionally supporting good companies, decreasing my carbon footprint, and the most utterly absurd and wonderful car I could ever imagine.  I don't regret it (though I'll definitely look to the used electric car market in the future, once enough time has passed for that to be a thing.)

TL;DR:  Young adult starts saving for a Tesla early in his career and happens to stumble into FI circles.

I’ve never missed a single payment but I’m getting increasingly worried since I’ll likely have my PhD in the next year and the chances of finding a job in my field are slim. My living stipend is 2400 monthly.

My total debt (student loan + CC debt + one personal loan) is close to 21,000 (21k). The credit card debt is about 14k of that.

There is a chance I won’t have funding this summer and will have to take out enough student loans to live for three months. So I want to knock at as much CC debt as possible before then. 

I’m familiar with both avalanche and snowball methods, but it’s giving me a dang HEADACHE figuring out what to throw at credit cards each month. My personal loan has a WHOPPING 25% interest rate and is about 30% paid off.

I guess I’m struggling when interest hits (at different times for different cards/accounts) and throws off everything I’ve calculated. Maybe I’m stupid with numbers but it’s so hard for me to figure out how to allocate my money after I pay rent. 

Sorry if this is not allowed, new to the sub. But I’m at my wit’s end. All I want is a solid career and income (hence why I’m in grad school now), a nice house (nothing flashy or huge), and a family. But my partner is even worse off financially, 90k student loans + ~25k cc debt. And he can’t have a conversation with me about money without getting defensive and shutting down (he’s also an academic facing a bleak job market). For him the only possible solution to our money problems is getting a real job and making real money after graduating, and he is completely unwilling to make changes (like stop using his credit cards) while he’s a student. FYI We keep our finances separate for now but don’t want to forever.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Advice--Balance Transfer vs Personal Loan vs Other?,"Hello all!

Hoping for some debt advice:

Background: I'm a late 20s/early 30s resident physician currently in residency (with about 2 years left before I finish) making about $60,000/year. I've been struggling with paying back debt I accrued during medical school/beginning of residency to help out my parents when my dad lost his job and couldn't find another one for over 1.5 years (very very complicated family situation, essentially I'm the only adult in their lives left and they lean on me heavily financially). 

Debts: 

* Roughly $140,000 in federal student loan debt (at about 6% interest; payments are currently deferred through the end of the year. I'm currently holding off on worrying about this debt until I graduate from residency as my income will increase anywhere from 4-5x what it is now and I should be able to tackle them aggressively then) 
* About $12,000 in private student loan debt ($6000 loan through my undergrad at 5% interest; another $6000 loan through Discover at about 7% interest. I aim to tackle these next in my debt journey, but for now I'm paying the minimums so I can focus on my credit card debt)
* $7182 in credit card debt (down from $14,600) total. My main credit card (Chase Sapphire) has a balance of $5782 at 20.99% interest (!!!) because I was able to move $1400 to a different credit card I already had that offered a temporary 0% interest balance transfer for 12 months (unfortunately the limit for this secondary card was $1500 and the transfer fee was about $100). 

My Credit Score is about 695. I've been making payments of anywhere between $500-1000 monthly towards my CC debt but the interest is killing me.  

My Question: 

I've been trying to pay the debt down as diligently as I can but I've really been getting discouraged by the interest. I've been thinking about applying for a balance transfer card with 0% interest promo period (I've been looking at the Citi Diamond Preferred Card in particular) but I'm worried that: 

1) I won't get approved given my middling credit score + salary and will then get a hard inquiry on my credit that will further lower my score and

 2) that if I do get approved, the credit limit will be too little to be worth the hassle/hard pull on my credit  (hoping to get approved for \~$5000 at least) 

Other alternatives I've considered would be a personal loan (though the interest rates on a personal loan would still probably be in low double digits given my credit score) OR I've heard of people calling their bank and asking for a temporary pause in interest charges in exchange for payment of debt in that time period and no use of the card in that time period. Has anyone done this before? Has it worked?

personalfinance,Using a securities loan to pay taxes,"As a business liquidation event nears, I’m starting to plan how I might handle the taxes I will inevitably incur.

One thought I had was to take the money and place it into a portfolio. Then use a securities loan at a 1.5-2% interest rate to pay the capital gains taxes.

This approach (albeit with risks) would allow me to keep the entire pre-tax amount invested in the market. Ideally, I’d be able to beat the margin spread and overtime pay off the loan.

Does this seem reasonable? Completely stupid? Other ideas?",finance

personalfinance,Heavy Rate on a 20k Car Finance Loan (15.9%) - What options do I have?,"I bought a certified 2018 honda accord LX - (dealer owned as a courtesy car previously, 3k miles on odometer, 7 years bumper to bumper warranty) on finance around the start of the year to replace my old 2008 Subaru Outback which was in need of Head Gasket replacement and I did not have the cash on hand or financing options to pay the $2.5k that the work required, plus the valuation that CarMax gave me for the Subaru itself was only $2k. So I decided it would make more sense to get somethin newer.

At the time my credit score was not the best as I have only about 1 year of loans/finances/etc against my credit report due to the fact I moved to the USA 4 years ago from the UK. However I have had good cash flow since moving here so I was not too concerned about the interest rate as I am in Washington State and there are very small fees for early payoffs. So my plan was to pay the car off within the year.

Now I've run into the issue with COVID and I am currently unemployed - I have just enough unemployment income to pay rent, bills and the minimum payment for the auto finance. And I now have the issue of the large interest rate on my auto finance that I do not know of suitable options to refinance due to only being on unemployment insurance.

Do I have any options right this minute other than a sudden windfall of cash to resolve my issue and to relieve myself of this huge interest rate?

My current financial situation:  
In:  
$480/week from unemployment after tax  
Out:  
$1060 rent per month  
$557 minimum payments per month on the car (only finance I have currently)  
$200 on bills per month (internet/electric/phone)  
$300\~ on groceries per month. (My Food / Essentials / Cat Food / Cat Litter )

CryptoCurrency,We are on the cusp of some serious breakthroughs in crypto,"I just want everyone to know how insanely excited I am about the progress crypto as a whole has made since the 2017 bull market.  The fundamentals are 10x better now than back then.  All this is happening while the legacy FIAT system is cannibalizing itself from greedy policy-makers increasing the divide between the rich and poor. 

\*

While the legacy system interest rates are kept artificially low, the free-markets in crypto are seeing interest rates of 10+% on stablecoins like USDC. Demand for stablecoins is absolutely exploding to take advantage of this.  It's important to understand the role stablecoins will play in all of this and usher in new money into this industry. Why hold FIAT?

\*

Real usecases have emerged that are simply more efficient than the legacy systems. DEFI, NFT's, asset tokenization, etc. Eventually the more efficient systems win, it can be delayed, but not avoided.

\*

All this is happening while Bitcoin's fundamentals are getting better and better.  There are many ways buying Bitcoin can now produce yields without selling, the hashrate has gone up 10x since 2017, and the institutions are starting to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet.

Bitcoin,"The greatest wealth transfer of this century! An analysis: British-US-Chinese Empires: Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum!","**""Inflation makes you pay 50 dollars for the 20 dollar haircut you used to get for 5 dollars when you had hair!""**

Let's embark on a journey that made the United States the number 1 economy of the world.

#### 1.  Despite the British Empire's claim that it would for ever remain the  leading empire,history can serve as a harbinger for what's to come...

At  the peak of its power, in 1913, ""the empire on which the sun never  sets"", controlled 25% of the planet's land mass and about the same  percentage of the world's population. Britain was both the naval an  imperial power of the 19th century, and between 1812-1914, its dominance  resulted in relative peace in Europe and the rest of the world. The  industrial revolution transformed Britain into the workshop of the  world.

By the start of the 20th century things changed as both  Germany and the United States started to challenge Britain's economic  and influential leadership. As often happened during human history such  challenging lead to war and although Britain achieved its largest  territorial influence after WW1, the war had destroyed much of its  economic strength, with losses in industrial and military power marking  the begin of its demise.

During WW2, Japan occupied Britain's  colonies, and after WW2, India, Britain's most valuable and populous  possession, achieved independence. Much of the British Empire's  influence is now enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter, stating shared  values like democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

The  United Kingdom's pound sterling was its world's reserve currency during  its reign and by controlling the supply of money, Britain was able to  influence its global power.

**""Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!""** *Mayer Amschel Rothschild*  


#### 2. The US Empire repeats this blueprint by claiming the U.S. Dollar's reserve currency status as its birthright!

**The Federal Reserve Act.**

The  Panic of 1907 triggered many American's belief that The Federal Reserve  Act, passed by the 63rd United States Congress and signed into law by  President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913, was necessary for  financial and economic stability. The law created the Federal Reserve  System, the central banking system of the United States.

**The Bretton Woods System.**

The  FED ended immobile reserve issues and the inelastic currency problems  and successfully internationalized the U.S Dollar as the global reserve  currency. The usage of the prior nationally used U.S. Dollar expanded a  first time when the Allies agreed to the terms of the Bretton Woods  System, establishing the rules for commercial as well as financial  regulations among the United States and its allies. Canada, Western  Europe, Australia and Japan accepted the U.S. Dollar, which was backed  by a gold exchange standard, making the U.S. Dollar ""as good as gold"".  This was only possible because the United States controlled two thirds  of the world's gold reserves.

Soviet representatives, who claimed  that institutions like the IMF and the International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were Wall Street branches, didn't  participate in Bretton Woods and later proved to be right, as the United  States printed too much money (not backed by its gold reserves) to wage  war on Vietnam, destroying a big part of the value of the U.S. Dollars  held by its allies, due to the inflation of the U.S. Dollar money  supply.

Yet, the initial demand for U.S. dollars created the  American way of life: a consumer driven economy fueled by products made  outside the U.S. in return for U.S. Dollars. As the Allied countries  couldn't really buy any ""Made in America""-products, due to the fact that  the United States' elites rather outsourced their manufacturing, they  instead invested their hard labor into U.S. Treasuries.

On August  1971, President Richard Nixon announced the unilateral cancellation of  the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to  gold, in a response to halt the Allied countries' continuous attempts to  exchange their U.S. Dollars for Gold. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system  was replaced by the current freely floating fiat currency system.

**The petro dollar system.**

The  second wave of U.S. Dollar adoption was the result of the petro dollar,  making the global trade of oil U.S. Dollar denominated. Every country  on this planet needed and still needs oil to operate and grow its  economy, creating an enormous growth in U.S. Dollar demand and like  mentioned before, those dollars had to be earned. Especially China  served the United States consumer model by producing almost everything  Americans can buy in Wall Mart and other stores. By relying on the U.S.  Dollar reserve currency status, the American elites have made the  mistake of outsourcing manufacturing to China, as often predicted by  Donald Trump in the 1980's. The y figured it was easier to just print  wealth.

**The tradewar.**

President Donald  Trump, decided it was time to bring jobs back to the U.S. and started an  ongoing trade war with China, the country that supplied the U.S.  consumer driven economy, and proud owner of $1.07 trillion in Treasury  holdings. The trade war has negatively impacted the economies of both  the United States and China and will most likely result in the  decoupling of both economies.

**What is to come? My personal insights.**

I  see huge problems for the U.S. and the rest of the western liberal  democracies. But especially the United States, who's currency amounts to  no less than 60% of all the world's reserve assets, is vulnerable if  and when China who only accounts for 1 or 2 %, says it is time for  change. Most likely we will experience another banking crisis, with or  without Covid-19, and unfortunately a bigger one when compared to the  2008 dissaster. Did you know that the global debt tripled since then?  Many economists and politicians advocate the end of the U.S. Dollar  reserve currency system and predict a reset. Every financial system has a  limited lifespan similar to a human live: it is created, it grows, it  matures, and unfortunately, it ages, weakens and dies. It happened to  the Brittish Pound Sterling, and I am afraid that the days of this  financial hegemony are numbered as well.

**And I did write ""afraid"", why?**

History  tells us that these transition periods are particularly dangerous and  have often led to full-blown military conflicts if not world wars. The  current wealth transfer, the result of manufacturing outsourcing to  mainland China, impoverished the United States and destroyed its middle  class. President Donald Trump's analysis that the U.S. needs a strong  manufacturing base is correct, yet without its allies the United States  will not be able to turn the tide.

It took China decades to build  its manufacturing base, and President Trump doesn't have the privilege  of having the political luxury to design five year plans, as the United  States capitalistic and political model specializes more on presidential  campaigning and less on economic planning, which is exactly China's  strength.

#### 3. The Chinese 'digital' empire.

China  is ideally positioned to become the new global power: it produces many  of our products and dominates most supply chains. It has been hoarding  gold and mines most of the Bitcoin. It might just have the right reserve  assets to back its DCEP, the digital Yuan, which will be pilot tested  during the 2022 Winter Olympics hosted by China. Despite the fact that  the United States and other western nations might not want to adopt the  Yuan or allow it to be part of the world's reserve assets, China can  demand payment in Yuan for its products. It's that simple! This is why  outsourcing is such as stupid economic voluntarily yet fatal policy. If  you only print money and don't produce goods, how long will the world  play ball?

One of the results of Trump's trade war is that China  and other countries such as Russia and Iran no longer want to be  vulnerable to U.S. sanctions that come in the shape of being denied  access to the financial system through Swift. The United States can  indeed destroy a big part of Iran's economy, but Iran is now becoming a  big cryptocurrency player. In other words, bullying those countries  might work in the short-term, but in the long-term they will simply  adopt a new standard: and I believe that the Yuan will likely play a  major role in the financial system they will adopt.

This trend  means that the expansion of the demand in U.S. Dollars will stop and  reverse, when countries no longer want to use the currency whose issuer  can economically destroy them through sanctions. The alternatives for  such countires are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many  others, national CBDC's (Central Bank Digital Currencies), and the  adoption of the digital Yuan.

This digital Yuan will be attached  to the One Belt, One road initiative, finding adoption whilst developing  huge infrastructure projects that will lead to a Eurasian trading zone.  If the U.S. Military leaves the Middle East, as Trump brings home  troops, this will create the right conditions for China to emerge as the  victor.

#### 4. Surveillance Capitalism - Insights on the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment, DC/EP):

1.  This centralized digital financial system works on blockchain and  cryptographic principles and aims to increase the circulation of the  RMB, in the hope it can become a reserve currency like the U.S. Dollar.

2. Created and sanctioned by the Chinese Government, it is the only legal digital currency in China.

3.  The system offers Chinese regulators better monitoring abilities and  will be an efficient tool against anonymous counterfeiting, money  laundering and illegal financing. At the same time it reduces costs  involved in maintaining and recycling bank notes and coins.

4. As  mentioned above, China aims to bypass Swift, which it regards to be a  U.S. entity, and will be able to collect real-time data related to money  creation, bookkeeping, essential information for the implementation of  monetary policies.

5. The pilot institutions for DCEP, China  Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will serve as a production test  for China's new currency system, after which the DCEP will be  distributed to large fintech companies such as Tencent and Alibaba to be  used in WeChat Pay and AliPay. Transfers will not go through bank  accounts, but through electronic wallets.

6. By mandating that  all merchants who accept digital payments must accept DCEP, the DECP  will become the most accepted digital currency in the world.

#### 5. Sings of hope.

If  the United States adopts blockchain and issues a CBDC (Central Bank  Digital Currency) backed by Bitcoin, they will have a reasonable chance  to offer the western democracies a new type of dollar standard that can  be an anchor versus the coming RMB. If not, I fear the worst is yet to  come for the U.S. Dollar and its economy.

Many smart American  economists and Wall Street goeroe's have finally figured out the  remarkable strength of Bitcoin, the world's first and most favorite  digital form of gold.

Some of the smartest investment capitalists  like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffet have allocated more money into gold, a  clear sign of trouble. Bitcoin might be a step too far for Warren  Buffet, but rest assure that Wall Street investment management companies  have figured it out by now, have you?

You can expect more  institutions to allocate a % of their portfolio's wealth into Bitcoin  and other cryptocurrencies, as a hedge against the systemic risk in our  global financial system, which will inevitable start feeling the effects  of the trillions that have been printed.

personalfinance,30 y/o figuring out what to do with savings/extra income,"Hey there! I've been working for the past six months or so to try to get my finances in better order. The resources here (wiki, reading posts) have been very helpful, and now I feel like I've reached a point where I've got to ask for some direct advice for how to proceed. I know this kind of a lot and contains a couple of different types of questions - any help is much appreciated.  


More info below, but most simply: **I've got money just sitting in a savings account, it continues to grow, and I want to do something better with it.**  


My situation:  
* Own my home. Mortgage is ~140k at this point, interest 3.6%. I have been making quarterly extra payments of $1700 on the principal.  
* Maxed out Roth IRA for 2019 and 2020, planning to continue to do so. No 401(k) through my employer. Not eligible for HSA.
* 50k in savings. ~16k is my 12-month emergency fund. It's all sitting in a ""high-yield"" savings account that feels like a waste, particularly with rates now.  
* No big expenses coming up.  


So I'm trying to figure out what to do both with 1) the money that I already have in savings as well as 2) the additional money I'm saving every month. Because my interest rate is relatively low, I am wondering if should be investing it rather than making extra payments to the principal. I should also say that I'm fairly risk averse, and would like to err on the more conservative side.


Should I put the savings I have into a..... target date 2025 index fund, which would be on the more conservative side of investing? Should I be throwing everything at my mortgage, even though it would be a lower return? In any case, just sitting on it as I am currently doing seems like the worst option.",finance

MachineLearning,[Project] Troubles Training a Region Proposal Network with a Resnet-101 Backbone,"Training Problems for a RPN

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to train a network for \*region proposals\* as in the anchor box-concept

from \*Faster R-CNN\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I am using a pretrained \*Resnet 101\* backbone with three layers popped off. The popped off

layers are the \`conv5\_x layer, average pooling layer\`, and \`softmax layer\`.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result my convolutional feature map fed to the RPN heads for images

of size 600\*600 results is of spatial resolution 37 by 37 with 1024 channels.

&amp;#x200B;

I have set the gradients of only block conv4\_x to be trainable.

From there I am using the torchvision.models.detection rpn code to use the

rpn.AnchorGenerator, rpn.RPNHead, and ultimately rpn.RegionProposalNetwork classes.

There are two losses that are returned by the call to forward, the objectness loss,

and the regression loss.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The issue I am having is that my model is training very, very slowly. In Girschick's original paper he says he trains over 80K minibatches (roughly 8 epochs since the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has about 11000 images), where each mini batch is a single image with 256 anchor boxes, but my network from epoch to epoch improves its loss VERY SLOWLY, and I am training for 30 + epochs.

&amp;#x200B;

My code can be viewed at this pytorch discussion link here:

[https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/training-a-region-proposal-network-with-a-resnet-101-backbone/98144](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/training-a-region-proposal-network-with-a-resnet-101-backbone/98144)

\`

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering trying the following ideas to fix the network training very slowly:

\- trying various learning rates (although I have already tried 0.01, 0.001, 0.003 with similar results

\- various batch sizes (so far the best results have been batches of 4 (4 images \* 256 anchors per image)

\- freezing more/less layers of the Resnet-101 backbone

\- using a different optimizer altogether

\- different weightings of the loss function

&amp;#x200B;

Any hints or things obviously wrong with my approach MUCH APPRECIATED. I would be happy to give any more information to anyone who can help.",technology

personalfinance,Need help in deciding whether to purchase a house,"Hello All,

Here is my situation. In the US on a work visa since 2014, visa valid till 2023, Green card in process, but have a very long wait time ( 50-100 years, yay country specific immigration limits).

Salary &gt; 100000

Spouse salary &gt; 70000 (started in May)

&amp;#x200B;

Spouse has been insisting for more than a year to buy a house instead of renting a townhouse currently at $1250, utilities( add $400 for elec,gas, internet, water, etc on average)

We do not follow a zero based budget, but have been living pretty comfortably in the midwest, and increase our savings and retirement accounts by around a $1000 each month.

We seriously started looking at houses and got preapproved on Aug 31. Placed an offer on one 2003 build 2bed condo for 270k, seller asks 285k, we did not budge since it was overpriced and on the market for 10 months. still has not sold. Seller declined.

Placed an offer on a 3bed 1997 single family home for $330k 3 days later, and was accepted, but i freaked out, as they had 3 offers at the same price(asking was $330k), and they selected ours, since others had placed conditions( we did not place any conditions, as our realtor said that is the best way to go forward in this ""hot sellers market""). I slept on it, and told the realtor i did not want to go forward ( had not paid any escrow money yet), and essentially fired her, as in stopped all communication, and completely freaked out about the home buying process.

&amp;#x200B;

Wife stopped asking for a week, then started looking into new home builds instead. Looked at 10+ communities by 3-4 builders ( some major, some small), under the $400000 price range. Looking at the options we wanted, home prices went upto $430000 (lot prices are a complete scam IMO). Still waiting on design center to snatch another $40-$50K from my cold dead hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the calculated monthly cost, came to around $2600 with 10% down. I checked the NYT rent vs buy calculator, and it essentially said, makes sense to buy if you stay for more than 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the job market with COVID, not sure if my job would still be available,  and I do not know if i will be allowed to stay in the country or will have to return.

My spouse is fed up of me taking so long to decide, and it is starting to affect her mental health.

Here is my question, if you want to answer it?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I buy a $430,000 house for the sake of my sanity?
2. Should I continue to rent, and if yes, what should change for me to purchase a house?

personalfinance,Paying student loans early..?,"I was reading this [article](https://www.moneyunder30.com/should-you-pay-off-student-loans-early) about paying student loans early and it mentions that paying them early doesn't always offer the best return. 

I'm 23, and just recently graduated college. I have a job with a base salary of 80k. I didn't rack up much student loan debt because I went to community college for 2 years before transferring to a 4 year university, and worked all throughout college. In total I have amassed $13,000.00 in student loan debt. I don't have any credit card debt and very small monthly expenses. My question to you, r/personalfinance, is should

 A) I be aggressive toward my student loan debt and just pay it off during my grace period (6-month grace period with no interest) and just get rid of them (I hate having any kind of debt) or 

B) Pay them off through the standard repayment plan that I currently have over a 10 year period. All of the loans are subsidized and have a sub 5% interest rate. 

With option A, I would be debt-free and not have that weight on my shoulders.

With option B, I guess one of the benefits would be to instead throw that money into saving or investments to get a better return off my money.

We're being offered Traditional or Roth, and the company will match either. They will match up to 4% if we put in 5%, so that's what I'm planning for now.

I am 30 years old and make around $45k/year and already have a Roth and SEP IRA with Vanguard ($18k / $14k respectively) that are both set to the 2055 targeted fund. I max out the Roth every year, and the SEP is no longer offered where I work so that will just sit as-is.

**AGGRESSIVE GROWTH**  
* DFA International Value - 0.39%

personalfinance,25 &amp; 85k/month financial advice,"First off, thanks for taking the time to read.

I just received a promotion which has increased my income by 35k. I live in Alabama, so after state/federal withholdings I will be taking home 4,800 a month.

I have had terrible financial decisions up until this point, but I've always been spectacular in my career field. I work extremely long hours which leads to me being dumb and spontaneous spending on my days off, which has left me saving nothing at all, but I want to change this My terrible decisions include terrible credit : 12k in student loans, 1k owed to a bank, 2 repos....so my credit is currently worthless. I have a car paying 300/m (since my credit is so bad I'm paying ridiculous interest) that I have 2 years left on paying it off and around 100/m for insurance. Outside of that I have no living expenses besides rent and utilities and food which total around 1100/m. So each month I'll be left with around 3,300 and I really want to start being smart with money and turn my financial situation around.

A few goals of mine include being able to pay for my future children's college, and of course having a great retirement/ savings.

My current company offers a 401k for my new position, which I think will be the start of my savings. Outside of that, in the past I've used apps like robinhood (online stock trading) and just put 100/m out of my paycheck every 2 weeks to make myself save something at least.

I hope these are enough details for an accurate judgment of my situation. If you have any budgeting/saving plan/advice or even books to read I'd greatly appreciate it. The one thing I fear is just blowing all the extra money I will be taking in which is why I'm posting here and doing some research along with this.

Is there any conventional wisdom for holding the loan and not making payments for a while? My next payment is due December 2023.

vet,"My cat died and the vet doesn't know why, I'm trying to understand what could have happened","Sorry this is long. I want to include as much detail as possible in case any of it is relevant:

TL;DR: She was only 6. She started making strange mouth (gagging?) noises one evening. Two trips to emergency vet. Her body gradually shut down overnight until she stopped breathing the next morning. Vet says it looks neurological but I'm unconvinced. Could it have been poison, or even possibly holding poop too long?

I'm going to try to just lay this out in chronological order. Her name was Mia. I got her in December of last year. She was about 6 at the time. Russian blue, pretty playful and active. I fed her only dry food, the same as the previous owner I adopted her from. She was a pretty good weight, she seemed to self-regulate eating, just eating as much as she wanted then stopping. I lived in a small studio in San Francisco.

She seemed pretty normal and healthy. She used the litter box without problems, I never noticed anything unusual. She would throw up maybe once every 2-3 months, but she was always fine after so I never looked into it.

One thing that really bothered me after she died: I accidentally hit her in the head a few times, once while playing, once while just waving my arms and I didn't see her. She also bumped it jumping into a glass door she didn't see. I was also scared so I would look at her closely afterwards but she also seemed fine. These events were mostly a number of months before she died.

In the last few months I noticed her chewing more, she would spend a lot of time chewing the metal cord of a toy (not electric, just a cord). Sometimes she would chew plastic bags. Not for too long, so I didn't worry much.

Here's where things get a little more suspicious. 1.5 weeks before she died, we moved, just about a mile away. She seemed to get comfortable in the new place overall, except for this: she didn't seem to want to eat as much. I'm trying to remember and I really think that started with the move.

The other issue was she didn't seem to want to poop without me there. The litter box was in the kitchen and I was usually in the main room. I noticed that a few days would go by without her pooping, and I guessed that she didn't like going into the kitchen. So I tested the theory: I brought the litter box into the main room where I could see it and within minutes she pooped. So I assumed I was right and figured I'd just make her get used to using it in the kitchen.

Four days before, I got a plant called a cat palm. She immediately went and started not just chewing it but I think eating it. I looked it up and it seems non-toxic to cats. Given the time delay and that I saw some of the leaves in her last poop, I assume the plant wasn't the issue.

So, now the day of: It's again been a few days since she pooped, she doesn't seem to want to use it in the kitchen. I don't know if it's because she doesn't like the kitchen or if she doesn't feel comfortable without me there. At about 5 PM I sit down on the kitchen floor to work. Again, within a few minutes, she poops, looking kind of uncomfortable while doing it, maybe because it's been a few days. As far as I can tell, that's right when she started to look bad.

She seems less energetic, and most concerning she starts making this noise with her mouth that is hard to describe but sounds a lot to me like something is stuck in her throat. I actually tried a little kitty Heimlich and also holding her upside don't and patting her back. She would do it once every few minutes, so I decided to wait a little bit to see if she'd just come back to normal. When she didn't stop and continued to look tired and sluggish, I took her to the vet, around 8 I think.

The vet said she looked fine, that she was stressed and hissing, but energetic. That sounds like her, she had a somewhat anxious demeanor I think. They said there didn't seem to be anything in her throat, and they didn't hear her make a noise. So I took her back. As soon as we got back, around 9 or 10, it was obvious something was wrong. She seemed like she barely knew I was there, eventually she kind of slumped down and I lifted her onto her feet and she just slumped down again.

So I took her back. This time they could tell something was wrong, and they heard her make the noise, which the vet described as ""gagging."" I left her there. An hour later, the vet called, still not doing well, and they mentioned she had very high blood sugar. I had no reason to think she was diabetic. The vet said a diabetic cat would seem to drink a lot and pee a lot, which she never did. They said she seemed very hydrated which was not consistent with diabetes. This symptom so far is totally unexplained.

The next morning they called and said she had lost consciousness. By the time I got there, she was on a respirator. So that was it. They say putting the respirator in they could confirm there was nothing in her throat.

It wasn't rabies.

They were pretty confounded, but said it looked like it could be a stroke or an aneurism. Neither of those make sense to me, because I would expect those to happen more suddenly and these symptoms don't seem neurological. Basically, it seems to me like it must either be poison, or I imagine she ruptured something internally from not pooping for a long time, each of which seems like it would lead to a slow decline like this. I don't know if the latter is a thing that could happen.

It seems too coincidental that I just moved and these other irregularities happened. I'm concerned something at my place poisoned her, but I can't think of what that could be, and I didn't see her go anywhere or eat anything weird, and of course I was home most of the time.

Thanks for reading if you did. I understand there's no way to know what happened, so I mainly want to know if she could have actually died from refusing to poop, and also how likely it is that she was exposed to some poison at my new place (I've been here over 2 months now and I haven't noticed anything weird happening to me.)",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Why do my refinance closing costs include a 20% down payment?,"Hi everyone, I'm really looking for some information as to if this is a normal thing.

Here's the background, I want to refinance my home mortgage because interest rates are low as hell right now. After weeks of getting the documents ready, I'm under the impression from the agent that the closing costs are only going to be in the $3000 - 4000 range because of what he said. 

On top of this, it looks like the refinanced loan amount is only 80% of my current mortgage left over and that leaves a whopping 20% left over for ""Estimated cash to close"" closing costs. So, the closing costs are nowhere near what was initially said and also easily 20x that amount.

personalfinance,Wife and I unable to get preapproved for mortgage while student loans in forbearance. What are our options?,"My wife and I are first time homebuyers trying to get preapproved for a mortgage outside a major city in the US.

We both have around 270k in federal student debt. We are both in public service, on Income Driven Repayment Plans, and working towards the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program. Right now, our loans are in forbearance through December (through the relief bill passed by Congress earlier in the year), and each month counts toward PSLF (a benefit we are very thankful for).

We have approached three lenders at this point looking to get preapproved for a modest mortgage in the area we are living in (around 500k).

Because our monthly repayment is currently at $0 while we are in forbearance, lenders have told us that they must use 1-1.5% of our total student dept to estimate our monthly expenses as part of the pre-approval process.

Because this estimate comes out to between $2,700 to $4,350 a month, instead of the ~$700 we pay (combined) through our repayment plans, we have been turned down by all three lenders, and they have told us that we should reapply once we are out of forbearance and a few months back in repayment (around March or April 2021).

Are people with high loans in forbearance right now in similar situations? Is there some workaround to this that would allow a lender to us a more accurate estimate of our payments, rather than use the 1-1.5% convention?

Thanks all.",finance

personalfinance,To refi or not to refi?,"So my wife and I were planning on buying our first house in the second quarter of 2021 (when our current lease ends). We’ve been working on this for quite some time as we’ve had terrible credit for years - mostly due to medical bills, but also because of some bad credit card decisions. My wife is basically the sole income (I work two days a week now, but my main job is a SAHD), so we’ve only been working on her credit (also because I have 6-figure student loan debt...).

Early in 2019 we had to buy a “new” car because our only vehicle got flooded. At the time her credit was poor so we have what I’m assuming is a crummy interest rate through Carvana. Now she has good credit (just over 700), but it’s very much still a work in progress.

We got an offer from our bank to refinance the loan to a lower rate, which would lower our monthly payment by ~$100 (USD), but we’re not sure if the savings is worth hurting our length of credit history. Any advice would be appreciated!

personalfinance,"Want to increase 401k contributions, but need to increase W4 tax witholding as well","asking for my partner; 

He found out that his W4 was not filled out correctly and he is about $4000 behind on federal tax witholding for the year (source: https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator ). There's about 6 paychecks left in the year, meaning he has to tack on an extra ~$550/paycheck in federal taxes to try and catch up otherwise he will owe it all when he files taxes. That is on top of the increased tax rate he is going to owe; we arent really sure what the total tax burden on his paycheck is going to be now, he used to pay only ~$350 in federal taxes per paycheck on a $100k salary.

At the same time, he wants to try and increase his 401k contributions. His 401k is way behind because he never knew it existed until this year. So he is trying to catch up, and did a 10% paycheck contribution all year for about $350/paycheck for ~$6000 total contributions for the year. He is getting full employer contributions regardless (they give flat-rate % salary contributions to all employees). 

The problem now is that he doesn't know how much of a 401k contribution increase, if any, he can afford. 

I have been working with him to set up a budget with YNAB, he has enough liquid cash for the standard 6 month emergency fund, and enough remaining cash to cover normal expenses. However, he is also used to getting a $2600 biweekly paycheck due to his tax under-witholding; I am doing some ballpark math and we think it might drop as low as $1600 biweekly for the rest of the year just due to the tax increases. Some lifestyle re-evaluation is definitely gonna be required to adapt to this lower net pay, but neither of us is sure just how to fit in the desired 401k contribution increases into all this.

Using the twitter API is an option but there's not nearly as much ""political material"" to work with as in the US for instance, and the main language of my country is not English, so sentiment prediction/analysis is not really an option.

investing,Barclays says the end of the city is an urban myth,"""**Property prices have risen across the US during the pandemic and, contrary to popular perception, they have risen in each of rural, suburban, AND urban areas**. Despite widely reported speculation about a collapse in demand for urban living (likely spurred by the outsized attention given to New York City and San Francisco), our data suggests that people left urban areas, but at a more modest pace than media reports might suggest.""

""**COVID-19 has not caused people’s housing preferences to permanently shift away from the amenities of urban living**. Density aversion is leading to some declines in the biggest cities. But price changes during COVID-19 suggest that people are still willing to pay for urban amenities, placing value on access to restaurants, bars, and cultural institutions found in denser cities – they will just need to find places where they are less impaired by social distancing rules.""

""**We do see more risk of cities underperforming suburbs, a contrast to many years when home price increases in urban areas significantly outpaced those in suburban or rural areas**. While prices are likely to rise all over, urban areas are at risk of losing their long stretch of outperformance over suburbs. More working from home (WFH) in the future, risks around COVID-related closures of urban amenities, and potentially lingering aversion to density are likely to give the suburbs a relative edge in the future, even as both places rise in absolute terms. This could create an incremental demand bump of up to 500,000 new housing units in the US if up to 2% of people permanently relocate out of urban areas.""

""**Of the biggest cities in the US, only New York and San Francisco have seen average price declines during the pandemic**. Most urban areas in the US have benefitted from the same pent-up demand and increase in affordability that has lifted suburbs. And while we would not dismiss the tail risk of a self-reinforcing cycle of falling home prices for New York City or San Francisco, it remains a tail.""

""**We expect the trend of rising home prices in both cities and suburbs to persist even after the pandemic ends, because affordability has improved and should remain elevated for some time**. The collapse in long-term interest rates made mortgages more affordable at the same time that household savings soared as a result of lockdowns and government largesse. Moreover, millennials have reached their peak marriage years, so are entering their peak years for home buying. These should provide a tailwind for both suburban and urban properties.""

""**Multifamily rentals are the most challenged corner of the residential market, with rents at risk due to a potentially “K-shaped” recovery (where higher income workers experience a rebound, but lower income worker remain strained)**. If lower-wage jobs take a long time to reappear, or don’t reappear at all in the places they were before, rents could take a material hit.""

""**In contrast, Single-Family Rental (SFR) appears poised to benefit from the same economic recovery.** SFR customers have similar wealth to home buyers, so they are less likely to face the pressures of multi-family assets. And because their assets gain in value as home prices rise, they should perform well in a general regime of rising prices.""

""**In the UK, trends have been similar to the US, but with perhaps a relatively bigger shift of interest to the suburbs.** The risks are slightly different, however, as housing assets are more exposed to government policy shifts.""

""**In China, there is a growing desire for better housing and better living conditions after COVID-19.** Flexible work arrangement and hygiene awareness have caused local residents to look for better housing, more bedrooms, and second homes.""

""**Student enrollment is falling in the US, creating a risk for security-backed student housing.** However, initial trends are promising and moves to reduce density could offset any reductions in enrollment. In the UK, enrollment trends are the opposite – rising as is typical of recessions.""",finance

Paid off my car, but helping my parents pay theirs at $500 a month (killer, but they are not doing well financially either)

I have about $14K as an emergency/need for when I go to grad school. 

In terms of my job, I was furloughed, but rehired albeit, shorter hours and lost my benefits, so no 401k match, PTO or health ins.

Take home is approx $3200 a month, no real savings or retirement, have $4300 in a money market fund with Vanguard (not sure what to do with it) and maybe $18K in a 401k, but once covid started was not able to contribute. 

I suppose I have several separate questions:

What should I do with the money in my Vanguard and 401k accounts as the Vanguard is currently just sitting in a money market account. Should I convert my 401 into a IRA (won't be able to stay with the company as I will be leaving for school, not sure what my options are)? School is about 3 years, I'm worried since I won't be contributing to the account and not sure if it's the wisest thing to leave it in.

Should I pay off the private school loan ($8,815.83) with the amount I have as an emergency? Hate knowing that it is currently accruing interest, but also realize that an emergency is just that, so I haven't been touching it or pay a portion of it? Federal loan has been 0% up until December, doubt it will continue to stay that way.

I will be looking to take a Grad Plus loan to pay for school (approx $150K) to cover tuition and rent, to become a PA. Starting salary is 90-100 coming out, although with the current state, I have heard of layoffs and lower starting salaries for new grads.

So far, I have driven approximately 15000 miles (essential worker here, so even during COVID shut down, I was driving to work every day).Below are the cost of the purchase, with maintenance and what I would have paid if I went with a comparable ICE car.

Car cost: $51200

EV Federal rebate (no longer valid for Tesla): $3750

Car cost-rebate: $47450

Miles driven: 15000

Maintenance cost : $0

Electricity cost:$0 (will explain below)


This car has an operational range of about 260 miles. My work provides free charging stations so I haven’t paid a cent for electricity. If I charged exclusively at home, I’d have paid the following:

Average watt hour per mile: 275 (over summer and winter)

Total watt hour used: 15000 X 275 = 4125000, or 4125 Kwh

Cost per Kwh based on my location (central MA): $0.16

Total electricity expense: 4125 X 0.16 = Approx $660


Let’s compare this number with the ICE car I was considering (BMW X3)

Cost: Approx $50000

Miles driven: 15000

Average MPG : 27

Gallons consumed: 556

Average cost of premium fuel in MA over the last year: $3.10

Cost of gas:  Approx $1730

Cost savings charging at home: $1070


Cost savings charging at work: $1730


I did not include the cost of oil change for the BMW, which is about $150. Overall, comparing a Tesla with a car that is similar cost does result in savings. However, if you compare the cost of a Model 3 with a Corolla/Civic or even a Camry, the cost savings will not be relevant as these cars are cheaper and provide better MPG with lower fuel and maintenance cost. Also, the cost savings won't matter if you're purchasing a Model S or X, which are significantly more expensive.


EDIT: It seems people are taking issue to the car I was comparing it with. This was purely my use case as I wanted a Tesla but did not want to spend more than $50K, which is the price of a X3. So my only option was a M3. As I mentioned, the cost would be significantly cheaper if I bought a Camry etc",finance

personalfinance,"Bought a car, 22, regret","I’m 22, currently in the US military and like to think I know right from wrong.. most of the time. 

Recently, I traded in a car that I was positive in equity on. No big deal there. The problem arises when I traded a car I was comfortable with payments on to, of course, something I’m not so comfortable paying on. Still not a huge issue as I can afford the payments.

My problem is that with my low income I’ve realized I’m pocketing roughly $500 a month after bills, cars, food, savings- the whole deal. Most people wouldn’t find that as an issue, but where I do is because I drafted up what I could be saving if I was to have a beater A to B car instead of this new vehicle. 

Instead of pocketing $500 a month/ new car. I could be pocketing $1500 a month/ beater car and have some mechanical experience for the more frequent repairs on that vehicle. That’s a difference of over $10,000 a year in savings (which with what I get paid in the military, is a very good amount difference saved). 

I’m looking for advice on what the best option would be. Currently I took a preapproval loan from a military credit union that gave me a higher than I believe deserved APR at 8.49% with a 710 credit score. 

Should I try to refinance the car immediately, and save (car total was 28k) $4,000-6000 total on the vehicle if I was to get a 4-5.5% approved interest rate and look into selling it once positive in equity?

Should I try to look into selling the car even at negative equity and take a personal loan to pay the difference since I will be saving more without it?

Should I hold onto the car for longer (~6-12 months) for a better approval chance at refinancing and go from there?

My unfortunate decisions on getting this new vehicle has hindered what I care much more about and that’s financial freedom in the long run. And I know the sooner you start maximizing your savings the more it’ll help you in the long run. So now I’m stuck trying to figure out how to go about getting into a beater and out of this new car. I’m not in any financial crisis, just not where I’d prefer to be and left myself needing guidance.

personalfinance,How bad is bankruptcy really? Seeking debt recovery advice :),"If I already have poor credit and an outstanding amount of credit card debt, how badly could bankruptcy really affect me?

I was young and stoopid and accrued credit card debt. I've spent the last 6 months realizing my mistakes and changing things, and now I'm faced with moving forward to my goals with over $10k in **credit card debt** (interest rates ranging from 15% to 28%.); but I also have just over $10k in **savings** (thanks to smart budgeting and....changing things). I have been making minimum payments to my 3 credit cards while figuring out what the best course of action is to get out of debt and also move forward with my life where I want to go. I could slog it out and pay off my debts using a combination of my savings and some sort of debt consolidation or other debt recovery method, but **why not just erase the slate and start over with $10k of capital in my pocket now that I’m older and wiser**? My FICO credit score is 602.

I'm planning on moving out to L.A. on my own in the next 6 months and will be pursuing work with TV production companies while making low wage hourly and possibly Uber driving at night in the meantime. What are the biggest drawbacks of filing bankruptcy? Any alternative debt recovery advice would be greatly appreciated! I’m just trying to weigh my options here and make the smart choice.

This sub has been truly amazing in providing me with the good financial advice I never had. I’m very appreciative of all the people who I’ve learned from here on other posts and want to express gratitude in advance for any information here. :)

EDIT: Sorry guys, I completely forgot I posted this and haven't been around the computer. Just caught up and want to say thanks for your input!  The obvious thing to do is use the $10k to pay off the -$10k, but I'm just trying to consider all the options here. I'd rather game the system and have a better life rather than simply hand over all my cash because that's the first answer. Just made the minimum payments one more time but will likely use the avalanche method to use the majority of my money to get rid of most of the debt. Keeping enough around for a savings/moving fund. And use any excess of my budget to pay off the final card. I'm also unemployed due to COVID so income is sparse but what can you do, eh.",finance

We currently have 18k combined savings, and are hoping to have 30-40k by then (including emergency fund). Nice houses in our area are anywhere from 250-350k so that about sets our high end (350) and our expectations for what we can buy. 

We hope to keep 5k in cash for close emergencies after closing, and if we have a mortgage of around 1200-1500, we will still be able to save about 600-800 a month for anything else that comes up.

I was doing some cleaning and found a check for $2,900 that was dated for August 9th, 2019. 

I contacted my banks, the check writers bank, and was basically told to get a new check. The problem is I no longer have a way of contacting the check writer. I was wondering if there was any possible way on Earth to cash this check, I really hate thinking I missed out on nearly 3k because I forgot about it’s existence and didn’t cash it right away.

personalfinance,Would it be too early to look into additional investments?,"Hello PersonalFinance!

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I posted about potentially buying a home even though COVID is a thing. Many users said I was pretty close to being able to buy with confidence while others seemed to think I was a year or two away, all fair assesments!

&amp;#x200B;

Since it it important to the post I will update you all that I did in fact purchase a home back in June. The interests rate were low enough to where I felt ready jumping in. I put down 10% to save some cash reserves since the interest rate is at 3.1% and PMI was baked into my loan. My current monthly payment with escrow is $1300 on a home purchased at 280k. I have since been able to save around 35k cash and feel weird just sitting on it and dont feel all too confident in the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

Income after tax and 401k sits around $4700 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I seek advice. I have given a lot of thought into potentially trying to aquire a duplex as a rental property. I have considered setting up a company to be able to go into the rentals with a partner 50/50. A duplex where we would feel confident on tenants not being an issue in terms of vacancy would cost around 350-500k depending on the property. Total rent would be from 3000 to 4500 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would getting into something like this be too much too soon? I want to get into rental properties while interest rates remain low and as soon as I can because passive income is so important to me and in this case, building equity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know getting a finanacial advisor to set up a porfolio may be about as passive as I can get but I cant help but feel like I can build wealth much faster in real estate given the city I reside in. Any thought are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Dip into savings and efund to take advantage of 0% interest on Student Loans?,"So my wife needs a new/used car here soon before the winter season kicks in. Her current car is on the last leg.

We have about $6,000 in our car fund which we planned to put some of it down on the car purchase and then pay on a loan. We both have good credit, so loan rate shouldn't be too high.. Thinking 2.5-3.5% or so on a $25,000 car. 

We'd gone back and forth on whether to put ANY money down on a car and rather invest it as it'll grow more than the interest will hurt us on the car.

She just quit teaching in May, so she is no longer on the Public student loan forgiveness plan for her $30,000 in student loans. If you dont know, federal studen loan rates are 0% at this moment through the end of 2020, so it is not growing at this time which is fantastic.

Now my thought is.. why not take the car fund money we have, and put that all towards her student loans rather than a car down payment or investment fund. THEN I thought.. hell maybe it's not a bad idea to dip into our other funds (e fund, dog savings, house savings, personal savings, travel savings, etc.) and pull some chunks of money from each of those accounts (we distribute portions of our paychecks to each account and only pay for those items from those accounts as needed).

My thought was maybe we try and put more than the $6k we have in the car fund towards the loans before the end of the year and the interest rates kick back in. Her payments will definitely go up from the $17 a month minimum payments she has now. 

We have about $30,000 liquid in all of our little savings funds, including the efund. We both have solid jobs and dont see any lay offs or furloughs coming in the near future, and $20k or so in our roths collectively that we could pull out if absolutely necessary (worst case of course)

My idea was maybe dip into each account, and pull out a comfortable amount, to put towards these loans. Maybe use 60-80% of each account. We probably cant pull together enough *extra* to pay them off completely... but we could make a serious dent. Is there any reason we shouldn't do this? Or any scenario where we should put that money elsewhere for the time being and not take advantage of the 0% on student loans right now? I personally cant think of any but wanted to ask before we take thousands and shuffle it around.

And once we get our tax refunds back next year, we would put all of that money back into each fund accordingly to bring it back up to speed. We're both young and healthy, no kids. Have a house payment and a small cushion in our bills account just in case something comes up. I do feel we are more discipline financially than our peers as well, so I dont have a fear that we might go overboad or anything.

We have no credit card debt. Just mortgage and student loans (and a future car payment, but none currently) My student loans are at $60k, but I am on the PSLF plan and 3 years in so far. So putting any money towards it I dont feel is advantageous to us financially if its forgiven in 7-8 years. We did just buy our house in June, if that matters. 

Any thoughts or perspectives that i have overlooked would be helpful. I didnt feel this belonged in /r/studentloans as it's more about how to handle our finances in this scenario rather than the ins and outs of student loans themselves. Thanks everyone!",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Mon, Oct 5, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 5, 2020**

Stocks rose Monday, mostly recovering Friday’s losses, as market participants continue to closely monitor developments around the health of President Trump and additional fiscal stimulus. 

Last Friday, Pres. Trump announced that he and the First Lady had contracted COVID-19 and that he was going to Walter Reed Military Medical Center to receive treatment. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley, said Sunday that the President was being treated with steroid dexamethasone (which is typically used in severe cases), remedesivir (broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead (GILD)), and  REGN-COV2 (which is used to alleviate symptoms and reduce viral load developed by Regeneron (REGN)). Since then developments around the President’s health have been mostly positive. About an hour or two before market close, Pres. Trump tweeted that he planned to leave the hospital today at 6:30 p.m. ET. 

Market participants also continue to closely eye updates around the election in light of Pres. Trump’s diagnosis and his inability to continue campaigning in the last few weeks before the election on Nov. 3. A new poll released Sunday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal conducted after last week’s presidential debate, but before news emerged that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, found that former Vice President Joe Biden was leading Trump 53% to 39% nationally among registered voters in the survey.

House Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have committed to keep working together to try and come to an agreement regarding additional fiscal stimulus after last week’s failed meeting. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin met once again, for about an hour, but were again unable to come to a consensus. The pair expects to talk again Tuesday as the White House and Democratic leaders try to craft an elusive second pandemic relief package, Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said in a tweet. While Mnuchin and Pelosi are pushing to come to an agreement, there are still a range of outstanding disagreements between Democrats, Republicans, and White House officials.

Economists and FOMC officials are once again pushing for the passage of additional stimulus. With millions of Americans out of work and small businesses struggling to stay afloat, economists are worried that a lack of additional fiscal stimulus would completely stunt the already slowing US economy. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “Economic scarring is likely to become more apparent in Q4 as more companies finally start to throw in the towel, reporting closures and job cuts. Without additional aid \[fiscal stimulus\], the struggles will become more widespread and evident.”

Put simply, $216 a month will either get me:

* $648 towards my 401k (company adds and matches 4%, thus tripling the net amount contributed)

I realize that the majority will see the title and say ""PAY OFF YOUR DEBT DUMMY"", but this is not as clear cut to me for a couple reasons.

1. I can put 3x the amount in my 401k for the same price, and it's compounding interest
2. Student loan interest rates are 0% until the end of the year
3. I already am putting 1k a month towards my student loans (starting this month, it's been $300/month the last couple months)

personalfinance,Lowball appraisal. What can I do to fight it?,"Hello! Contrary to my username, I do not live in a van (anymore), I live in a house, which I bought several years ago at a 4.65% interest rate and now I want to take advantage of the lower rates plus tap increased home equity @ 80% LTV with a cash-out refi (or just do a HELOC after) given that houses in this area are going up in value.

Bank quoted me 2.75% 30yr fixed refi, sounded good to me, so I went for it.

Appraisal came back at $420k which was literally exactly the same number as the previous appraisal I got during my last refi more than four years ago. Since then I've built a large addition and the market in the area has gone up, so I was expecting significant increase in value. There's no way the house hasn't increased in value.

I called shenanigans with the bank and appraiser and they copped to making a mistake on the acreage of the lot. They said they would correct that, but didn't expect the value to increase much. I haven't gotten the new appraisal back from them yet, but I fear it will only go up by $10k or maybe $20k when I was expecting an appraisal between $500k and $540k based on recent sales of comparable houses in the area.

I found other mistakes in the appraisal as well, some big, some small. For instance, while the square footage is larger than my last appraisal, apparently reflecting the addition, the number is lower than it should be, undercounting the square footage by hundreds of sqft. They also undercounted the rooms.

I feel like they're lowballing me and based on how the conversations have gone so far, I worry they're going to hold their ground. So I'm looking for options. Can I hire the company that did my last appraisal (which went better than this nonsense) and have them do another? Or would the bank not accept a second appraisal from a company I choose? What can someone do in this situation?",finance
personalfinance,Should I finish paying off student loans or string them along to keep my credit score up while looking for a house?,"Over the past few months I've been aggressively paying down my debt ($1500 per month). I was able to pay off my car this last month so now I'm moving all the money I was paying toward my car and putting it towards my student loans. I have just over $6,000 in student loans and only have federal loans left so they are all in deferment right now till December because of COVID. The loans range from 7% to 3% interest with amounts from 2500 the largest to 350 the smallest. The larger loans have higher interest but as of now they are all 0%. At the rate I'm paying them I will make my last payment in March. If I don't make minimum payments during the 0 interest period and then make only  minimum payments then I could probably string it out for another 12-18 months. Any money I don't spend on Student Loan payments will be put into my house fund.

&amp;#x200B;

My main worry is all these loans are pretty old. The oldest one is dated in 2008 when I started borrowing for college and I borrowed a little more each year till 2011 when I graduated. \*\*Will paying off these loans drop my credit score by that much?\*\* My credit score is currently hovering around 775 but I haven't checked it since I paid off my car earlier this month. That loan was a 4 year car loan I was able to pay off in less than 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't my only credit though. I've previously paid off 2 car loans in my name (my first had a co-signer when I was 16) and I currently have 3 credit cards the oldest being from 2008 and the total credit limit being over $20,000 though I've never really come close to that. I buy everything I can with my credit cards and pay them off at the end of every month since some of them give me pretty good rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mostly asking because I'm looking at buying a house around this time next year so I want to get a good deal on the loan. I know interest rates are good right now but I'm currently in California and plan to move to the midwest to be closer to my soon-to-be wife's family (and cheaper houses). We are renting now.

&amp;#x200B;

A few other details: I make 80k/year, my fiance makes 55k/year, both of us are still working as our jobs are largely unaffected by covid and the price range when we start looking at houses is between 200k-250k. Her credit is just under 800 and she is about 1 year into a 5 year car loan with 0.9% paying like 330 a month (yay Toyota-thon) which is our only other debt. We currently have about 35k saved up but are going for 50k minimum with the long goal of 60k. Both of our parents have expressed interest in helping us on our first house.",finance

personalfinance,Dumb or smart to refinance? Low LTV,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I own a house with my girlfriend and we're parting ways soon. We've owned the house for 1.5 years.

Original loan was for $157,000 @ 4.25%. The house appraised at $174,000 when we purchased it. Currently owe $153,000.

We put in new carpet, remodeled 2 rooms and the garage so it should (hopefully) appraise for more.

I plan on keeping the house and putting it into my name and since rates are low and one of us will no longer be on the deed refinancing could be a good option?

The mortgage broker we used when we bought the house presented a poor man's cash out refinance which would roll closing costs and initial escrow into the loan value bringing it up to $162,000. Closing costs are $4000, initial escrow is $5000.

Rate is 2.75%.

The way I see it is the total cost of the loan will be $38,000 cheaper over 30 years due to the different interest rates. On the flip side, I run more of a risk being upside down in the loan if real estate drops.

This also comes with a $400/mo less house payment (escrow shortage last year... Long story). Honestly, it'd help me out quite a bit.

personalfinance,Advice for 15 y/o and his 19 y/o guardian on debt,"Hi, 
my brother is my guardian ever since my mother died. We have no clue about finances. My brother had to take up some debt last year,
one loan of 40.000 at 1.75% interest p.a.; monthly payment is 750.
another loan of 20.000 interest-free from a relative, monthly payment is also 750.

We are about to get a large sum of money (inheritance from our mother) after we litigated against a relative for it. It's about 80.000. We don't have anything else to our name (except maybe a flat where our grandma has the right to live in until she dies and is basically worthless).

My brother wants to pay back all of our debt immediately. I've been telling him not to because I think it's smarter for us to keep paying back our debt on a per-month basis. I cannot really justify why I think that way because as I said, I am financially illiterate and no amount of Googling helped me out. But I think that I read somewhere that as long as inflation is higher than the interest rate for debt, one should stay in debt.

Why am I writing all of this?
Because I'd like to know if you recommend paying off both of our loans immediately. I'd be very grateful if you could explain your reasoning.
Thank you in advance. Also please excuse any mistakes (corrections are appreciated).",finance
personalfinance,Buying another house before selling current one. Mortgage questions.,"Sorry if this is not the right place for this. Found the perfect house for my unexpectedly growing family. The current house doesn't have enough room. Our house is currently listed for sale for a couple of days now and has been seen by a few people but no offers. It is worth noting that where I live is an extremely hot sellers market due to COVID and the adjacent city. Ideally we need the money from the current house to make a 20% down payment on the new house but we are afraid it may take too long and miss out on the new house. I have a 401k that we can loan against but that will only give us 5% down so we would have to pay a higher interest and PMI. We would pay back the loan with the money from the purchased house. We would also pay what remains of the 20%(5% down so \~15%) to remove the PMI. Questions. (A) Would we still be stuck with the high interest rate? (B) if we did a refinance after the sale of the current house would we have to wait 6 months and would we have to pay for closing costs again?  (C) is this a bad idea because we may be stuck paying the mortgage for 2 houses? Any other ideas? Credit is good if that matters and no other capital to really work with. Its OK to tell me to wait and it will cost too much in the long run just need some verification.  Sorry if you need more information, Ill try to provide it. Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Buying a car completely with credit card.,"I've been car shopping for a while, particularly for a used car. I have a promotional APR on my Amex of 3.99% on their pay over time charges until 08/21.

**I know that most dealers wouldn't allow me to buy the car completely with the card BUT HYPOTHETICALLY** this is a lower APR than most/all used car loans I've seen. Is there a downside I'm not seeing to trying to pay for as much/all of this car that I can with the credit card? I've verified with Amex that any purchases made during the promotional period are subject to the 3.99% APR for the lifetime of their payments.

I have good credit (760+) and am looking in the $35K price range for cars. I feel like this is too good to be true that I can throw as much of this on the card as they'll allow and get the points, while also seeing the same/if not better interest rate than I would with a traditional auto loan.

personalfinance,Scholarship money &amp; Retirement Accounts,"TL;DR: do (undergraduate) scholarships count as income in terms of eligibility for IRA contributions? 

Hi all, first I’d like to say that I’ve read the wiki a couple times and searched through old posts, so I think I’ve done my due diligence to ensure this isn’t a repeat. That said, if I did miss something I'm sorry in advance.

So, per the tldr, I’m an undergrad who just received an external scholarship (not from my school, it's from an independent organization). The money is deposited directly into my checking account and the program specifies it does not need to be used for education specifically. My schooling is already paid for by a combination of other scholarships/family support, so I don’t have any major expenses directly education-related that I can spend this new scholarship on. The scholarship will pay $9500 over the course of this tax season.
(Note: The scholarship program specifically notes that they do not, under any circumstance, provide advice regarding taxation of award money... That's why I'm here.)

My only other expected sources of earned money for the 20-21 season tax season include around $2k in income from tutoring throughout the school year and $2.5k from another scholarship, bringing the total earned money to $12000 in scholarships and $2000 in real income. (From my research, if all of this money is counted as income, then I land in the 12% fed bracket).

I have no debts or other such obligations, and have an appropriately sized emergency fund, so I’d like to invest as much of this money in as tax-advantaged a way as possible. From my understanding, it seems a Roth IRA is the best route for me, since my current tax bracket is almost certainly lower than what it will be in the near future. However, I wanted to confirm that this scholarship money is eligible for contribution to these kinds of accounts; it's not clear to me whether these sorts of scholarships constitute ""earned income"" in the traditional sense of the word. The most relevant info I could find from the IRS is copied below:

""Scholarship and fellowship payments are compensation for IRA purposes only if shown in box 1 of Form W-2."" 
https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2019_publink1000230355

My scholarship programs clearly state that they do not issue W2s, so to me this suggests that I cannot contribute that money to an IRA. So, as I understand it, that would limit me to contributing only the ~$2k from the tutoring job. 

Do any of you have insight here about whether the scholarship income qualifies as earned income for IRA contribution? If it doesn't, are there any other tax-advantaged ways to spend/invest this money? I'm not opposed to just dumping it in with my regular investment account, but I want to make sure I'm not missing out on free money.

Also, this is more of a general question that is a result of my lack of experience with filing taxes more than anything, but how are Roth IRA contributions specifically taxed? I understand that they're taxed on contribution rather than withdrawal, but when specifically does that taxation happen? When I send the money? Or does it all happen during tax filing? 

Thanks in advance.",finance
investing,"Buy T-Bonds Instead Of ""Keeping Cash On The Sidelines""","Having an emergency fund is always vital. Being able to cover short term emergencies without force selling assets is a must especially in a market downturn. But given that you have an emergency fund in place, why do people hoard cash? 

Say for example you have 100k portfolio invested into equities and we are in a raging bull market. (Let's pretend this is 2015-2019). If you begin to fear an upcoming recession, you can starting selling some of your equities and buying treasury bonds. BUT here's the key to my question....those who do own treasuries and equities in a portfolio, why would you keep any cash at all?

Long term treasury bonds have basically ALWAYS gone up in price in recessions due to high demand and falling interest rates. (This includes the great depression, the great recession, as well as in 2020) They are seen as a safe haven investment and rise dramatically in market downfalls. So I hear people say things like ""I have 50k invested but I also have 20k in cash waiting on the sidelines"". What's the point of this? Why not wait and sell for massive gains when the market crashes and get paid interest while you wait?

TLDR: TLT, EDV, and VGLT or some long term treasury ETFs that I like. So in normal conditions when interest rates and above 0% and we are in a normal bull market, why would anyone ever hold cash? Hold the bonds and sell for gains when the market crashes and then buy back into equities at rock bottom prices. Am I missing something???

Just to start off I am a 20 year old female and I was in the hospital last year for an accident and I have been getting constant spam mails from a debt collector and so on. I called my insurance and hospitals that I stayed at to confirm about any medical bills that I needed to pay. They all told me I have nothing on my accounts that I needed to pay.

Getting a 30 year and investing the difference made sense.  Now, rates are 3% and 2.5%, respectively; a 16.7% discount.

edit: I understand that most people would consider many different aspects when considering the 15 vs 30 yr loan but I'm just trying to figure out statistically, at the end of the day, when would a 15 year mortgage give me the higher NW:  Is it a 1% spread at 3%?  Is it a 0.5% spread at 2%?

edit #2: To rephrase: If you could guarantee (yes I know) a 7% return on investments, even if the 30 year was 6.5% and the 15% was 1%, it would still make financial sense to get the 30 year and invest the difference. Is that correct?",finance

D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder in America. One of the good things about the amount of uncertainty in the economy right now is interest rates are historically low and expected to stay there for several years. Add in the fact that people are spending more time at home, millennials are buying homes, and inflation expectations are creeping back up from their March lows, and we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of a huge bull market in residential real estate.

DHI focuses on lower priced homes, with a large majority of their homes priced under $300,000. This is a sweet spot for residential real estate as 45% of all new homes sales in the second quarter were priced below this threshold. In 2019, DHI closed on over 58,000 homes… that’s 9% of all the homes sold in the country last year, and they’re not slowing down. In the second quarter of 2020, DHI’s net income per share increased 37% to $1.72, revenues increased 10% to $5.4 billion, and net homes sold and closed increased by 38% and 10% respectively. 

Go take a look at their revenue and earnings per share growth over the last 5 years.

Analyst’s don’t expect this trend to dissipate anytime soon with expected 2021 EPS growth of +16.78% and 2022 EPS growth of +14.38%.


DHI is a well capitalized cash flow monster with macroeconomic tailwinds accelerating already stellar performance.

personalfinance,Is using student loan disbursements to pay down other high-interest debts ever a good idea?,"Happy Tuesday everyone!

So I'm in a unique situation to me currently where I will be receiving my student loan disbursements in the next week for my tuition. Prior to graduate school, I never had loans, I utilized scholarships I received and paid the rest of my tuition in cash. 

After talking with my school, there is no way of editing the amount of funds I'll be receiving. For context, for this semester and next semester combined I'll be receiving $8400, even though my tuition for the two semesters will only be $5296, leaving me with $3100 leftover for the two semesters. On top of this, I'll be receiving an employee reimbursement upon completion of my courses for 75% of the tuition, so roughly $3972 that I'll get back after the courses are completed that I will apply directly to the loans.  

My question is, should I use the remaining funds of $3100 to pay down higher-interest credit cards I currently have? On the side of my normal job, I flip homes so I'm constantly putting money on my hardware store cc, as well as some other small ones. After adding up the totals from all of my cards, it comes to $4326, so I'd be able to pay a large chunk of them off with the remaining funds, and then just owe on my student loans later on once I complete my Masters. Currently I'm only able to pay about $500 at the very most each month towards those cards. I haven't received what my interest rate will be just yet as the loans haven't been transferred to the loan servicer, but I'd assume they'd be much less than my high-interest credit cards that are around 20% each. 

Should I continue trying to pay them down each week with my regular paycheck and pay the student loans back directly after disbursement or should I use the student loan money to pay off those debts now?

Reaching out to the community here to see what other people's debt repayment strategies are, particularly for student loans.

My financial picture:

Personal Loan through BestEgg: $8000 @ 5.32% fixed (3 yr term, $602 per month)

Federal Student Loans through Fedloan: $38000 @ 5.75% fixed (2 consolidated 20 yr loans; $22000 and $16000) ($220 per month)

Private Student loan through CollegeAve: $28000 @ 4.4% fixed (10 yr term, $319 per month)

Income: $95000 + yearly bonus of $10-12K (pre-tax)

Monthly expenses: \~3500 (NYC rent being $1100 of that :-\\)

Savings: $11000

6% contribution to 401k to max out employer match (currently have $18K in an index that tracks S&amp;P 500 stocks)

Whole life insurance plan ($150 per month; currently has 8k cash value that I can borrow against)

""Excellent"" credit score

I originally consolidated $20000 in high interest credit card debt last August onto the personal loan. Now I use my credit cards for everything, but pay off the whole balance every month to get the free money from rewards points. I have enough money in savings to pay off the personal loan, but I've been holding off due to Covid uncertainty and to have a healthy safety net in cash.

I generally agree with the strategy of paying down debt with the highest interest rate first, but for me that happens to be my federal student loans, which also come with many benefits not offered for private student loans, such as flexible payment plans, deferment and forbearance options for different life situations, and erasing balance after 20 years of payments (not sure if the gov't really honors this/makes it simple). Federal loan balances also have the potential of being decreased/erased depending on how the politics play out in the coming years/if progressives win out (probably don't want to bet on this of course).

According to the high interest first strategy, I should be paying down my federal student loans, but I feel more comfortable paying off my consumer debt via the personal loan first to free up the $602/month. Everything I read assumes that consumer debt and private student loans have the highest interest rates, but for me, that's not the case.

Aside from which order I should pay things off in, at what point do you think I should keep some debt at the minimum monthly payment and allow the loan(s) to play out to term in favor of ramping up 401k and other investments?

My goal is to reach financial independence as quickly as possible.

What is your safety net savings rule (3-6 months seems to be the trend)? I'm tempted to pay off the personal loan now, which would leave me with 2K in cushion.

I want to find the cheapest way to start paying off my student loans. I have 33,600 in student loans, 6,600 of it are Perkins loans at 5% interest.

I am debating between the standard and the graduated repayment options. 

Here are my general thoughts --&gt; 

Standard: If I make the minimum payments, it'll be the cheapest plan over the lifetime of the loan. The fixed payment will also make budgeting easier. Also, if I may over the minimum the extra will go to more of the loan's principle. 

Graduated: The upside here is I have more money to invest that can grow, at hopefully a faster rate than my student loans. I can put more of my extra payments above the minimum towards targeting my higher interest federal loans. Does that work though? The minimum I have to pay for the graduated is about $160. If I threw $500+ at it each month with the extra targeting higher interest loans, does that make any material impact compared to me doing the same with the standard repayment (minimum is around $285)?

So, here are the details on my existing mortgage, and the first loan estimate we got for a potential refinance:

Current Mortgage:

Interest Rate: 4.875%

Length of Loan: 30 years (currently 28 years left in mortgage before maturity)

Monthly Payment: $1,034

On the surface, I obviously like the terms of the refinance - however, would it be more beneficial to just pay extra principal on the existing loan, knowing we're moving by 2023 or so?  For example, we usually pay a total of $1300 each month (with an extra $266 or so in principal).  Would it benefit us at all if we took the refinance, continued to pay $1300 each month, to significantly increase the extra principal payment every month (Which would amount to $436)?

personalfinance,Do Estimated Taxes Get Refunded Separately?,"Hello! My husband and I filed jointly. He received a tax refund for the amount withheld from his W-2s that was over what we owed. But on top of that amount, I'm self-employed, so I paid a significant amount in estimated federal taxes, none of which turned out to be needed since he withheld enough to cover it. According to our tax return, we should get that amount refunded, but it didn't come with the W-2 amount. Does it come separately? Did we misunderstand something? We called BFS and the IRS (BFS sent us to collections because we were worried we were being given a smaller refund intentionally, and the collections guy obviously didn't know much about what was going on).

So anyway, the question is—is the refund for the amount overpaid in estimated taxes still coming later on, in theory? Or is that amount, as the collections guy believes (despite both our tax return and the IRS tax transcript showing otherwise) simply credited against our annual income and not actually something that's refunded? And is there a number we can call in the IRS that can actually help us if an error has been made?

""I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,"" Trump said Tuesday in a tweet.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tues, Oct 6, 2020. I know I say this a lot but today really was a crazy day! Please enjoy","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 6, 2020**

Stocks traded mixed today as market participants digested a host of new developments around Pres. Trump’s health after his COVID diagnosis, Chairman Powell’s remarks, the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, and the resurgence of the Virus in some hotspots.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.78% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.42%, and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.37% down.

Today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a virtual address at the National Association of Business Economics’ annual address to discuss the Fed’s outlook for the economy during this pandemic. In his address, Powell once again (for the hundredth time it seems) reiterated the need of further fiscal stimulus to support the pandemic-stricken economy and promote faster recovery. He said, “The recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.”

Elsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Powell’s comments. She said. “Chairman Powell’s warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people.” 

At the moment of writing this recap, Pres. Trump tweeted “Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.” Immediately after this tweet, the markets turned sharply downwards and the VIX turned sharply upwards (VIX is an indicator of market participant’s risk sentiment). Pelosi responded by saying, “Trump is not willing to crush the virus” and that “he puts himself before the nation”

Trump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center yesterday and returned to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated for Covid-19. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had “met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,” while conceding that he “may not be entirely out of the woods yet” in his recovery process.

Just four states in the US are reporting a decline in coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Wisconsin, new cases are averaging at about 2,400 daily -- the third highest in the country behind Texas and California. That's up 15% from what the state was averaging in the previous week. At least 22 states are reporting more new cases than the previous week, with many across the Midwest and now increasingly in the Northeast.

personalfinance,"unable to file taxes (probably my fault, please help!)","i decided to file 2018 taxes myself, in attempt to save on accountant fees. turbotax seemed straightforward enough, especially with accountant-prepared filings from  2017 and earlier. something seemed off when i did not receive a return after a few months. i brushed it off at the time.

it wasn't until October 2019, while searching through spam email, that i saw numerous alerts from turbotax stating my return could not be filed. federal return was rejected because the return amount i indicated for 2017 for validation did not match IRS records. state return was rejected becase federal return was not accepted.

i sent federal filing in by mail at that time, but have been unable to check its status on irs.gov. i am unable to create an account, the issue again being an apparent mismatch on the 2017 return amount.

embarassed to admit, i was overwhelmed and too embarassed to even attempt filing 2019 returns, anticipating the same issue.

does anyone have suggestions on what i should do at this point? i would like to avoid going to jail for tax evasion/fraud. feels like i am failing as an adult :(",finance

personalfinance,Vanguard (with dividends) vs TSP,"Xposted to Bogleheads:
I did a search for vanguard vs TSP and I didn't see an answer for this:

TLDR: Should I invest for retirement funds after my match into Vanguard VTSAX, which provides dividends, or max out the Roth TSP first?

I'm 36 and am behind on saving for retirement. I had a decent benefit at my first job for a couple of years, but that ended and my next two employers didn't have any retirement programs. I focused on paying off debt instead of retirement.

I now work for the federal government and my spouse and I have nearly finished paying off the last of his student loans (mine are paid, yay!). I've been investing 5% to max out the match and put the rest toward paying off our debts. We now have a house with a good interest rate (under 3%) and 15 mo old daughter that we will need to start saving for her schooling.

I have about $25k with Vanguard from my pre-federal employee life. $20k is in the VTSAX fund in a traditional IRA and 5k is in the VOO ETF in my Roth IRA.  

I have about 25k in the TSP, mixed in Roth and Traditional due to the matching having to go into traditional. The TSP will permit me to invest my full $19,500 into the Roth TSP. That seems like an obvious choice, but the TSP doesn't pay any dividends. I really feel like since I'm already 36, I really need that extra dividend income to boost my growth. 

So, when the last of his student loans are paid and I can boost my retirement savings, I am trying to determine if I should max out the Roth TSP for future tax savings or keep the match and invest in my Roth and Traditional IRAs at Vanguard, which pay out quarterly dividends that I reinvest. 

I have no idea how to determine if we will be in a smaller or larger tax bracket at retirement, because we are pretty middle of the road right now (22% bracket). 

Thanks for any thoughts.",finance
stocks,"Stocks set to fall a second day after Trump halts stimulus talks, Dow futures fall 90 points","U.S. stock futures moved lower in overnight trading on Tuesday after President Donald Trump called off stimulus talks until after the November election. 

Dow futures fell 90 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.32% and 0.25%, respectively.

In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 375 points after Trump tweeted the White House is halting talks with Democrats about a second coronavirus stimulus deal. Earlier in the session, stocks rallied in hopes that there would be a second relief package to prop up markets as the coronavirus outbreak rages on.

“I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,” Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday. 

The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.57% on Tuesday.

“It’s just so disruptive,” Tom Block, Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat, told CNBC. “There’s no going around the president. My view is that this is negative for the market.”

[Some on Wall Street speculated](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trump-tanks-the-market-by-stopping-stimulus-talks-what-the-pros-are-doing-from-here.html) Trump’s move was a mere negotiating tactic, while others hypothesized the president truly doesn’t think the economy needs another $2 trillion in fiscal spending. 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday the economy needs more aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus for an economic recovery that he said still has “a long way to go.”

Powell said the lack of support could “lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses” and thwart a rebound that thus far has progressed more quickly than expected. “By contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller,” Powell added. 

“Chairman Powell has said that we need more stimulus, and this is going against the advice of the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the markets don’t really like going against the advice of the chairman of the Federal Reserve ... I would not say it’s over for good but I would say it’s a very negative sign and likely pushes it until after the election,” Block added. 

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester [said later on Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trumps-ending-of-stimulus-talks-will-mean-a-much-slower-recovery-feds-mester-says.html) that the end of stimulus talks means the economic recovery will be “much slower” than originally expected.

The Federal Open Market Committee will publish its meeting minutes from its September meeting at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The FOMC made no action on interest rates in September, leaving them near zero.

Now we've been trying to do Uber eats during the weekend but that's inconsistent. During the week is hardly possible as I'm gone from around 9-2 and then from 3-5 I'm working at another internship.  


I'm selling extra stuff but because our outflow is so large we're mostly using that to eat and for gas to get from place to place. Cancelling the gym would incur a fee that we never have the money to cover, and we both enjoy working out.  


Credit isn't strong enough to consolidate the debt, and I know my fiance will have student loans kick in soon, and then myself after graduation. Which is why I'd like to get out of this mess before then if possible.

personalfinance,Is this a good credit card offer?,"I skimmed the wiki first I promise. Keep it under 30% utilization, pay it each month once the statement goes up but before the due date so it builds my credit.

Background: 

recently got a car, financed it, blah blah, so there's 8 or so hard inquiries on my credit. Due to this, I'd planned to hold off on applying for a credit card until January or so. Which would also let me get a few car payments in to help diversify my credit history. Never had a credit card. I applied for one with chase mid-may, which disappeared into the ether so I'm guessing I was denied or my application expired before I sent over the info they requested. 

Card details:

Was prequalified by the letter in the mail

Details

Card: Capital one quicksilver

1.5% cashback, unlimited (hmm)

0% apr until 07/21 (cute)

26.99% apr after that (christ that's high)

Transfers &amp; cash advance: 26.99%

Annual fee: none

So, is this a good offer? Afaik my credit score these auto loan folks got was in the low 700s. All I have tied to my name (before the car) was student loans, which are on ice per the feds now, but I've been paying each month since January, sometimes twice I month. That nearly 30% apr is kinda spooking me, but it doesn't matter if I pay it before it hits. 

Also, how's their customer service?

Answers to questions I half expect:

Budget: oh yes! About 40% of my paycheck goes into a variety of savings/investments (401k, Roth IRA, savings acct to fund emergency fund, etc)

House expenses: I pay my folks $500 and buy about $100 in groceries per month to contribute to the household.

Other expenses: 200 a month to a couple life insurance policies (have been on me since I was a baby afaik)
 
Gas: about $120 a month, fortunately gas is pretty cheap here.

Car note: $800/month. It's actually a bit less, but I apply the difference to the principal (about 32 bucks)

Anyway, this got kind of long. Thanks for reading

financialindependence,Down payment for a mortgage — how to think about the math in FI?,"My wife and I planning to buy a home in the next couple of years in a very high cost-of-living area. We have family in town, like living here despite the high COL, and intend to settle for the long term. While it's probably the better financial decision to rent, the permanence of living in our own home and the ability to tailor it to our needs is appealing.

I started thinking about whether it would be better to go with a smaller vs. larger down payment, assuming we had the cash to cover in any case. On one hand, a smaller down payment keeps more of our net worth liquid, increasing the amount of income we can withdraw based on the safe withdrawal rate. On the other hand, a larger down payment would reduce our mortgage bill, which means we'd need less income to cover our other expenses.

Since the SWR assumes your money is kept in a balanced portfolio, and conventional wisdom is that market returns tend to be higher in the long run than the current low interest rates we're seeing, my intuition suggested a smaller down payment that keeps more money invested in the market would clearly be better. I ended up doing the math, and was surprised by what I found.

I made the following assumptions: (to keep things simple, I ignored taxes, closing costs on the home, etc.)

* Realistic ""good"" interest rate at 3.25% on a 30-year fixed mortgage
* A conservative safe withdrawal rate at 3.5%
* Starting net worth of $3M
* House costs $1M
* In addition to P&amp;I, mortgage payment includes property tax at 1.25% of the purchase price and an insurance payment at 0.22% of the home price, both of which remain static

**My math showed that each 100K increase in the down payment reduces the mortgage payment by \~$435/mo, whereas it only reduces income based on the SWR by \~$292/mo (100000\*0.035/12).** Here's a spreadsheet with my math, if anyone wants to check it out:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqP9vwXkfY6CQ0sPtu1NQ5m3FKWrd7O6i5Gp1evnAvA/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqP9vwXkfY6CQ0sPtu1NQ5m3FKWrd7O6i5Gp1evnAvA/copy)

Even stranger, it isn't until the interest rate is an impossibly low 0.35% that the monthly mortgage payment reduction from the higher down payments roughly evens out with the reduction in income.

Something about this seemed counterintuitive, so I figured I'd post here in case anyone else sees something obvious that I'm missing. For those of you who faced a similar decision in the past, what did you do?",finance
investing,The effect of a stimulus package on currency,"I just want to know if I have understood this correctly:

Stimulus comes in two forms: Fiscal and Monetary 

1. No stimulus means less economic recovery and thus people put their money in banks for investment and turn to safe currencies like the USD?

2. Fiscal stimulus means cutting taxes for example. This gets people to spend more and so more money in circulation and less in banks. USD goes up or down?

3. Monetary stimulus means cutting interest rates which leads to a weaker USD since people no longer put their money in banks?

Also, I've converted any CAD amounts to USD for the sake of simplicity on this post.



For some background context, I'm a 26 year-old Canadian currently working in the US. I have around $19K USD in Canadian federal student loans at a 2.45% floating interest rate, with min payments of $342/month on which the moratorium expires next month. With the resumption of the loan payments alongside what I support my parents with, I'll have a monthly spend of $4700. I'm also sitting on $34K in my chequing/savings account that I'm currently not doing anything with. I got a really big pay bump by switching jobs in January, so this is the first time I've been able to have any kind of freedom in my finances, which is both exciting and mildly anxiety-inducing.

 

Embarrassingly enough, this week I *finally* categorized and tracked all my spending (!) and enrolled in my company's 401(k) plan. I'm still trying to figure this all out, but if I understand correctly I have until the end of the 2020 calendar year to hit $19,500 in contributions, right? Before I started my research I was thinking about paying off my student loans in one go just to get them off of my mind, but now I feel like there would be a big loss in focusing on a loan with a tiny interest rate over the 5-8% average return of the 401(k) on pre-tax dollars.


Since I'm paid on the 1st and 15th of each month, that means I'll have 5 paycheques before the end of the year. Does it make sense to set myself at the max contribution of 90% in order to hit to the 2020 contribution max by my 5th pay period (4 will take me really close)? Does it make sense to do this over paying off my student loans? And whatever I choose, does it make sense to follow the standard advice in this subreddit and invest in a Roth IRA after I max out my 401(k) even if I don't plan on retiring in the USA?

personalfinance,Started up a roth IRA. New to this stuff and figuring out if I should invest or wait until I move?,"First of all, I started looking into investing and all of that for about a whole week now so I know VERY LITTLE and bits and pieces about these things so I apologize for sounding really noobish about a lot of this stuff as I'm still learning.

So as of recently I decided that I wanted to start to finally start saving up for my retirement after literally doing nothing about it besides putting my money into a savings account. A few days ago I signed up for my work's 401k plan and after more research and a recommendation for my brother (who wasn't the biggest help lol), a ROTH IRA is pretty much one of the best suggestions and what I'm trying to go for. I signed up a roth IRA from Vanguard just a few hours ago and I know that I should be prioritizing stocks over bonds especially at a young age (I'm 25) and I'm aware it's more risky but higher reward, but I'm also aware that I shouldn't let dips in the market scare me so I'm willing to go that route. I wanna learn more about investing and do more than just ""invest and practically forget about it as it grows"" but I guess that's probably the best idea for now to start off.

Anyways, so my problem is that there's a lot I'm confused about and I know it takes time to learn these things but it's overwhelming. I'm having trouble navigating Vanguard's site since it's confusing for me and I thiiink(?) I invested $100 (coz I think I had to?) in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX) of which idk what that is exactly. I've read up that I should invest in VTSMX especially with me going the risky route but I know there's other stuff I could and prob should invest in.

I'm debt free and all I really pay for is rent and bills so I don't spend too much within a month and easily accrue money (very slowly). But the other problem is that my savings is pretty low as I only have 7.5k and I don't make great money at my job, and I do need to save up so I can move out of state sometime next year and my goal for when I move is to have 15k, but just having 10k should be good enough honestly.  I heard that for some stocks or whatever, there's a minimum balance of $1000+ I have to start off and while $1000 won't kill me, I still feel like that's quite a lot especially with me moving in less than a year and my income rate. From what I hear, you can withdraw your funds without getting taxed much, if at all(?)  So should I just move out of state and then start investing in my roth IRA or is there still hope for me to invest in the meantime? And if I can invest in while I wait to move, what's recommended for me to invest in to start off?",finance

personalfinance,Will taking out Parent PLUS loans hurt my parents' ability to take out a mortgage if the monthly payment is almost 0 dollars?,"I am a junior in college, and once I graduate, I have two younger siblings that will start college a semester later. My father is 54 and is permanently/totally disabled from a rare form of metastasized cancer and receives about 1200 a month from disability payments. My mother is a minimum wage retail worker. I also work part time. We make 25-30k a year at the moment.

We have about 2k a month in rent expenses. Majority of food and healthcare is under welfare. Other monthly costs include my fathers 
my father's car insurance (400), phone+internet (300), and other miscellaneous expenses (500-600) a month. Yes, we are going into savings to pay for monthly expenses. We don't have a lot of savings left though, maybe 3-6 months left. 

So we are in financial trouble. We will also likely be in more financial trouble in the upcoming months because my father's parents need to move to the USA to get proper medical treatment and will be living with us. My suggestion was  taking out parent plus loans under the ICR plan, which would subtract the federal poverty income from our income and make us pay 20 percent of that every year. Which would result in 0 dollars currently, and it's unlikely that  my parents will gain a higher income. 

My father *qualified* for a 200k mortgage. (I keep trying to tell him that there's no way he can afford a house over 100k, but he refuses to listen to me. And most houses anywhere near us are 200+k).

He's worried that having the Parent PLUS loans will affect his ability to get a mortgage? Is there any truth to that? I would assume that if his monthly payment is practically nothing, then it wouldn't affect anything. 

Additionally, is there any way to convince him that buying a house right now that's 100k+ is a bad idea? He thinks that mortgage payments will be cheaper than our rent even in 250k houses but I can't get him to understand that there are other costs associated with owning a home.

So I've been trying to refinance for about a week and a half and it seems almost impossible to get ahold of anyone. I've talked to the credit union I bank at and they said they would have a mortgage team call me back within 24 hours and this never happened. I called the bank the owns the current loan and left a message last week, again no call. Then I called the loan officer last week that helped me get my loan to begin with and she apologized in advanced that it would take awhile to get refinanced because ""everyone is refinancing"". 

A little back story is that I did a pathway to purchase program and they gave me 20k down for my house. the stipulation is that I stay in the house for 5 years and its fully forgivable. I've been in the house for two years so if I was to refinance I would have to pay 12k back because its prorated. I have 100k in equity which is well over 20% of the LTV and I have $1500 total of my own money into the house with closing cost ect.

 I currently owe $202k on the house and my interest rate is 5.125% on a 30 year loan. I have a 760+ credit score and with interest rates being an all time low I can see why I shouldn't refinance. My plan was to refinance $220k to pay for refinance fees/p2p and even with a 3% interest rate plus getting rid of pmi I will save over $500 a month. From there I was going to roll that money back into the principal of the house and I would pay the house off 12 years earlier then now without affecting my income/bills. 

So my questions are,

 How would I accelerate getting ahold of someone to refinance? 

Also, I know the feds ""promised"" to not raise interest rates for a couple years so is it worth the gamble to wait for 3 more years to refinance and hopefully get a good rate at that time? At that point I could put the 12k I'm going to pay P2P into my principal of the house instead.",finance

The max is 75k, which I presume to hopefully hit in a few years. I live in a relatively low COL state, so I can see myself staying in this position for a good while, assuming everything “jives” when I get in the office. This is going up from 35k, however my current insurance is cheaper, and the new job has a mandatory state education retirement, so according to my calculations, I’ll net about 50% more after taxes, insurance cost increase, etc.  I should net right at about 3k a month. 

I just sold an off-road UTV for about the same I paid for it, and eliminated that payment, as well as took the surplus $3800 and paid it on a credit card balance. This leaves me with about 6k in CC debt, 3.5k in a federal student loan, and about 5k left on my truck. I plan to commute the first 6-12 months and take every spare penny and pay those off. Ideally, I’d pay the card off first as it’s much higher interest, but I’m tempting to pay the truck off first instead as it’s a much higher monthly obligation. 

Once I’m completely debt free, I’ll start establishing my savings and looking for a house. However, I’m not sure how much house I will be able to  afford. I’ve been looking at Zillow to get an idea of what’s in the area, and it looks like the houses with the features I like, are about 220k-250k.

Some say I NEED 20% down to avoid PMI, others say I can do an 80-10-10, and others still say put down the bare minimum to get the loan and just pay the PMI.


I was just hoping that maybe someone could help me crunch some numbers. I’ll have the mandatory retirement coming out, and I want to contribute enough to get the optional 403(b) match. I don’t want to be “mortgage broke” but I would like to get as nice as I can afford with some spending money, savings, and maybe a new truck 5 years in the future.",finance

Original plan was straightforward - use the 760k as down payment, take a new 30 year loan.

Then I thought that maybe I should straight refinance my current home first, which would lower our DTI to 1100 for PI.

Then I realized that if I could cash-out refi, I could get about $312k out of it. Add that to the $760k capital and could buy a slightly cheaper house, 1.05m in cash (+closing). This would keep the mortgage on my current home, which would become a rental, which means that it would be tax advantaged for us because we currently take the standard deduction due to the $10000 SALT limit for a married couple.

personalfinance,"Should I pay off my car now, or wait till a more stable economic time","Hi there,

I'm 28 years old and work in IT in healthcare. My annual income is $69,000 and my monthly expenses are around $2,500 a month (currently live in a HCOL area). Outside of my 401k I have about $14,000 in total in my emergency savings, personal savings, and a personal investment account. My only ""real"" debt is a car loan I owe roughly $9,500 on, and I also owe about $20,000 to my parents for school interest free. My monthly car payment is $237 a month.

I'm debating whether or not I should pay off my car loan completely or wait till a more stable economic time. I'm pretty pessimistic about the future of the economy (not that my opinion matters). My job seems to be pretty stable, but I don't know what the future holds. There have been some layoffs within management in my department but I could see change happening even a year from now.

Because of that, I'm not sure if I should use my savings to pay off my car. If I paid off my car I would have about $4,500 in savings left which would almost give me about 2 months of expenses if I lost my job.

My other option that I'm considering is dropping my 401k contributions to 5%, which is what my company matches (I currently contribute 10%), and then use that extra money in my paycheck to start putting more money towards the car loan.

While it would be nice to have an extra $237 a month to put towards my savings, I'm a little anxious about taking $9,500 out of my savings given the state of our economy. Following Dave Ramsey's advice btw..

Thank you and I appreciate your thoughts!

EDIT: Adding a couple other details that might be helpful- Interest rate is 6.99% on a 60 month term. I just opened it up a year ago, so have about 48 months left if I did the minimum monthly payments, which I have no intention of doing. Wondering if its worth looking into refinancing, but not sure if its worth the time since I could probably pay it off in a year if I really buckled down and decided not to pull $9500 from savings.",finance
financialindependence,My Research on great 401k company matching,"Edits:

Thanks ill for your responses and sharing your company and its match for those that did. I received too many messages to add to this list, but I can summarize the overall themes.

Universities seem to have a very high match, sometimes regardless of employee contribution, around 10 to 15%. 

A lot of big tech companies offer a 50% match uncapped. 

Sometimes smaller companies, especially in investing, banking ,etc can have 100% match up to IRS limit. 

A number of companies shared have pretty unique benefits, including pensions, or stock purchase options that may make up for having an average (4% match) or below average match, so its up for the individual to decide. 

Having a higher employer match can help expedite reaching your FI number and/or retirement goals. 

According to Fidelity: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/the-average-401k-balance-by-age](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/the-average-401k-balance-by-age)

A while back I started doing research in finding better companies with good benefits as the one I am at now is pretty abysmal. That got me to wonder what exactly is a bad, good, great benefits package etc. So I began with 401k match because I don't have one and I'm on the fire path so it's a big problem for me. Here's what I found analyzing many companies in the SP500, as well as other companies that I've found from online articles and online forum testimonials.

The Standard match appears to be 100% match up to 3%, then 50% match up to 2, so essentially 4%.

From [https://20somethingfinance.com/401k-match/](https://20somethingfinance.com/401k-match/) :According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical or [**average 401K match**](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/automatic-enrollment-employer-match-rates-and-employee-compensation-in-401k-plans.htm)nets out to 3.5%. Their [**National Compensation Survey**](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/) found that of the 56% of employers who offer a 401K plan (a sad statistic in itself):

* 49% of employers with 401K plans match 0%
* 41% match a percentage of employee contributions between 0-6% of salary.
* 10% match a percentage of employee contributions at 6% or more of salary.
* The median is a 3% match.

This is consistent with what I found, a lot of big companies offer 100% up to 6%.

**Best 401k companies**

A lot of this data came straight from the 2019 or 2020 pdf of company benefits website, I.e. straight from the source, but others I had to look at reviews on Glassdoor, indeed, and other sites which for some reason accounts were varied on some, but I entered the most common answer.

I ranked them based on total potential salary contribution, meaning how much they will contribute plus what you have to contribute to to receive max contribution.

Some of the top 5 have unique matches, so I ranked them separately. for instance, Conoco only requires a 1% employee contribution to get their 6% contribution, so it's unique and could be better for someone who can't contribute a lot fo their salary but can still get a good match.

1. **Mastercard** \- 125% match up to 10% (you put in 10, they put 12.5, so (22.5%)
2. **ConocoPhillips** \- if you contribute at least 1% of your eligible pay each pay period, you will receive 6% Company match with an additional 0% – 6% Company discretionary contribution. (7% to 13%)
3. **Gilead science** \- 401k/Roth 100% match up to $15,000 (with 100k salary, up to 15%, 66k 22%)
4. **Chevron -** If you make basic contributions of at least 2 percent of regular pay, Chevron adds 8 percent of your regular pay. (10%)
5. Ultimate software - 45% match uncapped

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Southwest Airlines -** 100% match up to 9.3%(18.6%)
2. **Farmers** \- 100% match up to 6% plus 4% automatic contribution (16%)
3. **VISA -** Matches 200% for up to 5% ( you contribute 5%, they contribute 10%) (15%)
4. **Delta** \- 100% match up to 6% plus 3% automatic contribution(15%)
5. **Allergan** \- match 100% up to 8%(16%)
6. **Ally Bank**\- 100% match up to 6% plus 2% automatic contribution, plus discretionary 2% (14-16%)
7. **FedEx**\- you put in 6%, they put in 8% (14%)
8. **Fidelity** \- match 100% up to 7%(14%)
9. **Capital one** \- if you contribute 6%, They contribute 7.5%. (13.5%)
10. **3m** \- 100% match up to 5% plus 3% automatic contribution(13%)
11. **Discover** \- 100% match up to 5% plus 3% automatic contribution(13%)
12. **American Express** \- 100% match up to 6%(12%)
13. **Citigroup** \- 100% match up to 6%(12%)
14. **Wells Fargo** \- 100% match up to 6% (12%)
15. **Verizon** \- 100% match up to 6% (12%)

**(Suspending Match )Exxon mobile** \- “Currently, the company matches a 6 percent minimum employee contribution with 7 percent of the participant’s pay.”

personalfinance,"Medicaid - Out earning my initial approval period, what will happen?","I'm a contract worker with very poor healthcare offered through my contracting company so we have been on healthcare through our state ACA program. My wife recently gave birth to our 3rd child and that triggered a re-application process for our insurance. 

In this reapplication process the increase of size in our household combined with the time off that my wife and I were taking from work to care for the new baby meant that our new application resulted in qualification for medicaid. Great! We went through the process and were able to keep our existing providers.

Now it's been a few months and I've just realized that the resumption of my full time work may mean that we would get kicked back off the medicaid. I've done a cursory search and found that I may be stuck paying a lot of back taxes after I file my federal return. At this point it's possible that even if I update my income today and swap back to the standard ACA insurance policy that I'd still owe taxes if I understand correctly.  


\-I need help understanding how much taxes I should expect to pay for a 3 child 2 adult family on medicaid if we were to retro-actively be disqualified. I can budget for this amount and reserve it so that we're not stuck when our tax bill comes.  


\-If this is not a problem, then it influences my career options as I'm currently pushing for direct hire to get employer provided insurance.

Forex,How long to stick with a trading strategy that seems not to work well ?,"Hello everyone,

Has any of you successfully changed his trading strategy ? I have been trading a trend following strategy since going live on May 20, however it has not been working very well : 

* my metrics : WR and RRR are going down leading to a negative expectancy
* i'm experienceing more frequent losing streaks
* and it feels like I'm always entering late to the waves 

I tried to tweak some elements of my strategy (managing correlation, timeframe of entry, how to detect the trend, etc..) and see if things improve, but it does not seem to work  

I'm asking if it's the right time (5 months after going live) to look for another trading style ? at the same time I don't want to be system hopping, as i know it's some of the major sins of traders

personalfinance,How should I appropriately budget to spend the least money possible over the course of paying debts and getting a house?,"I just got a new job paying 65k which makes me super excited, but I have a few moderate interest debts. About 20k in student loans with varying interest rates from 2.5% up to 5% and a 13k auto loan with 4% interest. After budgeting monthly expenses and minimum payments on loans I'm pulling in $825 a month, even when I'm only putting 1% into 401k. The company will only match 25%, but it's discretionary at the end of the year. I asked around and apparently the last two years they haven't matched so I felt like that money could be better put towards paying off loans or saving for a house.

One of the biggest expenses I have is rent. I have a family of four and currently we are paying $1600 a month, but we are considering getting a house in 3-5 years. We have already saved up to 3 months of savings and have it in a high yield savings account. So where should the $825 go to first? Just pay minimums on the loans and save for a down payment on a house? Or should it go towards paying off the loans early and just have almost no down payment on the mortgage? If that's the case, do I pay the auto first as the student loans are not accruing interest right now? Or do I try to knock out the student loan with the 5% interest rate?

As a fun little side note: I am trying to get a job teaching 1 class at my previous university as it pays $1000 a month. Would that change anything if I do get that job?",finance
personalfinance,Why does it cost more money to refinance at a lower interest rate (and other refinance related questions)?,"I am trying to be more financially literate and understand the nuances of the financial transactions I make. I recently saw a post about someone refinancing their home mortgage at ridiculously low rates, so have been researching doing the same. My current mortgage is a 30 year fixed mortgage at 4.25% interest and I am currently paying PMI even though real estate prices have gone up and I have more than 20% equity in my house (purchased house for $205,000 three years ago; $186,000 balance, worth \~$260,000 conservatively). I only plan on being in this house another \~2 years before moving up in house. 

I am trying to understand different aspects of refinancing - interest rate versus APR / what do the points mean / etc, but the mortgage people seem very bias in getting a transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at 15 year fixed mortgages here are some scenarios I am preapproved for:

2.250 interest rate; 2.648% APR; $5,218 Points (credits)

2.375 interest rate; 2.718% APR; $4,441 Points (credits)

2.750 interest rate; 2.939% APR; $1,712 Points (credits)

3.125 interest rate; 3.193% APR; $590 Points (credits)

&amp;#x200B;

And here are two options at 30 year fixed mortgages that I am preapproved for:

2.375 interest rate; 2.743% APR; $9,115 Points (credits)

3.125 interest rate; 3.200% APR; $1,560 Points (credits)

&amp;#x200B;

My priorities include making the best financial choice and maximizing equity (even if the payment is higher). I can afford a 15 year mortgage. Are there any benefits to staying with a 30 year mortgage? Is it worth it to refinance even if I only stay in this house 2 more years?

Plus at the time, I was in a dispute with my auto lease owner over broken machinery and was late on payments (in reality i was holding out because they were refusing to replace broken parts on a brand new car, the point is I had flags on my credit). Her credit came in around 630, mine came in at 585 due to the flags. The interest rate we got on her car is like 10.4%. Fast forward to now, I’ve had a new job for 6 months that’s completely salary, and more money than my last job. My wife also got a promotion and is making more money. Her credit probably has not changed too drastically, but mine is back up around 700. I’m starting to look into refinancing her car to save money in the long run, but the companies I’ve checked with have given me rates such as 8% etc, which seems hiiiigh. I feel like the companies are just giving me slightly better rates so that I still technically save money, but in reality I’m just moving most of that debt to a new company.

personalfinance,Stuck In a perpetual loop,"So I have tried a few times to consolidate my credit cards down into one loan to have one payment.

I have them mostly locked so nothing can charge them and I don’t carry them around with me. 

I have tried a few times to get a loan to consolidate them but I’m told they can’t approve me for a loan because my card utilization is too height. I am at 70% on some cards. I know I could get a better interest rate if I could consolidate and make more of a dent if it was all lumped together, but when I try to consolidate the said they can’t because my utilization is high. 

Well duh!!! I’m trying to fix that with the consolidation!!! Is there anything anyone can advise or should I just keep making more than minimum until they are paid down past like 50% and try again. Anything is appreciated.

personalfinance,Pay Down Student Loans or Invest?,"I am trying to figure out whether it is better to pay down my student loans or use extra money to invest.  I understand that generally investing you would expect 5% annual return and my loans are 6% so it may be a close call. I have 93 payments remaining on federal student loans that have a balance of $72,608.85 with a weighted average interest rate of 6.09%. 

Before coronavirus, we just paid off my wife’s student loans and I had planned to take the approximately $250/mo we were paying on her loans, and apply it to my loans and refinance with a private lender. The rate quotes I was getting at the time were around 2.5% and I would have the whole loan paid off for about $1,275 per month in about 5 years. 

Instead, when COVID happened and the administrative forbearance kicked in, I started banking the $1,000 per month and now have an extra $7,000 in savings. I expected to start paying back my loan in September but now my Covid forbearance will last until March 2021. 

Additionally, My wife and I recently opened up an investment account with fidelity and we have about $6,000 invested in a few ETFs. (Due to work complications, it is impractical to invest in individual stocks.) Going forward we have that $7,000 in the saved student loan “payments” plus around $2,000 monthly to allocate between our savings/investment and student loan payments. Assuming we have enough in emergency savings, and as of March 2021 at least $989 of $2,000 will need to go towards student loans, what is the most efficient way to allocate our money? 

If the answers is paydown student loans, do I still refinance with private loans and loans all of the protections and advantages of government loans, or continue to get soaked with the high interest rate but still have security of federal loans?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance versus paying down debt,"Hi all, I need some advice on how to calculate the optimal strategy to prioritize paying off debt.

To qualify for refinancing under the same plan the bank now requires 5% equity in the house. How would I go about determining if we would be better off (aka minimize interest payments unless there is a more optimal strategy?) by paying off principal for our mortgage then spending the money to refinance versus applying that extra cash to more aggressively pay off student debt? Also, how would I see the “break even” point between the two strategies? Our current plan is to stay in this house long term, but if the refi mortgage is only the better option looking many years down the road it is always possible we will outgrow this house and buy something new.

So please bare with me, this is a long one. But any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a 25F, I work in digital marketing and I make about $42k per year. I am in massive debt for someone my age and I'm barely keeping my head above water. I started to spiral shortly after I graduated undergrad at 21 and was going though post-grad depression (now i realize was just full blown MMD, which I'm currently working on through meds and therapy). I couldn't find a job in my field fast enough and I was working part-time at the mall, struggling to get 20 hours a week to pay my car note, insurance, phone bill and very small credit card at the time. I ended up getting my credit limit increased to 10k, getting another card for 5k, and another card for 1k (this was used for an emergency mechanic). I maxed all these cards out within about 2.5 years for a variety of reasons: cash advances to help my family (we are all struggling financially), paid my car note a few times on it, helped my father out a lot when he was deported back to UK, and some compulsive shopping habits that unknowingly stemmed from my depression. I eventually got a job at a call center making ""decent"" money, but the bonuses that I was getting helped me keep up with all my minimum payments and I was even able to throw a little extra money to it here and there. But because I was living at home and really no proper understanding of how to manage money, I ended up saving absolutely nothing and just blowing my leftover money on shit to temporarily make myself feel better because I worked at a call center instead of in my field and watched all my peers go onto their dream jobs. (I'm not avoiding accountability, I'm just explaining my mindset at the time. I completely understand how I fucked up and trust me, I beat myself up about every single day)

It all went to shit last year when I moved out of my mom's house and out on my own with a close friend. I got an entry level marketing job about 2 hours away from home, packed up all my stuff and moved thinking this was going to be my big break into adulthood. Life slapped me in the face like no other. I was let get from my job just a few days after starting because the company had lost a huge contract with a major brand and was now having to reassess their budget. I get it, I was fresh so it just made sense to cut me out of the equation. Since I had already moved, I decided to just stick it out until I found something else. I was unemployed for about a month and a half but ended up falling wayyy behind on payments and accumulating some more debt. When I did find a job (my current one), I thought it would all be fixed but nope turns out I was making a lot more at my call center job from making monthly bonuses than I would at my entry level job. It was really hard to pay all my bills, take care of myself and pay rent. I ended up messing around with payday loans, I'm almost paid off entirely and I will never touch one of those things again. But now I haven't been able to keep up with my credit cards and student loans. I haven't paid my electricity bill in months (my roommate doesn't know bc it's in my name). I've had about 3 things go to collections, I owe about $300 in medical bills, $500 in past due property taxes and about 3k in taxes (both states and federal). I barely get by paycheck to paycheck, and I go in the negative pretty frequently. My lease is going to end in March and I may have to move back home to even start getting my life together. I've been looking for jobs like crazy but covid has really killed the job market. I've been doing some food delivery to help out but bc there's so many people doing it now since the pandemic started, it's hard to make a large amount of money from it.

I'm completely lost and I have no idea what to do now. My depression has only gotten worse (my doctor just prescribed me antidepressants last week and I will start therapy next week), I literally wake up in the middle of the night thinking of what bills are due next. I have constant anxiety, my phone is always on DND so I can avoid collection calls and I hardly ever check the mail. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that I'll find a better paying job soon but I'm running our of time. I'm considering filing bankruptcy but I don't want to lose my car, I've been working so hard to stay on top of it. I thought about doing a debt relief or consolidation loan, but I've been reading that those things are scams. I'm really just looking to see if anyone else has been in something remotely similar to this and what steps you've taken.",finance

CryptoCurrency,What do you guys think about the upcoming Fed Coin?,[removed],cryptocurrency
investing,Talk to me about Big Lots ($BIG),"A few interesting things I'm seeing in their financial statements:  


\-Gross margins are strong and have little variation between then for the years 2011-2020. The company can make money in their sleep because what they do is profitable (closeout retail). Revenue growth is profitable and they have a large store foot print of 1,400+ stores. Usually in lower income areas and you can see this by the growth of shrink (inventory theft) as the company expands their store footprint.

\-SGA has grown faster than EBIT margins. EBIT margins have never been higher than SGA growth. So it's not a business issue but may be a corporate issue?  


\-They've bought back an aggressive amount of stock over the past ten years. When you look at how fast the company has bought back stock and decided to pay a dividend as well it does give the first impression that management is very shareholder friendly. We do love buybacks and dividends. But they've reduced their shares outstanding at the expense of increasing their debt levels. Total liabilities have grown over 14% over the last ten years. Buybacks lower the cost of equity to a degree but now the company seems to be slowly growing more dependent on debt.

\-They've had some annoying accounting moments such as discontinued operations when KB Toys went bankrupt years ago. They also sold off a distribution center in CA last year and relocated it to Apple Valley, CA. That gain on sale was 53% of their 2020 EBIT. Pull that out and EBIT crashed hard in 2020. And even if you do leave that gain on sale in you have to ask yourself how they're going make that sale happen again. You can't sell the same building twice.

\-Management links executive performance bonuses to ROIC improvements. I get worried quickly when I see companies talk about ROIC because ROIC, like EBITDA, is a non-GAAP metric. When I read Southwest Airlines' 10-K (pre-2020) they included a calculation for ROIC there that the company uses. At best I just ignore it and see it as pandering to shareholders because we care about ROIC growth. At worst I think it's the company trying to tie themselves to more non-GAAP metrics for compensation. Non-GAAP metrics that can stuffed.

\-Adjust for buybacks (I did this by looking through the footnotes to find the amount of shares they bought back and added it back to their outstanding share count for the year in question, and adding back the cash spent on buybacks to shareholders equity). And the capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF. FCF also has to be adjusted a bit because of how their CFFI section handled acquisitions in the past and PPE sales as well. So what I ended up doing was CFFO-capex+PPE sales-acquisitions. Then I calculated just CFFO-capex-acquisitions. Pick either FCF calculation and the capital base has still grown faster than that. 

\-DSI (calculated as ending inventory divided by cost of goods sold multiplied by 365 days as I was using the 10-K documents for all of this) has grown from 51 days in 2011 to 63 days in 2020. It was at 67 days in 2019. Now this may be justifiable because they make a lot of their money from furniture and home decor sales and there's only so many buyers that go to Big Lots that can afford furniture on a predictable basis. But this growth has me worried that they don't know how to manage inventories properly. 2020 isn't going to help that either because their buying base more than likely lacks cash to decorate their homes. So what can they do if their debt load continues to grow in light of potential closures occurring again? Debt will grow (leases and accrued expenses especially) but smaller revenues so will they do consignment sales to get inventory down? Will they cut prices at their stores? Will they do a capital raise and dilute shareholders even more? I don't know and that's what makes this difficult.

\-Management: Bruce Thorn, the former CEO of Tailored Brands, left TB to go to Big Lots. Now I'm not going to act as though Tailored Brands going into bankruptcy was all on him. That's not fair of anyone to say since nobody could predict COVID or Amazon having taken over almost all of the retail world. But I do have to take note that he probably saw a lot of the issues Tailored Brands have and was unable to stop them, leading to their ultimate bankruptcy. I can't just ignore that.

stocks,Market Recap - Wed Oct 7 Please Enjoy!,"**Summary**

Stocks were on a run today, climbing steadily higher all the way into close, fueled by hope stemming from President Trump’s tweets on the push to approve $1,200 checks and support for Airlines.

The SPY finished up 1.73%, the QQQ up 1.8%, and the DIA up 1.85%. Additionally the small cap IWM is up 2.18% for the day, and the Biotech etf IBB closed up 2.22%.

Yesterday in the early afternoon, Trump announced that he would stop all Stimulus talks until after the election. The markets saw a very significant slide off, only recouping a bit of the losses by the close. However, later in the day, going back on his word he made two significant tweets which helped to push the markets higher today. “If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY. I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” and the second was about the airlines “The House &amp; Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, &amp; 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!”

During today, Speaker Pelosi conducted an interview on ABC’s “The View” where she signaled willingness to keep discussions open, but disparaged the idea of stand-alone bills. She continues to support the idea that a one comprehensive package in the order of $2 Trillion must be passed in whole. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said “We don’t have time to save the economy piece by piece. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told us, we need to act now and act big”.

It is worth noting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin have constantly been advocating that with all the Fed has done, still more direct stimulus from Congress is needed to aid with the recovery. Many feel it is unfortunate to see that the stimulus has become a ground to push political agendas, while the ones who pay the price are the regular American citizens.

Tonight there will be a vice presidential debate between Kamala Harris, and current VP Mike Pence. According to a report published by Marketwatch the stakes will be high as ""Vice President Pence must put in a strong performance against the democratic nominee, Sen Kamala Harris of California, to turn the electorate's attention away from the first presidential debate and a barrage of negative news coverage related to Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization"".

On other fronts, hotspots for Coronavirus are picking up, with the latest restrictions coming from New York. The rule will come into effect on Friday and will affect businesses, houses of worships and schools. Boston has also delayed the reopening of schools for a week. India is closing in on the US to become the country with most infections, adding 78k new cases, more than double of the US, to total 6.8M vs the 7.7M total cases in the US.

Vaccine developments continue to move forward with the White House and FDA finally on agreement on the guidelines to approve for Emergency use. Also, During the John Hopkins University Vaccine Symposium, Operation Warp Speed Chief says within next month or two ""We feel comfortable"" that we will have one or two efficacious candidates to deliver doses to 30M people by Nov or Dec 2020 as per reports on the event by Benzinga. The story on Trump’s recovery is that he has been treated with a cocktail with treatments from GILD and REGN and is currently recuperating presenting mild to no symptoms according to a report by CNBC.

personalfinance,Anyone try borrowing against their investments to boost returns?,"Looks like you can borrow from M1finance [at 2% up to 35% of your portfolio](https://www.m1finance.com/how-it-works/borrow/). Those rates... are really low (for now at least).

Even an ultra-short ETF [is paying 2.36%](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vubfx) right now. That's only a spread of .36% so probably not worth it considering the gains will be taxable but the margin would not be deductible. But, it could make sense for a low risk fund like VASIX. The time horizon is 3-5yrs and returns about 5.3%, yielding a spread of about 3%.

The main risk I see is that there could be a drawdown [of up to 4.3%](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vasix/risk) while interest rates shot up. The premise of central banking is to drop interest rates when equities falter though. I guess it's possible your principle assets could drop 65%, forcing you to exit the position during the drawdown to avoid the margin call. If you're borrowing against long term assets, then it's likely near-balanced. Very rare but it (barely) happened in 2008. Even in that case your drawdown on your overall portfolio would only be 1.5% (.35 \* 4.3%) and you'd reset. Meanwhile, you'd be earning a spread of 3% for as long as interest rates stay low, which is the foreseeable future according to the Fed.

It's not risk-free but it looks to me like a very low risk way to add 1%/yr returns to your portfolio (or more but then you're entering leverage territory since the risks are no longer negligible).",finance

personalfinance,Selling home...want to pay off one large balance,"When my home sells I will have enough to pay off one total large balance. They are roughly the same amount and same interest rate. One is just significantly older than the other.

I wont be selling my home until spring but the profits due to the current market will leave me with a signficant profit after paying my mother back the balance for the renovations she paid for that I've been paying monthly on (otherwise I own the home outright - no mortgage).

I'll be moving in with my long term SO after the house is listed but the rest of the balance I plan to invest and keep as a savings/worst case scenario fund. I wont have to hurry or rush to pay it since there will be no mortgage to pay and my mother is fine waiting for her end balance payment when it sells after its listed.

Both balances are 16k and some change. 

1. fed loan on two different loans with a combined interest rate of 4.5% - of course these are not gaining interest currently till Jan 1st 2021 so anything paid goes to the principle. These balances have been on my credit for the past 7 years. Payment is income based at like 50-something a month though I pay significantly more so I can pay down the principle.

2. interest 3.2% for my vehicle which was bought in April 2020 (so loan will be about a year old when I have $ to pay off). The vehicle is worth about 22k thanks to getting a significantly good deal on it due to covid19 and car sales being low. Current payment is 285 a month. I hate having this payment but it was a necessary evil thanks to my previous vehicle finally busting.

If you were in my shoes, which would you pay? Theoretically I could pay off both but I would prefer to have a significant nest egg and safety net though my employment is pandemic proof (funeral and cremation insustry).  I've never made enough to have a good savings and money to put significantly towards retirement/invest in my retirement.",finance
personalfinance,Is my emergency fund too big?,"I currently make $95k and saved up $17k I dedicated as my emergency fund....I also have an additional $3k saved up cause I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it yet lol....so $20k in all.

I got bored of my job as and went hunting for a new one. I have ~3 years experience as a Software Engineer. To my surprise I had...no problem finding one. I ended up getting multiple offers and choosing one I liked. I'm going to now be making $107k.

It made me think...maybe a 6 month emergency fund is too much. Given I was able to find multiple jobs within 1.5 months. To where, the main thing if I lose my job, it's not gonna hurt bad. I might have been too conservative.

I think maybe I should instead take half of my emergency fund and use it to pay loans.

I'm also going to have a $5k sign on and a $9k in PTO not used.

I have debt wise....

* $10k to buyout my car lease.
* ~$20k in loans at ~7% interest rate.
* ~$20k in student loans at ~4% interest rate.

So all in all with this new job, I'll have $34k in savings. I have to buy this car next June or a car, so that's $10k. If I keep 3 months savings as an emergency fund then the savings is now down to $15k I could use to pay my loans off. With all that I could reasonably pay off the higher interest loan in a few months. It took me like 7-9 months to save up $20k (previously only had $5k to my name and was spending like an idiot and not saving.) Then in the next year pay off the other loans and be debt free.

Alternatively, I could keep the emergency fund at 6 months and pay off both loans within 2 years.


All this said I have been saving to my 401k. I save enough so with my contribution and my employers it's 15%.

personalfinance,Is It Possible To Repair Your Own Credit Without Paying Credit Repair Firm?,"**Note, I know it's ""possible"" to do it.  As my general contractor always says, ""anything is possible"".  But what I really mean is, can I realistically do this myself?

Back story:

Mistake #1 - I left college with roughly $100k in student loan debt.  I am, embarrassingly, one of those idiots who really didn't understand what student loans meant.  I was young and had no real guidance from anyone in my life except for... ""you HAVE to go to college"". My parents never went, neither did any of my aunts or uncles, or grandparents.  But growing up, it was ingrained in my brain that when I graduate high school, I will go to college.  All I knew, was that every semester, in order to stay in school, I had to go to the financial aid office and sign some financial aid forms.  So I did.  As stupid as it sounds, I really had no idea what I was signing.  And it has fucked with me for the last 15 years.  

Mistake #2: When I graduated, I moved to a major city with no money and a dream.  No seriously, I am another one of those idiots who believed I was special enough to make it ""big"".  Well, I was wrong.  I struggled. Hard. It didn't help that it was spring of 2008, juuuuust as the economy decided to die, and there was no work. I barely paid rent working 2, to 3, to 4 jobs at a time. All minimum wage. All part time or seasonal.  If it wasn't for my then girlfriend (now wife), I would have been homeless.  It's that simple.  I made enough money to pay my portion of the rent and utilities, and some food.  Anything else I put on credit cards.  

Mistake #3: I relied on credit cards to live.  Yes it was a mistake, but I really don't know what I would have done without them.  For better or worse, they helped.  I eventually met someone who set me straight, and helped me create a budget, and I tackled my debt and finances properly, which probably saved my life as well. 

Over the course of the next 6-8 years, I completely ignored my student loan debt.  I simply couldn't spare a penny to pay them.  Not to mention, 5 out of the 9 loans I had were private loans.  After 3 months of non-payment, those went into default, and eventually to collections. The government issued loans were much more generous.  I was able to apply for deferments and forbearance's. All the while, that debt just kept going up and up and up. I easily owed about $135k in just a few years. 

About 5-6 years ago, I started getting calls from collection agencies trying to settle the debt from the private loan companies. By this time, i had gotten my finances in much better shape (although still not great), but I was finally making a living wage, and was able to start saving money.  I negotiated significantly lower payouts by paying off the loans in full.  For example, I had one debt that was around $29,000. They offered me a payout of $15,000. I told them I had $7800, and they took it. Wiped the debt clean.  Another one was like $15,000, they offered me a payout of $8,000, I told them I had $4,000, and they took it.  Those numbers aren't exact, but it was close.  you get the idea.  

Fast forward to today.  My only debt is now to 2 federal loans, in which I am making progress on.  They are both current,  and in good standing.  The interest is absolutely killing me, though. But that's another story for another day. I have no outstanding credit card debt. My only other debt is my car. I am in a MUCH better financial position than ever in my life.  I pay all my bills on time, and when i check my credit score, I have mostly great ratings.  The thing thats killing my score is that I have these settled debts from debt collectors on my credit.  

My wife and I bought a house in late 2018, but really, it was just her.  She's the bread winner, and was able to get the loan based off of her credit alone.  But she decided to leave the private sector and work for the government, and she took a massive paycut (but she loves what she does now, so it was worth it).  When the interest rates plummeted due to covid, we looked into refinancing, but her income was no longer high enough, and we needed mine as well.  But my credit just wasn't good enough.  The mortgage firm recommended a credit repair firm to help repair my credit. They made it sound like by getting those settled debts removed from my credit, my credit score would sky rocket.  But they wanted like a LOT of money to do this.  

So my extremely long winded story leads to this question: Can I fix my credit without using a firm like this?",finance
personalfinance,Should I buy points and finance closing cost to lower my mortgage payment when refinancing?,"I got quotes from a couple of companies and I'm about to go with this one company that can save me about $250/mon. I just closed on my first home this January so I still have a lot of years/amount to pay. Fyi, my credit is over 760 and I work in a very secure job field. 

I got a couple rates from this one company and they're kind of forcing me to buy points which I'm reluctant to  do so. This point along with title fees and such are rolled into the mortgage so not only I'm buying points but paying interest by financing it. What's interesting is that even with buying+financing points, my monthly payment is still going to be about $250/mon cheaper than what I'm paying now.

I feel like I'm being conned by buying AND financing points+closing cost but lowering interest rate AND my monthly mortgage is too sweet to pass on. 

I asked and did get a slightly higher rate without buying points but because the rate is higher on this, my monthly payment is actually about $40 higher than financing points. (aha! that's how they make money!- I realized) So, because I feel like being conned by buying+financing points, I want to go with no points option but I'll be paying slightly higher monthly payment although it's still going to be about $230 cheaper than my current one. 

What's your advice?

personalfinance,Do not use Capital One's web site to mail a check,"Posting this in hopes that anyone else planning to use Capital One to mail an important check rethinks that decision and avoids some pain in the future.

Husband and I are in the process of closing on a home purchase financed with a mortgage. 

We've been stashing money in a Capital One 360 account because when we first decided to open a joint account, ING was a good online bank with a relatively high interest rate for checking, and we could sign up for together right away. ING later got acquired by Capital One. 

In late August we ordered a Cashier's Check directly from their site. We paid to have it sent FedEx 2 day to the seller's attorney and got a tracking number. All normal stuff.

Our mortgage company requested a copy of the check. As it turns out, Capital One does not let you view some checks online ""including Bill Pay checks, checks sent through Mail A Check, checks converted to ACH withdrawals, and checks mailed for deposit."" [citation](https://www.capitalone.com/support-center/bank/view-check-image)

We called customer service and asked if they could mail us a copy, and they assured us they would.

After not receiving the copy for two weeks, we stopped by a branch. Turns out CO360 accounts are not serviced by branches but they still kindly put in an inquiry for us.

Two chats and two more phone calls, and they have let us know that they have no ability to issue a new check due to limitations of their own software, and no ability to track the status of the first check they claim they mailed. 

I tweeted at them earlier this week and they said they escalated our case but it would take TWENTY business days to hear back. While closing on an house, this is how they handle ESCALATING an issue for customers that have banked with them for a decade and held a consistently high balance.

investing,"PIC. (XL Fleet) My first foray into DD, not my first EV/Green Play, and a long play for me.","Hi everyone. 

First off, thanks for stopping by to check out my post. 

I’d like to share a little bit about PIC, which will be merging with XL Fleet (ticker will be XL) sometime in the 4th quarter. 

I have been playing SPAC’s since I started investing/trading 7 months ago like a lot of people. What I have found most interesting with PIC, is not that it is a green play, or that they convert existing vehicles on the road to hybrids, or that they have actual products on the road already with revenue to hit $75M next year, but the idea that the stock is currently valued at its “pre-merger” announcement price. 

The stock is at 10.50 as I type this up. 

As far as SPAC’s have gone lately, they are on a slow bleed the last two weeks or so. PIC, and the XL announcement, came at a bad time for these plays, three weeks ago. The stock only spiked to $13 and change, and has slowly fallen back to where it is now. 

Here’s the DD as I see it. XL Fleet has FedEx, DHL, Pepsi, and Verizon lined up and is hoping to have to 100,000 vehicle installs in the next 18 months. These powertrains get added into Ford and Chevy vehicles, instantly transforming them into hybrids and can save companies money. 

Green tech tends to be hot now, PIC is at a total bargain, and XL Fleet had an actual product, on the roads, and ready to go. 

I hope this helps some of you, and my position is long at 1,200 shares at 11.29 average. I have averaged down from my initial purchase at 12.50. 

Here is a link to more info as well. 

https://wccftech.com/xl-fleet-merger-pivotal-all-time-high/

Thanks for checking this out.

Bitcoin,Upcoming Fed Coin/Crypto Dollar,"While I like the fact that decentralized crypto currency gives people the power over their own money, I think the upcoming Fed Coin/digital dollar is going to be complete tyranny. 

The Federal Reserve and other private banks will issue this crypto currency soon, remove cash from society and make it to where you have to use it. If you are considered a dissenter you will just have your Fed Coin zapped from your account, won't be able to get loans, they will have complete control over your money. If you give your child $100 for his/her birthday BAM it's taxed at 20%, your kid spends that $80 BAM taxed again at 20% and over and over until it's all eaten up through taxation. Under the table transactions will be impossible.

I think crypto currency is about to be used for control over people and world governments are likely to shut down crypto exchanges and make it illegal to use alternate money. Look at china and their social credit score system, we're moving more and more towards a surveillance state and the last key is the crypto dollar.

Anyone that says this is all conspiracy can just look back at the first stimulus bill of this year, the US congress already tried passing it, it's just a matter of time until they succeed.

personalfinance,Should I skip college in my 20s and study in my 30s?,"M25, I dropped out of college at around 20 and moved to the U.S. Since then I have had little debt, a credit score that keeps oscillating between 700 and 790, and I am still paying off a car in which I never missed any payments but I still got about 2 and a half years left to pay. ( Initially it was high interest rate of around 20% I think but when my credit hit 790 I refinanced it to 2.00%. Never missed any payment.)

The thing is, Florida is expensive overall and they *demand* that you work a lot of hours to make ends meet. Fortunately, I am single but my car payments and car insurance are holding me back financially to start paying for a house and I actually wanna prioritize that over college in my 20s and maybe study in my 30s because I don't plan on getting mixed up with student loan debt in my 20s.

I might not actually study at all because I am trying to avoid more debt in Florida, although I am doing okay financially. I am also gonna pay off my car insurance completely all the way through May 2021 and that will be done this month, saving up up $167 a month all the way through May.

I also have $1300 in credit card debt (I used my card more due to car insurance taking a financial toll on me) which I plan on paying off next year with my tax returns but then I realized yesterday that the returns may be diminished since I traded on Robinhood this year. Dammit.

But whatever, it is what it is. I'll just take what I can get from that and combine it with small payments made this year. This next paycheck is gonna be rough since I'm gonna bite the bullet and pay the insurance completely which should help me long-term with the card and car payment.

I think the car was a double-edged sword in my 20s because it DID help raise my credit to where it is but it also became a huge financial burden to me. It really did set me back years and I don't wanna be set back further because of college, especially when I am doing okay right now.

personalfinance,"Please help me get my brother's finances back on track. 35yo, 36k CC debt, $58k Student Loans, $51k in Savings, Sparse Income","In California. My brother's finances are all over the place and I am trying to help him get things organized. The main problem is he works in a niche creative field (stylized art for tv/film production) and there is only intermittent work. As soon as a project finishes he has to find a new job. Projects usually run 3-12mo and he is paid $35/hr. He puts almost 25% pre-tax into an employer sponsored 401k which I think is very high considering he has $36k in CC debt across 6 cards and a $58k student loan. His method was basically to put as much in savings &amp; retirement as possible while working, and use savings to get by while finding the next job. However over several years the credit card debt continued piling up in between.

His most recent job ended in August and he qualifies for $450/week in unemployment, but the job market for his field has dried up due to COVID and it doesn't look like he will find employment soon. He is exploring other positions in slightly different fields but pay is almost $10/hr less than his regular salary around $25/hr. Regardless, we are working on this part and in the meantime, he can at least rely on $450/week.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a breakdown:

**Income**:

$450/week unemployment, not withholding tax = $1800/mo

\~$200/mo selling misc art/products on eBay

**Savings**:

$18,300 cash in a savings account

$33,200 in retirement funds ($17,200 in Fidelity IRA, $8,800 in Fidelity 401K, $7,200 in Vanguard IRA)

**Debts:**

$58k federal student loans ($47k principal, $11k interest due to $0/mo IBR payment qualification and almost no payments since 2015. This is concerning to me.)

$36k credit card debt over 6 cards, most with 24-29% APR.

**Expenses**:

$800/mo rent/utilities

$100/mo groceries

$940 in credit card minimum payments

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, unemployment just covers his expenses so he's not going into the hole (at least not by much if any) but the credit cards are eating up more than half of his income in just minimum payments. Would it be at all a good idea to take advantage of the CARES Act 401K/IRA withdrawal and just pay off all the credit cards, then direct that extra $940/mo toward student loans and savings? Should he borrow against it instead? I feel like would just be opening another can of worms. Please help me out here. I feel like he could be in a much better place if things were just organized for him. Please let me know if I need to provide any other information. Thank you",finance
personalfinance,What to do with a significant pay increase for a few years,"I am a 38/M making approximately $115,000 a year. Was previously married (divorced about 3 years now) with a child and after the divorce only really left with debt. Only said that to say why I pretty much have no savings. I have been grinding down the debt though and only have 5K of CC debt left at about 20% and a car loan of $18.5K at 6%.

I have a public sector job and in January I will be moving overseas and my pay will jump to $150,000K per year. This is a temporary post so I will be there for 5 to 7 years. I'm trying to see how someone manages their pay that is only temporarily higher than usual. Added information to the story is that I'm engaged and will be getting married in about September to someone that out earns me even at my higher pay. She has her stuff together and I really want mine together before tying the knot again.

I know I should pay off the CCs and the car before bolstering my emergency fund (at least I think so) and with the pay bump I am optimistic I can pull that off before the big dance. What exactly do I do after that? I can't have a long term solution as my pay will drop back down when I return home but at least I will be debt free by that time and have two incomes in the household (fiancé is a rock star and is already debt free with a savings that puts me to shame). Do I simply make a 5 year plan? 

After my debt is paid even if I max my TSP (401k for govies) after my emergency fund is full, what exactly do I do with my extra? Early calculations is that I will be netting about 9k a month (federal retirement is automatically removed from my pay). I am moving to an expensive place (part of the reason the pay jumps so much) so I think my monthly bills should be about  3.5k a month after I have paid off the car/CCs. Add another 1k for child support, about 1.5K for max TSP contribution per month and I am looking at $3K extra per month to invest somehow. I have not had this at my disposal since I was married and frankly am not sure how to proceed. 

Also pointing out that I didn't add in much for emergency savings each month as I talked to my fiancé about our finances. We will be semi-separate. Our together accounts will be the one for paying bills and the emergency fund but since hers is funded she will just put what she has into ours and there will not be much left then to get it to where it needs to be. I am also not even factoring in her income on helping with the bills (which will be about half). Some guidance on what to do with the extra 3K+ per month for the next 5 years or so would be great.

personalfinance,Graduate student receiving fellowship and not sure what to do with the extra funding.,"I am a graduate student who recently was awarded a fellowship that will give me an additional $20k a year for the next 2 years and I am trying to figure out the best way to utilize these funds. The funds will be split into two payments a year ($10k each semester) and will first go through my university, and then be deposited into my personal account. I should receive the first payment in a few weeks. I have confirmed that my university is not keeping any of the funding for themselves and will not take out any taxes. The extra funding is an almost 50% increase in my yearly income, which is really exciting. I'm 24 and halfway through my program, single with no kids. Here's some background on my finances:

I receive a monthly taxed stipend from the program and have a second job that together mostly keep me afloat. I will continue to receive the stipend and plan to keep the second job for the time being. I live in a HCOL area and don't get paid much as a grad student, but I'm usually able to stay within my budget (which before COVID included paying some loans). 

I currently have about $6k in my checking account, $12k in an Ally savings account, and $2k in a Vanguard target date fund that I opened this June. My program does not offer any retirement/investment benefits.

My only debt is student loans. I have the following unsubsidized federal loans: 

$5.4k at 4.6%

$5.4k at 4.3%

$5.5k at 3.7%

$9.8k at 6%

The loans are currently deferred since I am in school, but I normally pay off the interest + a few dollars more on the lower ones, and pay about $600 of the 6% loan per month. This loan was originally $20k so I've been able to make a good dent in it. Since interest rates for federal loans have been set to 0% until the end of December, I haven't been paying them for the last few months . When the 0% rate went into effect, my plan was to save some money until December, then keep about half of my savings account as a rainy day fund/contribute to my Roth IRA and use the rest to pay off most of the 6% loan. 

I'm still planning to do that by December, but now that I know that I'm receiving a small windfall in a few weeks I'm trying to figure out what the smartest thing to do with that money is. The fellowship money can be used for graduate school expenses such as rent, medical, childcare, etc. however I don't think it can be used for investing since it is not actual income (please correct me if I am wrong). It is considered a fellowship/scholarship by the IRS, so I am only exempt from taxes on it if I use the money for something directly related to schooling.

What is the best way for me to utilize and manage this money? Should I open a separate account for the fellowship money? Ideally I would like to use it towards my work, but at the moment I don't have a need for equipment, travel funds, or anything else research related. There is a possibility that I will use the funding field work next year, but it will probably not be this year. If I don't touch the money until next year, will I have to pay taxes on it even if it is not used for anything?

personalfinance,Trying to determine whether or not it's in my best interest to refinance my house right now (TX),"So - pertinent information:

I have two homes, one that I rent out and one that I live in. The home that I'm talking about refinancing would be the primary residence that I live in.

The two homes are the only debts that I or my wife have, and we are both on both loans.

We use credit cards for almost everything and payoff the balance every month.

My credit score is currently 805, and my wife's is also right around 800.

Combined we make $170k-$180k/year pre-tax. We have about $30k in savings right now. $17k of that we have tagged as emergency funds, and $14k just as 'savings'.

**Information on the mortgage for the home that I rent out:**

Balance: $170k  
Interest Rate: 3.375%  
Principle and Interest: $1,007.98/mo  
Remaining Term: 26 years  
Home Value: $250k  

**Information on the mortgage for my primary residence (the one being refinanced):**  

Balance: $395k  
Interest Rate: 4.000%  
Principal and Interest: $1,933.05/mo  
Remaining Term: 29 years (so purchase the home just over a year ago)  
Home Value: $450k  

Both mortgages are through the same credit union that we use for our savings and checking. On the credit union's website they are advertising 3.25% on a 30-year fixed rate refinance.

We plan to keep my current primary residence for at least 5 years, and are targeting more like 10 years.

So I'm a little in the dark about what to consider with a home refinance, and have a few questions:

1. Is 3.25% a good rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage refinance right now? Or would it be beneficial for me to shop somewhere else?  
2. I assume it costs money up front to refinance just for them to process is it. What is a ballpark of what that would cost?  
3. How much would dropping my interest rate from 4.000% to 3.250% save me per payment? Also perhaps over the 10 years? Would I just multiply monthly savings by 120?  
4. Does it matter that I just got this loan 14-15 months ago?

stocks,Methane emissions reduction - the unconventional green energy play,"(posting here because wsb as been a shitshow for years now. Position: 25k shares in $QST on the TSX)

Everyone is talking about green tech these days. Sure, democrat sweep in November and whatnot sets the stage for growth in clean energy.

But what is clean energy? Most people think CO2 is reduced through expanding in wind and solar. After all, the top 10 holdings of ICLN are wind and solar companies. Others will talk about overpriced electric car companies. Blah. 

But really, clean tech is going to come from improving the fossil fuel industry. 80% of power production and more than 90% of CO2e still come from fossil fuel sources in the US. The most potent GHG is methane, 25x more greenhouse potential than the same amount of carbon dioxide.

Its puzzling that: 

* Wind and solar and other renewables (mostly hydro, in the US) make up about 10% of energy production. We've seen nothing but hype hype hype coming out of the sector

* Methane emissions make up about 10% of the total CO2e emissions from any source. We've seen not a single peep out of the sector

Why is it that nobody is talking about the companies that do methane emissions reduction? For one, the companies are small and obscure, and most of them privately held. Two, their business is tied to the oil and gas sector, which has bad press among investors.

However, investors be damned, governments are paying attention:

1. Government of Canada has a [$750 million](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/funding-partnerships/funding-opportunities/current-funding-opportunities/emissions-reduction-fund/22781) methane emissions reduction grant, to fund capital investments in methane reduction for oil and gas companies (probably starting sometime next year)

2. State level, Colorado has been making big strides in methane regulation through the state’s Air Quality Control Commission and, to a lesser extent, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. California's Landfill Methane Regulation (LMR) requires municipal solid waste landfills to reduce methane and other air pollutant emissions through emissions monitoring and through capturing fugitive methane. North Dakota, etc

3. Federally, the Obama admin has made a number of regulatory moves through the EPA re: methane emissions from landfills and from oil and gas sources. Trump has rolled it back. These two articles may be of interest: [1](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/it-cannot-survive-why-trump-s-rollback-methane-rule-might-lose-court#:~:text=Under%20its%20rule%2C%20the%20Trump,processing%20segments%20of%20the%20industry.), [2](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2020/01/31/the-status-of-methane-regulation-in-the-u-s/) 

**What are we looking at, in the future?**

The Biden campaign has already said that “[o]n day one, Biden will use the full authority of the executive branch to make progress and significantly reduce emissions” including by “[r]equiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations.” 

This, coupled with the trend of increased methane regulation across the world, creates an opportunity for companies that provide technology to capture or flare methane. Canada's grant alone is several times larger than the entire methane reduction industry.

In order to meet GHG targets, countries will have to aggressively target methane as it is a much more potent source of CO2e, and since it is concentrated mostly at point sources, it is much easier to control.

All it takes is a few regulatory steps in the right direction to to make the industry a big one

**Questor?**

* Their business is renting or selling enclosed incinerators that turn methane into CO2

* They're the only ISO ETV certified clean combustion company

* their business is currently mostly Colorado, ND, a bit in canada and a bit elsewhere

* no debt (except lease oblig and tax liabilities)

* 17MM in property and equipment (for rental)

* 15MM in cash

* like everyone else tethered to O&amp;G, they suffered quite a bit in the COVID downturn. But they're making it their priority to capture market share and enter new markets, while preserving the clean balance sheet. 

* they're also expanding their services to include methane emissions monitoring

**anyways, I think its an excellent industry with a lot of asymmetry in payoff (big money from regulations) vs risk (its already hammered down). Questor is a great company and I'm looking for a dip to buy more. Also, I would welcome if you have any suggestions about the industry and other players in it. Or any thoughts**",finance

stocks,Worried About the U.S. Stock Market? Buy Alibaba Options.,"China might be the best hedge for U.S. stocks.

Key Chinese indexes and stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, and investor sentiment suggests that Asia might even emerge as an economic haven, as America and Europe are still struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: ASHR), a proxy for mainland China’s stocks, is up 18% this year, compared with 6% for the S&amp;P 500 index.

Shares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), one of China’s most important companies, are up 36% this year. Alibaba, given its broad scope, might just help investors insulate their portfolios at a time of unusual duress in U.S. history—acting in the role once occupied by fixed income when it was an effective offset to equity weakness.

When President Donald Trump surprisingly ended stimulus negotiations with a Tuesday tweet, U.S. stocks sank. Many Chinese stocks, notably Alibaba, held up.

Hedging U.S. portfolios with Chinese stocks, particularly Alibaba, might seem outlandish, but Susquehanna Investment Group, a top options-trading firm that seeks out noncorrelated U.S. equity investments, has significant China exposure. The secretive trading company owns a huge piece of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, that could be worth more than $15 billion. The investment would probably dwarf anything the firm’s partners have ever realized in a long history of extraordinary success.

Alibaba will never protect a portfolio the way traditional hedges, such as S&amp;P 500 options, do, but Alibaba’s options premiums and stock price aren’t as distorted ahead of the bizarre U.S. presidential election. Trading volumes on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, are stunningly anemic during the oddest trading year since the 2008-09 financial crisis, suggesting that investors have little faith that VIX derivatives will work as expected.

But adding China exposure, especially Alibaba, to a portfolio offers hedging through diversification.

Alibaba will hold its annual Singles Day event on Nov. 11. For 24 hours, Alibaba will host an online sale and celebration that makes Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Prime Day seem like a Rotary Club luncheon. The company will probably report quarterly earnings in early November.

In 2019, Singles Day sales totaled $38 billion, up from $31 billion in the previous year. This year’s event will indicate how much Asian consumers have recovered from the coronavirus. Powerful sales results will intrigue investors who are worried about the sclerotic U.S. and European economies and concerned about political mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.

With Alibaba’s stock at $296.50, investors can sell Alibaba’s November $295 put for $18.20 and buy Alibaba’s November $300 call for $17.60. The trade generates a credit of 60 cents. If Alibaba’s stock is at $310 at expiration, the call is worth $10. Should the stock price be below the put strike price at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock at the strike price, or to cover the put at a higher prices.

During the past 52 weeks, Alibaba’s stock has ranged from $161.68 to $299. Shares are up 80% over the past year.

Alibaba’s attraction extends beyond hedging and diversification. The stock monetizes the rise of Asia’s middle class, which is one of the world’s greatest economic trends. Alibaba’s scope is so broad that anyone who buys the stock essentially gets the Asian equivalent of a portfolio of companies similar to eBay (EBAY), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), FedEx (FDX), United Parcel Service (UPS), and the entertainment studios.

Reports indicate that China’s economy is already recovering from the coronavirus. Goldman has even advised clients that Asia is well positioned compared with other areas because it has contained the virus. The irony is unpleasantly rich.",finance

These two articles may be of interest: [1](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/it-cannot-survive-why-trump-s-rollback-methane-rule-might-lose-court#:~:text=Under%20its%20rule%2C%20the%20Trump,processing%20segments%20of%20the%20industry.), [2](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2020/01/31/the-status-of-methane-regulation-in-the-u-s/) 

**What are we looking at, in the future?**

The Biden campaign has already said that “[o]n day one, Biden will use the full authority of the executive branch to make progress and significantly reduce emissions” including by “[r]equiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations.” 

This, coupled with the trend of increased methane regulation across the world, creates an opportunity for companies that provide technology to capture or flare methane. Canada's grant alone is several times larger than the entire methane reduction industry.

In order to meet GHG targets, countries will have to aggressively target methane as it is a much more potent source of CO2e, and since it is concentrated mostly at point sources, it is much easier to control.

All it takes is a few regulatory steps in the right direction to to make the industry a big one

**Questor?**

* Their business is renting or selling enclosed incinerators that turn methane into CO2

* They're the only ISO ETV certified clean combustion company

* their business is currently mostly Colorado, ND, a bit in canada and a bit elsewhere

* no debt (except lease oblig and tax liabilities)

* 17MM in property and equipment (for rental)

* 15MM in cash

* like everyone else tethered to O&amp;G, they suffered quite a bit in the COVID downturn. But they're making it their priority to capture market share and enter new markets, while preserving the clean balance sheet. 

* they're also expanding their services to include methane emissions monitoring

**anyways, I think its an excellent industry with a lot of asymmetry in payoff (big money from regulations) vs risk (its already hammered down). Questor is a great company and I'm looking for a dip to buy more. Also, I would welcome if you have any suggestions about the industry and other players in it. Or any thoughts**",finance
personalfinance,Any American expats here? How are you saving for retirement etc.,"So I need to buckle down on saving for long term. I just finished my student loans this year before My 30th birthday and have 0 in credit card debt with a 815 fico score. I really just started saving majority of my salery after completing the loans since I was diverting most towards them because the interest rates were rather high at 7+%

I am a American living overseas in Asia. I File taxes every year but I don’t have to pay anything due to the foreign income exclusion since I am out of the country more than 11 months a year. But because I claim that, I cannot have a Roth IRA and I couldn’t sign up for a Vanguard due to some address issues. 

I have a Robinhood account but currently down 20% 

Currently looking at high yield savings account to keep easy to access money but also any other accounts for long term. Should I sign up for 401k even if not sponsored by a company?

I currently have a 8 month nest egg and some silver bullion. Majority of my paycheck is able to be saved since most cost are covered by employer since I am a expat and that’s pretty standard.

personalfinance,Long-term impact of greater TSP/retirement contributions vs additional down payment for house,"I am planning to buy a house in 1-2 years, and am starting to get my ducks in a row for that. Right now, I am maxing out my TSP (401k but government) contributions, but I could stop doing that, and save the additional cash to put more into my down payment. The extra cash wouldn't be the difference between being able to buy or not, it would just reduce the size of the loan and potentially reduce the interest rate.

Does anyone have any thoughts on, in generally, whether having the extra money invested or the smaller loan would be the bigger benefit long-term? My instinct is that the money is better in the TSP, because of the generally low rates for home loans.

Edit: I know it's hard to predict without the exact mortgage rates, but I need to make the decision of whether to change my contribution now, and won't be buying for a year or two, so hard to say where they will be then.",finance

personalfinance,Under what conditions would you abandon PSLF?,"I know this is a personal decision, but I was hoping to get some input on how to think through this problem.

My wife has \~$280k in med school dept, and with interest it's at \~$307k. She just finished fellowship after a 4-year residency and started a job at a large academic institution making $250k. I make $110k normally, but I've been at reduced pay since May, and full pay will be restored in mid-December. We have a 9 month old child, her credit score is mid 700s and mine is 800+.

We are on track via IBR to apply for PSLF in around 5.5 years (there are 6 payments that may not be eligible, need to call Fedloan), and had been encouraged by recent stories of people having their balances forgiven. The problem is, my wife is experiencing pretty profound burnout/[moral injury](https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/), and the work load at her new job has turned out to feel a lot like residency. She knows about community jobs in the region that pay up to $360k and require fewer shifts, but she wouldn't be applying until probably early 2022.

I want to encourage her to make the career shift that will lead to greater happiness and fulfillment, and I also want to make sure we are pursuing a sensible strategy for getting loans paid off. Given that refinance rates seem to be pretty competitive right now, would it make sense to refinance now, let the interest capitalize, and just start working aggressively on the loan balance? Or should we wait until she has that higher-pay/lower-stress job lined up and do it then? I am having a hard time figuring out how to balance these options against each other.

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Need help formalizing a 18 month strategy before buying a home,"Hi All,

Apologies for the wall of text. I was hoping to get some advice on what I should do next to plan for a house purchase in the future. I was initially targeting May using a FHA loan but I think my DTI is a bit too high for that to work out, so I'm now pushing it out to next May (2022).   


I started out 2019 with about $22k in savings but we ran into health issues (dad had a heart attack, partner got cancer) which sucked all of our savings up and put me about $50k into CC debt with no savings. Towards the end of the year, my old car died and needed a new motor so I opted to trade it in for something else as I didn't have the money to fix it. With so much debt and a credit score in the low 600s, I got really terrible loan terms.  


In an attempt to pull myself out of dire financial straights, I looked into one of those credit counseling services (they call and negotiate card terms for you) but decided that wasn't the right way forward. I ended up getting a consolidation loan for my CC debt in October 2019 which gave me breathing room. I know these can be risky if you're not responsible but I've now gone a year with no additional spend on cards - I run small recurring charges on all of them and PIF to keep the accounts active.   


I recognize the situation I'm in is mostly my fault with a couple curveballs thrown in due to life events I didn't think would ever happen. I grew up poor, started making a ton of money, was irresponsible with it, and now I'm here. I'm sure there were better ways to deal with medical debt but everyone is happy and healthy, and that's all that matters to me.   


Due to my experiences dealing with 2019, I've valued having money going into savings far more than restructuring debt to have more favorable terms. I know this isn't a smart idea but just don't want to be put into that spot ever again - even with COVID, I've managed to go from $0 in savings to $10k in savings. I'm hoping to get advice on what I should do next, with the end goal of buying a reasonable house (\~$200k) to get out of the cycle of renting and start building equity.   


**Current Situation:**  
Income: \~$125k/yr

Savings: $10k. I put about $500-$1000/mo into savings right now.

Other: I've been putting $600/mo into my 401k since February  


Student Loan Debt: \~$120k  
Consolidation Loan: \~$45k remaining, 51 payments remaining,  20.05% APR  
Car Loan: $15k remaining, 60 payments remaining, 12.4% APR  
CC Debt: $4k, on 0% APR balance transfer promo until December  


**Scores (Idk which one is best, I'm just happy they're above 700 again):**

FICO 8: 731  
FICO 9: 725

FICO 9 Auto: 719

FICO 9 Bankcard: 729   


I'm currently leaning towards a few options right now:

1) Refinance Car -  72 month term, 12.4% interest rate, $357.82/mo payment. I have consistently paid $500/mo since Feb, and that's factored into my budget. If I refinanced, the goal is not to lower payments but hopefully cut the term in half - since I'm budgeting $500/mo into payments and pay that, I think I could reasonably expect to get a 36mo term under $500.

2) Trade car in - Given my loan term is horrific, I was thinking of getting a used Chevrolet Volt. They're about $16k for one-owner, clean 2016-2017 models in my area. 99% of the trips I take could be done on battery, and I figure less maintenance will help make my budget more consistent. I'd put $5k down.

3) Refinance consolidation loan. 20% APR is really high, even if I can get this to 15% I think that'd probably be worth it. 

4) Pay off $6k in debt (CC + small Student Loan), spend the six months building my savings up, and try again to get a home in May.

5) Refinance both car and consolidation loan.  


Any help would be greatly appreciated - I've historically not been good with money and am trying to change that. I feel great about going a year being far more disciplined and am ready to improve things further.",finance
personalfinance,"A short guide to fixing your finances the lazy way.. at least, how I fixed mine.","A long time ago I used to struggle with my personal finances. I wasn't saving for retirement, I didn't have a savings account, and my checking account was, more often than not, in the negatives. I'd frequently blow my entire paycheck over a single weekend hitting up the bars and clubs with friends, sometimes I wouldn't even have enough money left to fill up my car so that I could go to work. I'd make the minimum payment on maxed out credit cards, which I had previously convinced myself to open to ""improve my credit score"", and then watch them like a hawk so that I would know when I could spend that extra $20 that was available to me. 

The worst part was, I didn't have a good reason or excuse. I had a decent job with steady pay. I was just flat out irresponsible, and I was struggling.  I wanted to change and to improve my finances; I even started reading everything I could to learn how to properly fix my financial issues. I just wasn't working and I didn't have the self control.

One day that changed for me. It was a small bit of advice that a little old lady who was working as a bank teller told me. It was simple advice, and it truly changed everything for me. She told me to open a second checking account for my bills and to protect my money from myself. This approach isn't all that different from the ""envelopes"" system or the You Need A Budget approach of dedicating each dollar to a purpose. It's not even anything overly sophisticated, and I'm not sure why this specific advice suddenly clicked. But it did, and  in an age where most money is electronic, that physical separation of accounts is what I needed. For whatever reason this common sense approach that alluded me.  Based on this advice, here is what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: Open a second checking account and a second savings account. These accounts will each be used for a specific purpose: Checking 1- Bills; Checking 2- Spending; Savings 1- Emergency Fund; Savings 2- Planned Future Purchases. If possible open them at a separate institution and don't get a debit card for them. By using a separate institution, you will be able to transfer funds if you ever have a real emergency; however, the 2-3 day transfer time should be enough to dissuade you from impulse buys or from just spending everything you have. Exactly where you setup these accounts is up to you; however, I'd recommend a ""high-yield"" online checking/savings account. It's not much interest but you might as well get as much as you can.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Figure out the minimum monthly payment for all of your bills, debts, etc. It doesn't matter if it's your rent/mortgage, cell phone, or that subscription box you just ""have"" to have.. If its a bill, its a bill; total it up. Multiply that number by 13, then divide it by however many paychecks you get a year. If there are things that you don't really need, consider cutting them out.. but the most important thing is to make sure that you are covering your bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3: You now know how much your paycheck is left after bills; figure out how much you want to save for an emergency.  The general recommendation is to keep 3-6 months of your pay in an emergency fund. That's a lot, and it takes time to get there. Instead start small, set a goal to have enough in your emergency fund to cover 1-2 months of pay a year from now. Just take your monthly pay check and divide it by the total number of paychecks you get a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4: Automate the F out of it. Most employer's let you set-up automatic financial allotments from your paycheck. Set one allotment up to go to your ""bills"" account (based on the amount you came up with in step 2), another allotment to go to your ""emergency account (amount in step 3), and the rest goes into your spending account. Then setup auto-pay for all of your bills from your ""bills"" account. (Note: make sure that you have enough money in your bills account to actually cover the auto-pay first).

Step 5: Unless it's an absolute emergency.. Don't touch your emergency or bills accounts. Similarly, unless it's an absolute emergency don't touch your credit cards.

From here things get a whole lot easier. It may not be overnight, but it will get easier. If you stick with it, your bills will be paid on time every month. A year from now you will have enough extra money in your bills account to cover 1 months of bills ahead of time, and 1-2 months worth of pay in your emergency fund. You might not be in perfect financial shape, but will be a whole lot better off. As you continue forward:

*  As you pay off individual debts, put that money towards paying off another debt (lowest balance, highest interest rate.. doesn't matter just put it to something to get it paid off sooner).
* If you want to buy something but don't have enough money in your spending account for it (or if using your spending money means you won't be able to eat) setup a recurring transfer to your ""Planned Future Purchases"" savings account. It might take a month, it might take a year, but you will get there
* any time you come into a little extra money (e.g. bonus, side gig, etc.) put at least half of it towards your bills. Then treat yourself with the remaining amount.
* Any time you get a pay raise, no mater how big or small, put at least half of that towards retirement, then split the rest between paying off bills and your spending. Keep doing this year after year until your retirement savings (whatever type of account(s) you decide on) is maxed.
* Once you have over 3-6 months of pay in your emergency savings, put anything extra towards debt (potentially excluding your mortgage). If you don't have any debt, put it towards a long term goal (like buying a car/house) or invest it.

&amp;#x200B;

As a final note.. I'm sure the above probably isn't the best or most optimal advice, but it worked for me. Hopefully someone else will find it useful.",finance

vet,Adopted 4 month old bottle fed kitten.,"Hi I just want to preface we've been to the vet already. I'm a new cat owner and my kitten Edgar has random bouts of diarrhea. No parasites. Nothing internal that we know of. A food allergy was definitely diagnosed and I agree. He is on royal canin sensitive tummy canned food and I feed sensitive stomach blue buffalo cruncher.(dry). Every few weeks he gets diarrhea but first his ears and paws get hot then the diarrhea. I take away food and reintegrate using very small meals and hes fine.
It's been 3 times.
First time was definitely his diet and the food I was feeding. (Premium food that I found out was recalled)
Second time he had jumped up on the counter and ate pie.
Third time was when I realized his ears and feet get hot before a bout of diarrhea it happened the second time too. Since the second bout I put dishes in the dish washer and dont leave anything out not even coffee. But he could've ate dog food which I keep out of h and s reach too.
His attitude is great, he drinks water and is very playful. 

I'm wondering if it has to do with being bottle fed? Or if its Crohns disease can cats get that? The vet said maybe IBS. I ordered pre and probiotic to add to his food. Obviously this may be a lifetime issue I'm prepared for that but is there anything else I can do any other kind of food that will work better?

Also could it be overfeeding? Or should I just feed wet food?
Any suggestions would be great. I should mention he is extremely large for a kitten his age.

Please dont shame me I'm doing my best.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 8. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**

Stocks rose again today, extending yesterday’s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump’s discharge from the hospital.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. 

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.”

According to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn’t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, “There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.” In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump’s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, “It’s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \[Tuesday’s\] close, and then the rally.” Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.

Shares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying “I took this medicine \[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\] and it was incredible.”

In other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea’s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization. 

**Highlights**

personalfinance,re: super high refi closing costs vs paying more in principal,"My partner and i have been living in our (hopefully) forever home for the past 4 years in New York.  We put 20% down, 30 year  fixed rate loan at about 2.8%. We have about 414,000 to go to pay off. I received a letter from the bank to suggest that we refi for a lower interest rate. We are comfortable with our month payments right now but are always trying to do the smart thing with our money.

I called the bank and had them run some numbers. The closing costs are an outrageous $9,000-$11,000. He said it was because new york is a mortgage tax state (1.3% where we are) which is one reason they are so high. So after running the numbers, it wouldn't even lower our monthly payments that much. We considered refi-ing into a 15 year but the monthly is higher than we'd feel comfortable with in case one of us lost our jobs. 

So now I am wondering if it just makes more sense to keep our current loan and make payments to the principal as if it was a 15 year. That way, we'd have our cushion in case one of us lost our jobs and can reduce the payments but we'd still be saving on all those years on interest. I did check that we don't have any penalties for prepayment of the loan.

I've checked out other posts where people suggested to put money into the market because the rate of return is higher; however we are extremely risk averse esp now with our political/corona climate. So we wouldn't choose to do that at this point. 

Any thoughts or advice appreciated!",finance

Forex,Break down this FT article about US rates,"Excerpt from an Financial Times articles regarding US bonds:

&amp;#x200B;

""Strategists at Morgan Stanley are even beginning to worry about a “rates scare”, a sudden move higher in government bond yields that could take the market by surprise, with big implications for US stocks. ""

  
""The big barrier to that is the Fed. A rapid decline in bond prices is likely to prompt a swift response from the US central bank. Having unleashed a torrent of liquidity to ensure financial conditions remain loose, the Fed is likely to show little tolerance for a destabilizing increase in rates that upends efforts to support the economy.  ""

  
""Some have already called on the central bank to alter its monthly $80bn Treasury bond-buying programme and focus the bulk of its purchases on longer-dated debt. Strategists at TD Securities reckon the Fed may be forced to act as early as December. ""

&amp;#x200B;

ELI5 what is happening? Is there worry that the recent treasury sell-off will drive Treasury yields too high, but why does that matter? I don't see the effects on the real economy, unless I guess this is a problem because institutions borrow/lending at floating rates will track the Treasury yields and thus borrowing becomes harder?

And re: the call to ""alter"" the 80 billion program; by buying more longer term Treasuries I guess that keeps rates down for the long term right? So that we don't need to worry about rates only being low for a short while?",finance
personalfinance,Monthly budget planning,"I asked a question about RSU's last week and you all were so very helpful! Thanks for that.

I want to start off making the right decisions, so how would you say I should plan to budget my money? A few specific questions:

1. Rent: I'm shopping for 1 bedroom apartments in Silicon Valley, and they're like 2-2.5K a month for a decent place. I have an apartment with my college friends in Berkeley where 4 of us share a nice 2 bedroom apartment, each paying around $1,200, which I think is a lot more reasonable. However, it's about a 1.5 hour one way commute from Berkeley to work (fortunately, we have transportation shuttles), so I'm not sure the 1K a month savings is worth that much trouble?
2. Investing: After saving for retirement, HSA, etc, I'm wondering how much should I put into the stock market? What is a good percentage of the money left over? I've done options trading in the past, but I kind of want to just have money passively grow in the stock market.
3. Other savings: I'm not sure how much is a reasonable spend per month; should I aim to save everything after fixed expenses? Is there any reason why I should open a savings account over putting money into the stock market?
4. Monthly income: I'm normalizing my salary by 12 months, though in reality, I get less per month but a few times a year (RSU vesting and bonus time), I can expect a fair bit more. Is this a reasonable way to think about monthly income?
5. Other than health insurance, are things like dental, life, etc useful?
6. Debt: I have around 13K in subsidized federal student loans, but my company is matching my annual payment up to a certain amount, and people on my previous post mentioned that I should try to get it from 7% to a lower percentage. I think I can do that. However, I also owe my parents around 80K for 1.5 years of school (I am from out of state). How should I pay that without paying tax? I heard anything over 10K is taxable? Would it be 20K since I'm technically paying two people back?

personalfinance,Question about monthly payment: does the minimum amount have an impact on life of the loan?,"In March 2020, I refinanced my private student loans of 65k to a ten year plan. I’ve been fortunate enough to be not be negatively affected by COVID, and I’ve been putting a lot of extra cash towards that loan. I’m down to 45k. I’ve knocked about 4 years off the life of the loan. 

My minimum payments are $665 and my interest rate is 4.2%. I’ve been seeing lower interest rates advertised and I’m considering refinancing again. 

My question is: in terms of paying off the loan ASAP, does the minimum payment have an impact? I’m currently paying an extra $2k a month on top of my $665 minimum payment and seeing great results. If the minimum payment went down to say $550, would I see even better results? Or does the minimum payment not really matter in that sense?

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense, it’s been one of THOSE weeks where my brain is fried and I just can’t figure out if my thought process makes sense lol.

i’m preparing data (in Pandas) for a machine learning Forex strategy.
Data comes from FRED, FXCM, Alpha vantage ecc. 
How could different features be aggregated in a pandas dataframe? For example fundamental data with price time series (GBPUSD + technical indicators + GDP + interest rates ecc).
There is a problem with date adaptation, a feature is daily while others generally monthly.
I know scaling and features selection/reduction with PCA but i’m interested in preprocessing and joining of features with different scale/values/timeframe. 
Please tell me a detailed process in pandas or Scikit Learn to obtain fundamental and price features perfectly merged and ready for a machine learning training/test. From cleaning to scaling. Then many ML models like Random trees or Svm will be compared choosing the best performer.

investing,The US debt is now projected to be larger than the US economy,"As the United States continues its struggle with the pandemic-induced economic recession and a [sputtering recovery](https://www.cnn.com/business/economy), the country's burgeoning debt is not anyone's top concern these days.

&amp;#x200B;

Even deficit hawks are urging a dysfunctional Washington and a chaotic White House to approve another round of [badly needed stimulus](http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/stimulus-pelosi-trump-coronavirus/index.html) to the tune of trillions.

&amp;#x200B;

""The US federal budget is on an unsustainable path, has been for some time,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome [Powell said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/economy/fed-powell-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html) this week. But, Powell added, ""This is not the time to give priority to those concerns.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, when the country eventually pulls out of its current health and economic crises, Americans will be left with a debt hangover.

&amp;#x200B;

On Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that for fiscal year 2020, which ended September 30, the US deficit hit $3.13 trillion -- or 15.2% of GDP -- thanks to the chasm between what the country spent ($6.55 trillion) and what it took in ($3.42 trillion) for the year.

&amp;#x200B;

As a share of the economy, the estimated 2020 deficit is more than triple what the annual deficit was in 2019. And it's the highest it has been since just after World War II.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the huge year-over-year jump is simple: Starting this spring, the federal government spent [more than $4 trillion](https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/) to help stem the economic pain to workers and businesses caused by sudden and widespread business shutdowns. And most people agree more money will need to be spent until the White House manages to get the Covid-19 crisis under control.

&amp;#x200B;

The Treasury Department won't put out final numbers for fiscal year 2020 until later this month. But if the CBO's estimates are on the mark, the country's total debt owed to investors -- which is essentially the sum of annual deficits that have accrued over the years -- will have outpaced the size of the economy, coming in at nearly 102% of GDP, according to calculations from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The debt hasn't been that high since 1946, when the federal debt was 106.1% of GDP.""Debt is the size of the economy today, and soon it will be larger than any time in history,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas said.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with such high debt levels going forward is that they will increasingly constrain what the government can do to meet the country's needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Spending is projected to continue rising and is far outpacing revenue. And interest payments alone on the debt -- even if rates remain low -- will consume an ever-growing share of tax dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the risks of future disruptions, like a pandemic, a debt load that already is outpacing economic growth puts the country at greater risk of a fiscal crisis, which in turn would require sharp cuts to the services and benefits on which Americans rely.

&amp;#x200B;

""There is no set tipping point at which a fiscal crisis becomes likely or imminent, nor is there an identifiable point at which interest costs as a percentage of GDP become unsustainable,"" CBO director Phillip Swagel said last month. ""But as the debt grows, the risks become greater.""

If I was sitting on $1,000 worth of 5-year T-notes with a coupon of $15.90 a year, and suddenly the best anyone could do was $3.30 a year, does that mean the market would be willing to pay nearly $5k for my T-notes?

personalfinance,Is it ever a good idea to take out a TSP Loan?,"Background: The Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, is a federal employee (military and civilian) 401k comparable retirement plan. A little more limited in options, but it's got low fees and they match 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothetical set-up: Say you have X amount in debt at Y interest rate. And you have Z&gt;X in your TSP. You have the option to take out X from your TSP to pay it off. Then they will take out of your paycheck an amount that will be pay off the loan in a timeline you set. In addition to just paying back the amount borrowed, they add an ""interest"" portion to your payment (this goes to your account too though). The only processing or administration fee is a $50 surcharge. This isn't a taxable distribution.

Question: Is there ever a time when you would say that you would do this?

Example: $10,000 in credit card debt @ 18%. To pay off in 10 years, your payments would be 180 dollars. If taking out a loan and keeping same payment (current interest rates on TSP loans are 0.75%) you pay it off in 57 months. Less than half the time.

Is this an example of a guaranteed return (in the example's case an 18.75% return)? Or am I missing something? Please don't respond with saying you should check the budget. That's not my question. My question is if there is ever a time when it's a good idea to take out a loan.

Site I used to calculate the example:

[https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/debtrepayment)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I posted this as a comment but probably should put it here instead. Remember, assuming the budget is set. There is no more money. No more trimming of the budget is possible (even though in many many cases that isn't true). We're talking hypothetically. In the example below I ONLY have that debt but that payment is the most I can possibly pay.

I feel like we're drifting off topic and I wanted to start a new thread discussing my question. Is it EVER a good idea to take a TSP loan. Let's throw some numbers here.

Past 10 year market returns = 9.2%

(source:  [https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-stock-market-return#:\~:text=The%20average%20stock%20market%20return%20for%2010%20years%20is%209.2,different%20from%20year%20to%20year.](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-stock-market-return#:~:text=The%20average%20stock%20market%20return%20for%2010%20years%20is%209.2,different%20from%20year%20to%20year.) )

I have 10K debt at 20% interest rate (simulating credit card debt). Paying off in 5 years, payments are 265. No additional funds since funds are being sent to creditor.

If loan is taken out, interest rate changes to .75%. Payments are kept same. All payments go into the account.

|\-|Take out loan|Don't take out loan and chill|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Starting|0|10000|
|After 1 year|=265\*12=3180|=10000\*1.092=10920|
|After 2 years|=3180(1.092) + 265(12)=6652|11924|
|After 3 years|=10444|13021|
|After 4 years|=14585|14219|
|After 5 years|=19107|15527|

Am I doing something wrong here? It would seem that it would be better to use the loan.",finance
solar,Questions from an electrician about the 120% rule,"I've recently started doing some consulting with a company where I'm strictly dealing with the tie in end of things.

I understand the rule, the how and why.  But are there any products that could potentially bypass all of that red tape by monitoring the buss with CTs and limiting the amount of solar being backfed or turning off strings?  It's a no brainer that the average home with a 200 amp meter isn't utilizing all of that amperage in the first place.  Am I taking crazy pills, or does this seem like something that should exist?

stocks,Weed stocks surge as Kamala Harris vows to decriminalize pot in debate,"(Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of major cannabis producers surged on Thursday after Democratic vice president nominee Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at a federal level in the United States under a Biden administration.

During Wednesday night's debate with Vice President Mike Pence, Harris said she and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would also expunge the criminal records of people convicted of marijuana-related offences in the past.

Cannabis stock tracker MJ ETF (MJ.P) rose 5.5% to mark its best session since early June, while Tilray Inc (TLRY.O) jumped 19.2% on the Nasdaq. U.S.-listed shares of Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO), Aphria Inc (APHA.TO) and Aurora Cannabis Inc (ACB.TO) closed between 10% and 13% higher.

Even though many U.S. states have legalized marijuana use, banks and other traditional financial institutions have so far largely refused to work with the industry as cannabis is still a classified substance at the federal level.

""Access to safe banking will transform the industry, freeing up capital markets for investment and reducing the risk of operating a cannabis business,"" said Keith Cich, co-founder of cannabis-related products manufacturer Sunderstorm Inc.

Regulatory issues have also restricted cash availability for companies in the nascent sector at a time when they are struggling with a lack of profitability due to high costs.

""From a business perspective, (decriminalization) will level the playing field by allowing companies to expense normal operational costs instead of being taxed on gross profit,"" said Sam Armenia, vice president at producer C21 Investments Inc (CXXI.CD).

Harris, who has supported cannabis decriminalization even before Biden picked her as his running mate, is the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, which sought to end federal prohibition of marijuana.

Original plan was to aggressively pay down monthly (currently 1.5k monthly and plan to double that) and refinance in 2024 due to current mortgage being ARM.

personalfinance,"Just wanted to share my story on why I've ended my relationship with Chase. (No TL;DR, Sorry)","For some background on this situation, I'm a younger pilot in (what would currently be, thanks 2020) the prime of my career. Like many, I've been jobless for months now with very strict financial discipline to get through this insanity. The job I had prior to being furloughed was based in another state, other than the one I reside in. Am collecting unemployment from that state. I've had a checking account with JPM/Chase for nearly fifteen years from which I manage all my cash transactions.

In the middle of September, I'm jarred awake at around 0430 by an alert from Chase warning me that there was suspicious activity on my account that requires my immediate attention. Not fully conscious, I pop open the Chase app and login to my acc- ""your credentials are invalid and/or this account does not exist"" 

***I'm very much awake now.***

I open up my email inbox on my phone to review the email that alerted me, looking for signs of possible phishing. Looks legit. I stumble over to my computer to attempt to login to Chase through a browser and am met with a similar message concerning the quantum state of my account. At this point, the little evidence I have leads me to believe I'm very likely being robbed in real time. I look back at the email again and see there's a 1-800 number attached. I quickly verify the validity of the number with the one listed on their site. It's legit. So, I give them a call.

Once I'm connected to a human being, I explain the situation in hopes that I can get this cleared up with enough time to get back to sleep. The CSR informs me that my account is currently restricted and that I'd be transferred to their loss prevention department for further details. At this point, I'm now approaching a bit of a panic. But, I stay cool. Once I'm connected to a very cordial representative in loss prevention, I validate my account and identity. The clickity click of their keyboard eases me slightly. Just keystrokes away from resolving this. Lo, the rep's tone shifts dramatically into something fairly hostile, ""Sir, your account has been restricted due to fraudulent activity. All payments associated with this account will be halted."" *My rent. My insurance. My utilities.* ""... Any remaining funds in this account will be sent to you via check within ten business days and the account will be closed. Chase will no longer be doing business with you now, or in the future."" My ears are ringing.

""Ma'am, I'm fairly certain that whatever fraudulent activity you're referring to might be because another person gained access to my account and I'm trying to resolve that before the issue gets worse. Why are you closing my account?"" My mouth is insanely dry.

""We have that right, sir. Do you have any further questions?""

""Do I have any further ques- What the hell is going on?""

She repeats her script. When asked what fraudulent activity would have violated the account, she reminds me that no explanation is needed. OK, time to get a grip on this. ""So, there is a check that's being sent out with the funds from that account to my mailing address?"", ""Yes."" I have her verify the address to again ensure that I'm not being digitally mugged. Checks out.

*Something is wrong here.*

I resign the idea that I'll be getting back to sleep and wait for my closest branch to open up. I drive over there with my documents to verify my identity and account, sign in at the lobby and wait. A teller calls on me and we convene at her desk. We have a friendly exchange and I briefly explain my morning to her and ask how this issue can be resolved. When pulling up my account details, she informs me that my account has been restricted, indicating that she didn't even listen to me. According to her terminal screen, she needs to call a specific number for support on the matter. She does so and certifies her ID with the person on the other end of the phone. The teller then intently listens to the call, nodding with an occasional ""OK."", ""Right."" My eyes itch. Finally ""Alright, I'll let him know. Thank you."" She hangs up and turns to me with a new sharper tone, nearly verbatim recites the same patronizing poem about how my account is associated with fraudulent activity. Account closed. No more business with Chase. Check is in the mail. Good day. The rapid shift in blood pressure makes me light headed.

Luckily, I had a check and a good chunk of cash that was able to seed a new checking account with another bank later that day. All was not lost. I spent the next 48 hours updating every account payable with this new information. Even while doing so, I'm bombarded with notifications from various services notifying me there's a problem with my payment method. This is a nightmare, but at least this can be patched quickly. The shock of the matter starts to wear off and the adrenaline crash associated with it crushes me. It's over, I'll get the money in the mail. It'll be fine.

It's now early October. Even though I've spent every day checking my mail box for a certified parcel from Chase, sometimes twice a day, it has yet to materialize. Nearly three weeks. USPS is messed up, but this still doesn't feel right. So, I nut up and call Chase again. I fast forward through the pleasantries to get connected with their loss prevention team. Once connected, I let them know that I know the account is restricted but have yet to receive the check. ""You haven't received the check?"" She asks, stalling. ""That's correct. I was told on \[the specific date and time\] that a check would be sent that day and would take at most ten business days to get here."" She asks to place me on hold. I put the phone on speaker to wait while I make a pot of coffee. Twenty minutes crawl by before she comes back on the line and informs me that there was not a check written.

***""Excuse me?""***

""Yes sir. Currently with the account being restricted, no transactions can take place on the account and that includes checks.""  
""But the account is closed. They told me this much nearly a month ago.""  
""Oh, no sir. The account is not closed, but the funds are effectively frozen.""  
""So, now what. How do I resolve this?""  
""There are two separate direct deposits that appear to be from the state of \[State of furloughed job\] that show a possible trend of fraudulent activity.""  
These payments she's referring to are exactly what you think they are: unemployment insurance payments that have become the lifeblood of whatever resembles financial survival this year. Payments that I had been receiving since March.

I'm then told that the best way to resolve this is to bring supporting documents to a branch, and have an employee submit them to their department for confirmation. I explain to her exactly what those payments are and briefly list off the exact dates those deposits were made (read from the state's website) and she confirms it. I can hear the realization of what is happening in her responses that the situation is now quite a drastic departure from one that paints a picture of a proud bank dealing with an apparently spontaneous felon.

The next morning, I walk into a Chase branch with copies of my application for unemployment, monetary determination and complete payment history. I engage a teller to notify a manager that I need their time. The manager greets me kindly and seats me in her office. I brief her on the situation and as I move from event to event, the look on her face darkens. She already knows the punchline, but I deliver it anyway when i render the documents. We both spend some time on the phone with loss prevention who is manually reviewing the documents while we wait. One hour later, the voice on the other end of the phone asks to speak to me directly. I pick up the handset with a glove.  


""Firstly sir, on behalf of Chase Bank I'd like to apologize to you for this event.""  
*Yup.*

""Your account restriction is lifted immediately and the full amount of the account will be credited back to the account within four business days. Do you have any questions for me?""

My first query is probing what specific state/federal regulation and/or JP Morgan Chase policy my account violated.  
""None, sir.""

My second question was identifying if the state flagged the transactions and the bank responded to that flag.  
""No sir, the state did not notify us of any fraudulent activity.""

""So we're clear, Chase unilaterally made this decision without any input or conference with the state?""

""That's correct, sir.""

That's enough for me. I hand the phone back to the manager and start to pack up my things. The manager hangs up the phone after some closing words with the loss prevention associate and asks me if she can help me in any way. I think her sympathy overstepped her professional courtesy, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and moved on.

""No ma'am. Thank you, but I don't believe I'll be doing any business with Chase now, or in the future.""",finance

Excerpt from the article:

Southwest Airlines stock has collapsed thanks to the pandemic but has now also experienced a sharp rebound. While the competitors are lugging around enormous debt (between 25 and 50% of last year’s sales), things are looking much better at Southwest.

Debt is exceptionally low for the industry and only corresponds to annual profit or a tenth of sales (rounded). So Southwest works sustainably.

Every year, huge sums of capital flow out of the other airlines, keyword:  
**Interest rates**  
This money is being lost to investors. In the long term, this results in enormous wealth effects, which of course are reflected in the share price.

Southwest is likely to be the outperformer in the future. So if you want to bet on a rebound in the sector, then you’ve come to the right place.

As long as the stock is trading above $ 38, a possible rise again to $ 40 and 42 could happen at any time. Above that, the way would be clear towards $44 and $46.

For countercyclical investors, things get interesting near $36. This is where the long-term support zone begins, which extends to $30.

what do you guys think is southwest a good buy right now?",finance

1. What else should I be thinking about? 
2. Can someone validate that paying a small amount of PMI would actually reduce the interest rate? 
3. Is there a compelling reason why I should use more of my OWN money when interest rates for a 30 year fixed loan are so low?

Some of my loans have raised dramatically due to my own stupidity in my 20s. I'm now down to 4 loans left after paying things off and would like to have a good strategy for continuing to pay off the loans while helping build my credit in the meantime. Balances and payoff order below:

1 - 11k loan, 18k balance, 6.8%

2 - 11k loan, 20k balance, 6.8%

3 - 5k loan, 6k balance, 2.43%

4 - 5k loan, 6.5k balance, 2.43%

When I check my credit score the negative strikes are always that my loan balances are too high. I completely understand that. So I'm wondering while paying off my student loans, would it help raise my credit score if I were to get the loans under the original loan amounts and then keep paying them down.

For example, I could pay 3k towards loans 3&amp;4 to get them under the original loan amounts. Then pay 8k on loan 1 to get it under the original loan amount, After that, I would switch to paying off loan 2 since they have the same interest rate.

Hopefully, this all makes sense.",finance

personalfinance,"First (Used) Car Purchase as a 23 y/o, looking for finance advice.","Hi, I'm very nervous about my upcoming trade-in/used car purchase and could use some advice. I don't have like a dad or Hank Hill or anyone that can go through this process with me and I'm starting to get overwhelmed.

**Here are some relevant facts:**

* I'm 23 and currently work as a software developer for one of the bigger accounting firms and make $70k before taxes, so a bit over $4k a month. My job is very secure and I have no concerns about my job security changing due the pandemic, this company has too much money so we are fine \*knocks on wood\*
* I went to state college for free b/c poor so I have no student debt. 
* I have two credit cards open just to build credit with, I don't typically keep a balance on them, and the oldest account is 3 years.
* My credit score is 759 according to Capital One's credit wise app, I know this isn't my actual credit score but I'm just saying I don't have the shittiest credit, I'm just young/my credit history apparently isn't as old as lenders want it to be.
* I currently drive a 2013 Honda Civic 4 Door LX with about 63,500 miles on it and some damage to my front and rear bumpers, with nothing owed on the car but I pay about $350 a month for full coverage insurance (I got this car in 2016 after someone totaled my hyundai elantra and my insurance gave me way more money than I paid for the elantra on craigslist so my mom talked the dealership salesman into taking $14,000 cash for the Civic.). Everything else is in good condition so if I'm being generous I'd say I could probably get $5-7k for my civic? Does this sound absolutely incorrect?
* The car I'm looking at is a used 2017 Infiniti QX60 with 57,353 miles and it is essentially fully loaded for  **$26,104** before taxes. 
* The dealer is also offering $500 off of the price before taxes.
* I have about $2000 for the car down payment but also about $1000 more that I can put either into the down payment on the car, or a down payment on a loan. 

**Here are my questions:**

* **How do you know what would be considered a \*good\* rate for your credit score?**
   *  The lowest I saw on my lending tree offers was maybe 4.1% so I want to look into credit unions because I read they usually have lower auto loan rates.
* I am getting my car detailed before getting it appraised for trade-in, but **how many appraisals should I get for my Civic?** I have already thought about getting it appraised by carmax and carvana because I heard they usually pay more. 
   * What if I ask the dealer what they would pay for it and don't like the answer so I decide to go with carmax or carvana. **Will the buying process be stalled until I get the money from whoever buys my car?** Or would I get a loan for the purchase price and use my check from whoever buys the car to go straight into the loan? Would I end up paying more in interest?
* I looked for auto loans on lending tree but I put way too much as the loan amount ($30k) because I feel like my trade in is variable x, as in I don't actually know how much I'll get for it, and I can't look into interest rates or loans because I don't know what my borrowed cost will be. **Should I go get my car appraised right away before I'm ready to purchase?**
* Will the salesmen at the dealership think I'm easy to screw over being a young woman by myself? Because I definitely will be easy to screw over, I have no idea what's going on. **How can I make sure the salespeople aren't being shady or screwing me?**
* **Will the dealership help with financing with the best rates or should I go to credit unions first and look into an auto loan myself?** I'm especially nervous about this because I get confused about my credit score being affected by hard pulls, and it always seems like companies try to avoid saying that they are going to do a hard credit pull.
   * If I should go to the credit unions myself, should I go after I trade my current car in and have that money or can I go with a confirmed quote/statement saying what they will pay and then know exactly how much I'll need or **will they only work with me when I'm like signing papers in the dealership?**
* My Civic's auto insurance payment is due on the 15th, this is the day or day before I'd like to purchase the SUV. **Should I cancel my insurance on the 14th and set up insurance for the new car? What if I don't go through with the buying process? What stage in the buying process do you need insurance for the new car?**
* I live in Dallas, TX but the car I'm looking at is in Plano, TX which is still a larger Texas city, **does this affect anything**? Will credit unions in smaller towns maybe offer better loan rates? How does that relate?

Thanks for any advice, I really appreciate it.

Also I assume people are going to tell me that it's a very stupid decision to get a used car if my current car is paid off and works fine, which I do agree with, but my reasons for trading in and getting this SUV versus my current sedan include:

* I now have a 100 pound, oddly tall great pyrenees and she's uncomfortable in my civic, and I make 8+ hour trips back to my hometown for holidays and other times of the year and I want her to have a comfortable space and trip. 
* Any large purchase I make for my apartment (work from home desk, bicycle, tv, any furniture from a store or side of the road) I have to rent a UHaul because nothing fits in my little civic and I'm not old enough to rent a truck yet. I spent a lot of money on UHauls in 2019.
* I would rather trade my sedan in sooner rather than after the holidays to that I don't put even more miles on it",finance
personalfinance,Credit score and rates for private student loan,"I'm trying to understand how private student loan lenders determine your rate.

 I am currently shopping for a loan to cover what my federal loans won't, and I'm running into 2 issues: first, it looks like a bunch of lenders don't work with my school (it's private, I'm thinking that's the reason);  second, I've gotten quotes with astronomical interest rates. These rates, about 12% fixed and 10.5% variable, come despite me having a 790 credit score and my cosigner being in the 800s; plus both of us having worked for our current employers for 3+ years. When I applied without a cosigner I didn't even qualify.

If it is, please let me know! If you know of any other variables that affect the rate you get I'd like to learn about that too.

personalfinance,Should I finance roof replacement with insurance payout or HELOC?,"I received hail damage on my roof about a month ago. The insurance claim has been filed and approved for a full roof replacement, and the insurance company will be transferring the money directly to my bank account. I also have a HELOC that was set up with the intention of using the money for home improvements, and the amount available to withdraw is far more than what the roof would cost. The interest rate is locked in at 2% apr, and all debt including the HELOC (even if I borrow the entire cost to replace the roof) will be paid off in under two years. 

Normally I would just use the insurance payout to cover the cost of the new roof. However, I have an emergency fund of only $5,000, and with so much uncertainty with COVID, I am at risk of being temporarily laid off at work (they have already laid off thousands of people, so it’s an actual risk). I am still adding to my emergency fund, but having extra liquid cash is a great thing (and a comforting thing) when you don’t have a job...

I’m considering putting the money from the insurance company into my emergency fund, and using the HELOC to fund the roof replacement. Obviously this would mean paying interest on the borrowed money, which is a con. However, the benefit is that I will have more cash at my disposal in case I do get laid off. When things settle down and I feel there’s less of a risk, I could simply pay off the HELOC with the additional savings. 

Is this a stupid idea?? Does it make more sense to use the insurance payout for the roof, then rely on the HELOC as an extra “emergency fund” in the case of a layoff? Are there any negative legal ramifications to doing this? I will be replacing the roof either way.",finance

Stocks traded higher today as market participant’s closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.

Traders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump’s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. 

According to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let’s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!”

Adding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President “wants to do a deal.” This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump’s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.

Yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President’s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, “A compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.”

defi,Price Oracle - A Must Have Infrastructure,"# Overview

With the exponential growth of decentralized finance protocols over the past 12 months and the growing interest from other corners of the cryptocurrency market to DeFi, we have witnessed a tremendous shift in crypto market narrative from centralized to decentralized finance.

However, for DeFi to truly achieve its goal to disrupt traditional finance and transform the entire financial industry to be more efficient and transparent, the space still has a long way to go. And one of the key obstacles that it needs to overcome to inch closer to this goal is the oracle problem.

## Price Oracle: A must-have infrastructure

The problem with the blockchain world is that Dapps cannot directly communicate with off-chain information to enable further innovations such as dispute settlement, liquidation, risk management which all require off-chain data to be fed into the smart contract. This is where price oracles serve as an essential component of the DeFi space - price oracles are the “connectors” between the on-chain and off-chain worlds, delivering data generated by real-life, off-chain events on-chain and thus trigger a series of smart contract execution. 

Decentralized financial services offered by the current mainstream DeFi platforms such as MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX, etc. rely heavily on the price oracles to provide the data necessary to carry out smart contract operations such as determining liquidation prices, margin trading, and lending. Price oracles act as a reliable source of information to feed these critical data to these DeFi platforms. As such, price oracles are an integral part of the decentralized financial services infrastructure.

## Problems With Current Oracles

Decentralized finance is unconventional, and we have observed a few differences when comparing it with the traditional finance industry.

### Lack of viable options to conduct proper risk management

In traditional finance, when institutions talk about investing, trading or having market exposure, the first thing they think of is usually risks. Quantifiable risks form the foundation of the financial market and are crucial for market participants to make informed investment decisions. In DeFi, however, we have barely seen any analysis and recognition of such risks, not to mention incorporating quantifiable risks into the DeFi infrastructure. In other words, as of today, market participants have not been able to comprehensively understand risks in DeFi, nor can they properly calculate and hedge them.

### Time in the on-chain world is discrete rather than continuous, measured on a block by block basis

In the off-chain world, time elapses continuously and the market has evolved over time into having a complicated price discovery mechanism based on the continuous timeline. As such, a market’s price discovery is almost always more efficient in the centralized world than the decentralized one. 

However, in the on-chain world, time elapses discretely and the smallest unit of time in the blockchain world is known as the block time.

Due to this time structural difference, we argue that DeFi applications should not compete with their centralized counterparts for being the destination of price discovery. Instead, these applications should bring their unique competitive advantages to the game, creating exclusive experiences in the decentralized world. Unfortunately, the current DeFi ecosystem is still building infrastructure based on the centralized mindset.

### Existing designs of automated market makers (AMMs) rely on arbitrageurs to ensure that prices on AMM DEXs do not deviate from actual market prices

Because the traditional financial market has become fairly efficient through years of evolution, arbitrage opportunities are hard to come by. However, the current AMM-based DEXs heavily rely on arbitrageurs to help approximate true market prices, implying an inefficiency in the design of the DeFi infrastructure.

### Liquidity providers (LPs) are not compensated enough for having market exposure on volatile assets

There are various market frictions in the centralized trading world such as latency and transaction fees. These frictions are also true in the decentralized world, and DeFi LPs are not being compensated enough for bearing the cost incurred by these frictions. 

Given the concerns listed above, we believe that the blockchain infrastructure, specifically price oracles, should be built upon the following design principles.

a) Enable computable risks

b) Consider time as discrete rather than continuous, with the smallest unit of time as blocks

c) Meet the non-arbitrage condition

d) Incorporate time delay, market volatility and transaction costs when compensating the LPs

# Overview of the Price Oracle Sector

The demand for oracles heightened in recent months as more DeFi protocols are being launched. 

As seen in the charts below, between May 1, 2020 and September 1, 2020, the 30-days rolling gas fee for oracle project Chainlink showed a 32.2x surge, while the standard gas fee on the Ethereum blockchain only jumped by 26.9x during the same time period. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Chainlink and another oracle project, NEST Protocol, were among the top 10 Ethereum gas gazers on September 1, 2020, ranked #5 and #7 respectively. Both protocols rose to prominence within a short period of time - on May 1, 2020, Chainlink was ranked #11 while NEST Protocol was not on the list.** 

&amp;#x200B;

The gas distribution during the period between August 15, 2020 and September 15, 2020 also shows that NEST Protocol and Chainlink are the only two non-DEX projects in the top 10 Ethereum gas usage leaderboard (excluding Tether USD and SmartWay Forsage, which is a pyramid scheme).

Unlike in yield farming, there is limited hype in the oracle sector, especially with NEST Protocol. Even with the recent DeFi hype, the google search index of keyword “blockchain oracle” was near zero for 80% of the days over the past three months. Being the must have infrastructure in the industry together with a low google search index, implying huge potential for further development.

## Oracle protocol review

There are essentially two types of oracles, centralized and decentralized ones. 

Coinbase Price Oracle is a notable example of a centralized oracle. It takes Coinbase Pro’s API as the data source, then excludes data points with significant deviation. DeFi projects wishing to request data feeds can make calls to Coinbase Price Oracle with public key verification enabled.

Although centralized oracle is an easy way to fulfil the off/on-chain data gap, we have only seen a few DeFi projects utilising it, largely due to security concerns - an attacker can control the oracle data sources and then broadcast malicious information to a smart contract that relies on the data, thus contaminating the decentralized trading environment.  

On the other hand, decentralized oracles have been widely accepted by the DeFi ecosystem. DeFi applications such as lending, derivatives, and some DEXs all need a reliable oracle to access price data in order for them to function properly and fairly.

&amp;#x200B;

In this report, we investigate four decentralized oracle projects: Chainlink, NEST Protocol, Band Protocol, and Tellor, each of which have been created based on various design principles and with different levels of decentralization.

· Chainlink provides price feeds for 55 trading pairs, including 30 fiat pairs. More than $2.3B locked values in crypto assets are referencing Chainlink price oracle as of September 14, 2020. 

· Band Protocol aims to provide a price feed service on multiple public chains, including Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos. Beyond cryptocurrencies, Band Protocol can also connect to trusted data sources (i.e., weather, lottery, and unemployment rate) through traditional Web APIs with customised oracle script.

· Tellor takes the old fashion Proof of Work (PoW) method combined with the staking concept to maintain data quality. Users can request data by adding TRB token as a tip. 

In a macro view, the three oracles mentioned above have structured their price generation model as shown in the process below.

https://preview.redd.it/ojsbko9ls4s51.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca1cb464d82478d01002e8e5ac744c7175211b3

Due to the on-chain validating requirement, these decentralized oracles may fail to update when the market experiences extreme volatility, like the one on Black Thursday, due to network congestion and extreme market conditions. 

The process of on-chain validation needs voting by transaction, which consumes extremely high gas fees during peak blockchain network activities. Even if sufficiently high gas fee has been utilised, voting can still encounter blockchain propagation issues.

NEST Protocol, on the other hand, proposes a different way to solve the problem of providing prices on-chain through a decentralized incentive solution called quotation mining. In a nutshell, the quotation mining system consists of two types of participants 

1: Makers which consist of miners and verifiers 

2: Callers. Anyone can become a miner to provide quotation and pay commissions in return to receive NEST tokens. On the other hand, verifiers can challenge the miner’s quotation by staking 2x equivalent amounts of asset to update the price if the previous quotation price deviates from the true market price.

Each of the current DeFi projects brings some elements from traditional finance to smart contracts, with the lending sector considered to be the largest by total value locked as shown on the left. However, we argue that the majority price oracles are too centralized which only report data on short tail assets. Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on Coingecko which have a combined value of $328B, roughly 22% of the $328B assets has not yet been reported by decentralised oracles.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r9pi0fjvs4s51.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4adb0fd728ca5fb26b200836d32724704cdea79

We believe the DeFi ecosystem should not pick and choose on what asset data should be reported by the price oracles. Instead, these decisions should be made by the community. However, when reporting data on long tail assets, we run into the problem of attacks. **The maximum penalty to maliciously attack an oracle node by reporting incorrect price data is the amount of assets that the attacker staked. The monetary value could be significantly less than the potential profit earned if a successful attack can be executed, generating an incentive for malicious attackers to exploit the protocol.**

NEST protocol presents a properly designed structure to eliminate these potential attack vendors. A malicious attacker may tamper with a normal quotation price, however, the attacker must stake 2x the amount of assets in order to challenge the previous quotation price. The attacker either leaves significant arbitrage opportunities to the market or must continue to self report and continue staking 2x of the previous amount of assets in order to sustain the attack. **The costs of an attack can become exponentially large within an hour of the attack and raise to almost the total number of ETH in the entire market. This design makes NEST protocol attack resistance in the sense that it can completely eliminate dishonest players in the system.** 

## Price feed comparison

Oracles are in charge of price feeds. The donut chart below demonstrates a simple comparison about methods for oracles to generate data and how those data are validated. Chainlink uses price data from nodes with LINK tokens as collateral. Though anyone can run a Chainlink node, the Reference Data Feed is generated still by permission. Currently, Chainlink has 21 trusted parties for its ETH-USD pair with 0.5% deviation threshold. 

In Tellor's ecosystem, users can request price feeds by giving TRB tokens as incentives. Miners quote price with PoW competition; and the median of the first five price feeds will be saved on-chain. Users are able to dispute the price feeds within one day after price feed generation. 

NEST Protocol allows miners to participate quotation mining by staking base token and quote token with an off-chain price; i.e., staking 10 ETH with $3,800 USDT means Ethereum (ETH) has a current market price of $380. The arbitrager (Taker) can challenge the quoted price by performing a swap for both ETH and USDT within 25 blocks (i.e., T0 \~ 5 mins) if the arbitrager believes that the price quoted by the miner is incorrect. 

In the meantime, the arbitrager needs to provide an updated quote and stake 2x amount of asset. When no one challenges the quotation price within 25 blocks, **effectively meaning that the price meets the non-arbitrage condition**, this quotation price then becomes the NEST- price, which can then be used by other DeFi applications. On the other hand, **there is no verification process for other price oracles and thus no way to ensure the price data reported by other oracles meet the non-arbitrage condition.**

In addition, **NEST protocol can achieve on-chain price updates for every block under the most efficient scenario.** Since the smallest unit of time is the block time in the on-chain world, **price updates on every block is the most efficient way that can be achieved.**

&amp;#x200B;

# The unique risk factors value proposition

**Price delay and price deviation are two key risk factors presented in all oracle infrastructure.** Network congestion or a lack of price feed can cause price delay causing price deviations. These two risk factors can influence the performance of other DeFi platforms relying on these oracles. 

Unfortunately, there is no way to eliminate price delay and price deviations due to the fact that the off-chain world runs on continuous time, but the on-chain world runs discretely by block.  

As a result, after an asset’s price undergoes the process of being transmitted through the oracle from off chain to on-chain, it also becomes different from the quoted price of the off-chain exchange. 

In fact, the transfer of asset experience from off-chain to on-chain will produce three different prices with small deviations: **exchange quotations, oracle theoretical feed prices, and on-chain quotations (true price generated by Oracles).** Behind the difference between these three prices are two easily overlooked risk factors: 1: delay 2: volatility.

&amp;#x200B;

## Delay and volatility

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/00mdu0yss4s51.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ec343973a05cffdbd1a4377ef54509f83565eb

**For all price oracle protocols, market volatility matters.** Since the on-chain and off-chain world runs in parallel with different time structures, price differences are naturally presented between the off-chain and the on-chain world due to time delay. However, when the market volatility is higher, price differences can experience some even larger gaps. 

## Data analysis

This section presents a data-driven analysis of the differences in ETH/USDT prices between price oracles (i.e., NEST Protocol and Chainlink Oracle1) and Huobi Global exchange, using historical data ranging from August 30, 2020 to September 16, 2020.

##### 1: Chainlink launched ETH/USD aggregation while NEST Protocol provides ETH/USDT reference price. In this analysis, we assume the difference between USDT and USD is negligible.

We discovered that the ETH/USDT price from the oracles matches Huobi Global exchange’s off-chain price data closely with some extremely small deviations.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ndsiyxrs4s51.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=106f9324dced6661a9a92f86d2b7fdc05d0ca7b8

Then we further calculate the spread between Chainlink’s and NEST’s ETH/USDT prices and exchange price. Most of the time the NEST Protocol’s price spread (red dots) is smaller than Chainlink’s (blue dots). The absolute number of Chainlink’s average price spread ($0.494) is 31x as much as NEST’s ($-0.016).

This finding affirms that the NEST Protocol’s price data can be more properly referred to in the decentralised world based on its accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0kpmjeirs4s51.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d8b44b3e64ea83a5415f4951366065091c0609

The results of the spread analysis indicate that the price spreads between September 2 and 6 were relatively large, which we believe was related to the higher gas fee and ETH/USDT price volatility on the Ethereum network during the time. For Sep 2 2020, the Ethereum average daily gas price is roughly around 480 Gwei.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37i9ia0rs4s51.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2333c6f3600a34a994bc4944f56a0e65269ff31

We have further analyzed the standard deviation of 1440 minutes rolling price spread and the results have shown that the standard deviation of the Nest’s spread was only 0.21% to 1.30%, while for Chainlink it ranges from 0.97% to 2.01%, again we have verified that the NEST Protocol has a more reliable quotation design.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5qpqrhiqs4s51.png?width=1064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9543a04167056c9c18ff24f098fef881af819598

We extracted data between Sep 5 and Sep 14, 2020 for deeper analysis. Both NEST Protocol’s and Chainlink’s highest absolute number of average daily spread prices occurred on Sep 5, 2020. ETH/USDT quotation price from Huobi Global exchange fell by more than $76 on that same day. While Sep 14, 2020 presents a relatively low price volatility market. 

The below analysis shows that Chainlink’s reference prices (red dots) provide much less price data than NEST Protocol, which means Chainlink has a lower frequency of quotation under a stable market, due to its design.

Chainlink is set to trigger the oracle updates when the off-chain price fluctuated for over 0.5%. Otherwise, there will be no price update for as long as 10800 seconds. While in NEST Protocol, anyone can become a miner providing quotations to earn NEST tokens. With a higher frequency of quotation, Nest’s reference price tracks more closely to the Huobi Global’s than Chainlink’s.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vypjwbups4s51.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0832677b19ee678c58abb20cefe9bffc68363c45

The analysis of price spreads also confirms the above view. The deviations of the two oracles’ price spreads from zero is different under different market conditions. On Sep 05, 2020, when the market was in a higher volatility, the deviation is larger than that under the lower price volatility market.

Under the same market condition, the deviations from zero for Chainlink’s price spreads (blue dots) are worse than NEST Protocol’s (red dots) for most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6sd8m9ps4s51.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5937dd766e7dc6163620d5795e9b6fcd37497ba5

Our interim analysis shows that prices provided by NEST Protocol match more closely with those from the centralised exchange. In contrast, Chainlink as one of the price oracle infrastructures demonstrated subordinate performance in terms of price reliability.

# What does this mean for the future of DeFi?

The current DeFi ecosystem can be described as CeFi running on blockchain, although the space continues to strive for decentralization, innovation, and permission-less. We believe that the current DeFi market structure can be considered as DeFi 1.0, where some of the most critical legos pieces in the DeFi blueprint such as lending, trading, derivatives, price oracles, etc have been built to support the early stage ecosystem in the past few years. 

We have demonstrated that current DeFi price oracles can be more accurate and reliable to support further innovation in the space. Major players such as Chainlink offer a solution to solve the most important issue in the decentralised world - connecting off-chain data with on-chain data. However, its reliability, accuracy and the decentralised nature are called into question when compared with the NEST oracle supported by in-depth data analysis.

As DeFi grows, however, DeFi 1.0 no longer satisfies all the market demands, especially those coming from sophisticated market participants. As such, we need DeFi 2.0, or what we call, CoFi, Computable Finance.

To resolve the problem that current financial risks in DeFi lack computability, a redesign of the price oracle infrastructure is likely part of the solution. At the end of the day, a sustainable DeFi ecosystem will be the one where market participants can be compensated by bearing certain risks, and these risks can be computable in such a way that they allow market participants to properly quantify hedge these risks if necessary.

In the CoFi world, we envision the reshape of the most important DeFi infrastructure - the price oracle - entirely from the ground up to attract meaningful market attraction, deliver accurate and timely data information, enable computable risks, and meet the non-arbitrage condition.

personalfinance,Contribute to non-matching 401k or save up more for real estate?,"So I recently changed jobs and my new company currently does not match anything on the 401k (yea that sucks). Previously I was contributing 8% to the 401k with a 3.5% match. 

Current situation:

* Went from 63.5k to 85k income, 5k relo bonus

* 10k in emergency fund (6mo expenses)
* 15k in former 401k
* 14k in Roth IRA, will be 17k by end of year
* Another 10k in general savings (travel fund, fun money, unassigned savings)
* No debt

My 3-5 year goal is to buy a piece of property for hunting/shooting/doing whatever I want here in Texas. I was thinking around 200k with like 10% down and the best interest rate I could find, so call 20-30k being my savings goal. 

I was wondering if skipping or contributing less to the non-matched 401k for a year or two would be foolish in order to accelerate the savings for my future ranch? I will continue with the IRA and am exploring other options for investing as well (mutual funds? idk).

If the company match came back I would immediately put in to get the match of course, but owning a ranch has been my dream for years and achieving that sooner is awfully tempting.

personalfinance,Love it or List it?,"Hi there. I am trying to decide whether to keep or sell a rental property. To summarize my info:

\- I am 43 yo.

\- Current value: $300K. 

\-  Purchase: 2007 for $210K. So, total appreciation is \~50% between then and now.

\- Desirable part of the city. There will likely be continuous demand for renting this condo.

\- Mortgage: 6 years / $75K left. 3.5%  interest rate.

\- Current Monthly Rent: $2200

\- Current cash flow: After the mortgage, condo fees, and maintenance, around $250 per month. Some of it ends up going to a MM account  for maintenance, the rest to an investment account. You can call current cash flow $0 considering the time I put into it etc.

\- Dealing with new tenants, getting it cleaned every year, the upkeep etc. does get tiresome at times. My wife does not want to deal with it (3 little kids) so all of it is on me.

\- If I were to sell it, I would invest the money in ETF of mutual funds.  

\- Captial gain taxes would be around 15%.

Does is make sense to keep this rental or sell it? If I can get through the next 6 years until the mortgage is paid off (zero cash flow until then), I am looking at around $1500-1800/month cash flow after that. But even then gains/value starting in 6 years would be around 6% - 7%. 

On the other hand, if I were to sell it today, I could take advantage of the interest that my investment will earn rather than waiting for 6 years before I do that. I realize the property would likely appreciate during that time, but I don’t know by how much.

So, my current thinking is to sell the condo this summer. I feel like I can do better in the stock market with mutual funds / ETFs. 

Any advice on what I should do? Am I missing something big? What arguments are there to talk me out of selling it?",finance
personalfinance,Rate changed after rate lock,"Purchasing a home and closing in a week, and today received a form from the lender to increase the rate.  I didn't even know that this was a thing.  I thought that I had the rate locked in, and nothing changed in my credit score.  However, the home appraised lower than the original price so I believe that's why they are changing the rate.

Original loan amount was $247,000 with starting interest rate of 3% and discount points at 1% to obtain rate of 2.75%.

Then the home appraised from $242,000, so they are now adjusting the rate to 3.25% and discount points at cost of 1% to obtain a rate of 2.875%.

Does anybody know how to do the math on this to see if this is fair?  I think it's something like total loan to property value (TLV)?  Does the decrease of just 5k justify hiking my rate up like this?  Also, it's just a week before closing and I've already purchased the appraisal I don't even know if it makes sense to walk considering what I've paid but I'm not afraid to if I'm being taken advantage.

Also, all three of my credit scores came back between 780 - 795 during the process.  I think the original deal where I was getting 3% and having to buy down to 2.75% was already high given my high credit score and the current market.  I see people with worse scores than me getting like 2.5% rates, so I don't understand how now I'm going up given my scores didn't change.",finance

He inquired about the state of UHS cybersecurity prior to the attack, about details on vulnerability and patch management policies, about the extent of network segmentation between different facilities and systems, and about third-party risk management policies. He asked whether medical devices are isolated from administrative systems and networks to prevent disruption in the wake of an attack.

Warner also asked whether UHS decided to pay the ransom and if so, how much; he asked for confirmation that HIPAA protected data was not accessed or exfiltrated; and he asked the name of the senior executive overseeing the recovery and response efforts.

&gt;1.Please describe the UHS vulnerability management process, including your current practices relating to patch management across your health infrastructure.  
&gt;  
&gt;2.How are various UHS facilities’ networks and IT systems isolated from each other to prevent a cybersecurity breach at one facility from affecting multiple facilities?  
&gt;  
&gt;3.Does UHS have effective segmentation measures in place within its healthcare facilities to prevent any type of malware from spreading?  
&gt;  
&gt;4.What policies does UHS maintain relating to third-party risk management?  
&gt;  
&gt;5.What are your cybersecurity and risk assessment requirements?

I've recently seen some posts here saying that inexperience with product and business-side are some of the factors that prevent some candidates from moving forward.

I know that the federal government, especially some 3-letter agencies, work with a lot of unique data. However, an obvious consequence is that the data domain usually doesn't overlap with traditional data science problems a FAANG or tech startup company would face.

So does this mean that data scientists from fed jobs (without prior experience with product/business data) will face an uphill battle? Or do most FAANG employers look favorably enough upon data science experience from specific federal agencies that it shouldn't be a concern?",technology

They are refinancing into a 15 year fixed at 2.25%.

I’m trying to do the math on how much they will save just off the interest, but I’m stuck on how to break down the amortization since they’ve also been paying an extra few hundred a month into their principle, and also since they have 23 years or so left on the original, compared to their new 15 year.

personalfinance,Trying to determine if we can buy the house we want,"Throwaway account, mostly so my coworkers don’t know how much I make. 

Hey r/personalfinance! My wife and I are trying to figure out if we can afford the house we want in Seattle, and I’m unsure if its a good idea. 

**Our income**

So I work in tech at a big company as a Data Scientist, and am getting a very large raise in about a month. I currently make $240k/yr, but will be making just north of $400k/yr starting at the end of November. My wife makes about $140k/yr as well, working in a non-tech industry. I think we can comfortably say our household income (barring any major stock market crashes that would make my equity less valuable) will be around the $550k/yr area. 

**Our current savings and expenditures**

We currently spend $3400 a month on rent, and maybe $5000 a month on everything else. We have no kids, and small loans on reasonably priced cars that we could pay off, but the interest rates are so low that we haven’t. As such, we’ve been able to save up about $225k for a down payment on a house (could bump this up to $250k in a month or so)

**The house we want**

So this is the sticky part. We’ve found a few houses we like, and most of them have been around $1.4M. We feel fairly confident we can afford that as we’ve already been pre-approved for a jumbo loan with a 3.5% interest rate and 15% down on a $1.43M house. Unfortunately that house didn’t work out due to some inspection problems, so we’re back to shopping for houses, and found a $1.69M house that we love. 

This is significantly more than we had planned on spending, but I think we can do it (as long as the bank agrees). Is this an awful idea? Should we wait and save up more?

personalfinance,"My company recently IPOed. Do I need to pay both AMT taxes this year, AND Capital Gains taxes on ISO shares once I sell them next year?","I purchased roughly 10,000 ISOs from the company where I am employed back in February of 2020, which recently went through an IPO, and am unclear on if I will need to pay AMT taxes this year, and then also pay gains taxes once I end up selling those shares. 

Here is a fictional scenario to simplify the details:

* Purchased 10,000 shares on 2/7/20 for $5/share (strike price) 
* FMV on 2/7/20 was $20/share
* Cost to exercise: $50,000 
* AMT: $200,000
* AMT Difference: $150,000 

I understand that the IRS will essentially recognize that $150,000 as additional income for 2020, and that I will pay AMT taxes on that $150,000. Assuming my tax bracket is 44% (for both Federal / State combined) then I will be paying roughly $66k in taxes on this (despite not being able to sell or see any tangible ROI yet).

cybersecurity,FBI/DHS: Government election systems face threat from active Zerologon exploits,"This joint cybersecurity advisory was written by CISA with contributions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 

CISA has recently observed advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting multiple legacy vulnerabilities in combination with a newer privilege escalation vulnerability—CVE-2020-1472—in Windows Netlogon. The commonly used tactic, known as vulnerability chaining, exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion to compromise a network or application. This recent malicious activity has often, but not exclusively, been directed at federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government networks. Although it does not appear these targets are being selected because of their proximity to elections information, there may be some risk to elections information housed on government networks.

CISA is aware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to elections support systems; however, CISA has no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised. There are steps that election officials, their supporting SLTT IT staff, and vendors can take to help defend against this malicious cyber activity.

Some common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by APT actors include leveraging legacy network access and virtual private network (VPN) vulnerabilities in association with the recent critical CVE-2020-1472 Netlogon vulnerability. CISA is aware of multiple cases where the Fortinet FortiOS Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-13379 has been exploited to gain access to networks. To a lesser extent, CISA has also observed threat actors exploiting the MobileIron vulnerability CVE-2020-15505. While these exploits have been observed recently, this activity is ongoing and still unfolding. CISA recommends network staff and administrators review internet-facing infrastructure for vulnerabilities, including Juniper CVE-2020-1631, Pulse Secure CVE-2019-11510,  Citrix NetScaler CVE-2020-19781, and Palo Alto Networks CVE-2020-2021 (this list is not considered exhaustive).

I'll be buying in the $550k range in six months (moving in the spring). Will have $75k for down payment.

personalfinance,Potential pros and cons when moving (debt) to a credit union,"Throwaway because financial topic. I only know the basics of credit unions, I am planning to move my money to one but hoping I can use the switch in my favor (e.g. lower interest rate on debt). My FICO is in the mid-700s.

I read the rules and read the Clark article about switching to a better bank but it only touched on assets and not particularly moving debt... I did learn some things I hadn’t thought of though (like categorizing your activity before the switch!)

The question:

For a while I’ve disagreed with the banking practices of large American banks (BofA, Wells Fargo, Chase, etc...) Recently I feel moved to actually change banks to a smaller local credit union.

I know that generally credit unions have better rates and customer service and things, but I am wondering what I might look out for when actually making the switch. For example:

Potential pros:
-I have a CC with my bank, obviously I wouldn’t close the card but might I be able to transfer the balance to a new account at the credit union for a reduced interest rate?
-Could I combine my personal loan and medium (under $5k) CC debt into a personal loan with a better rate at a credit union?

Potential con: Is there a con to moving my personal loan from my bank to a credit union?
Am I even asking the right questions? Is there something else I should consider?

personalfinance,"Bought townhouse in Feb 2020 at 3.625% APR, is it right time to refinance?","Hello all. 

Long time lurker, first time poster in this community. Any help is much appreciated!  
We bought our first townhouse in SF East Bay Area. New construction townhouse and paid 15% down and no PMI Mortgage plan at 3.625% interest rate - 30 year fixed.    
Wife and me both work for non-profit/no-stock/no-bonus companies unlike people in Bay Area. So money is tight and we are in midst of growing our family. Oh one more thing, I'm not a US Citizen and on a visa. 

We're thinking of refinancing our loan but since 15% down, LTV is high. Plus to get our loan below or equal to 765k \[jumbo limit in our area\], we will need to put 50k towards principal. 

Currently mortgage lenders offer 3% interest on 765k, which saves us $515 in monthly mortgage payments but no closing costs.   
Other option, pay 3.5k closing costs for 2.875% interest rate on 765k and get $565 monthly savings on mortgage payments.   
We have received above offers from [lenderfi.com](https://lenderfi.com) and [loandepot.com](https://loandepot.com).  


Why refinance?

\- Save monthly payments   
\- Reduce interest rate   
\- Reinvest savings in other investments. 

Why not?

\- lose 50k  savings  
\- all eggs in one basket = all our money in housing market.  
\- job/visa situation keeps changing under current political climate. 

Any help/guidance for the confused soul?

personalfinance,Refinancing a home?,"I closed on my first home last December. I went with a 30 year fixed at 3.99%. My current monthly payment is a little under $730 a month. I have been putting $100 down extra on the principal per month, as well. I talked with my mortgage lender just to ask if it was a good time to refinance even though it has been less than a year since I bought the place. She ran the numbers and said the best bet would be to do a 15 year with a 2.75% interest rate. I am contemplating taking her up on this offer as that seems like a good rate. My payment would be right at $1,000 a month with the refinance.

The issue is I am not sure if I will stay here long term. I am a nurse who has thought about travel nursing, but then again I may just stay put and work in the same area I currently do. I am a live in the moment person. I hardly look to the future and think what I want to do, so this is a tough question for me to answer when I am asked.

My monthly income varies depending on overtime, how many shifts I pick up, if there are any bonuses going on, etc. I have a healthy emergency fund and contribute 10% to a Roth 401K at work as well as a Roth IRA that I try to max out every year.

personalfinance,For Anyone With A Bi-Weekly Mortgage With PenFed,"I apologize if this is not the appropriate sub - just trying to get the word out.

# Background

A month ago, PenFed converted their mortgage system to a new one.  I noticed that my balance was not correct.  After over 6 hours on hold across multiple calls, I finally reached a supervisor who said she thought it likely was only affecting bi-weekly mortgages and that she would get a ticket over to the appropriate group to investigate and couldn't give me a time estimate.


# The Bug


The following formula is how mortgage interest is calculated


    BALANCE X INT_RATE / PAYMENTS_PER_YEAR

For bi-weekly payments, the payments per year shouldn't be 26 but rather (365/26).  You would have to read how your bank handles leap year but for the purposes of this discussion, it **doesn't matter**

Here is how PenFed is calculating my (and I assume yours too) bi-weekly mortgage interest amount


    BALANCE * INT_RATE / (360 / 14)


Yep, they think there are only 360 days a year.


# What You Should Do


First, don't just take my word for it - **VERIFY** your balance/interest is incorrect.  Assuming it is, contact them on all of their social media locations as I believe you will get nowhere by calling.


I happen to have a supervisor's email address and direct extension but for obvious reasons will not share that publicly.  If social media fails, I am willing to discuss things privately and perhaps get us on a group email or something.

I honestly can't believe a professional banking engineers would make such a mistake or that it would go this long without them being able to find it and that it only took some random customer a few payments to reverse engineer.",finance

So I have been in the US for a little under a year and have a single line of credit (2-3 months old) as well as being an authorized user on a family member's card (added about a month ago).

However, when I work with my mortage lender, she's telling me I will need to wait closer to 6 months to have a sufficient credit score to take out a mortage.
I would get if she meant waiting to get a higher credit score and have access to lower interest rates, but she made it seem like I would have a hard time taking out any kind of mortage. Does the credit score I'm getting through my bank not match what lenders are able to see? Do lenders look beyond an overall credit score and focus specifically on a client's credit history?

(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is starting to use its network of retail stores as distribution centers for shipping products to consumers, joining a trend popularized by other retailers.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has typically shipped devices like iPhones, Macs, iPads, and accessories from warehouses located across a customer’s region or directly from China. Now items that are in stock can be shipped directly to consumers from a network of almost 300 retail stores spread across the U.S. and Canada, according to people familiar with the matter.

Apple told staff the shift will mean faster delivery times for customers who live further from distribution centers than from stores, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing internal policies. The products will be shipped through United Parcel Service Inc. in Canada and FedEx Corp. in the U.S. via ground shipping and may be delivered as early as the day after a customer’s order, Apple told its staff. The program will apply to customers who live within 100 miles from a store, the people said.",finance

I am going to be inheriting a small traditional IRA (\~ $4,500) from my Grandmother who was over 80 at the time. I was most likely going to just take the lump sum due to it being a smaller sum so I can build up my emergency fund. This will not make me go up a tax bracket.

However, PA also has an inheritance tax of 4.5% to lineal heirs, when is this sum taken out? Should I expect to pay it when I file my taxes or is it withheld in the initial disbursement?

I have hit a hardship and desperately need to take a withdrawal.

The NAGDCA says “If the plan has a set contribution and has not officially declared itself to be an MPP, the plan sponsor may conclude that they can take advantage of the new coronavirus-related distribution provisions”

State of SC says: The CARES Act did not create a new form of in-service distribution for 401(a) defined contribution plans, such as the State ORP. Guidance issued by the IRS has clarified that the new in-service distributions allowed by the CARES Act are only available for certain types of plans (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457(b)), and do not override the ordinary distribution rules for 401(a) plans such as the State ORP, which generally prohibit in-service distributions unless someone has reached normal retirement age. See, for example, Question 10 of the IRS Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers.

Although the CARES Act did not authorize new forms of in-service distributions from the State ORP, the PEBA Board did resolve at its April 17, 2020, meeting that, if the federal government takes future action that would allow in-service coronavirus-related distributions from 401(a) defined contribution plans before normal retirement age, PEBA would adopt those distributions for the State ORP.",finance

personalfinance,"Senior in college just received $14,000, how can I best use this money?","TL;DR: I received just shy of $14,000 dollar, I am a college student about to graduate. How should I use this money to best benefit me? 

Hey y’all so I am looking for some guidance on what to do with a lump sum of money that I just received. Here’s a breakdown of my current situation, hopefully it will help. 

I just received a check from a car insurance company because my car was totaled from an accident. They valued my car at $13,898 and that is the money I received. I do not plan on buying a new car, I am considering a used car, but I am figuring some details first. My bike and amazing friends can get me everywhere I need to be. In short, how should I best use the $13,898 to best benefit me? 

Currently I am a college student, I am halfway through my senior year. Unfortunately like many college students I am overwhelmed with debt. After I am done with school, I will have roughly $60,000-$75,000 dollars in debt – this is a huge pain in the wallet, but I would like to pay this off as soon as possible. I am planning to have my debt paid off within two years of graduation (I plan on having a second job in addition to my full-time job). 

I am studying information technology and cybersecurity and the jobs in my area have a starting salary range from 60,000 - 80,000 starting salary with great opportunities to be promoted quickly.  Ideally, I would like to stay at home after graduation and pay off my loan, but I currently have an offer in Missouri making $61,000 but I would have to cover all my expenses.  So, I can take this offer and have to cover all my own expenses or find a job in my home state and have no expenses except for my loans and a used car at some point assuming covid lets us return to the office, both my roughly make the same amount of money. 

I want to know what I can do with the lump sum of money I received to best help me in the long haul. I have a deep desire to pay off my loans as soon as possible, I am not looking for them to be forgiven in 27.5 years, I want them gone.  I will be making pretty good money after graduation. I will be buying used vehicle at some point but not for another 9-12 months. Hopefully, this help you all help me. I just want to be smart with this money. Technically I am supposed to be using it for a new car, but I do not need one yet so with that said how can I make good use of? Unfortunately, interest rates are super low right now but placing it in a saving account is all I can think of now. I am open to anyone’s .02 cents, Thanks for the advice!!",finance

- A March like crash will not happen, the feds have made it clear they will keep the market propped up for a while (the after effects of all the printing in a few years will not be good in my opinion).

10-7-2020 Remote EEG and invasive surveillance in the private / criminal sector. In contemporary technology we are faced with new dilemma and new obstacles otherwise known to be unreal or mystical.  This unfortunately challenges traditional law enforcement and modern 'burden of proof' elements.  With our criminal justice system there isn't a strong partnership between newage technology and the A.I frontier.  These sorts of 'machines' or complex code may be available only to the military or very large precincts like the NYPD 'tripwire' program.  
Its important to note that the private criminal sector has found ways to utilize these systems thru backdoors, zeroday exploits/hacks and other malware/penetration style tactics.  Some of these systems are local, federal or even international (satellites) and cell phone / data streams Data streams - EmotivPRO  and or towers.  With these systems perpetrators are able to gain exclusive access to other peoples 'real-time' data Real time, recording and playback modes - EmotivPRO .  Such as where they're located, or theyre feeling, what they look like, even as far as vital signs.  

www.neurosky.com is a example a BCI(brain to computer interface's) paired with a software and a headset for the user(s) own pleasure.  Little does neurosky know that this technology has paved the way for criminals or individuals with malicious intent to breakdown neurosky's structure and build custom invasive brain to computer interfaces.  www.OpenEEG.sourceforge.net is a community online where users can post / discuss brain scanning equipment and their latest findings. http://openeeg.sourceforge.net   Also users frequent OpenBCI - Open Source Biosensing Tools (EEG, EMG, EKG, and more).  This technology is a existential threat to not only the US but humans as a whole. Espionage is what the US intelligence community needs to be particularly afraid of, thoughts, dreams and emotions can be scanned or stored in a 'Neural Bank' thru the interception of  TCP/IP neural packets . https://packetstormsecurity.com (good source for everything related)   BrainBay OpenBCI Documentation  

Thru the use of a BCI headset a user can remotely send customized neural packets thru a neural packet receiver/sender (same-thing) to a target resulting in a phenomenon called 'synthetic telepathy'... or synthetic Insight Brainwear 5 Channel Wireless EEG Headset | EMOTIV     The headset itself doesn't support malicious software / code.  But it can be used as a vessel for perpetrators to send and receive neural packets using their own mind with the support of a BCI.   Here is a partnership between facebook and a BCI company called CTRL-LABS CTRL-labs - YouTube  CTRL-labs - Crunchbase Company Profile &amp; Funding  CTRL-labs   Neural Interface Technology  The powerful visual shown by CTRL-LABS shows a degree of sophistication that law enforcement increasingly has trouble keeping up with. But due to some brave journalists and dedicated minds we now can connect the dots and hopefully create regulations and a code of ethics regarding invasive BCI's. Unfortunately modern legal precedent is functional unaware of such activity, or at least our system isn't primed for it yet. I am writing this as a cautionary tale to those worried about new age technology and surveillance in contemporary America.  For the most part the NSA has used their collection of data ethically. But their software and tools were leaked onto the internet and scooped up by the private criminal sector.  
Regular Americans stand helpless against such technology , their information and feelings are being mined and stored by criminals for sadistic and fiscal reasons.  Such as stalking, harassment, espionage and much else.  I want to switch gears to the science and literal meaning of EEG equipment , R. Douglas Fields PhD wrote a great book on the history and creation of brain monitoring and scanning. (insert 'Electric brain references and quotes here). Also here is a hour long visual representation by Dr. R. Douglas Fields  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJtoW8wvgXo Digital Signal collection / interpretation is a process in which signals coming from send/receiving devices such as micro controllers, cell phone towers, satellites creates a full spectrum grid of surveillance that victims cannot typically break free from.  Neural nets are another component of the equation, the collection of TCP/IP neural packets go thru one of many systems one of which is a neural net.  The neural net is a system in which raw neural packets are passed thru a series of checkpoints and other mathematical formalities that process raw neural data and deliver it into a neat package for the user to see what a target or user is thinking, feeling or even dreaming...   

Legal precedent has been a issue with this technology as it is quite hard to prove.  But not impossible. If you follow the links provided and watch the visuals you will see that the technology is completely possible.  It is done thru low band frequencies usually in the 40-60 hertz range. 40-60 hertz is related to EMF (electromagnetic field) , if tuned correctly with AI, software like Brainwave it allows for a 'perp' to create  synthetic telepathy  (insert information here about synthetic telepathy). Perps in modern times are now using complex technology to target individuals and its virtually undetectable.  With the help of law enforcement and transparency thru the private sector creating a partnership is paramount to help victims , as they're always gaslighted or told they re insane.  I have been doing research on the subject for about 6 months or so and it is very very plausible due to the integration of 4g - 5g technology.   5g will revolutionize this harassment and intrusion of civil liberties to a level that we will not be able to keep up with.   
It is paramount we create ethics , regulations and arrest those who are using this for malicious intent.  Brainbay is BCI like software used thru a webcam, thru retina and facial expressions it can cross platform with narrow A.I to create synthetic EEG like imaging.   http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/  
Usually 'perps' will use a different country than the target to circumvent accountability.  Also the use of VPNS people are able to mask their location, though that technology is becoming easier to detect.  Sector, Elon Musk is developing a cranial implant called the neuralink . The neurolink is about the size of post it note , maybe a little smaller. It is intended to be symbiotic relationship between A.I and humanity.  This has promising prognosis's but major shortcomings and concerns regarding ethics and potential existential risks regarding the major evolutionary jump. Now that is out in the open and for users to use and manipulate the open source community of BCI's it is particularly troubling. The lack of oversight and the compounded interest of technology paired with exponential growth its making virtually impossible for local or even state police departments to keep up with.  All things considered its important to create a new legal framework and/or procedure when dealing with complex harassment and or remote neuro monitoring equipment (such as long range acoustic devices and or satellite installations). Users discuss innovative ideas, schematics and DIY EEG equipment for their imaging needs. The problem is the lack of oversight - due to the rapid growth of new age tech and micro controllers... paired with 5g.  It will be a serious issue for local and state authorities to keep up.  

That being said I think its paramount to establish strong legal precedent and not write this off as  hocus-pocus  or out of the realm of possibilities. Most victims present in a way that is hard to understand or comprehend for most Officers or other officials.  As its highly specialized  field of computing , neurology and networking all in one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJtoW8wvgXo 

There is also another community I want to state for this report, which is the www.openbci.com community.  Now this is the software component that links the brain to whichever EEG the user is using.  There is detailed images on the website showing users making custom BCI headpieces and headsets...  Most of it is DYI manuals ; users have found ways to make affordable hardware and easy to read/obtain schematics. Thru the use of TCP/IP neural packets , signals between machine to brain (VOICE TO SKULL).  This raises considerable alarms , basically this technology / software is capable of remote messages to the brain using a neural packet sender/receiver. This can be amplified for remote or wider range transmissions , or for high power localized EEG s.   Right now the standard hertz used is between 35-45 (approx, depending on the EEG s).  Perpetrators mine data thru narrow A.I and Brainbay. Unfortunately this technology is very clandestine and used in sophisticated identity theft, stalking, harassment, ransomware, blackmail, fraud , interception/espionage, privacy violations and revenge porn.  

That being said, staying many steps ahead is the key to countering the criminal aspects of this technology.  So in order to do that what was once darkness and is now out in the light, all sectors of society must be aware of the capabilities and danger associated with intrusive sophisticated unwarranted surveillance , via cross device , via cross platform/OS penetration. Thanks for spending some of your time reading my report on contemporary surveillance and the Era of A.I.  Take care, be well. Thru the use of existing code and narrow minded AI , perpetrator's  can break down existing brain to computer interfaces and use invasive technology and send and receive thoughts, and even read vital signs.  

Very few companies are capable of such feats in fact its considered cutting edge to a point, the data mining is in the most comprehensive part of the equation.  Then A.I does the rest: malware such as 'ROOTKIT's” ,   rootkits hide in the firmware of the device (PC , SMART PHONE , even wired or wireless devices).  Perpetrator's can then have a remote copy of a victim's device , this can be plugged into a BCI which can measure emotions, pupil dilation, some vital signs and other mannerisms thru what you search, type, look like (front/back facing camera).  To make matters worse if the victim has a smart watch which is bluetoothed to a rootkitted device then they have vital signs, blood pressure, steps, location and other intrusive details.  It can take many years of rootkitting in order to create a “link” to a victims cortex/brain .  

Then A.I takes over , it can take the mined data and essentially predict the victims behavior and or personality.  Again as previously stated our legal system is not yet primed to such activity, only in the intelligence sector would there be precedent. Now that 5G is being rolled out it will make the rootkit mining seemless , 5g is 600-1000x faster than 4gLTE and 30-50x faster than Wi-Fi.  So collection of data can be stored, collected and mined at a rate never ever seen before.  This would be a existential threat to national security, personal security and the mental health of the entire planet.  If we do not establish cheap detection or mute features than our fate is virtually sealed.  Sophisticated organized crime or “cabals” could use this for unbelievable potential, it would be the most power weapon known to mankind 10 fold.  I digress:  So the headpieces, headsets and brain to computer interfaces already  exist but the 
firewalls do NOT exist.  

This would be a particular issue with the military and politics.  Not only would “perps” be able to send and receive TCP/IP neural packets and other intrusive forms of neural network related forms of PERP to VICTIM communication.   In layman's, they could send voices and essentially predict and analyze your brain.  Not only that they can plug your subconscious and their dreams/dream cycle.  What else is particularly troubling is that the signal would be so strong at 5g levels it potentially alter human physiology; it has been theorized that it can prevent the oxidation of cells.  This is in theory as human physiology and 5G / intrusive EEG's brain scanning equipment is generally hidden and black listed on search engines and YouTube.  Law enforcement needs to have state, local and federal safeguards created , in conjunction with the private sector. 
 
In conjunction 'perps' can use ADOBE VOCO to impersonate the victims voice to cause further disruption to their lives  we live in the age of disinformation and fraud.  An there is almost nothing average or even high class people can do.   This is a on going report and any information that can be shed on this topic would be of much help.",technology
personalfinance,Refinancing to add household liquidity,"&amp;#x200B;

We are considering refinancing from our current mortgage (25 years left at 3.75%) to a 30 year mortgage (2.99%).

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked through the numbers from our approved application and am seeing the following:

Our monthly payment would go down 150$ a month (with 60 extra monthly payments of course).

We would be paying approximately 75$ less equity into the house each month.

Our equity would go down by approximately 4k (to cover the mortgage costs).

At closing we would not owe more than a trivial amount (\~100$). There are no extra costs (appraisal would be waived).

&amp;#x200B;

Other information:

We do not plan on moving out of our house and have approximately 50k of equity in the house if we had to.

We do not have any debt and have good credit.

Our house is worth approximately 2.5x our income. Our remaining mortgage balance is roughly 1.8x our income.

&amp;#x200B;

Our reason for refinancing would be to extract extra liquidity each month which we would most likely invest. Over the long run, we would hope to have a higher return rate than 3%. This would also become part of our emergency fund.  We would also consider putting some of the money into a roth IRA after we are comfortable with the amount in our emergency fund (we currently contribute around 10% of our income into our regular ira accounts).

&amp;#x200B;

Does this seem like a reasonable approach? Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

UPDATE:

Thank you for all of the input.

I ran some numbers assuming we invested the 150$ savings each month.

With an interest rate of 3% we would have approximately 63K saved up after 25 years. At that point we would owe about 50K in equity. I know there are tax implications but if we put the money in a Roth IRA that would be negated. At a 5% return we would have 80k which is 30k over what we would still owe on the house.

This seems like a decent benefit with minimal risk. The two risks are if we move or if the market underperforms and we would be ok with either.",finance

Luckily we live about 5 minutes from the local military base and can rent out the home and cash flow without an issue.  This would mean purchasing another home as our primary residence. Here are my thoughts. 

**Pros:** make a smarter choice for our next home (more ideal location, size, layout, space and storage etc.) 

Rent out our current home, additional cash flow each month, and having someone else pay off our mortgage will be great 

Increase real estate portfolio and control 2 properties essentially doubling or tripling our net worth in 30 years.

**Cons** Two mortgage payments if we have a period the house isn’t being rented.

personalfinance,Math help on loan repayment,"Hi guys, I tackled my debt quickly in 2019 and was on track to get rid of all of it. 

Then in March, my student loan went into deferment and so I figured I would put my money in my 401k. 

I understand that paying off debt is a prime directive of this sub, and I could pay off this loan today if I wanted. 

But here's the thing: The loan is 5K with an interest rate of 4.125%

Even very conservative estimates place index/etf funds at 5% return on investment. 

So my money is spent better in the market than totally paying off this loan. 

So my question is: 

What would be the optimal monthly payment that would allow me to pay off the loan but also have money to put toward investments? 

Is my reasoning sound on this?

If one dollar goes toward the student loan I have effectively paid off a future interest of 0.04125

If one dollar goes toward investments  then I have effectively made 0.05

Edit: I think what I'll do is take the total at the end of the month and multiply that by the interest rate. 

So 5K times 0.04125 comes out to a payment of $206.25 making a total of $4793.75. 

4793.75 will have an accrued interest of 16.25 which makes the end month total 4810. 

Then 4810 would be multipled by 0.04125 making my payment $198.41

And so on...

But, Microsoft said, the company's efforts reflect a ""new legal approach"" that may help authorities fight the network going forward.Trickbot allowed hackers to sell what Microsoft said was a service to other hackers — offering them the capability to inject vulnerable computers, routers and other devices with other malware.That includes ransomware, which Microsoft and US officials have warned could pose a risk to websites that display election information or to third-party software vendors that provide services to election officials.""Adversaries can use ransomware to infect a computer system used to maintain voter rolls or report on election-night results, seizing those systems at a prescribed hour optimized to sow chaos and distrust,"" Microsoft VP of security Tom Burt wrote in a [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/12/trickbot-ransomware-cyberthreat-us-elections/).

Ransomware seizes control of target computers and freezes them until victims pay up — though experts urge those affected by ransomware not to encourage hackers by complying with their demands. The Treasury Department has warned that paying ransoms could violate US sanctions policy.

He added: ""We have now cut off key infrastructure so those operating Trickbot will no longer be able to initiate new infections or activate ransomware already dropped into computer systems.""

A separate technical report by Microsoft on Monday said Trickbot has been used to spread the Ryuk [ransomware](http://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/us/nevada-school-district-hack-ransom/index.html). Security experts say Ryuk has been attacking 20 organizations per week, and was reportedly the ransomware that Universal Health Services, one of the nation's largest hospital companies.

But Trickbot has also been used to spread false and malicious emails containing malware that tried to lure victims in with messaging surrounding Black Lives Matter and Covid-19, Microsoft said.

Microsoft said Trickbot has infected more than 1 million computing devices globally since 2016 and that its operators have acted on behalf of both governments and criminal organizations, but their exact identity remains ambiguous.

Taking down Trickbot follows a series of attacks that became [highly publicized](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/tech/ransomware-election/index.html) in recent weeks: One targeting Tyler Technologies, a software vendor used by numerous local governments, and Universal Health Services, one of the nation's largest hospital companies. A statement on Tyler Technologies' website has said the company does not directly make election software and the software it does produce that is used by election officials to display voting information is separate from its internal systems that were affected by the attack.

Ransomware could pose a risk to the election process if systems designed to support voting are brought down, according to Check Point threat analyst Lotem Finkelsteen, but so far experts regard it as ""mainly a hypothetical threat right now.""

## Month Thirty Three – Down 76%

[ 2018 Top Ten Summary for September ](https://preview.redd.it/wvhzjexe6os51.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e633def25a2874044f1c358f1ae6f0edbb295422)

After a rough start to September, crypto spent the month trying in vain to claw back ground.  While a few coins rebounded quite a bit from the monthly lows, most ended up finishing the month significantly down.  Out of the 2018 Top Ten group, **Bitcoin** lost the least, down -8% in September.  **NEM** followed it’s winning August ([yes, you read that right](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-32)) with the poorest performance, down -26%. 

## Question of the month:

#### Which cryptocurrency exchange won approval to create America’s first crypto bank in September?

A) Binance  
B) Binance.us  
C) Kraken  
D) Coinbase

*Scroll down for the answer.*

## Ranking and September Winners and Losers

[Rank of 2018 Portfolio - 50&amp;#37; no longer in Top Ten](https://preview.redd.it/85sjahrgbos51.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a09feae6a923cfea4caa730da9f6df207de1078)

A lot of shuffling in September.  On the upside, **Bitcoin Cash** and **Cardano** gained one place each landing at #5 and #10 respectively.  **Cardano** gets special mention for [re-entering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A83anvGUrCs) the Top Ten. 

Heading the wrong direction were **IOTA**, **NEM**, **Dash**, and **Stellar** each falling two or three spots.  

The big story though, for long time crypto watchers, was the ejection of **Litecoin** from the Top Ten, down five places from #7 to #12 in just one month.  For some context, **Litecoin’s** absence from the Top Ten is a [Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) first.  It is also the first time since [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) has tracked crypto rankings that **Litecoin** has not been in the Top Ten.

Drop outs: After thirty-three months of this experiment 50% of the cryptos that [started 2018 in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out.  **NEM, Litecoin, Dash, IOTA**, and **Stellar** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether,** **BSV**, **LINK**, and most recently, **DOT**.

***September Winners*** – Although it lost -8% of its value, this month’s W goes to **Bitcoin**. **ADA** gets second place, down -15% and climbing back into the Top Ten.

***September Losers*** –  As most probably expected after an extremely out of character victory last month, **NEM** came back down to earth in September, [bigly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEOzt7oFCDI), down -26%.  **Litecoin** finished right behind, down -24% and dropping out of the Top Ten.  

For the overly competitive, below is a tally of the winners of the first 33 months of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. **Bitcoin** still has the most monthly wins (8) and **Cardano** in second place with 6 monthly wins. With its poor September performance, **NEM** now has 7 monthly losses. 

[Ws and Ls - One clear winner](https://preview.redd.it/zr6yp0wpbos51.png?width=285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88f3916ce7111a9513ea3c52fa02d0f03c924bd)

Every crypto has at least one monthly win and **Bitcoin** is unique as the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t lost a month yet since January 2018.

## Overall update – BTC solidly in the lead, followed by ETH. Dash in the basement, LTC drops out of the Top Ten.

Even though **BTC** took a bit of a detour on its way back to break-even point, it is still far ahead of the field, down -17% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.** The initial investment of $100 thirty-three months ago is now worth about $83.  Second place **Ethereum** is down -49% over the same time period.

At this point in the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, **Dash** is at the bottom.  It is currently worth $70.49, down from a January 1st, 2018 starting price of over $1,000. That’s a loss of  -93%. The initial $100 invested in Dash 33 months ago is now worth $6.77.

The big story this month is **LTC’s** departure from the Top Ten, the first time since I started the experiment back in January 2018.  Whether or not it will eventually fend off the new generation of coins remains to be seen, but it certainly is noteworthy to have one of the most well known and long standing cryptos drop out of the Top Ten.  Consider [pouring one out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QACY04l5OHo) for **Litecoin.**

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

The crypto market lost over $35B in September and is down -39% since January 2018. The value of the overall crypto market is near where it was in August of this year, just a few months back.  As painful as the beginning of the month was, looking at a table like this helps with perspective, especially if you’re panic prone.  

## Bitcoin dominance:

After steadily dipping for months, **BitDom** increased a bit in September, up to 57.5%. 

For some context: since the [beginning of the experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), the range of **Bitcoin** dominance has been quite wide: we saw a high of 70% **BitDom** in September 2019 and a low of 33% **BitDom** in February 2018.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018:

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost -$50 this month. If I cashed out today, the $1000 initial investment would return about $238, down -76% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

September broke an encouraging upward trend, but at least the portfolio is taking a break from the -80% range.  Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, for some context:

[ 33 Monthly ROIs on Top Ten since Jan 2018](https://preview.redd.it/h5s4dvutbos51.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccccf3234ac943351d66b64fb91969d88c6356d3)

The absolute bottom was [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/) back in January 2019.  

So the Top Ten Cryptos of 2018 are down -76%. What about the ***2019*** and ***2020*** Top Tens? Let’s take a look:

* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +54% (total value $1,538)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +56% (total value $1,564)

So overall? Taking the three portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios are worth $‭3,340‬** ($238+ $1,538 +$1,564).

**That’s up about +11%** for the three combined portfolios, compared to +31% [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-32). 

Here’s a table to help visualize:

[ Combined ROI on $3k over 3 years - UP +11&amp;#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/53ofp7p4cos51.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=547971e9ccd56ce93689dc4d145ecce2de558649)

That’s a +11% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for three straight years. 

But surely you’d do better if you went all in on one crypto, right? 

Depends on your choice. Let’s take a look:

&amp;#x200B;

[ETH for the win](https://preview.redd.it/0kw4ty69cos51.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc7c5861ff3f9b3e9cc323bea1a9fae625316500)

Only five cryptos have started in the Top Ten for all three years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC** (unless **Litecoin** can make a comeback by the 1st of Jan. 2021, it’s not going to make the *four* year club!). Knowing what we know now, which one would have been best to go all in on?

**Ethereum**, by a pretty good margin: the initial $3k would be up +104%, worth $6,118 today. The worst choice of a basket to put all your eggs in at this point in the experiment is **XRP,** down by almost one third.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&amp;P 500 Index fell from an all time high in August, but is currently up +26% since January 2018.

[S&amp;P since Jan. 2018](https://preview.redd.it/btmjpvxucos51.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee61bbefda16a8b7f5b377e0efc30115c97f8015)

The initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would have been worth about $1260 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.

But what if I took the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments? Here are the numbers:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1260 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1050 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,660.**

That is up **+22%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a **+11%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

That’s an 11% swing ***in favor of the S&amp;P 500*** and breaks a two month mini-streak of wins from the Top Ten crypto portfolios.

[S&amp;P vs. Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://preview.redd.it/zxobdqpxcos51.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74fed7b688eda0f67184a5723e21c4a3328a68c9)

That’s seven monthly victories for the S&amp;P vs. two monthly victories for crypto.  The largest gap so far was a 22% difference in favor of the S&amp;P in [June](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-30). 

## Conclusion:

September was a tough month for both traditional and crypto markets.  What’s next for the rest of 2020?  More volatility is no doubt to come as we enter the last quarter of a truly unpredictable and exhausting year.  Buckle up.  

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment twice, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of two new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21) then again on [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9).

## And the Answer is…

**C) Kraken**

According to [an official announcement](https://blog.kraken.com/post/6241/kraken-wyoming-first-digital-asset-bank/) in September, Kraken is “*the first digital asset company in U.S. history to receive a bank charter recognized under federal and state law*.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Is mortgage interest on rental property more like a tax ""credit"" than a deduction?","Sometimes people seem to make a (false) argument that paying residential mortgage interest is good (vs none) because you get a deduction on it (let's assume you are itemizing and not taking standard deduction because we are talking large amounts in the expensive SF Bay Area real estate market). I describe it as ""false"" because, while yes you get a deduction, you still had to pay it. 

So if you pay $30,000 in interest, you out-lay cash of $30,000. On your tax return, you claim the deduction $30,000, lowering tour taxable income by $30,000, thus saving you $7,500 (assume 25% tax rate). So it's as if you ""only"" paid out $22,500. But compared to no mortgage, you're still out $22,500.  (And when I say ""some people"" make this argument, I don't mean the fine people of personalfinance of Reddit, of course. I mean my husband ...)

Does the same apply for mortgage interest on rental property?  Assume the rental is cash flow positive. Does it make sense to pay down the mortgage (if you can) and avoid interest despite being able to use it to offset rental income (because you still have to outlay the cash and only receive some benefit for reduction of taxable income)?  Or is it better to keep some interest expense to offer the rental income?  

And for the sake of the question, let's not assume any other opportunity cost of what you'd use the money for otherwise, whether interest rates are super low or high, or what tax bracket you are in. 

So probably my title should be ""Is mortgage interest on rental property more/less/equally valuable as residential mortgage interest from a tax perspective?""",finance

personalfinance,Aggressively paying student loans is a bad idea?,"While reading online, I stumbled across the concept that aggressively paying student loans isn’t as financially beneficial as making the minimum payment and investing into a 401k or something like the S&amp;P 500. While I understand in theory how this makes sense, I’m not sure if it makes sense for me personally, and I wonder if I’m making the right decision. 

Combined, I have about $88k in student loan debt. $56k are from private loans and $32k in federal loans. I find the federal loans very manageable, and could understand making the minimum payments so that I can get a better return of investment somewhere else. 

However my private loans are currently locked at a 4% interest rate for the next 13 months. After this, the loans will all return to their prior interest rates, which range from 11-7%. My plan has been to take advantage of this low interest rate to pay down my private loans as much as I can before my interest rates become high again. 

My first few years out of college I bounced around between different jobs, and managed my finances poorly. My credit score dropped from 790 to the 500’s and I’ve just now been able to start rebuilding my credit. My student loans have been the biggest burden on my income, preventing me from moving into an apartment (currently living with my parents). 

Am I doing the wrong thing by aggressively paying my loans down? Wouldn’t reducing my balances (and building my credit back simultaneously) put me in a better financial position? They way I see it after 13 months when my 4% apr is gone, I’d have a more manageable minimum payment and higher credit to possibly refinance or consolidate my loans with. 

TLDR: is aggressively paying my loans actually a bad idea compared to investing? I’m taking advantage of a temporary fixed rate of 4% when my loans are usually 11-7%. My logic is making aggressive payments during the temporary period of the low interest rate would pay off by building credit and lowering my monthly payment in the long run.

CryptoCurrency,It's beginning to feel a lot like 2017. Some useful reminders and advice for new comers.,"Hype and increasing prices will undoubtedly attract new investors, HODLers, and gamblers. Regardless of how long you've been in crypto, below are a few pieces of information (or reminders) you should consider.  


1. **We're still early**. Cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, is still in its infancy. Because of this, we will continue to see headlines of hacks, exchange closures, big name investors coming into the space, major institutional adoption, and everything in between. Until crypto is regulated (for better or worse) and even after, there will be bad actors attempting to steal your cryptocurrencies. To that end, think twice when hearing about 'deals' or investments that seem too good to be true. They probably are.  

2.  **Protection**. I often see questions regarding the storage of cryptocurrencies. Not to oversimplify, but as a user, you have \~3 choices to store your cryptocurrency. In order of most secure to least secure:
   1. **Cold Storage** \- From wikipedia: **Cold storage** refers to storing **Bitcoins/Cryptos** offline and spending without the private keys controlling them ever being online. This resists theft by hackers and malware, and is often a necessary security precaution especially dealing with large amounts of **Bitcoin.**   
If you aren't comfortable manually storing your private key, physical hardware wallets are your best alternative. When possible, buy direct from the manufacturer to avoid any tampering to your new device.
      1. [https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/)
      2. [https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)
   2. **Hot Wallets** \- From [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hot-wallet.asp): The difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet is that hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not.   
Hot wallets can be installed onto your mobile device and/or your web browser. Similar to cold storage, these hot wallets will 'store' your crypto and will be accessed to send/receive tokens, execute smart contracts, and conduct other transactions. There are many options to choose from, but MetaMask is as close to an industry standard as it comes, and the developer has recently implemented an ERC-20 token swap function. Again, download directly from the developer if you can.
      1. [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)
   3. **Exchanges** \- Exchanges certainly have their own purpose, most notably as an on and off ramp for your fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, etc). However, when you read headlines like ""Bitcoin Hacked for 10 million dollars!"" what they usually mean is, a centralized exchange that holds users' cryptocurrencies was hacked and bitcoin was extracted from the exchange's storage. For this reason, exchanges are considered to be less safe than your Hot Wallet and Cold storage alternatives.  

3. **Don't be greedy**. This is easier said than done, and many veteran traders have learned this the hard way -- some still haven't learned. When prices are only going up, you're going to feel like a million bucks. **But things dont go up forever**. **Ever**. (Unless it's the Fed's balance sheet.. har har). Point being, it's okay to take profits along the way up. I guarantee you'll have an opportunity to re-buy those same tokens at a cheaper price, and you'll enjoy them even more the second time around.     

4. **Don't spend more than you can afford**. Hopefully this goes without saying, but the crypto space is extremely volatile. It is not uncommon to lose your entire investment with just one wrong token/ICO/scam. To that end; just use your common sense. It sounds easy, but when you're making money, sometimes it's hard to see the cliff at the end of the road.  
 
5. **Keep learning**. I joined the crypto space because I saw an opportunity to make money. It's been a wild ride, and I've learned a lot more than I've gained (from a monetary perspective). What i didn't expect to happen, was to open pandora's box when it comes to what Bitcoin (specifically) aimed to solve. My thirst for knowledge only expanded when I learned of the opportunity space Ethereum was trying to fill. Compound that with the immutability of blockchain technology, DeFi, smart contracts, data oracles, (and the list goes on); now I'm completely hooked. It's clear to me that blockchain will revolutionize the way we function on the global scale. But many are just now beginning to learn about bBitcoin, and we're ahead of the curve. Which leads me back to point number 1; we're still early. 

  
Sorry for rambling on here; I'm sure more veteran HODLers have already X'd out of this post, which is fine. They likely don't need this information as they have learned these same tips along their own journeys. But for newcomers to the space, I wish I had this foundational knowledge from the get go. Don't be afraid to ask questions on this sub. With the recent implementation of MOON tokens (this is a whole 'nother topic), I've personally noticed more downvotes than normal. But awareness and understanding is critical to adoption, so don't be turned off if you don't get an answer to your questions immediately.

Wife and I did the town hall marriage last December, was going to have our wedding this year but didn’t happen due to the pandemic and are living separately with our families until we have our (probably much smaller) wedding in Summer 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current monthly financial situation:

\-monthly net income around $4825

\-$200 car payment

\-Minimum student loan payments \~$1200 (expected to go up to $1500ish once January comes and federal loan goes back into repayment); been paying $1600/mo since March

\-Been saving $2k/mo, have $28.7k saved up in a Citi HYSA (expecting to need $14k for wedding costs next summer). Starting this month, I’ll be providing $1k a month for my parents, and reducing monthly savings to $1k

\-Max out the 3% 401k from work, minimal credit card balance ($100-200)

\-Wife brings home between $2500-3000/mo, but she's supporting her family right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s my loan list:

\-Private loan (the big one): $93k, refinanced to 10yr. 4.1% in Dec. 2019. Monthly payment is $1070, been paying $1200-1500 throughout quarantine, since fed loans went to 0% until EOY. 

\-Federal loans: roughly $17k, interest ranging from 3.15%-4.4%. About 5 years left on these guys. 

\-No-interest loan: $7k, 5 years left. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question revolves around the big private loan. I looked into refinancing again and got offers for 10 yr 3.46% (monthly $920) and 15 yr 3.54% (monthly $670). I was thinking of taking the 10 yr term with the intention of continuing to make the $1500 monthly payments to pay this off faster, which I project to be about 5 years. 

Now, I’m tempted to take the 15 yr. term since the rate difference is minimal, and at $1500/mo that would be about another month or two worth of payments over the 10yr. term with the added flexibility of being able to reduce payments when I’m in a financial pinch. 

The thought hit me that it might be a better long-term financial move to take the 15 yr. loan, make minimum payments and invest the extra money that I would’ve been putting into the loan. I’m tempted to start investing, and have another $7k in my E\*TRADE account just sitting there from a former employer’s stock plan (cashed out close to its 1yr high in April). I’m tempted to take the extra $800 or so from my student loan payments with the new 15 yr. refi and put them into a dividend stock (T, O, ARCC are the ones I’ve had my eyes on) every month. Because, in theory, that annual dividend rate is way more than the 3.5% rate that I pay in interest, right?

How do I calculate the difference here, and what am I supposed to be comparing to pick the more financially sound option? I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to be looking at/crunching to pick the better move.",finance

CryptoMarkets,DeFi Projects in Blockchain,"DeFi stands for **Decentralized Finance**, which has  become a huge part of the blockchain industry. DeFi aims to be able to  carry out the same functions and more which blockchain does, with the  exclusion of the middlemen that are required for the services. To carry  these functions out, **smart contracts** come into play.  Smart contracts are automatically enforced contracts that apply to all  the users of blockchain technology, therefore eliminating the need for  middlemen such as banks or lawyers. This elimination improves the  efficiency as well as minimizes costs. For example, if you were to take a  loan, DeFi would allow you to get that loan without a lender. Instead,  your digital assets would be kept as collateral until the loan is  repaid. In this exchange, the lender would be the smart contract itself  and the interest rates are calculated using an algorithm based on demand  and supply.

According to[ an article](https://theconversation.com/what-is-defi-and-why-is-it-the-hottest-ticket-in-cryptocurrencies-144883)  in The Conversation, between September 2017 and August 2019, the total  value of DeFi contracts has risen up from US$2.1 million to US$6.9  billion (£1.6 million to £5.3 billion). This has created an increase in  the value of all trademark tokens that are used for DeFi smart  contracts, making way for new token-based startups to early success and  the current ones to a continually rising value.

As  we are living through a pandemic, the perfect time to embrace the  change to cryptocurrency has arrived. Having required the need for  social distancing and other laws, cryptocurrency provides the ultimate  “no interaction” policy as the need for middlemen does not exist. All  you need to be able to use the blockchain technology is a smartphone.  Emerging organizations provide you with a platform where you can handle  your finances and take part in trading all with the help of an app on  your smartphone. For example, Zin Finance is launching an application  that will allow you to link your debit card or payment source to its app  and handle your finances, as well as take place is trading and staking  of their token, Zin.

Looking at the success the blockchain industry has become, startups like [Zin](https://zin.finance/)  provide an easy-access platform with their applications, making it more  user-friendly for adults. Zin Finance combines the investment tools of  crypto and traditional stocks. The application makes trading seem like a  game and staking being your “locked up” reward that you earn a bonus  on. As we transform ourselves into the virtual world, these initiatives  knock down an obstacle that our older generation faces and younger  requires.

personalfinance,Seeking advice/sanity check on first home purchase - jumbo w/ 10% down,"Hello all,

SO and I are looking at purchasing a home for the first time in medium-high COL city. We are about to kick off a house search with a realtor but wanted to get some advice/sanity check as we proceed. Here's what we are looking at:

**Income/Take Home:**

* Combined income of $350K per year. We also have annual bonuses that are not included here (could be another $70K)
* We both have student loans (\~3 years left), max out retirement, and financially support parents
* **After the above, post-tax take home each month works out to be \~$14,000**
   * We are currently **renting a 2 bdrm for $3,300 per month**

**Discretionary Spending/Savings:**

* Based on 2019 and 2020 spending, our **monthly expenses are about $5,000**
   * This includes all spend: travel, food, shopping, bills, etc.
   * We've accounted for reduced spend during COVID, so feel confident $5,000 is about the right monthly estimate
   * We have families overseas, so annual travel expenses are high and not likely to change 
* We are currently **saving \~$6,000 per month**

**House Search:**

* Looking for a 3 bdrm townhouse, which in our area costs about **$850K - $950K** for a move-in ready unit in a good neighborhood
* We have enough saved for **10% down payment** plus closing costs
* This puts us in jumbo territory (not in a higher conforming loan limit area)
* We've received a **pre-approval at 3.5%** for the jumbo loan with 10% down 
* Thinking 5-10 year commitment
* With taxes, HOA, PMI, etc. all included, our monthly **cost for the home will be around $6,000 a month**

**Questions/Sanity Check:**

* Can we afford this? Numbers look fine, all online calculators and mortgage brokers say this is easily doable, but they are also telling us we can afford $1.5M house, so I take all that with a grain of salt
* How does 3.5% for a jumbo loan (from a broker) with 10% down compare? We've tried to use online aggregators and checked a few lenders, but not many are giving pre-approvals for jumbo with less than 20% down. Are there any lenders we should check?
* How much should I be setting aside for repairs? Hopefully a newer construction will help minimize repair costs, but what should I budget? 1% of purchase price per year?
* Does it make sense to be in a situation where we are saving \~$3K each month when our fixed expenses (student loans + mortgage) would be close to $10K a month?
* Should we wait to buy? We are putting down 10% to buy now when interest rates are low. We'd have another $40K in reserves for emergencies after the down payment.  Getting to 20% down payment would take \~18 months, which feels too long (interest rate fluctuation, current rent, and desire for a bigger home)

We don't really have anyone we can go to advice on this, so we'd appreciate your thoughts based on what we've laid out. Thanks in advance.",finance

stocks,Market Recap - Monday October 12 PLEASE ENJOY!!,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 12, 2020**

Stocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.

Prospects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week’s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that “the bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.” While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. 

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), “New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market.

personalfinance,"Despite reading the Wiki, I am still uncertain about how to approach my financial situation. Specifically, I want to know how I can optimize the configuration of my accounts.","Hi all,

Although I (24 years) have read the Wiki, I still feel unsure how to go about optimizing my current situation. I am hoping to get some advice about how to tackle several areas of my finances to steer me in a the right direction. I would also appreciate any suggestions around changing banks, opening new accounts, optimizing payments and direct deposits, etc. The following is my current configuration:

* **Banking: Wells Fargo** 
   * I have a general checking account that acts as my savings - I went over the monthly transfer limit one too many times so they converted the savings account to a checking account; I have \~$25K sitting idle in it currently, but some of that is meant to be my emergency fund; my direct deposit is set up for this account so after contributing to my 401(K) all leftover money flows here
   * I have the WF Platinum CC; I have had it for probably 5 years and pay my bill several times each month in full
* **Debt: Student Loans**
   * Unsubsidized Loan in my name through OSLA
      * 4.8% interest rate
      * $3,936.37 in principal left to pay 
      * 3/19/2021 maturity
   * Loan in my mother's name that I pay for
      * $150 monthly payments so far
      * \~7% interest rate (guessing since I can't pull the info right now)
      * \~$10,000 in principal left to pay (guessing since I can't pull the info right now)
      * Not sure of the maturity
* **401(K)**
   * I have a 401(K) plan with my company where they match 100% on the first 3% and then 50% on the next 3% (effective match of 4.5%); I am contributing 7% currently
* **Investment Accounts**
   * Charles Schwab account
      * \~$2.5K in a money market account that my father set up for me when I was 18 and didn't get access until I was 21; Didn't know what to do with the money at the time, and since I was still in school I figured there was no harm in letting it sit there in case I needed it. At this point, I know I need to invest it but I am concerned about where to put it. Kicking myself for not acting sooner, but better late than never. I hear a lot about SPY and I know I want something like an ETF or index that will steadily grow without me having to pay much attention.
   * Roth IRA account
      * Recently opened a Roth with the financial advisor my parents use, but I have yet to contribute. After reading the Wiki I'm wondering if it would be better to forgo this and just set one up using Schwab
   * HSA (Health Equity / WageWorks)
      * $1,500/year total contributions; $1,200/year in personal contributions, company contributes $300/year
      * 80/20 between VIGIX &amp; VIIIX, respectively
      * Automatic rebalance every 3 months
      * Mandate to keep $1,000 in cash and invest anything on top of that
      * Soon after opening the HSA I developed a medical condition that I have so far been unable to fully cure so I have seen a doctor more regularly than I normally would, though annual cost is probably around $600 after insurance

**Questions:**

* Banking
   * Should I call WF and convert my checking account back to a savings account? Should I move my savings to a HYSA such as Marcus? 
   * How can I set up various accounts so that I can shift my money across them while staying under the transfer limit? I want to be able to have different buckets where I can allocate portions of my paycheck. If you have this configured can you please explain how I should go about doing it? Ideally, I can have different accounts for savings, checking, an emergency fund, vacation, and maybe car payments, leaving the HSA for medical/dental expenses.   
   * Should I set up an automatic transfer of some fixed amount to go to my Schwab account each time I am paid or is there a better method of siphoning money from my paycheck into my Schwab account to be invested? I know there is a direct deposit option where you have to call your payroll company to arrange - is that a good option?
* Debt 
   * Should I do as the Wiki says and pay down all debt immediately since I have the funds and the interest rates are above 4%, or should I dump all my additional funds into my Schwab account and invest while continuing to make the minimum payments and not accruing interest during this time due to COVID? Should I consider refinancing instead? 
* Roth
   * Should I instead open a Roth with Schwab? I completely trust the financial advisor and my family has been with them for a very long time. Although they are great people, I don't know if a Roth with them is better than Schwab.
* HSA
   * I have no idea what I'm doing here. I figure $1,000 cash ought to be good enough to cover any yearly expenses, but with the ongoing medical condition I described I don't know if an HSA is now a worse option than a lower deductible plan. 
* General Saving
   * Since I have been saving a good bit of money on top of contributing to my 401(K) and HSA, I think I am good to increase my contributions to those, a Roth, and my Schwab account. Please let me know if there is anything else you might advise me to consider when it comes to doing this.

personalfinance,"Age old question: Repair the transmission, or get a new car?","GF's tranny going out. Looking for advice for financials.

Car: 2013 Nissan Rogue
Transmission rebuild: 3500-4000
Transmission replace: 4500-5500
Possible bandaid (add a tranny cooler - gamble): 1000

KBB Trade-in value ""good"": 5000
KBB Trade-in value ""fair"": 3500

Car was purchased 2 years ago for ~$13k with 82k miles
$6075 is still owed 110k miles current. Interest rate is 3.99%

This is a known issue with these vehicles- they have transmission problems because it's a terrible transmission. My guess is that even if we fix the thing it'll break again. She has the money to eat the cost of getting out of this vehicle she's upside down in, but not really the time or willpower to find a new car. (But a good financial argument might convince her to suck it up.)

I've looked into extended warranties which were offered because Nissan was forced to (because, again, terrible transmissions) - they only offer it up to 2012 from what I've seen, so her car misses the cut off.

Financially speaking what's the most practical way forward?

Is there any trick someone may have to get this thing repaired for cheaper- get Nissan, insurance, or the slimy dealership to pay for it (they're not slimy because of this- that's a different story, but even a reputable dealership I wouldn't guess would jump to help with this one)

I'm biased because I don't like the car, but I don't think a transmission repair is worth it ($4k for a $1.5k value add), being upside down kinda confounds me though, and how would she even off load this car to a dealer ship.",finance
personalfinance,Which Student Loan to Pay First: Higher Principal or Higher Interest Rate?,"Here's the situation, my wife and I both refinanced our student loans through private lenders before the pandemic, so we haven't benefited from the interest freeze by the US gov't. (bummer, I know). 

I have a loan of \~$90,400 @ 3.89% interest for 75 more months.  Min payment is $1,508/month

My wife has a loan of \~$44,000 @ 4.72% interest for 75 more months. Min payment is $734/month

We're currently on pace to pay off our loans early by paying $4,500/month split $3,060/month to my loan and $1,440/month to my wife's. This will allow us to pay off our loans at approximately the same time +/- 1 month. 

My question is, should we keep going down this path or should we focus on paying one of the loans off sooner, and why do you say that?

personalfinance,Advice on car loan,"Hello! 

First, a little background information: I am 23 years old, a college student and I have a part time job. Currently, I have a total yearly income of about $28,000. If all goes to plan, by the end of this year or soon next year, I will have a full-time job that pays roughly $40-45,000. Currently, I have no issue covering all normal living expenses, and I typically have about 600 or $700 left over to save each month. Although COVID slowed down my plans to get the full-time position, the manager is adamant that she wants to create the position and hire me as soon as she can. 

I am also a car enthusiast. My attainable dream car is a 2019 or newer Mazda Miata. Based on the research that I've done, I expect that the full price of the car once I'm ready to buy will be around $28,000.  This leads me to a few questions, which I'm trying to plan for now. 

1. I've seen my parents make some pretty bad financial decisions regarding car loans. My mom is still digging herself out of a hole from when she totaled a car that she was upside down on the loan. I have no interest in ever making this mistake. I want to save up enough money so that I can make a down payment such that I only have to finance a maximum of $10,000. I'm also not interested in a particularly long car loan, I would really like to stay at or under 4 years. I feel like a down payment of this size would leave me with a car that is always worth more than what I owe. Is a $10,000 loan for 4 years reasonable? 


2. I've heard horror stories of people getting screwed over regarding interest rate. This will be a gently used car, but I understand the interest rates on loans are typically a little bit higher if the car is used. What kind of interest rate should I target, and what can I do to improve my chances of getting good interest rate? Depending on whether you ask my bank or nerd wallet, my credit score is either 720 or 686. I have a credit card with a $900 limit, where I typically only put about $200 on it per month and pay it off entirely each month. 


3. Although I want to get the miata, I'm interested in keeping my current car. The Miata is not exactly the most practical car, and I want to keep my current car so that I can haul people and larger things around with me. What can I do to ensure that I pay a reasonable amount for insurance for two cars? I do have one accident on my record from when someone hit me in an intersection a couple years ago. I also have one speeding ticket from a year ago, and one from the year before that. Both tickets were for 10 miles or less over the speed limit, and I don't plan on getting any more.


4. Unless I win the lottery, (unlikely, I don't play it) this probably won't happen for about a year to a year and a half, but I'd really like to know what I can start doing now to make this easier on myself and get the best deal possible when I'm ready to buy. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,When is liquidity more valuable than technically being debt-free?,"I graduated college in 2019 and have been employed since. Apart from having stellar retirement stuff going on, I moved out and I can support myself.

I've been following the typical advice to pay off debts and start an emergency fund. My car finally kicked the bucket and now I need a new one sooner than I anticipated. Well, lucky me I have that emergency fund. I can technically pay for a new (used) car in cash but it's going to significantly demolish my savings.

I'm already planning to pay for this in cash, but it got me thinking, in what cases, (like this) &amp; (assuming you can get a loan with a very low interest rate) is liquidity more valuable to you than than not taking on a debt? Is that ever true? If not, why? Does an unstable economy change this?",finance

gaming,Fifa 21 Switch review from a fifahead,"I have only played 20 and 21 on switch so I'm not as upset about the visual interface being the same as 19. That is absolutely wild that EA wouldn't bother to at least change up the UI. That's less attention than they give to FIFA Mobile. 

That being said, FIFA 20 for switch was clearly a game that needed some patches anyway. 21 is a superior game as far as the tweaks to defending specifically. They nerfed dribbling as was very much needed. The new distance shooting is hell to defend against but you have a better defensive interface to counter it. Much, much better game. That being said they literally could have just patched 20 and been done with it. Even the formation menu used to glitch and your players were all in wrong positions,they never bothered to patch it the entire year. In that way it's almost like they did it on purpose to make sure we would buy 21.

Also to call the game full price is just not true, it's $10 cheaper than the Xbox and ps versions. The game itself is worth it, it's just that it's not worth 50 dollars just to upgrade. Personally I was getting sick of the soundtrack of 20 anyway so I'm a big fan.

Tldr: 21 is better, if they had changed the UI at all, just to show they still care, it would be a pretty great game",technology

personalfinance,Anybody find a (relatively) high-rate interest checking *WITHOUT* debit card activity?,"Hi friends, longtime/first time. I’m looking for a primary checking account with decently high interest rates, without required debit card activity (direct deposit requirement is doable for me). Preferably comes with free checks, and Zelle compatibility, but those are bonuses. So far I’ve found following:

DCU: 0.50% interest; T-Mobile Money: 4% on $3K, 1% thereafter; Axos Bank: 0.42% interest when you meet their direct deposit requirement

I already have the T-Mobile money account and get the interest, but I want something with branch access and check writing and preferably Zelle for my primary account. DCU is the favorite right now since I have a savings account there as well, and I believe they offer free checks and shared branch access, but no Zelle. 

Currently my main checking is PNC Bank’s Virtual Wallet Checking Pro, which has no monthly fees, but doesn’t accrue interest on the checking account, though it gets a decent 0.8% on the Growth savings account, which I use for short term savings. I get free checks and Zelle access through this account currently, so I may just keep this as my primary checking, if there’s not too much out there.  

Any recommendations for banks/credit unions you like with solid interest rates on checking? FWIW I’m located in MI.",finance
personalfinance,How much will go towards principle?,"Im just trying to understand compound interest. For example, I have poor credit, but needed a car right away so I bought a 14,000 car and got approved for a 19% for 72 months interest rate.

I am working on building my credit and the sales guy told me I can refinance in a year once my score goes up more. My question is since my payments are 297 how much of that will go towards principle? I plan on paying 397 every month to pay if off quicker and I am a little well off financially so I can make even bigger payments every now and then so I can avoid that 72 months.

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency is less liquid than cash now, but tomorrow it can be JUST AS LIQUID.","For the argument “Crypto is less liquid than cash”, wouldn’t you say that cryptocurrency (or at least some) IS JUST AS liquid as cash? That’s one of the driving goals behind lightning network in the bitcoin camp to create a viable layer 2 solution to transact bitcoin at better intervals. Or same with the emergence of Ethereum 2.0 releases. 

I understand people have to sell off their coins in order to purchase things, but isn’t the eventual point for using crypto is that you’ll never really need to do that if businesses, and other services started to accept crypto currency as a viable form of payment? People will claim market is too volatile, but within these markets, stable coins offer an solution to that concern as they do not change in value so they can be a viable use of commerce. Maybe not the ones like we have today (Dai, USDT, or USDC) but maybe government issued ones. Hopefully along with those new coins better regulatory classifications will follow.

Tokenomics becoming more popular with the emergence of DeFi systems, and NFTs. From what I seen, cryptocurrency could make assets that weren’t as liquid, become even more liquid. Just have to get creative with how you structure this. 

This is just a thought I had, I want to know you all thoughts. We are far from the world using some cryptocurrencies as medium of exchange. From the covid pandemic, to the USA Federal Reserve reduced distribution of physical coins, it’s promoting a lot pf businesses to go cashless. Even fintech companies are providing better liquidity solutions for liquidation of assets. Appending cryptocurrency and blockchain technology would just accelerate these application performance.

personalfinance,Credit score is hindering getting desired interest rate on a mortgage,"First time posting, hope I explain this properly. My wife (27F) and I (26M) are buying our first home together. We are buying a house that has yet to be built; it's not custom but one those companies that lets you choose from available floorplans and hundreds of options and whatnot. It's the perfect house for us though. The final price comes out to be $420k. We have doctorates and make $226,000 annually pre-tax. In 2 years out of school we were able to save around $90k and this was when she was in residency and making half of what she makes now. We both have sizable student loan debt in the low six-figures but had no trouble making payments pre-covid deferment.

Regarding the mortgage, we are deciding to go with the builder's mortgage company because they are offering $10k towards closing costs. We are planning on putting down 12-15% down (50-60K). Based on early talks with the lender, interest rates for us for a conventional 30yr fixed could be as low as 2.875% which is similar to what a couple of friends were able to secure. This obviously can change by the time we close in 5-6 months when the house is done but all sources indicate rates will probably stay this low. 

On to my immense stupidity. I have only had one credit card that I've used like a total of three times. I had some small medical bill go to collections like 5 years ago because I wasn't even aware of the bill and paid it off promptly. My credit score is 673, I'm assuming because I just haven't built any credit at all. My wife's is 761. In the initial loan questionnaire I put both our info down and at the phone interview we had with their lender last night it was revealed that my credit score was being used to determine the interest rate of 3.6% as of right now.

I know this is a good interest rate in general but I was really hoping to get something around 3% or less given the current lender climate with covid. We are very new to this and clueless in many regards but I personally still feel very stupid for failing to be an adult in a very simple matter and just using my credit card for shit to build credit. What are some things that we can do to get a better interest rate? Would it be possible to start the process over and just use my wife as the sole person on the loan if she qualifies? Do I just suck it up and build my credit, take the interest rate as it is at closing and refinance when my credit is better?

We live pretty comfortably and have about 2 - 3k leftover every month to pay our rent/ utilities/ eat/ etc after we pay his student loan debt, taxes, and malpractice insurance amongst some other random stuff.

Technically we make a little over $400k on paper because my tuition reimbursement is treated as income. But the reality is this means I'm currently on the hook to pay for a hefty tax bill at the end of the year for money we never see. I saved up some money before we got married in anticipation of this problem so we're square for this year, but I'm terrified about the next few years.

The taxes on my tuition reimbursement are currently more than we have leftover after his taxes/ debt payments. We could take out debt, and an old coworker recommended purchasing a house because physicians can get 0% down loans and we could then at least write off the interest payments and have some equity. Our parents are convinced we should just have a kid right now. We're also tempted to suck it up and pay for an accountant because we're in such a mess.

personalfinance,Need advice on how to get out of installment loan hell.,"A couple of months ago I signed up for an installment loan because I was faced with an unexpected expense  and needed funds immediately to fix the situation.

Bitcoin,What the Department of Justices Recent Obession with Cryptography and Crypto is About,"I often post things here that really come across as fud, but what we have seen these last couple months is an explosion in regulator activity. The way the US federal government works, is it sits on cases for years at a time in secrecy, and then it attacks.

There are many obscure laws that people are all unaware of which entirely relate to the war on terror and 9/11 and the Patriot Act. The truth is that most of these banking laws that changed are a result of their pretense to behave like a police state under the guise of fighting terrorism. Well What does that have to do with bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

They want to set the precedence of those anti terrorism laws and banking laws onto end to end encryption and bitcoin. These people have a clear motive they are trying to keep hid, that crypto lawyer are beginning to speculate isn't off the table. They certainly implied in the DoJ 83 page report that those options are on the table. But the truth is, they \*already\* want to do it anyways.

Before I make the case for what I am alleging you need to know about the key regulatory bodies and some of these laws, which I'm just gonna list for you to research in case you doubt me:

1) OFAC 2)FATF 3)BIS 4)Interpol 5)Banking Secrecy Act 6)Treasury Department 7)Federal Reserve

Namely, What can the US do under OFAC in the guise of anti terrorism. Well the short answer is ANYTHING. And that is what this 83 page guide by Barr is claiming, that is what the Bitmex Indictment by the Department of Justice is claiming, that is what they have been doing in Afghanistan and Iraq for 20 years. It's been like this since 9/11 and now they are squaring in on crypto.

***It is clear that the Department of Justice and AG Barr do not want Bitcoin to function as Bitcoin, much like end to end encryption they want a back door***

But let's talk about what that ***looks*** like.

1) Forcing every country in the world to enforce mandatory KYC on all decentralized smart contracts and all centralized exchanges with the threat of extrajudicial indictment and OFAC black listing for Banking Secrecy Act violations and Terrorism funding.

2) Forcing every country to prohibit withdrawls to any non preregistered white listed address that has been vetted by CipherTrace and Chain Analysis with the threat as stated in 1)

3) Forcing every country to prohibit US customers from making an account without extremely profoundly high regulatory costs, thus trapping capital in the united states and prohibiting US citizen from investing overseas, as most modern Banks today will no longer take Americans as customers overseas, due to the same regulatory threats.

4) Forcing every merchant in America, and as many outside of America to use Chain Analysis and Cipher Trace on all transactions to vet the source of the funds, ***and if those funds do not have a chain of custody on a public blockchain linking back to a white listed kyced account, then rejecting those transactions (no more monero)***

5) Forcing every exchange in the world to do the same chain of custody verification on every customer just as above.

6) Disallowing any deposits in a US financial exchange to cash out without said chain of custody.

7) Disallowing any cash out of funds that have not been declared as owned assets in a perpetually pervasively monitored public address that the US regulatory bodies know about.

8) ***The constant threat of censorship and forced confiscation.***

9) ***The backdooring of all hardware wallets and software wallets, prosecution of developers. Indictments against Trezor and Ledgernano.***

10) ***Perpetual Surveilance***

Story:

We are ready to move on to the next stage of our lives but before buying a house, we wanted to make sure we like the area and our jobs, so planning to rent a house for 2-3 years before committing fully to buying a property (even with interest rates being so low!!). Anyways, we are looking in an area that is apparently very hot, both for buying and renting. We were looking at listings on websites like Trulia, Zillow, Compass etc. but anytime we inquired about one, it seemed like the house was already rented out, even though it was just posted &lt;1 week ago.

Recently, one of the people we e-mailed on Trulia later e-mailed us, asking if we wanted her to set up a profile on her agency's web portal which we did. She asked us general stuff we were looking for - price, bedrooms, etc, seemed legit and didn't ask us for any personal info, so we gave it. Now we are getting e-mails from her agency regularly with new rentals on the market via MLS, which we like.

However, she recently e-mailed us asking for the above information, stating that the market is so hot that to secure the rental, we need to be ready to pounce as soon as the it hits the market. I think it is making me nervous because I never heard of someone working with a renter to find a house for them to rent. I searched online but all the results seem to be for people seeking to rent out their house, rather than someone looking for a house to rent. The person has a real estate license and all that so I'm pretty sure its legit. I guess I'm being paranoid but just want to make sure it is OK to give this information, especially hearing all these scams out there.

personalfinance,Which is the best car budgeting option?,"Hello all! About a year ago, I (25m) made a decision to buy a used a German car (2014 Audi SQ5 for those who want to know). While it has been reliable and relatively problem free, save for some tire issues and minor small thing, some of the big stuff is coming up like brakes, rotors and new tires. Estimated cost of at those two are gonna run around $2000. 

When I purchased the car, I told myself to have fun with it for a year and then get something that’s (much)better on gas and easier to maintain. That year mark is coming up so I’ve been thinking of a couple of options and goals that I want to achieve. Currently my car payment is $375 a month for 72 months, insurance is $185 a month (live in Denver and had a ticket or two before I purchased the car), and gas is about $200-$250 a month. To simply put, let’s say my monthly car expenses are about $800 month. 

I have a personal loan that I would like to get rid of as soon as possible and some credit card debt to bring down as well so I’m looking at ways to lower my car operating costs and apply that to those debts. 

There are two options I’m thinking of: A) purchase a cheap car outright (like around $2k) or B) purchase a used electric vehicle.

The first option is enticing because, obviously, no payments and cheaper insurance. However I’m concerned with how long it will hold up because I drive a lot (about 20k a year) and don’t want to pay more in service visits, maintenance costs than the actual cost of the vehicle.

The second option is interesting for a couple of reasons as I’m really leaning towards a BMW i3. I work for a BMW dealership so I get discounts at our service and parts department and I can do free charging at work. However the con is back to payments, albeit much cheaper than my current payments. The one I’m looking at also has a small gas generator to power the battery if it’s charge is depleted.

I’m not sure which would be the best option to go with, I could luck out on the super cheap car and have nothing go wrong or everything. However, with the i3, I can get much newer tech, better reliability, and near elimination of gas costs. I should also mention that this will be my only car for another year so I don’t have anything to fall back on. 

It’s a tough situation I’ve gotten myself into, luckily my place of work is able to give me money for my current car so if I trade it in for something in our preowned inventory, I will not have to make a down payment. I want to hear some suggestion and opinions as getting insight from this would be really helpful. Thank you!

Edit: Current car pay off is $18.5k and my work is able to give me $19.5k so they are giving $1k which I would use towards a down payment. Loan is over 72 months at 4.14% interest. The i3 I am looking at is about $16k after taxes and is a 2015 model with range extender. I make about 40k a year and my monthly bills and utilities come out to about $1650 without the car, $2190 with just car payments not including gas.

Another option they have given me is leasing a new plug-in hybrid from there. On 3yr/12k mile plan it would be $415 a month and $215 for insurance. Operating cost would be much lower since all scheduled maintenance is covered over 3yr/36k miles plus 4yr/50k warranty. I would also receive a federal tax credit if about $4k if I went with this option. Not to mention I’d be saving a lot in gas since a single charge can make it from home to work (about 20 miles) and the gas tank is much smaller to fill. Fill up on this option is about $20-$25 where as my current car is about $45-$55 once a week

To put it simply, my goal is lower my monthly cost of the car itself for now and use that saved money towards paying off other things faster to then use the freed up monthly towards a nice car in the future.",finance

personalfinance,current economy killed my career. Overwhelmed by my expenses.,"I got furloughed at the start of the pandemic due to the industry I'm in. I was holding on to hope that the pandemic would die out and we could get back to work, but I just found out I'm now laid off permanently and my company is going under. I'm already pretty stressed out, so if folks could not attack me for bad decisions, it would be appreciated.

until about a year and half ago, I had never had debt other than my student loans. No CC's, no personal loans, no home loans, no auto loans, nothing. Then I got a 140% pay increase/promotion to $90k a year by switching jobs. My car was 22 yrs old, had 275k miles on it and needed constant work, so I stupidly decided to lifestyle creep and got into an expensive auto loan and two credit cards.

I've been out of work since the day the pandemic got real in the US, i.e. mid March. I've been on unemployment since then. I apply for jobs 5 days a week, but my industry is toast (my entire LinkedIn feed is everyone in my network begging for jobs, or going to school to switch careers). I have one company that set up the meeting/3rd interview to give me an offer, then cancelled it citing internal HR issues. They say they're going to extend an offer soon when the new HR staff gets up and running, but I'm not holding my breath. So I guess this is me coming to reality and accepting that my industry isn't coming back and I have to make some changes and probably go to school or just live a LOT cheaper.

so here's my stupid situation:

* My UI comes out to the equivalent of $14/hr. It should last until mid march with all the extensions in my state, but I want to get back to work and not count on that. Minimum wage where I am currently is about $8 an hour. Even trade jobs or retail/food service management jobs here pay less than my UI (which is from another state).

* Staying with family, so no rent at the moment. If I go back to my state, the pay is much higher (i.e. mcdonald's pays $14/hr or more), but my rent costs would increase to at least $800/month. My food, gas, etc would also be higher. That said, I'm too old to be living with my parents and they're driving me insane. 

* I have about $10k in cash between checking and savings. This was higher, but the UI doesn't cover my costs, so I've been paying bills out of this.

* I have two cards, one with a $2800 balance and one with a $5k balance. The $5k balance one was no interest until this month. It's now high interest.

* my car loan is $45k+ and somewhat high interest due to my lack of credit history and the mediocre score I had when I bought it. My payment is around $800/month. was easy when I was making $90k with minimal expenses as a single guy, but is now really a problem. I was planning on refinancing it after a year, but lost my job before I did that. The market value of the car according to KBB is about $38k. They've been selling high lately due to COVID making supply scarce, so in theory I could get $40k or more for it to get out from under the loan, but don't want to count that into the equation.

* I have no family or friends that can help. As bad as this sounds, I'm the best one in my family about money for several generations back.

* I'm currently spending nothing on hobbies and have nothing to sell. I cancelled any streaming subscriptions and other extra costs a long time ago.

* all of my accounts are current and paid up. I always pay my bills ahead of time. I have no collections on my record. My federal student loans are in automatic COVID deferment.

* I'm now paying COBRA payments for my health insurance. This is pretty high.

* I updated my budget last night, and to cover all of my costs currently (car payment, car insurance, phone, health insurance, food, card payments, gas), I need to make at least $24/hr or around $50k a year. To cover all of that plus $800/month rent, I need to make $33/hr or around $68k.

* If I move to NYC or LA, I can make $80k-$90k a year easy, but my rent would go up to probably $1k, plus transportation costs and increased food, etc. costs. My costs at that point would be $72k. In theory, my health insurance costs would decrease. I'm avoiding this because I get very, very depressed living in big cities and usually get anti social and hide in my apartment.

* completely willing to go back to school, but already have a liberal arts bachelor's with debt

I realize there's a fair amount of stupid decisions in there. If I could do it over, I wouldn't take out the student loans or the car loan or the cards. What I need at this point is advice on moving forward. I know I should sell my car, but it would take over half of my current cash to do that, and I would be left needing a car in a rural area with no public transportation of any kind, and only having like $3k to my name and no job. I can't trade it in at the dealer for a cheaper car, because I don't have a job, so no one will give me a new loan.

personalfinance,Dentist in considerable debt weighing career transition options,"Hello all,

I am a 32-year old general dentist with $400k+ in student loans. I graduated in 2015 and completed a general residency. I currently work in private practice and teach, both P/T.

My savings are approximately $20k, and I am currently on the REPAYE plan, 25 years at 10% discretionary with an eventual tax bomb. The likelihood I stay on this trajectory is very low, given the financial duress it would cause for any potential relationship lol.

My annual salary has been lower than industry average due to several factors. First, I have a chronic shoulder injury, which despite the progress I've made, affects my ability of working long hours to some degree. Second, the associateships have had limitations, mainly the number of active patients, and hours and days needed.

I am also a bit of an idealist in that I am very conservative with treatment planning, hyper-attentive with the quality of my work, and most heavily focused on patient education. My patients trust me and my coworkers respect me, but from an owner's perspective I am not the most valuable associate.

Finally, with consideration to my teaching position, I do receive a prorated F/T salary, which is far better than the minimal pay. Given my P/T status, however, I do not receive any benefits and have been unable to count any years towards PSLF.

All in all, it's within reason to say my first four years following residency have been challenging, resulting in personal stress and financial instability.

I remain optimistic that I am still relatively young in my career, and God willing, I have a lot of years ahead of me. At the same time, I recognize the dire need to be more goal-oriented and fiscally responsible to get out of debt. In order to so, I need to focus on a single career trajectory, and cut out the others. The options I'm considering, as well as their respective pros and cons, are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Specialize. Pros: pursuing field of greatest personal passion and interest, higher profitability, likely best balance of work and pay; Cons: high tuition, loss of otherwise income during residency years, an even higher initial debt should I enter partnership/ownership, and lack of clarity regarding the L-T future of specialty.
2. Remain in private practice as a general dentist. Partnership/Ownership in 1-2 years. Pros: independence and high potential profitability; Cons: high initial debt, highest stress.
3. Academics F/T. Pros: influencing future dentists and promoting better dentistry, PSLF, lower stress; Cons: not performing clinical dentistry and treating patients, low independence, lowest profitability.
4. Service Corp. Pros: highest job stability, 20-year retirement pay, lowest stress; Cons: lowest independence, low career advancement, lowest profitability.

&amp;#x200B;

My greatest interest is Periodontics, and I have continually entertained the thought of going back to school and specializing. My inability to gain financial stability as a general dentist as well as the increased debt I would have to take upon gives me caution. In addition, I have some concern regarding the L-T viability of the field given the ever-increasing overlapping of the specialties, the difficulty in establishing one's presence in the community and gaining referral sources.

Should I remain in private practice, my preference is to become an owner/partner within the next year or two. However, I am aware of the financial and time investment requirements, as well as the stresses that come with ownership. I actually signed a LOI and entered the lending phase for a FFS practice this summer, educating myself and learning the ins and outs of the financial and legal aspects of practice transition and business management. As comprehensive as my business plan is and favorable the asking price was (62%), no dental lender is willing to fully finance the practice due to declining revenues in light of COVID restrictive lending. As I do not readily have 10% liquidity yet, I will likely have to move on. While this experience has greatly prepared me for if and when I enter into ownership or partnership, I will postpone my search for 1 year.

My primary focus for this upcoming 1-2 years will be to work hard as an associate and save money in order to reach 10% liquidity, whether I set my sights upon partnership/ownership or not.

Having said that, I have recently been considering the possibility of pursuing PSLF and NHSC positions. For clarification purposes, does anyone know whether Active Duty health professionals receive PSLF, in addition to NHSC benefits? Also, are there other types of positions that qualify for PSLF, apart from federal prisons, Indian Health Service, and VA hospitals?

In summary, all four career trajectories are viable options with the respective pros and cons, but in order to be more goal-oriented I need to cut down my options. For someone that is a bit of an idealist, loves the educational aspects of healthcare and dentistry, and is less financially driven but wants stability, do you have recommendations or additional considerations for me to consider? 

Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

investing,Fidelity's latest report says portfolios should consider 5% Bitcoin allocation,"[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060\_www\_fidelity\_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-alternative-investment.pdf](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-alternative-investment.pdf)

&gt;Consider a portfolio with a target allocation of 5% bitcoin. If bitcoin’s allocation rises to 10% of the portfolio due to its outperformance relative to other assets, a disciplined rebalancing strategy would dictate selling bitcoin to bring its allocation back to the 5% target and using the funds to increase the allocation to other asset classes, which have drifted below their target allocation. If bitcoin underperforms and declines to 1% of the portfolio, investors would buy bitcoin and sell their position in other asset classes that are above their target allocation. An advantage of rebalancing is that it forces investors to have the discipline to buy low and sell high. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

* Director of Research Ria Bhutoria wrote that the crypto’s current market capitalization “is a drop in the bucket compared with markets bitcoin could disrupt.”
* Bhutoria argued that while institutional inflows may damp bitcoin’s uncorrelated performance, the crypto is “fundamentally less exposed” to the “economic headwinds” that other assets will likely face.
* Bitcoin is therefore a “potentially useful” asset for uncorrelated return-seeking investors. “Consider a portfolio with a target allocation of 5% bitcoin,” she wrote.

personalfinance,Building credit with a car loan,"My boyfriend (we are in a long term, committed relationship, just don't want to get married) got out of bankruptcy a little under a year ago. He has a secured credit card, but no other lines of credit.  He has been paying the balance off every month in an effort to establish credit.

Two and a half years ago, he was rear ended, which totalled his car. Dealing with insurance was difficult, but the settlement helped him get out of the bankruptcy a few months early. He was able to get a car loan, but it had a 21% interest rate. I have pretty good credit (795) with minimal debt and was comfortable getting a loan in my name at 3.9% to help him afford a used car. I'm working on paying down all my debt and should be done by early 2022 at my current rate. 

Now that he has been out of bankruptcy for a while, I'm wondering if we could transfer the loan to his name (he is not currently on the loan, but pays for it monthly and pays for insurance which is also under my name). He has never missed a payment for the car or the insurance and has about $6700 left on the loan. 

Does it make sense to try to ""sell"" the car to him for the payoff so we can put the car in his name or should we just keep trucking along and try to find other ways for him to establish more credit?

I purchased a house last October for $34,000 from my father's first cousin. He basically sold me the land and the house came for free. I didn't have the money to purchase upfront and needed to finance it, which is where things had to get creative. Due to a septic system that was not up to code, no bank would approve the sale for a mortgage. I have a great relationship with my parents, and they agreed to lend me the necessary money to purchase the house through money they borrowed from a line of credit.

I grew up on a farm with a do-it-all father who taught me countless construction/trade skills and the two of us did all of the labor ourselves. Fast forward to almost one year later, I have invested about $27,000 out of pocket and hundreds of hours (thanks Covid) and it is getting some final touches before it is ready to rent. My question is: What should I do to finance the necessary $34,000 to repay my parents? I have looked into a home equity loan, HELOC, and private loans. Credit Karma says I am sitting around a 770-775 credit score. I am just having a hard time trying to figure out which one to go with and how I get the process started.

I am fine with paying it off quickly if it is a less than desirable interest rate, but am also open to the idea of letting the rental income pay for the loan itself if I can reinvest the rest of the income into another property. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,IUL vs roth IRA: an in-depth comparison of features and projections,"I've been pitched an IUL and everything I read online says to stay away. I see that an IUL might have some great benefits. I'll compare what I've learned about an IUL to a roth IRA and would like some feedback. I realize that there might be more options out there (i.e. 401k contributions and ER match) but let’s keep it simple for now. I’m sure I’m missing crucial info so please provide feedback and I’ll continually edit the info below.

*Assumptions: $11k contribution in year 1, 2% increase per year for 35 years (age 30 – 65). Withdrawing $169k per year starting at age 66. Stock market returns averaging 7% per year.*

**Contributions**

IRA - $11k is invested in an index fund. Currently, the income limit for an IRA is around $200k but we’re going to ignore that for this exercise.

IUL - $8.5k is put into cash value (see investments below), $2.5k pays for life insurance and plan fees. No contribution limits.

**Investments**

IRA – Fidelity total market index fund

IUL – Not actually invested, but it tracks the total market. Interest is credited to the cash value of your policy at the end of each year based on the index performance.

**Death benefit**

IRA – None. Most likely need to supplement with term life insurance until the IRA balance is large enough to cover your needs. IRA balance paid out upon death.

IUL - $750k for this policy. Death benefit is guaranteed starting on day 1, paid out upon death. Cash value of policy is also paid out upon death.

**Fees**

IRA – Expense ratio of Fidelity total market index is .015% on managed assets per year. This is incredibly small - $150 for every $1M annually. Other undisclosed fees average 2.2% on managed assets per year (probably closer to 1% for larger institutions like Fidelity). This is really large - $11k for every $1M annually. You could also consider the cost of term life insurance here since it’s an expense you’ll pay for when you go with the IRA plan – assume $600 per year for the same death benefit.

IUL - $3k average per year - covers the cost of insurance and other plan fees.

Can someone confirm the undisclosed fees on an IRA?

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp)

**Returns**

IRA – Market returns

IUL – Market returns with a 0% floor, 12% ceiling. Resets annually.

* So if there is a 30% decrease in year 1, and a 10% increase in year 2, the net return for the IRA is -23% while the net return for the IUL is 10%.
* So if there is a 30% increase in year 1, and a 10% decrease in year 2, the net return for the IRA is 17% while the net return for the IUL is 12%.

**Tax benefits**

IRA – Contributions are post-tax and withdraw (principle and interest) are tax free.

IUL – Contributions are post-tax and loans (principle and interest) are tax free.

**Income during retirement**

IRA – Withdraws that reduce your total balance. If your balance is big enough then you’ll be able to withdraw less than the amount of growth each year less fees and the balance will grow (or at least not decrease) forever.

IUL – Loans from your policy to yourself at a set interest rate (typically between 3% an 5%). The money that is loaned out still grows at a rate of the spread between the market returns and your interest rate (i.e. if you loan out $100k at 4% and the market returns 7% that year, you still make 3% on the loaned amount. On the flip side, if the market return is 3% you will pay the difference of 1% from the cash value of the policy). So the money you loan out to yourself during retirement ($168k per year for our example) is still growing at an average of 3%. Because you are loaning the funds rather than withdrawing the funds, the cash value should grow forever (even after accounting for the interest on the loans and policy fees).

I’ve found that most anti-IUL arguments ignore the fact that the money continues to grow after it’s been loaned out. It doesn’t matter how much you have at retirement, what matters is how long it can last. With that in mind, if your money can continue to grow after you’ve loaned it out during retirement, isn’t that incredibly valuable?

**Pre-retirement withdrawals**

IRA – Principle is available for withdrawal anytime penalty and tax free.

IUL – Entire balance is available to loan out anytime at a set interest rate (see above). Policy surrender value (typically lower than cash value) is also available for withdrawal anytime tax free.

**Balances** (IRA based on personal Excel model, IUL based on illustration provide by advisor)

*Assumptions: $11k contribution in year 1, 2% increase per year for 35 years (age 30 – 65). Withdrawing $169k per year starting at age 66. Stock market returns averaging 7% per year. 1% management fee per year on the IRA.*

Age 30

* IRA: 0
* IUL: 0

Age 65

* IRA: $1.63M
* IUL: $1.75M
* Difference due to the 1% fee on the IRA plan

Age 80

* IRA: -$21.7k
* IUL: $1.42M
* IRA runs out of money at age 79

Age 100

* IRA: -$6.28M
* IUL: $2.85M
* Look at how much the IUL leaves to my children

personalfinance,Advice disputing credit card charge for customs/storage fees incurred for shipping a package from the U.S. to Thailand,"American in Thailand here, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this post.

Last month my mom graciously shipped over a package using Fedex with my laptop, a camping lantern, and 4 bottles of herb supplements that she wanted me to have. She declared everything as Fedex had instructed her to, and I was expecting to receive my package September 14th.

The package never made it to me, and it had been held up by 'clearance delay' when I checked the shipping status. Reading around on some forums, I thought that it could be cleared shortly and I'd have my laptop. On September 28th after still not receiving it, I began emailing Fedex here in Thailand and I received a response stating that the camping lantern and supplements needed to be cleared by two different import departments here in Thailand. They had not notified me or called me prior to that to let me know.

Through the advice of my aunt here in Thailand, she said that we could take care of it ourselves and that we didn't need to use Fedex as a broker. I emailed Fedex on September 30th stating this, and I received a vague email back with possible storage fees for using a non-Fedex broker. I then went to the Fedex department at the airport to pick up any necessary documents. After arriving there and going through what felt like an absolute nightmare of Thai bureaucracy, we met with the broker and agreed to let him handle it for us.

Fast forward to today, October 14th, and I receive an email with all the fees. They are charging a total of $540 for me to clear the package out of customs, with the biggest fee being around $450 for ""storage fees.""

After getting nowhere on the phone with anyone at Fedex, I decided to pay the charge as I felt they were helding my package ransom at this point and I had zero leverage. They say that I had agreed to the non-Fedex broker fees, even though I still used a Fedex broker, and that there wouldn't be any charges if I had never sent that email. I had never acknowledged the fees, and the email did not say that they would be charging $13/day (BACKDATED to September 14th, the day my package arrived). To be completely honest, the email with the fees looked as if all of the fees were already total amounts. It was not clear at all that it would be $13/day. My real argument though is that I DID use a Fedex broker, and shouldn't be charged as if I didn't, although there is an email requesting that I handle it myself.

I feel as if I've been wronged and want to dispute this with Chase immediately but wanted to seek advice/validation (or invalidation if you believe Fedex is correct) on what the best possible way would be to approach the dispute with Chase. I only paid because if I didn't pay, the charges would continue to go up and I still wouldn't have any guarantee of ever getting my package..

Thanks again for any advice you can provide.",finance

Our gross income is about 65K in a large city and our rent is 1700. We have enough to put down 20% on a condo, and I am unwilling to go lower even though as first time home buyers with excellent credit it is an option. We would be left with about 8k in savings. I keep hearing from both civilians, realtors, bankers, and lenders alike that now is the time to get a mortgage, but is 8k enough for us to be secure if we buy? We are in our mid-30's so not young, but are uninterested in moving to the suburbs or somewhere with a LCoL as it would significantly reduce our quality of life. If saving more means we don't buy that is fine, but I guess my question is how soon are interests rates predicted to go up and do we have time to furnish a substantial emergency fund before we buy or should we be jumping at our options now, especially because properties in our area are lower than they should be due to covid and defaults? Our debts are negligible and our mortgage payment would be lower than our rent as long as we continue as we are with no significant changes. Our jobs are in healthcare and not in jeopardy. However, having the large nest egg that we do makes me feel secure. 8k would keep us going for about 4 months (were we to have our approximated mortgage, obviously less so with our current rent).",finance

personalfinance,Should I Cancel My Vehicle Extended Warranty?,"Hi everyone,

I purchased a used 2018 Toyota Camry last weekend.  I went in to the dealer swearing that I would not let them sucker me into an extended warranty, and by golly, they did it again!

The finance manager confused me by saying if I took the warranty, my car could get financed at 7% instead of 14%.  He made it sound like I would be getting the warranty for free and it would be foolish not to do it on a car model that has so many components that could break.  Yet, my monthly payment jumped $285 to $305.   I ran the number when I got home and it appears that they did sucker me into a rotten deal.  I originally financed the car at $14K.  Now it was showing $17K with a total balance of $22K. .

$22K for a two year old Camry with 80,000 miles, ugh.  Here's what I think he did.  He rolled the cost of the warranty into car loan principle balance raising it to $17K.  So even though I'm getting a better interest rate, I'm still paying $22K, the same amount in interest.   It would be a wash if I intend to pay out the loan in full.  But I want to get out of this crappy loan.  I have enough money to make a $1000 car payment a month so I'm hoping the lender will let me pay this off early and I don't end up paying 22K in total.  Or try to refinance in a year.

I guess my question is can you pay off car loans early or do they expect you to pay the entire interest amount?

The warranty added 3K to my total balance.  It would cover me for 45,000 miles.  Should I cancel if I can pay off the loan early?  If I keep the warranty then I'm already paying for 3K in repairs regardless if something happens or not.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Question on Mortgage,"I applied to refinance my mortgage and just had the Senior Banker reach out to me with new terms, and told her I needed time to think about it. I felt like she was pressuring me into saying yes to continue but held my ground with to call me back later today. I believe the new terms are worse than what I currently have with just looking at interest paid overall, and I am hoping someone could shed some light on if I am missing something.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Loan Balance: $ 89,847.59

Current Term in Month remaining: 304

Current Interest rate: 4.125%

Current: Total Principal Paid (just off remaining Balance to compare apples to apples) $89,847.59

Current: Total Interest Paid $55,117.69

Current Mortgage Payment: $975

&amp;#x200B;

New Loan Balance: $89,847.59

New Term in Months: 360

New Interest Rate: 3.625%

New Principle Paid:  $89,847.59

New Interest Paid: $ 57,662.81

New Mortgage Payment: $ 898

Edit Closing cost:  Closing costs are $3437, but giving me $2300 in credits so I need to bring $1137 to close

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing that stands out to me is yes my total monthly payment will be lower, and I will save $924 a year, however the interest paid is $2500 more for the life of the loan.

The main goal I had for doing this was to lower my monthly payment so I can pay more money towards my student loans, so this would give me an extra $77 per month. I would think that this would really be a great deal if I could get the interest rate under 3%, but my credit score ranges from 680-710 depending on which credit union they use.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I would like to eventually sell my house in 2-3 years and  cash out on the equity that gained as the market is really great but I don't want to sell anything during a pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any input you may have.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

I sent an email to the rep and told her the interest rate was too high, and she was magically able to bring it down to 2.99%, however the amount of closing would be around $1600 even though the estimate calculates out to around $1900. I told her the out of pocket would take about 18 months to recoup the cost just off the payment difference. Now with me wanting to sell the house in 2-3 years doesn't seem worth it. She then was like well you get get a higher interest rate to recoup the closing costs back. Then at this point I just told her I was done, and financial it doesn't make sense. I wasn't going to continue to play these numbers games with her.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on saving towards first home purchase at 26,"I have just started working for a year after graduate school. I am thinking about saving towards a small property for myself and renting the spare bedroom out to make the mortgage more affordable. Is investing in a property a good idea at my age?

I am in a relatively LCOL area and my income is 120k (single, 26 years old). While I am not certain that I will stay in the area for more than 4 years, I believe the city has lots of rental potential with two universities around and new companies moving in.

My first year, I had a full ride scholarship and everything looked great for my future. However, this past summer, my parents were always too busy to sit down and do the financial aid paperwork that my college requested. Because of that, the paperwork didn't get done until just a couple weeks ago, losing all of my financial aid in the process. In addition, I can't get the federal student loans through my school because that paperwork wasn't quite done. 

Now I'm looking for a private loan, and my credit score (\~600) is not good enough for any place to give me a loan on my own, which means I need a co-signer. My parents both have terrible credit, so they cannot get approved as co-signers. I've asked any other eligible friend I have to co-sign the loan, but they also declined, exhausting my last option 2 days ago. As class registration for next semester draws nearer, I get more and more worried that I won't have this loan on time and I'll have to drop college. What should I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how did you manage?

personalfinance,Should I rent out or sell my house?,"Hi all,

Due to COVID I was recently laid off from my position in Asheville, NC in June and just received an offer for a new position in LA.  I'm crunching some numbers and trying to decide if I should rent out my house for the equity or sell it. I'm fairly young (27) and Asheville has had great real estate appreciation over the past 10 years.

I bought the house in January for $285k with a 3.875% interest rate on a $270,750 loan and still owe \~$267.5k of that.  With the market currently I can also re-finance for a lower interest rate and put some more down to remove the PMI that I am paying in my mortgage.

The part I'm worried about is the amount I'm being told it will rent for.  I've talked to some property managers and they are estimating it will rent for $1700-1800 in the area but my current mortgage is \~$1500 and the 10% cost of a property manager will not leave me with much wiggle room.  What is a typical safety net when renting out a house for maintenance and everything else?

It is a 2018 build with new appliances and washer/dryer so I am expecting low maintenance costs, but it will still be a while till I can get the PMI off to get a lower monthly mortgage payment.

I've also reached out to my real estate agent and found that with the current market I could sell for $315-320k.  With closing costs, real estate fees, and the rest this should give me about $8-10k from the original purchase which would offset the original closing costs basically breaking even.

Should I sell and not deal with it from across the country or rent it out with the high appreciation market of Asheville and equity gain in the long run? Also I will be renting in LA if that helps

vet,Mama cat favours one kitten,"Hi! 
As the title says... Last night our cat gave birth to four beautiful kittens, without any severe incidents. However, during the day she has started to pick one of the kittens and carry him away from the others. She place him on the bed, feed him and clean him while the rest is left in their box. If I go get the other kittens and bring them to her, it's no problem and they get fed and cleaned as well. If I put the kitten she moved back with the others, she just go and lift him again and gets real stressed. When the others scream for her, she can get up and start to move towards them, but as soon as kitty 1 screams she turn back and lie down in bed with kitty 1. 

This is the first time I have kittens as a grown up (we had two litters when I was younger than 12) and I'm a bit unsure about what to do. Everyone says that they take care of it by themselves and to just let them be, but is this really normal behaviour for a mama cat? When should I start to worry?",cryptocurrency

I am a current postbac at the NIH being paid a stipend. Technically I am a trainee not an employee, due to this I have to file federal and state income tax myself reported on a Form 1099G, however no FICA taxes are deducted.

I am trying to get into investing and finance stuff and was wanting to start contribute a small portion of my stipend into a Roth IRA while I am here but I read somewhere that I possibly can't contribute to a Roth IRA if I am not paying social security/Medicare/Medicaid.

A second question, if I AM able to contribute is where is the best place for me to do that? I have seen  that Schwab and Fidelity and Vanguard are the most recommended by people on here. But for someone young who does not understand any technical terms, would only be able to contribute 100-200 a month MAX, and wants to make the most money on it over time (I don't plan to pull it early, its only for retirement), which of these is probably the best option for me personally?",finance
personalfinance,"In debt, need guidance on best action to take (long post with details provided)","Hello fellow Redditors, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons and is being written on mobile currently.

I come to you today because due to neglecting budgeting and being irresponsible with some financial choices that were made during wedding/honeymoon/personal life I really messed up. Now going forward all credit cards have been locked away and no new purchases made in months. My wife and I learned our lesson but unfortunately it was a lesson learned late.
I’m working hard to pay back debts but need guidance on what to do next as I’ve come into a pickle. We have started budgeting and have been working diligently on paying down debt and changing our lifestyle for the better, but now we have to somehow pay off this debt. Mind you this is my debt alone and we manage our finances separately I am working on this using my income only to pay this back.

A breakdown of bills along with utterly cringe worthy interest rates is listed below for evaluation

Age:33


Credit cards:
Citi Bank - $1,780 - min payment $27, 22% interest rate

Barclay - $8,715 - min payment $227, 19% interest rate
Chase - $9,736 - min payment $285, 24% interest

Capital one - $482 - min payment $25, 23% interest rate

Misc Card - $1,888 - min payment $67, 30% interest rate

Other bills:
Phone - $50

Car - $362 - $6,500 left, 1.9% interest rate 

Car insurance $130

Rent $500

Weekly income average - $450

Savings account: $620 emergency fund

401k - $8,000 (possible to take $4,000) loan if needed.

Now if you do the math my spending is about $1673 a month. YIKES!!!
I bring home on average $1820 a month. (Even scarier when you realize this is before food/gas) luckily my wife is assisting with these to help me, also she has her own debt she is paying down as well which is why I’m doing this solo so let’s leave her income out.

Here is the pickle..at this rate paying down debt will take forever. Yes I know I need to either increase income or sell things. However biggest issue arises again which is in currently a student as well, I graduate in Spring with my associates in business. My only way of making extra money while being in college right now is doing things like Waitr, I typically do about $20 a day (just started last month) to try and help pay down these debts. After $20 I go home to study for exams, quizzes and classes.
this would give me about $140 a week (before taxes) if I only make $140 each week. I never thought I would ask this but should I take the 401k loan of $4,000 to pay down debt? Or even go as far as depleting the retirement account which I never wanted to do. The reason I ask is I’m only getting a rate of return at 4% right now and those interest rates are killing me. If I did do this the plan would be once all debts are paid off to increase my contribution rate to 15% or higher to try and make up for lost time. 

Once certain debts are paid off I do plan on rolling that extra income into the next debt. Example: pay off Chase and roll that $285 in savings into another card to pay down quicker.

If anyone had any advice on what they would do moving forward please let me know. I am increasing my income by working side jobs and trying to sell anything I can find to dig myself out of this hole. Sorry for the long post but thank you for your wisdom. I understand I made a mistake and debt got the best of me, I’m working to right that wrong and get my life back on track to never let this happen again. But if you still want to be harsh on me that’s fine.",finance
stocks,Tesla Options Q for the Seasoned Ones,"Hi guys,

Posted this on Stocktwits too but curious for the Reddit take.

I bought 5 Tesla calls a few weeks back - close to the money when it was at $458 SP. The calls are for $460 strike with a Jan expiry. The IV was high at the time and Tesla went all the way down to $400. It’s now roared back to $462 so I’m in the money now, but the calls have only gained back 70% or so from the premium. I know theta decay and IV is real but my question is whether the premium will continue to run if it goes higher or if it will be snuffed by theta? I thought I’d be closer to B/E at this point but the options are collectively down 15k still. 

I’m long on Tesla and will keep one contract to exercise but the other 4 I need some advice on. Do I just let it ride and hopefully the SP goes up significantly closer to expiration?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 14, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 14, 2020**

Stocks accelerated yesterday’s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.

The Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&amp;P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.

Today, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be “difficult” before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi’s spokesperson called “productive”. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. 

The impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said “When the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.” The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting “Go big or go home!!!” for more stimulus. 

In other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday’s session.

In terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that “JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans — $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.”

vet,(Cat Sneezing /Coughing) what are signs that my cat needs to see a vet?,"My cat last saw a vet last week and appeared normal (normal temperature, no signs of wheezing, etc) but was diagnosed with feline asthma following an x-ray. She was given a shot of slow-release steroids. 

For the past few days, my cat has been sneezing throughout the day, her nose appears stuffed/congested and sometimes small coughs.  I think she was exposed to something scented which appears to be a trigger for her. She otherwise acts normal except maybe not quite as playful/sleeping (in public) more. What are some signs to take her to the vet?

I have already taken her to the vet for mild occasional coughing 4 times this year (2 in the last month or two)- I am happy to get her professional care but am tired of frequently having appointments with different providers and feeling like this is going nowhere esp since I don’t have pet insurance and I think the curbside appointment thing makes a little trickier to converse with the vets. If anyone has any tips on more effective vet trips, let me know.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinance my mortgage or pay down credit cards?,"I'm in the first year of a 30-year FHA mortgage with a balance of ~180K at 4%. Apparently I can do a streamlined refi. I was told I could get a rate as low as 2.25%, but I'm skeptical. I would like to get it at least down to 3%. The problem is I have a secondary mortgage of ~5K. As long as that is open, we can't refi. 

I will be getting a bonus at the beginning of the year that should easily cover the second mortgage. However, I had planned on that going to pay down credit cards where we're currently sitting about 15K.

My instinct is to pay down the credit cards. But the math seems to suggest otherwise.

1% of 180K is $1,800/year of savings. Plus the $200 of interest on the second mortgage.

22% of 5K, even compounding daily would only be 1,200-1,300. And then I can put next year's bonus to it. 

There's also the time factor. Rates may rise enough by January to make this a moot point. But they definitely could rise by next year if I waited until then to be able to refi.

I also like to try the reverse test. Would I raise my mortgage rate by 1% to transfer 5K of credit card debt to a second mortgage at 4%? I'm pretty sure I would pass on that.

Even typing this out has pushed me more towards the refi. But my gut still says credit cards. Am I just scared of the big interest rate? Or am I wrong that 1% of 180 outweighs 25% of 5?",finance

personalfinance,Skype charge back to Paypal and it's closed Can I get a paper check?,"Hi. So for years I kept getting charged for a personal number by Skype/Microsoft. Last year I got tired of it but realized I didn't cancel so as soon as the I got the email from Paypal of the charge I cancelled the number so I wouldn't get charged this year. This year comes and I get emails saying ""we are going to charge you on..."". I ignored the emails since I know I cancelled this last year. So I get charged $30. UGH. So I dispute the charge, it was reversed but then after an ""investigation"" put back on a few days later. I'm upset now so I closed my Paypal and took everything off my Paypal. I closed it down. About a month ago I put in a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (ftc.gov) about this situation against Skype for doing this autocharge after I cancelled the number. Last week I get an e-mail from Skype saying they are going to do a charge back and cancel my number. So now that I don't have a Paypal to charge back to, will I get a check or is there something else to do from my standpoint to get the refund.

I just waiting to see if I get another mail from Skype saying they couldn't charge back. But I don't know if I will ever get an e-mail since these companies don't really have people working there. Neither Paypal or Skype have any real support. I haven't been able to talk to anyone, hence the FTC complaint process.",finance

personalfinance,Financial advice on job options and cost of living comparisons,"Obligatory: not sure if this is the right sub.

I've been working from home for the past 7 months, only going in as needed, maybe 1x every 1-2 weeks. My husband lost his job ($45k/year) so we're on one income (mine, $122k/year). Combined thats $167k/year pre tax in the Chicago area (not suburbs,  Chicago, because that's the split distance between his former work place and mine). However, my husband has a very similar skill set as mine, and we think his next job should be in the $90-$110k/year range (switching from academia to industry), which would enable us to feel comfortable buying a house and starting a family (in Chicago at least!)

So, if things go well, we would hopefully have something like combined $220k/year in Chicago, which sounds astounding, but we typically take home a little less than half after taxes, retirement, Healthcare, etc. Still plenty.

He has a very promising lead for a job in San Jose (literally used to work with the hiring manager and she seems to be fast tracking his application). I'm not ready to leave my job until June, but hoping to finangle things so that I could work remotely for the remainder of my project, then switch functions/transfer to my companies location in the same area (southern bay area).

Does anyone have advice on 

1) how much we'd need to make to have a comparable salary in the southern bay area compared to A) 167k and B) 220k in Chicago. 

2) advice on how to convince my boss that it's better to keep me remote instead of lose me (we're already short staffed and my project is in critical time, plus, although its not public knowledge, my counter part will go on Maternity leave in 6M, so not a great time for project turnover)

3) any salary negotiating tactics to ensure we're at least breaking even with cost of living, or is it a smart move to offer to work remotely at the Chicago salary, essentially losing any cost of living increase from the new location (which isn't their fault anyway)

4) or do I just screw them over and start looking for a new job in the same location as my husband, at a different company? I'd be giving up about $20k in unvested RSUs if I went that route, and access to a pension plan in 1 year (that starts at 1.1% x final salary x #years worked, but essentially would be a guaranteed $6k/year from 65+ if i quit at 5 years, and could grow to an automatic $98k/year assuming 30 years and a salary growth of 3%/year - which i figure takes into account our merit increases of about 2.3-2.5% plus a few promotions)

5) with the job market as it currently is, and him trying to switch from academia to industry, how much is something ""in the bag"" worth over holding out for another position locally? (""In the bag"" right now feels like a 50-50 chance, but I need to be ready to have these conversations with my management)

Any advice is helpful. I'd love to get out to CA but I've heard over and over that no one can afford to live there...",finance
personalfinance,"If you are having problems with your payments showing up, act on it quickly","This was for another post, but now comments are locked.  I thought I'd still share.  


I bought a house in late 2009, just when the bubble was supposedly over (it wasn't and my house has been upside down since partially due to the rest of this story).  CitiMortgage was the lender and immediately I was getting notices that my payment wasn't recieved although I paid them properly and early.  Fast forward about 6 months and I even talked to the President's secretary that they are handling it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then they sold my loan to NationStar and the true pain happened.  NationStar almost immediately started a foreclosure action.  I went through having to call and pay over phone all the way to having to do Western Unions with cash.  They were sending people to my house with foreclosure paperwork and worse, one of the fuckers would just drive up the front yard to my door to make sure I was still living there.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told early on to just stop paying and then they'd figure it out.  I didn't.  When I finally paid about $125k on a $255k note I gave up and agreed with an attorney and stopped paying (after paying him $10k+).  

&amp;#x200B;

The case took 4 years, meanwhile my school loans I had on two fixed rate 5 and 6 percent cards ended up at a default rate along with all my previously excellent credit cards.  My school portion was about $80k.  The new interest rate was 26.99 percent along with another $10-15k I had mostly due to some medical and then furniture for the house I had bought.  I was paying my cards way more than the minimum payments and now that amount didn't even cover the interest.  I made the stupid mistake of thinking paying my debts was the right thing to do in this even after talking to all my creditors and explaining that I had always paid them properly and this was an error with my mortgage company.  I should have filed bankruptcy, instead I liquidated savings and more.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the case, it was deemed a 'clerical' error and they agreed they got all their money finally but then the bank wasn't held responsible for any of the damage it caused me nor the added thousands of dollars of interest nor my attorney's fees.  They agreed to rewrite the loan, forgive any penalties, but at about 1% above the real rates out there and insisted only to a 40 year term.  Also they were allowed to take to 4 years of missed payments and add them as a balloon to the loan.  After paying half the loan off I was now at 50% more than I started with ($365k total owned on a house now 11 years later worth about $300k).",finance

investing,Consumers’ Labor Market and Spending Expectations Improve,"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce

NEW YORK—The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the September 2020 Survey of Consumer Expectations, which shows improvements in labor market and spending expectations, as well as less pessimistic views about households’ expected financial situation. Home price growth expectations returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels, and debt delinquency expectations remained low. In contrast, year-ahead household income expectations remain weak compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Median inflation expectations remained unchanged at the short-term horizon, while it declined at the medium-term horizon. Uncertainty and disagreement about future inflation remain elevated.
 
The main findings from the September 2020 Survey are:
 
**Inflation**


-	Median inflation expectations in September remained unchanged at 3.0% at the one-year horizon and decreased 0.3 percentage point returning to its July level of 2.7% at the three-year horizon. The decline was driven by respondents above the age of 40 and those with at least some college education. Our measure of disagreement across respondents (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of inflation expectations) remains substantially above its pre-COVID-19 levels at both horizons.


-	Median inflation uncertainty—or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes—increased for the third consecutive month at the three-year horizon, while it retreated to its July 2020 level at the one-year horizon. Both series remain elevated relative to their pre-COVID-19 readings.


-	Median home price change expectations continued on its upward trend after reaching a series’ low of 0% in April 2020, and increasing from 2.8% in August to 3.1% in September, just above its 2019 average of 3.0%. The increase was broad-based across demographic groups and was strongest for respondents who live in the South Census region.


-	The median one-year ahead expected change in the cost of a college education remained essentially unchanged, while median expectations for the price of gasoline and for food prices both declined by 0.8 and 0.3 percentage points to 4.8% and 5.1%, respectively. Median expectations for the cost of rent and medical care also decreased from 5.5% and 8.3% to 5.4% and 6.8% in September, respectively.
          
**Labor Market**

-	Median one-year ahead expected earnings growth remained unchanged at 2.0% in September, for the second consecutive month. The series is below its 2019 average level of 2.4%.


-	Mean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—decreased from 39.1% in August, to 36.4% in September, below its 2019 average of 36.9%. The decline was driven by respondents below the age of 60.


-	The mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next 12 months retreated from 18.0% in August to 16.6% in September, remaining well above its pre-COVID-19 reading of 13.8% in February. This month’s decline was more pronounced among respondents above age 60 and those with a household income below $50,000. The mean probability of leaving one’s job voluntarily in the next 12 months increased 0.6 percentage point to 20.3% in September. The increase was broad-based across demographic groups.

-	The mean perceived probability of finding a job (if one’s current job was lost) declined from 50.7% in August to 49.9% in September. The series remains well below its 2019 average of 59.9%.
 
**Household Finance**


-	Median expected household income growth increased by 0.1 percentage point to 2.3% in September, remaining well below its 2019 average of 2.8%. The increase was driven mostly by respondents below the age of 40 and those with at least some college education.


-	Median household spending growth expectations increased from 3.0% in August to 3.4% in September, its highest reading since May 2019.

-	Perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago and expectations for year-ahead credit availability both improved somewhat in September, with fewer respondents reporting or expecting difficulties in obtaining credit.

-	The average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased from 9.7% in August to 10.7% in September. This reading remains below its 2019 average of 11.5%.

-	The median expectation regarding a year-ahead change in taxes (at current income level) rebounded from 2.7% in August to 3.0% in September.

-	The mean perceived probability that the average interest rate on saving accounts will be higher 12 months from now slightly declined to 27.6% in September, from 28.0% in August.

-	Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago deteriorated slightly, with slightly more respondents reporting being worse off. In contrast, one-year ahead expectations about households’ financial situations improved with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve and fewer respondents expecting their financial situation to worsen.

-	The mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from now decreased 0.8 percentage points to 44.1% in September.
 
About the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)

The SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy. 
 
The SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, our panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same individuals over time.",finance
personalfinance,Considering buying a new Honda subcompact,"I am loathe to buy new because of the conventional wisdom but in the process of investigating a new car purchase I found it may be a better plan in this situation. I am a 27 year old PhD student graduating in 1.5 years or so, married to a spouse that just got their BA and is looking for a job. We are both in the physical sciences. I make about 34k in stipend and fellowships per year and we took out 18k per year in unsubsidized federal student aid per year to help pay her tuition and our expenses. We have about 100k in student loans between us.  
My spouse totaled our old car in an accident (not hard to do as the car had 150k on it) and I got burned on a used 2k beater that had transmission issues that showed up after I got it. I wanted something to last 2 years until I graduate and then to buy something decent. We have enough funding to manage a payment and some family has generously offered to help us with a significant chunk of the purchase.  
After all this I wanted a very reliable practical car. I like the Honda fit with its good gas mileage, excellent reliability, and good cargo space utilization/versatility. It is also quite affordable. I was looking for used Fits but the depreciation is so slow compared to what I am used to they weren't much cheaper. Additionally we qualify for $1000 of manufacturer rebates and there is a 1.9% APR deal right now which would save us $500-1000 over choosing a used car with 3-5% APR. I found that unless we buy a car with over 70k miles, older than 4-5 years old, or both there is not a big savings to buying new. Insurance is only a bit cheaper on the used cars too.

I am planning on keeping the car for minimum 150k miles, but more likely 200k. As much as it pains me it seems like a better deal to spend $19.5k total (including fees and interest) for a brand new car that pay 14k for a 2015 with 60k or 17.5k for a 2017 with 45k. We are in the salt belt so there is definitely a cost to an older model year that there isn't in Arizona. We can afford this and I am having trouble seeing a significant cost savings of buying used in this instance. We have help and even if we didn't we can afford the payments. Can you either talk me out of this dumb decision or convince me that it might not be as stupid as my inner cheapskate is telling me?",finance

personalfinance,"Help Needed With First Homebuying In Hot Market, Early Career Physician","Thanks for checking out this post. In sum, I am looking for advice about this proposed budget, and if I am potentially missing something/making a big mistake. 

I am a relatively young attending physician looking to buy my first home in Nashville, TN. The market here has been super hot for the past few years, and is showing no signs of slowing down with new Amazon employees to come in, and the state 0% income tax - it has drawn high and moderate income earners from places like CA and NY in crazy numbers the past year. As with the rest of the country, prices are at an all-time high, though unlike the rest of the country I don't necessarily see a slump in prices on the horizon even post-COVID. 

I am lookin for a home with the following qualities: 

3000+ sqft, single family home, small (but some) yard, 2 car garage, nice kitchen, in our neighborhood or close (short-ish commute), modern aesthetic

In our neighborhood, a new construction with these features starts around high $900ks and goes up from there. There is a relatively large gap at this price point, as well, that the next ""tier"" of home is around $1.25M and above. 

Financial details: 

Net earnings: $450k (household combined more like $500-510k when my wife is added); Maxed out 403b, IRA contributions, total takehome/month ends up around $28,000 after taxes. Debt: Currently loans in forbearance due to COVID, but normally pursuing PSLF d/t high loan burden. Estimated monthly loan payment is $2700/mo; car payment and insurance is $700. Monthly discover bill around $2100 averaged over the year. I got married this year and we spent around $40k on the wedding all total, and with all this I managed to save around $215k. 

House I want to buy: 

$1.25M is asking price. Probably cannot offer less. New construction - may need upfront cost for some finishings (eg blinds etc). Pre-approved for loan with only 3% down at 2.75%, was planning on more like 10-15% to get monthly payments down and potentially interest rate could be better (have seen more like 2.5% for others in my situation). But going with a smaller down payment just to make the month-to-month situation as bad as it could be, $125k down would have me paying $6092/mo between mortgage, insurance, taxes and potential PMI.

And all said, I would have around $14k left per month. I have been putting $10k/mo into a taxable account, and while this could potentially continue, it might need to be pulled back from time to time for expenses such as vacation, furniture etc etc. 

Does this sound reasonable? Thanks for reading this massively long post!",finance

The house will be built by Jan. I had few questions and would love if you could help me out, This is the first time I am buying an house

The house we selected costs around 340k. The Builder said i need to get pre-approved from one of their Lenders so they can proceed, but do not have to stick with the lender's. but if i decide to stick with the lender i could get 4k (2k from lender's and 2k from builder). 

So i went ahead and one of their lender did a pre-qual and Now out of the 5 preferred lender i got one lender who quoted me this -

Closing cost of \~11k and down payment of 17125 (- 3k earnest money) . With 2.5 % interest and 2.675% APR. Since i have to get pre-approved from their lender i submitted all the documents to him and they said they will get an approval from underwriter.

Is the offer good?? he also said we might have to re-look it as he cant lock the interest rate yet.

Now i wanted to check can i still shop outside ? if so any suggestions (My hard credit was pulled this week)

The lender kind of hurried me into doing this saying they i might loose the 4k offered. which i dont care. So should i be doing something different.

I live in a house with my parents (retired) and I currently pay the bill for electricity and other utilities. The home that we live in only has my parents’s name on the deed. Since they are retired with no income. if we were to install a PV set up with a battery storage, they don’t have any tax liability to claim the federal tax credit. I plan to pay for the PV set up anyway, is there anyway I can qualify for the FTC? I do plan to place the order with Tesla under my name (if they allow). This is also my primary residence as well. Unfortunately, there’s no way for them to put my name on the deed right now. Sorry for data dumping but any one have any advice on how we can still take advantage of the FTC given my situation?

cardano,Myth of Money: The Future of Blockchain in Africa with Charles Hoskinson,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eSEPrJ-1A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eSEPrJ-1A)

Good chat, I learned something new... DeFi portfolio to be announced at the Goguen summit!

Charles on DeFi and stablecoins and Prism:

We're going to build some reference DeFi. We've been exploring stablecoins, DEXs and oracles and these things. We have great partners: from CBDC-style partners to big companies that are big data providers and so we have a lot of unique advantages and what's really cool about Cardano's holism is that we think we have a significantly better smart contract model that is far more scalable as predictable costs and it's easier to ensure correctness. 

When you implement these things and combined with the governance features I think that's really the the magic to two-punch setup. One is all about performance and life cycle and cost and maintenance and these things. The other is about well how do we actually have the system be self-sustaining. You need kind of both for that to work well and so we're going to announce a DeFi portfolio at the Goguen summit when we do that. 

We'll announce that soon and we'll announce a whole DeFi portfolio there but we definitely want to be in that space and we think we can add something unique and new and competitive to that space above and beyond what we've seen in the Ethereum world. You know it's early days with DeFi and oftentimes it's not the innovators who win it's the imitators. You kind of have the innovators, imitators and idiots. You never know where you're at that spectrum, everybody thinks you're an innovator. 

The innovators unfortunately get covered with scars and make a lot of strategic mistakes and the imitators who study those can actually come and be much more agile and out-compete the system. Facebook and Myspace were great examples of that. Yahoo and Google were great examples of that. I think we stand a really good shot in 2021 of being able to build a nice DeFi portfolio and you know you also have to think about infrastructure that DeFi requires so you need to make sure you have good random number generations, good oracle solutions... 

You have to make sure that you have a good class of people that can do bespoke things or add some centralization when centralization is required. What's really nice about our stake pool model is: we have 1200 stake pools who are basically blockchain-service providers. Their job right now is to secure Cardano and that's what they do but it's very easy for them to run layer 2 protocols, it's very easy for them to run bespoke things and create APIs that applications on Cardano can access so your DeFi can start talking to this dedicated-service class which is quite large, well reputable and efficient. You kind of get the best of both worlds, you get decentralization. We definitely have plans there but unfortunately I can't say anything but they're fun and magical and exciting. 

We are definitely going to do a stablecoin. It's just when you say stablecoin there's actually many different types of stablecoins. You have things like asset-backed stablecoins where tether is an example of that, where someone buys USD and they store in a bank account and then for every USD you mint a tether. You have commodity-backed stablecoins like goldcoins or these things... You have metastable coins where you take a basket of stablecoins and you create a synthetic asset that's backed by that basket and then you have algorithmic stablecoins like the Maker DAOs, where some sort of mechanic keeps the coins stable and then you have central bank issue digital currencies which is a really sexy hot topic, like the Marshall islands for example. There's a whole spectrum there and actually we have teams who look at each of these. In Africa in particular a lot of governments have come to us and said hey we want to do commodity-backed stable coins.  

We're excited about that and when we talk about sovereign counter partners, there I think, the best thing to do is couple stable coins with universal basic income (UBI). Basically during the operation of the stablecoin there are transaction fees and you let those fees accumulate in a sovereign wealth account and then what you do is you periodically give dividends to all the people of the country for that. This is super attractive when you have a smaller jurisdiction let's say a Mauritius or something like that and they have a lot of problems and it allows them to basically get a lot of direct foreign investment and then they can do a direct distribution to their people. 

We are exploring those and there's been a lot of excitement on the monetary policy side for these governments. The big challenge is also the regulatory layer on top of stablecoins. Tere needs to be the ability to freeze them, reverse transactions in the compliance layer. Cardano has a unique advantage here in that we have a product called Prism and it's our identity management stack. It's blockchain agnostic but it's tightly integrated with Cardano. It's a layer 2 identity stack based on DIDs and what this is going to enable people to do is have things like authenticated addresses where you could associate an address or an asset with a DID. DID is a decentralized identifier then you can do KYC and AML on that DID and then suddenly you can create a transitive graph of ownership and verify that all the people touching it have the right to do that. Who signs that DID is completely neutral. You could have a government sign it, regulatory bodies sign it, you can have a private entity like Pwc sign it or something like that.  

We're already exploring using Prism with exchanges for the travel rule where they can create authenticated accounts and basically you register a DID at the time of account creation and then when you go to withdraw you have to have an authenticated address to withdraw. What's so cool about is, you actually get more security as a consumer by this way because if someone compromises your account they can't create an authenticated address because they don't have your DID so you actually give the consumer something and you give the regulator something at the same time. It's really nice for privacy coins and you can do all kinds of anonymization and privatization of it. You can encrypt it and put them in the metadata and the decryption keys are only possessed by certain escrow parties and things like that or you do threshold proofs. 

We're building that in with a big zero knowledge campaign for Prism and basically those allow you to prove facts about somebody but not reveal things about them. For example, if you go to America and you want to drink they'll card you and when you show them your driver's license or your passport they don't just get your age. They get your name and all this other stuff about you. They'll know if you're an organ donor. You don't want to reveal all that to the waiter or waitress. If you have threshold proof you can prove that you're an American citizen or prove that you're over 21 or these types of things so stablecoins really need something like this. They need a built-in identity system to embed into transactions or addresses so you can actually manage with the AML/KYC regime of the country or private entity but at the same time preserve privacy. This can all be put in with smart contracts and layer 2 solutions so it doesn't have to be protocol level meaning that the protocol itself doesn't need a governance system to reverse transactions or these other things though it can be managed as a value added and then different jurisdictions will have different regulatory regimes. 

So, yes we will do a stablecoin and we have been thinking about it a lot and trying to holistically go through the whole thing.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Do I have a chance at debt settlement negotiation myself?,"Basically, I want to know if I have a chance at talking to my creditors / credit card companies to negotiate debt settlement instead of going through a debt settlement company like NDR (National Debt Relief).

*Please let me know if there's more relevant info I can provide for a better picture of the situation.


I actually signed agreement forms with NDR a few days ago, but after doing more research...It seems like it'd be better to just talk to the creditors myself, as I could avoid the fees they'd charge for the service?
 
NDR offered to half the debt, and 25% of the original total debt is added as legal fees.  So the debt is reduced to about 75% of the original amount. 

Story:
**TL;DR fell for $22k USD scam 3 years ago, company got sued by FTC, trial was set for July of this year but is still pending due to pandemic. I have documentation and correspondence that lines up with the case details published by the FTC.**


3 years ago I foolishly fell for a scam.  I had one credit card, and a 831 score.  I wanted to get into this 'work from home business opportunity' and I needed to come up with $22k USD. I opened 3 credit cards on the same day, and basically maxed them out. 

After I realized it was a scam, the interest had started piling up and all my money is going to minimum payments. Even after paying the minimum each month, the interest racks it right back up near max, and sometimes i end up doing cash withdrawal with the freed up credit on those cards to prevent my bank account from staying negative. I've paid off over $20k USD on the cards at this point, but they're all still maxed out.

The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) sued the company, had a final trial set for July of this year, potentially providing relief, but it's been delayed until further notice due to the whole pandemic situation. 

I've cut nearly all useless expenses but at times I have to choose food or bills. I don't buy shit for myself.  Been eating 22 cent ramen once a day for over a year up until a month ago. At one point I worked 70 hours a week for 8 months.  I'm at my wits end, I haven't had money in a savings account since this started.  The debt is $28k USD across the 4 cards right now.

I have email correspondence, and receipts for the transactions for the scam, which can be compared to the published FTC case.  

Could I realistically speak with my creditors and negotiate for debt settlement? Is there a chance? What would the process be like, what should I prepare or keep in mind?

investing,U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly increase,"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-increase-idUSKBN2701QD](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-increase-idUSKBN2701QD)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, which could heighten fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct 10, compared to 845,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week.

The weak labor market and resulting economic hardship are major hurdles to President Donald Trump’s chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s candidate, has blamed the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis for the worst economy in at least 73 years.

Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months.

With the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated. Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crashed by the pandemic leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government.

High unemployment and a resurgence in new coronavirus cases across the United States threaten the economy’s recovery from a recession, which started in February.

Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to as low as a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.",finance
stocks,"'Nightmare' U.S. stock valuations driven by 'young, dumb' investors, fund manager says","U.S. equity valuations have become a ""total nightmare"" fueled by ""young and dumb"" investors, according to Cole Smead, president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.

At present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&amp;P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).

Much of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.

""The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

He added that current valuations were an example of ""stock market failure"" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve ""can't save a stock market.""

""They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,"" Smead said.

A call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.

""In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,"" Smead added.

He suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to ""ride the index to a fault"" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.

""Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.""

Despite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.

personalfinance,Should we refinance my wife's student loans? She's a healthcare worker.,"Me (32M) and my wife (29F) [Tennessee, USA] have questions about making smart moves going forward regarding student loans. Numbers below. She is an Occupational Therapist at a hospital, and works with Covid patients almost every day. She graduated last fall. Her loan's interest rates span from 5.31% - 7.6%. All of our student loans are on Forbearance due to Covid.

I want to refinance her loans to get a better interest rate, but I am afraid that if we refinanced her loans and the federal government someday ""forgave"" (all or even some) student loans, that we'd be on the hook for the full amount. I feel like I also heard at some point that ""front-line"" healthcare workers were eligible for student loan forgiveness. I have no idea whether or not that's true.

##### Student Loan Balances:
- Her: ~$89,000 ([here's a breakdown](https://ibb.co/tsS1hPG))
- Me: ~$4,000

##### Other Debt:
- Credit Card: $900, paid off every month

##### Questions:
- Should we refinance these loans?
- If we refinanced, would that remove eligibility for student loan forgiveness in the future?
- Are ""front-line"" healthcare workers were eligible for any kind of student loan forgiveness?

personalfinance,Excess emergency fund. WWYD?,"Hi all,

This is probably a good problem to have, but our emergency fund sitting in a 0.6% savings account is getting a bit big and I am not quite sure about what is the best to do with the money. &gt;35k we can pull out and still have a comfortable emergency fund. 



General overview: 

Married couple (30) with one kid under 2 and another on the way (daycare is our biggest expense and accounted for). 

Only debt is my husband’s student loans (~85k at 6.5% which are all federal and Currently paused). This is all medical school and we have slowed down since residency is almost finished and there may be a sign on bonus to get rid of this completely in the next two years. 

We have maxed out both Roth IRAs. 

One 403b is set to be maxed. 

One 403b has terrible options (VALIC), but I am considering for the tax advantage. I do put aside enough for the company match. 



The only large expense I can see coming up is a new car - both are 10+ years old, but one seems to be on its last legs and maybe it’s time for us to finally keep up with the Jones and buy a newer car that doesn’t have the side mirror gorilla glued on. 



I am a bit anxious about the market, but the savings APR is just so sad right now. So a brokerage account? 



Take the high VALIC fees and stick it in a 403b?

529 is iffy - what if our kid doesn’t go to college?

personalfinance,Medical Bills Consolidation Plan,"So, I got pretty sick earlier this year, repeated week-long hospitalizations, labs, rehabilitation visits, the whole shebang. I'm past not only my deductible but max out of pocket.

So the bills have been trickling in, and frankly there's so many it's hard to tell if I'm being asked to pay ones my insurance should have covered. 

Luckily for me, I did take out the max HSA for the year because I hoped to get Lasik, so I have that to help me out. We're also coming up on benefits enrollment so I have the opportunity to do so again. 

This was something dangerous but not debilitating. I didn't miss much work and I'm still fully employed. I have excellent credit, so I have that going for me. The question is, how to I make use of all this in the most effective way?

My biggest hurdle is the unknown bills that keep showing up. I just had one turn up for the first time from freaking January. If they were all known, I could take out a debt consolidation loan, which usually has a better rate than a credit card, but bills (big ones!)  keep showing up so I don't know exactly how much I need. 

What I really need is a flexible line of credit with a decent interest rate that can only be used to pay medical bills, kind of like a HSA but in credit form. Something I can dump my HSA into next year, which I don't think I can for a regular credit card. I saw CareCredit and others, but they're more for elective items. These are hospital bills.",finance

personalfinance,When to consolidate student loans?,"Hey guys,

So I just graduated and I also just started a nicely paying job. I have about 100k in student loans (75k outstanding through private loans at different rates and 30k is stafford loans) both of which aren't due until December. My financial goal is to move out by January/February of next year but with the costs of housing in my area, and desire to go without a roommate, I'd need to either earn more or spend less. The problem is that all of my expenses are fixed and at a bare minimum so there isn't much wiggle room there, the only one I can manage in some effect is my student loan payments. It looks like private and federal combined, I'll be paying 1.1k per month on student loans which is STEEP. That's more than I'm allotting for monthly rent. I plan on paying off highest interest rate loans first, then consolidating when possible but I'm curious what exactly I should do prior to consolidating.

Right now I'm currently paying off a credit card balance (was 1.9k by end of month will be zero), and then saving as much as possible before I have to make payments on my loans. My credit score is on the cusp of 700 and other than my student loans and credit card I don't have any other loans or debts in my name. What measurements should I take and what goals should I set to get the best consolidation deal possible? My parents think I should get my credit score to 700 or above then talk about reconsolidating with my bank. Also, how much could I potentially save a month by consolidating if I do so with a decent deal?

personalfinance,Question regarding numbers on proposed VA IRRRL loan refinance,"Hi,

Based on someone elses post here recently, we decided to check on refinancing our 4 year old VA loan which is at 3.375%. Was a great rate in 2016 but rates are better now obviously.

I contacted the mortgage company we used originally since they were great. Got the numbers on the proposed VA IRRRL refinance today and am not sure it's the best deal for us. Interest rate would be 2.625% and save us $235/month but, from what I'm seeing, the cost to do this would be about $8,500. 

Is that normal?

She stated in her email the cost would be about $4800 and we'd be saving again after 21 months but I see other numbers and a bottom line that says ""Total closing costs: $8516.40"".

Looks like it would be $4836.40 closing costs, $2325 reserve/prepaid costs (homeowners insurance + property tax), and $1355 for FHA UFMIP/VA Funding fee.

investing,Recovery stocks are the obvious play from here.,"Hi, fairly seasoned investor here. I've done fairly well this year (up roughly 55% YTD and actively managing my portfolio daily). Honestly, I'm a bit bewildered by all the love for tech that still exists here. To me, it's pretty obvious that from here on out, the next 40-50% gains will come from the recovery stocks, not tech. 

What do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.

Why? Allow me to borrow a couple minutes of your time.

**Vaccine vaccine vaccine.** There is a widespread belief, which I agree with, that we will not have an approved vaccine available for the public to use until early next year. However, that is a dumb reason to not buy recovery stocks. The question you should be asking is: will we know that one of the many vaccines that are out there is effective and safe by the end of this year? Once we have a vaccine candidate that we know is effective and is safe, then the game is over. It does not matter if that vaccine won't be approved for a few weeks after, or won't be available for widespread use for a few months. The market looks forward. Once it becomes clear that a vaccine is ready and is coming sometime within the next 6 months, the recovery stocks will boom. 

So, when will we know? Pfizer has said that they should know by the end of October whether a vaccine is effective, and will release some data around then. If their Phase 3 data is positive, then I expect a huge rally in the recovery stocks. I expect their phase 3 data to be positive, given the positive phase 1/2 data, the cloaked positive comments in the press by Pfizer execs, and my belief in mRNA's potential.

**Ok well even if we get a vaccine approved we don't know if people will even take it, right?**. Of course they will. Sure, there will likely be only a small cohort of brave souls initially who take it, but once they take it and find it effective and low on side effects, they will tell their circle of friends/family, some of whom will then take it themselves, and then tell their circle, etc. etc. People want someone else to be one of the first to take it, but like with many things, once they hear it recommended from their friends who took it, they will themselves take it. Also, let's not forget that we won't need 100% vaccination rate for things to get back to mostly normal, and a lot of activities that were previously restricted (like international travel) will likely be available again only to vaccinated folks, which will further boost vaccination rates and create a self-reinforcing cycle.

**Ok but things will never fully return back to the way things were, right?** Probably not 100%, but I think 80%, yes, and much more quickly than you think. There is so much fearful talk of remote work being the way forward, and that no one wants offices anymore, and why would you ever travel for business again. I think this is all blown WAY out of proportion. For God's sakes guys, this is the way we've been doing things for many decades. People's habits won't just change on a dime like that because of a 9-12 month situation that is temporary. People will still want to see each other face to face, people will still go to offices, etc. I mean, I work remotely for my job, and it sucks. Meetings are confusing, I find myself procrastinating and not being nearly as efficient/productive as I was when I was in an office, team cohesion is down. Many employers do not like remote work because productivity is decreased significantly, and it's employers who will set the policy. Now, sure, maybe we have more remote work than we did before. Maybe it's an option for some people, maybe you work 1-2 days remotely per week or something, fine. But I don't think this justifies a 300-600% run up in some of these work from home stocks, and I expect to see those absolutely crater once we have a vaccine.

**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?** Not only will they, but they'll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the 'hot' stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you'd expect.

**Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?** Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It's all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you'll ignore the bumps on the way.

**Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?** Yeah, you could I guess, if you're a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was \~$65 pre-covid, but is now at \~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let's say, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I'd still expect more upside though, so I'd be a buyer there. However, I'd personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I'm a buyer here.

**Ok, well, what are the risks?** The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning 'sell recovery, buy tech'. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don't want to be stuck with a company you're worried about going bankrupt.

**I would really really appreciate feedback on this.** I'm investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I'm missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here.

personalfinance,Rolling over Roth IRA CD from suntrust to schwab,"Good evening PF!
I currently have a roth ira cd at suntrust with a 2.52% interest rate. There are 3.5 years left on the term. My bank has a zero penalty withdrawal for all CDs currently and I am wondering if it is possible to rollover the funds from the CD to my Roth IRA in Schwab. In particular, are there any tax implications in doing this? Am I able to just provide suntrust with a routing number and they can do the transfer for me and then I can invest the funds into a mutual fund of my choosing? That % is pretty good for a conservative investor but my Roth in schwab has done significantly better. 
One other question- would this roll over affect my current tax year or would it be for the year I opened the CD-2019?

By granting these withdrawal rights I intend that contributions to the trust shall qualify for the federal gift tax annual exclusion as gifts of present interests.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend isn't sure how much she should be paying for federal income tax, employer says they are withholding the right amount","My (19M) girlfriend (18F) recently got her first job at a market near our hometown. She was looking at her paycheck and noticed that on the first paycheck her employer withheld no money for federal income tax and on her second paycheck only withheld $3 however they did take out what I'd consider a normal amount for social security. We're both students and her parents are divorced. Her filing status on her paycheck says ""SMS"" which does not match her state filing status of ""F0"".
She asked the owner of the market and after he talked to a few people said that he believed they were withholding the correct amount and it was small cause she didn't ""earn that much"". 
She earned a little over $500 on her last paycheck (withholdings not included) and another girl she works with that gets very similar hours with the same pay got a much higher withholding other paycheck and the other girls filing status matches her state filing status which is F0. However this girl has been working at the market for a few years longer than she has (she started about a month ago). 
The owner told her there were changes to the way you file federal income tax this year (2020) and that was the reason for the discrepancy. 
Is this normal? I tried looking around and from my understanding, she should be paying at least 10% other income but the owner says they are withholding the full amount. 
She did just turn 18 about a week after she started to work there. If anyone could shed some light on this it would be greatly helpful. Thanks!",finance

I am a recent graduate with just under $24,000 in federal student loan debt at 6%. No other debt. I have an emergency fund which covers my largest deductible plus 6 months of my bare bone expenses.  Just started a new job last month; I gross \~$12,000/month.

My original plan was to max out HSA and Roth IRA for 2020 and throw all excess money to debt repayment. Then, in the new year, max out 401(k), HSA and backdoor Roth for 2021 and finish paying off debt. By my calculations, I could be debt free by April. 

Alternatively, I'm thinking about maxing out 401k for 2020 in the next few months (in addition to maxing out 2020 HSA and Roth IRA by April 2021). This would delay my debt payoff date, but only to July or August, at the latest.

personalfinance,Feedback on 5 year saving plan,"I would really like some feedback on whatever this is (budget? game plan?). To start, I'm 28F and have been at my job for 5 years and I don't plan on leaving any time soon. I also don't know enough about investments to feel comfortable diving into that world quite yet.

**Current Funds**

* I'm currently making $60K/year + bonus, so about $70K a year.  

   * My take home paychecks are about $2K bi-monthly (this includes OT, etc)
   * I'm currently investing 6% into my 401K. My company matches 20% of whatever I put in up to the state limit.
* I have about \~$20K saved up  

   * \~$15K saved up in an online savings account with current interest rate of .6% for a down payment on a home  

      * I'm currently depositing $100 weekly into said account.
   * \~$10K in my checking as rainy day funds.

**Current Debts/Monthly Payments**

* \~$1.3K/month in bills  

   * Car loan - $365/month with current remaining balance of $2500.
   * Student loan - $350/month with current remaining balance of $3100.
   * Parents bills - \~$225/month  

      * I don't live at home so I chose to help my parent with their monthly bills
   * Water bill - \~$90/month  

      * I'm fortunate enough to live with my SO who bought his house at the right time and we have housemates who cover pretty much everything (mortgage &amp; other utilities). This is the only bill I pay.
   * Cell phone bill - $250/month  

      * This covers me and my parents. (Yeah, I know it's high)
   * Subscriptions - $45/month  

      * Netflix, Hulu, etc
* \*\*My car insurance is \~$1800/yr that I pay in full in Sept.

**End Goal**

* Save $100K in 5 years or less by putting $2K into my online savings each month.  

   * This leaves me with $500-600 to spend freely on miscellaneous stuff including food, gas, fun.

*Additional Notes:*

* I always pay off the full statement balance on my credit cards and have never had a late payment.
* My SO makes significantly more than I do so he usually pays for most outings that we go on, if I were to be honest, it's about a 30/70 split. We don't drink or party, so it has really helped us cut down on spending. We've been together for 7 years and plan to get married in the next year or two (but are indecisive on whether or not we want a wedding)
* The past few years I was hit with some hardship so I wasn't able to save as much as I would've liked but also was never strict about my spending habits. I'm hoping to change that.
* Lastly, I choose to help my parents with their bills, they're immigrants and only my mom works, and she makes less than I do. I'm their only child and left the nest to go to college and moved out right after I got back from college. They sacrificed a lot for me, so this is the least I can do.

I get payed biweekly and my take home after tax and all with draws is about $1360.

I also have a disability income of $1043 a month.

We have one car payment, we owe $18,600 and pay $392 a month with a 4.04% interest rate. With no other debt, we have \~$41,000 in savings as our emergency fund.

After all our bills (internet, car insurance, gas, food, ect) we depending on SO income will have about either$10- $3000.

I have extra money from cash out refi, should I put back into house or in safe investments?","I just recently took over the mortgage from my parents, and as part of that I refinanced the mortgage to get a lower rate of 2.5%. However we only owed about 80k left on the original mortgage, so I actually had to do a cash out refinance to increase the loan value to qualify for a good rate with low fees. 

I will have ~140k from the cash out after paying for the original mortgage. My parents and I had originally planned to put all this money back into the new mortgage, and then continue making monthly payments and have it paid off in ~5 years. They will be retiring around that time and will continue to live in the house.

However I am wondering if it is worth it to instead put that money into a safe mutual fund like FXAIX. Assuming 10% growth and subtracting the 2.5% interest rate, I would be making an extra ~10k a year compared to just putting that money into the mortgage. This is a pretty substantial amount to me. 

I make about 55k a year and my only monthly bills are 800 to house, 70 to car insurance, 230 to student loans. I will continue to pay these bills for the next ~5 years, and then add the 2k a month for mortgage+escrow. My job is secure.

devops,How to diagram and document the development stream?,"My client is trying to work towards DevOps, but in the meantime I've noticed that our teams are really inconsistent in their development practices writ large. We're a SAFe-style program, but the previous contractor made a mess of the scaling effort and so we basically have a bunch of teams each doing their own flavor of development and testing. We have an independent test group that handles all of the testing, but whatever SOP they have hasn't been properly briefed and managed to the development teams, so everyone ends up doing their own thing. 
It's not terrible by any means, but I'd like us to get on a path to more consistent practices, and I think the first step is for us to get together and come up with an agreement about our delivery stream starting from Dev all the way to Prod. 
Is there a term for this kind of diagram, or any tips on facilitating or drawing it out? We want to capture a step-by-step process document that shows which specific steps (e.g., development, unit testing, functional testing, 508 testing, regression testing, code review, code check-in, build management) take place across which environments and in order. I feel like I've seen this a bunch of times but am not sure what the name of it is or if there are any best practices I can leverage.",technology

personalfinance,"Approved for a loan through my credit union, they want me to use their Payment protection plan, I'm not sure how it works.","I got approved for a 20k loan for 60 months at 8.25%  I haven't gotten the full terms sheet yet but they say the monthly payment will be 444.96, which when I do the math is more than 8.25%, it's more like 12%.  It says this includes a payment protection plan, which will make payments in the event I am unable to, but the information I have so far doesn't explain how much the payment protection plan is, or what it specifically is.

I have an email into them with questions, if it's a fee, I'm not sure I want to go with the loan, because 12% isn't all that great, but if it's more of an escrow type thing I'm totally on board with that, plus the added security.

Because a payment for a 20k 60 month 8.25% loan should be $408, not $445, if I'm paying extra on the loan it works out to be a little more than 1 extra payment a year, but $37 a month seems really steep for a protection fee.

Does anyone else have experience with something like this?

They say I can decline the plan but it would make my interest rate go up.

personalfinance,Can't get a personal loan because of limited credit history,"Hey everyone,

I'm moving in a few weeks and am in need of a small personal loan for that and some car repairs just to make sure I don't deplete all the money in my bank account.  I've applied for 2 different loans (SoFi and Discover) and I was rejected from both with the reason being I don't have enough credit accounts active.  I have a good credit score (mid 700s), I have no loans currently, and I haven't had any late payments on anything including the 1 credit card I do have.  

Is there something else I could apply for or anywhere I could get a loan with this kind of history?  My last resort would be to get some kind of cash advance from my credit card company but I really want to avoid doing that because of the higher interest rates compared to loans.

deeplearning,Earphone Reconstructs Facial Expressions by Deep Learning Contours of the Face,"Here is the [video](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f8698efd81cf36f1a8e38fa/?utm_source=r&amp;utm_campaign=earphone) link to the paper. 

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract: C-Face (Contour-Face) is an ear-mounted wearable sensing technology that uses two miniature cameras to continuously reconstruct facial expressions by deep learning contours of the face. When facial muscles move, the contours of the face change from the point of view of the ear-mounted cameras. These subtle changes are fed into a deep learning model which continuously outputs 42 facial feature points representing the shapes and positions of the mouth, eyes, and eyebrows. To evaluate C-Face, we embedded our technology into headphones and earphones. We conducted a user study with nine participants. In this study, we compared the output of our system to the feature points outputted by a state of the art computer vision library (Dlib) from a front-facing camera.}We found that the mean error of all 42 feature points was 0.77 mm for earphones and 0.74 mm for headphones. The mean error for 20 major feature points capturing the most active areas of the face was 1.43 mm for earphones and 1.39 mm for headphones. The ability to continuously reconstruct facial expressions introduces new opportunities in a variety of applications. As a demonstration, we implemented and evaluated C-Face for two applications: facial expression detection (outputting emojis) and silent speech recognition. We further discuss the opportunities and challenges of deploying C-Face in real-world applications.

stocks,"Psycho Market Recap - Friday, October 16, 2020","Summary

Stocks traded mostly sideways today to end the day slightly negative as investors weighed disappointing news on the stimulus front, a challenging reopening with some places being forced to go back on partial quarantine measures, and a US election which is now less than 3 weeks away.

For the day the SPY was down 0.07%, the QQQ down 0.57%, and the DIA incredibly up 0.37%. This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.

On the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.

The United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020. In comparison to last year's, it has tripled in size, mostly due to the measures put in place in response to the COVID pandemic. As a share of GDP this represents 16%, the largest since WWII, to put this into context in the 2009 crisis it reached almost 10% at its peak. The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs. Still Fed Chair Jerome Powell as soon as last week kept warning that recovery will be fragile and more so without additional aid from Congress and added that providing too much stimulus shouldn’t be a problem, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The figures for retail sales for the month of September have been reported today and they show that US retail sales have grown for the 5th month in a row driven by strong spending in clothing, cars and sporting goods, according to a report published by MarketBeat. Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. “Americans raced to the stores in September,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were “buying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.”

In Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.

personalfinance,Recommendation on Mortgage Refinance,"My fiancé and I just bought our first house in July and would like some advice from more financially savvy people on what our next plan should be. Honestly it was a spur of the moment thing, and we probably should’ve waited but what’s done is done. It is my fiancé’s dream house and well, I couldn’t say no lol 

It was purchased with an FHA Loan at 4.25% and DPA for 3.5% so we have to pay PMI. I’m considering saving enough money to pay the refinancing costs and refinance into a conventional loan. That way once 20% of the loan is paid the PMI falls off. We both also have great credit scores 750+, so ideally I’d like to get a lower interest rate as well.

To get a better financial picture: I currently have no credit card debt (just paid off the last one today!!), two couches financed for ~$1300 for 2 years 0%, my auto loan with 1.5 years left at 0.9%, and $7K in student loans (currently a student so there’s no payments, they haven’t incurred interest yet and I plan on graduating by next summer which should be ~$10.5K in student loans). I save 20% of my income which equates to ~$700, and we rented out the spare rooms to family for $375/month, so total monthly savings would be ~$1075.

Is this a good plan? Or would y’all recommend something else? I’m trying to be 100% debt free, except the house of course, and start saving money and building my net worth.",finance

personalfinance,"My life fell apart and I moved home with my parents, allowing me to save up a year's worth of rent. Now I want to make sure I'm making the smartest financial choices, what should I do?","About a year and a half ago I left my fiancee after a 7 year relationship.  Due to this, I had to move back home with my parents, but all of the sudden I had much lower living expenses with the same salary.  I ended up saving about $20k over the year and want to ultimately have enough to own a house in a few years.  

Since I hit $20k, however, I signed a lease to a house with a few friends of mine.  I don't have the greatest relationship with my parents and the house is *huge* and cheap.  So while moving out may not have been the best financial decision, it was the healthiest one for me.  I also had absolutely no furniture or things of my own moving in, so I had to spend a chunk to buy all of that as well.

Some caveats: 

1. I am severely underpaid at work and currently looking to get a new job.  I know that's the most efficient way of increasing my financial stability/savings.  Just hasn't happened yet. (Most jobs I'm interviewing for are offering 30-50% salary increases)
2. I know I can put everything I own into my student loans, but I like having liquid cash to fall on in case things fall apart again.  Plus, I really do want a house and I feel like putting everything into my student loans would push that back a few years if not more. I could be wrong.

So here's what my financial make up looks like right now:

Cash: $14,500 (Deposit, realtor fee, first month's rent, furniture, etc. cost about $5,500 total).

403b: $9,100 (No company match.  I contribute $250 a month to this)

Salary: $62,000 (I know this is low, but I'm actively working to find a new job.  I work in a nonprofit)

Student loans: $64,000 at 3.7% interest rate, I pay $650 a month towards this.  I originally had a loan with rates over 11%, refinanced it to 6% and then refinanced again to 3.7%

Car: I bought a used 2018 chevy cruze for $14,000. I financed $9k and paid $5k up front.  I pay $213 a month and will pay it off 3.5 years now.  I tried to find something cheaper, but anything cheaper required a ton of work, and leasing just feels like a waste of money.  I'm happy with this purchase.4

Credit rating: 765

&amp;#x200B;

I'm comfortable for now, my budget is conservative but just due to my low salary I can only afford to cash away $300-500 a month right now and still remain relatively comfortable.  I'm hoping to be able to get back to $20k by the end of the year.  However, should I invest this cash into a Vanguard?  I'm just very worried about losing this as a large emergency fund for myself.  Plus I also consider it part of my savings goal, as I want to have +$30k for a house in a few years.

personalfinance,Is this letter wrong? Previous employer asking for 401(k) contributions back,"I am looking for some help with a letter I received today from a previous employer:

[https://imgur.com/a/HabX95F](https://imgur.com/a/HabX95F)

I am a federal contractor, and my previous contract company lost their re-bid in February of last year (2019).  This company was the most incompetent I've ever seen, from sending paystubs to the wrong people, losing our insurance paperwork TWICE, forgetting to renew our security clearances, etc.  They were awful, and I don't really trust a single thing they say.

I received the letter linked above in the mail today, along with a few (most?) of my colleagues who were on the same contract.  They say they accidentally contributed too much to our 401(k), and we need to return this, or we will have to pay a 6% tax each year we don't remove it.  I looked all over the IRS website, and the only place I see ""6% excise tax"" is if you contribute too much to an IRA.  

First off, it doesn't say anything about 401(k)s, but even if it did, how could a company over-fund it?  I know the total yearly limit is somewhere around $56k, but we were no where close to that limit.  Second, the letter mentions they increased the employer match to make the overpayment less bad, but I believe their percent match is completely discretionary to them, right?  The IRS doesn't care if they match 4%, 4.5%, or 10%, as long as they are under the limit.

Third, at the very end of the contract, the company made a Roth contribution to our 401(k) plan.  This was super unusual, since all the rest was normal pre-tax.  Since they are such fuck ups, we all just kinda rolled with it (and I rolled mine into my Roth IRA).  I was maxing out my Roth IRA that year, so I had to change my contributions to make sure I did not go over the Roth limit, but as a Roth 401(k) contribution I'm not sure that even mattered.  The point is, throughout the course of 2019, my Roth contributions did not exceed $6,000, my 401(k) contributions did not exceed $19,000, and the combined 401(k) was nowhere near $56,000.

Lastly, if this were somehow related to the Roth contribution, the amounts don't match.  The letter is asking me to return $75.07, but the contribution was $169.23.

As stated in the beginning, this company is a complete joke, who did almost literally nothing right.  I feel like this is either another mistake on their part, or they are trying to recoup money from a mistake that is entirely their own problem.  Any insight or things I am missing would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Withdrawing $20k from my 401k,"Some short information first that I think is crucial in my decision. I'm 29, Make roughly $50k-$65k a year, have $50k in my 401k, have a $4500 (initially $6300 but I paid it down) personal loan for housing repairs when I purchased my house, a $1300 credit card through my bank, a $2000 Best Buy credit card, and I own a 2010 Vehicle with 130xxx miles (you'll see why I may consider this a problem). I have $1700 in my savings account, $300 my checking, $8000 in stocks, and $3000 in cryptos.

I'd like to withdraw $20k from my 401k to pay off the Best Buy Credit card. I have roughly 6 months to pay off the remaining amount before they will charge interest on my purchase and I honestly don't know the interest rate but I believe it was at least 7-10 or higher (I need to get it together). I would also like to pay off my personal loan of $4500 because that's a $200 a month payment and I would be able to contribute the $200 to other things. 

I would then take the rest of the money and put it into my savings account until I need a car. At that time I could put a nice size down payment on it and have a cheaper payment per month.

Total balance for that card is $5300 (including the $3500). He paid me back in cash recently because he was out of state when the payment had to be made. 

I've got a $5000 student loan with a 4.7% interest rate that I pay $250 monthly. 

Extra cash on hand is $8000, of which $5000 is an emergency fund. The rest of the $3000 I was saving/building to dump into my Roth in Jan. 2021. 

So with the $3500 I got, I'm at $11,500. Should I just pay off my loan in full and then make auto payments to the credit card that would be around $450/month to be paid off before interest hits?

I mean I have the cash on hand to pay off both, but given that it's 0% interest I don't see the point to do it. I'm just wondering if there's anything I'm not seeing that could negatively impact me aside from not paying off the card in time which I am not worried about.",finance

Since we live in California, we are looking at houses and we were thinking about only putting 10% down instead of 20% because 20% is a ton, and with low interest rates I've heard to put less down, especially as a first time buyer.

Forex,Macro Views,"From our newsletter:

Heads I win, tails I win.”

That’s the attitude of many investors today, who believe stocks have only one way to go… higher!

Just this week, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – announced it’s seeing record levels of retail buying of stocks, and the euphoric sentiment is a major warning signal.

All we need is the economic recovery to stall a bit and take longer than expected, and investor euphoria could turn first to alarm, then to dismay… 

Of course, if you’ve been in the markets for as long as I have, you’re bound to see this kind of irrational exuberance from time to time.

In fact, the current situation with stocks reminds me of the situation in the New Zealand dollar three decades ago… and an invaluable lesson I learned back then. Let me explain…

1987 All Over Again

It was 1987, and the kiwi (or New Zealand dollar) had been rallying dramatically for 10 months.

I’d never traded the kiwi before, but I knew a lot of bankers in New Zealand. I regularly executed business there in the major currencies, since I figured one day, I might really need that liquidity. (New Zealand filled up the dead trading zone between New York’s close and Australia’s open.)

But then the summer rolled around, and that’s when the kiwi caught my attention. In just two months, it shot up from 56.6 cents to 66 cents – a 16.6% rally. That’s an explosive move in the currency markets. So I started doing some research on the kiwi…

The more I looked into it, the more obvious it seemed: The central bank desperately wanted a lower currency. It needed inflation to cool off so it could lower rates and help exporters by driving down the kiwi.

Meanwhile, the market was very long the currency. The trend followers (mainly hedge funds) were all long. It was unlikely they’d be buying much more, considering how far the currency had come.

To me, this seemed like a classic bubble. The only question was: When should I start selling?

The market was super-bullish, super-long, and not particularly deep in terms of liquidity. The entire money supply of the country wasn’t that big, so I figured I should put on a modest short position at first. Then, once I had a major catalyst to convince me it was time, I would pile in.

Tell-Tale Signs of Any Bubble

I remember well the conversation that got me started. It was with a trader from ANZ Wellington, the biggest bank in New Zealand.

The trader, whose name was Nigel, called me up and said, “Mate, you need to buy the kiwi. There is only one way for this currency to go… up.”

Usually, Nigel was calm and objective, so he had my attention. He explained that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers were coming out and that they would be the catalyst for the currency’s next surge higher.

If the numbers came in worse than expected, Nigel told me, the central bank would have to raise rates even higher… And that would be great for the currency, attracting lots of capital flows.

Ok, I could follow that logic. I then asked the obvious question, “What happens if the numbers come out better than expected?”

Nigel quickly answered, “Oh, the kiwi would sail. Fundamentals would be better, and money would pour into the country.”

This guy was the chief dealer of the biggest trading bank in the country. I figured his view would be the exception because it seemed so ridiculous. But then I started calling all the banks down there… 

I spoke with 11 dealing rooms, and every bank had the same view. At that point, I was convinced. The market could go a bit higher… but this was a mania, a bubble ready to pop.

I started selling lightly over the next week, and each time I sold, the price went higher. I was amazed. I kept selling steadily until I had sold a few hundred million kiwi.

Then something happened. The stock market crashed in the U.S., and people started sprinting for cover.

I was sure the kiwi would crater as people scrambled to get out of their risky positions… And holding a currency that needed 15% interest rates to hold up was clearly risky.

So I plowed in. I sold billions of kiwi over the next three days, and the currency collapsed down to 58 cents – a 13.4% drop. All the longs were forced to bail once the currency broke technical support below 64 cents.



The Central Bank was angry with me for destabilizing their currency… Although they also noted they were happy I had driven the currency lower. They just didn’t want me to do it in a couple of days.

Now, you’re probably wondering why I’m telling you this today. And the answer is simple…

Don’t Ignore the Warning Signs

We have a very similar set-up in the stocks now, as well as in a number of currencies. The market is heavily skewed in one direction, and every scrap of marginally positive news has been baked into the price.

Meanwhile, we still have huge unemployment numbers… rising Covid-19 cases around the world… and the Federal Reserve practically begging Congress to pass more emergency stimulus.

This last fact alone is reason for concern. In a normal world, investors would interpret the Fed’s pleas for fiscal stimulus as a sign of weakness and sell risky assets aggressively.

But investors today are interpreting a clear signal of desperation as a reason to buy stocks more and more aggressively.

It makes about as much sense as the bankers in New Zealand assuring me there was only way for their currency to go. But you don’t have to make the same mistake they made…

If you’ve been following my writing, you already know the U.S. is heading towards a long-term cycle of very modest growth, propped up by zero interest rates and massive fiscal spending programs.

A stock market that is trading at, or near, all-time highs makes little sense if it is in any way reflective of the broader economy.

Just yesterday, we learned that the real unemployment level is still 11%, once we adjust for the reduced participation in the job market by the millions who have been squeezed out permanently. That is a terrifying number.

Now, I am not quite ready to go all in and sell the stock market, so I am not recommending you close your long positions. But I am suggesting that you tread carefully… and manage your positions with trailing stop-loss orders.

Given the current fundamental and technical position of the market, my strongest advice is that you should not get married to your stock positions or assume that every dip should be bought.",finance

OR does it make more sense to refi at the lower rate but lessen the term to 10 or 15 years and save some money overall with an even further reduced interest rate, but with similar or slightly high monthly payment than my current one?

personalfinance,Mortgage Question,"My wife and I were looking at mortgage options and we were encouraged by a major bank to have only one of our names on the mortgage. By doing so, we would stay below the 77k income limit and it would allow us to get $16,000 in assistance up front to add to our down payment and lower our interest rate through buying points on the rate. He said we could still put both of our names on the house title.

Are there any problems that could arise from this? It seems like a loophole that shouldn’t exist or too good to be true.",finance

personalfinance,Any good places to start learning about investment?,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not in the US

Hey guys, recently I started thinking about putting my money away in some smart way, but I don't know where to start. In my country, the most common way is a simple deposit, but it's only profitable here because the interest rates are higher than the inflation. I get my salary in US dollars, and I'd like to start saving money in them as well, but there are no options for deposits with interest rates at least 1%, let alone anything higher than that. Just fyi, for the last 2 years the US dollar inflation was around 1.7%, so I'd losing more money than I'm actually saving.

So what do I do with my money? Do I need to invest in stock market? Look for local businesses to invest in? I have 0 experience with this stuff, because before I was just putting all my money in a deposit account in my local currency.",finance

This makes it easier for me because I have been dealing with some bad anxiety issues, so working from home is a great plus. I can set my own hours and such, and am labeled as an ""independent contractor"". I am making $10 an hour plus commission on sales. I am not sure if I expect to stay with the company long, but so far I enjoy it because I can do it on my free time. I have looked into taxes, and see that I would need to pay the 15.3% self-employment tax. I also reside in New jersey, so also a 1.4% state income tax. That totals in 16.7%. I do not expect to make more than $12,200, which apparently is the deductible for people who are single and dependent? So would i technically just need to keep 16.7% of my paycheck and store it away in another account, or is there more taxes i might be missing? I am just a but unsure if i am going to have to pay a Federal income tax on less than $12,200. I looked online and just got scared because people say that independent contractors get taxed more, but if i do not need to pay federal income tax, than i really do not mind considering the flexibility of the job. Any information on how i can go about my taxes as an independent contractor will be greatly appreciated, as I also hear I will need to pay estimated tax quarterly? considering i plan to pay more than 1k in taxes.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage early and invest with LOC?,"I have what I presume to be a fairly unusual and privileged situation.

I'm a software developer for now and my current workload is a mix of client works as well as my own project which I don't necessarily plan on it being revenue producing although it has the potential.
I have retainer arrangements with all of my clients. It's not a lot but it's nice.

I also have a mortgage which I've put a sizable chunk as a down payment. As a consequence, my biweekly payments are relatively low. Paying off the mortgage also expands the available funds on a corresponding line of credit. The LOC rate is 1.5% above the mortgage rate which is less than 2%.

I'm an incredibly frugal man who's only real expenses are travel and eating out. Neither of which are currently possible so I don't need much to live my life. Putting all my monthly expenses together though, they go over the amount I collect in retainer fees, which means I must seek work if my clients don't have work for me that month, although that's rare.

Any cash past a 6 month emergency fund, I put to work in the market. I'm satisfied with my performance there. I will soon have enough to pay off the rest of the mortgage outright bringing my monthly expenses well below the collection of retainer fees. It will free me from seeking work and give me plenty of time to work on my own projects. I have also considered that if I don't need the extra work from my clients, I can happily pass it off to subcontractors with whom I can develop relationships and perhaps a team. Now, when I get work, I do the responsible thing of working on it myself so I collect in full. This takes my focus away on the projects I want to work on.

With the expanded LOC and with the rates so low, I've considered that I will simply use the liquidity there to fund my investments. I do not bet on extremely risky items. All things are volatile now but I only bet on things that MUST eventually come back up. (If they don't, the world has bigger problems than money). I also understand that investments towards interest/dividends are tax deductible while mortgage interest is not (at least in my region).

I have considered some pros and cons.

PROS

- My monthly obligations will be so little it wouldn't even matter

- I'll have time to concentrate on my entrepreneurial projects

- I could foster a team

- I will have no debt (except the LOC but at least it's not a monthly obligation)

- Some LOC interest is tax deductible

- Unlock much more monthly cash flow towards investments

CONS

- 100% of my principle would be in my home

- All of my investments would be 100% leveraged (until they are not)

- I will pay 1.5% more in interest

- Interest rates could go up and equities could go down at the same time putting me in a pinch which will force me to return to work to actively avoid interest compounding too quickly

- The principle : home price capital gain ratio is no more

My gut says go for it but my rational mind is much more skeptical and conservative to my benefit.

I certainly believe I can put my free time to good use. I often think that the work I do for the money I make is not worthy of my talents and if I had ability to direct my own work, I could venture into much more lucrative work.

I'd appreciate your critique of my thoughts.",finance

investing,A couple of highlights from Dan Loeb's letter:,"""The world continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid rate. The behavioral and business
changes that surged during the COVID-19 lockdown have, by now, been well-mapped: work
(and exercise) from home, online retail, multiplayer gaming, video on demand, online
payments, and an explosion in biotech research and drug development. COVID-19 has
permanently accelerated fundamental shifts in how we interact with each other and how
digital information is turned into value. These shifts were only possible due to an
exponential increase in broadband capacity, cloud computing infrastructure, artificial
intelligence, VOIP communications, rapid semiconductor innovation, cybersecurity
hardening, and the collaborative technology and business tools to bring it all together. The
evolution of this ecosystem now underpins almost every business we evaluate. As
investors, we must ask ourselves if we wish to engage at the leading edge of this
change or end up as roadkill on what was once quaintly called “the information
superhighway.”	

""Markets reached an all-time high on September 2, before elevated uncertainty about the
election and vaccine timing caused a modest sell-off. Sector rotation was evident
throughout, as tech cooled after a summer of euphoria, and some excess in the market was
wrung out. Many observers have reasonably asked how markets have remained resilient in
a time of historic uncertainty and continued economic suffering for many individuals, a
puzzling disconnect. Markets usually look ahead and it is critical to understand that this is
not a typical recession – one caused by excesses such as over-investment – but a shock
recession which, although rare, historically results in faster retracing because there is no
“imbalance” to unwind before a recovery can begin. For this reason, comparisons to 2008
are inappropriate. The policy response so far, whether through monetary, fiscal, or public
health measures, has been aggressive by historical standards. Assuming a reasonable
expectation of a vaccine early next year, we could see the level of US GDP return to its preCOVID level in the middle of 2021 with a possible fiscal stimulus bill in the first half providing
further impetus. A constructive central case notwithstanding, we are attendant to a number
of risks: a) political wrangling under a potential gridlock post-election scenario, which could
make it harder to enact fiscal support in the event of a faltering recovery; b) a third wave in 
COVID cases; c) a delay in vaccine distribution timing; d) larger-than-anticipated scarring
effects among consumer and businesses, which would be exacerbated by a more protracted
recovery; and e) the path of interest rates.""

""Given the economic recovery and generally conducive monetary policies, conditions seem
favorable for asset prices currently. Housing remains robust, inventories are rebuilding, and
financial conditions remain loose. While employment will take time to fully recover,
declining unemployment off a high level is typically good for stocks because earnings growth
is supported by rebounding GDP growth and muted wage pressure. In addition, high slack
in the labor market means there is room to run for the post-COVID expansion. A Fed that is
eager to nurse the economic recovery means that the typical rise in interest rates following
recessions may be more muted, which is supportive for P/E multiples, although a rise in
long-end rates is still likely, especially in the event of a Blue Sweep. Regardless of which
party wins the Presidential election or whether Democrats obtain a majority of Senate seats,
we expect that future stimulus spending will likely outweigh increases in taxation and
regulation that are assured under a Democratic majority and thus have maintained our
positions and exposures as we approach the election.""

I have some fresh funds and this is my first time getting into the US market. 

I am currently invested in my home country, the philippines and am planning to move some funds to the US market for diversification and also for better choices.

It took awhile before I was able to set an account. Right now, base on my research, it feels like most of the stocks right now is expensive (but who can argue with this since this environment has very low interest rates right now)

What sector and companies are good to look into right now? Which defensive stocks look attractive for you guys and why?

Fresh funds that I have now is something i can let it sleep for the next 5 to 10 years. Are there any 10,20 baggers are you guys eyeing?

The style I like to practice on is value base investing since I dont have the time to be actively trading and investing in companies with sound fundamentals makes me sleep at night when market falls.

personalfinance,"If I have two credit cards, both maxed out, with different credit limits, which should I try to pay off first to best improve my credit score?","Slightly simplified scenario: I have two credit cards, both maxed out, one with a $4500 limit and the other $1500. I have $1000 which I can afford to pay on those cards. Should I pay it all toward the first card (reducing its utilization slightly), or the second card (reducing its utilization a lot), or split it up in some fashion (say, $500 on each, or proportional to the credit limits so $750 on the first and $250 on the second)? Or does it even matter (regarding my credit score) which card I pay, and I should just pay the one with the higher interest rate? Obviously I know I should not carry a balance but over the past year I've had no choice and I'll try to avoid doing that as much as possible in the future once I get these cards paid off!

edit: the actual scenario is I have four maxed out (or nearly maxed out) credit cards with the following limits: $4600, $1850, $1000, and $400. The first two are general purpose credit cards I can use anywhere; the last two are merchant specific credit cards (Home Depot and Amazon). I also have a fifth credit card, also general purpose; the limit is $3000 and I just paid it off last week but for some reason my available credit is stuck at $100; I asked a question about that here yesterday. Presumably I should pay off the general purpose credit cards before the merchant specific ones, so I'm not as constrained as to where I can use my credit? The $1000 figure I pulled out of a hat; I could spend more but I'm concerned about my credit limits being lowered once I make the payments and then I'm out the money in the event that I might need it again, so I want to hold on to some money in my checking account that the credit card companies can't touch, but I'm not sure how much to hold on to - I have $3200 but I was recently hospitalized so I know I have some large bills coming up whenever they get around to mailing them out to me! Plus who knows what other random bills might come up, I'm always paranoid about that! I really want to reduce the interest that I pay on my credit cards but I'm just so scared to pay too much on them for fear of not having money when I need it...

edit: OK, after getting a bunch of advice here (thanks everyone!) and checking on my cards' interest rates, I think I know what I'm going to do. So here are all my cards, their rates, and what I'm going to do with them:

* Fifth Third $4600: 18.99% - I'm going to leave this one alone for now because it has the lowest interest rate.
* Verizon $3000: 25.74% but it's almost entirely paid off - I will pay the rest off (it's only like $13) to reduce the number of outstanding balances, which should help my credit score. But - I'm going to keep my Verizon phone bill on auto pay here, to keep the card open and my available credit high, that will help my credit score. Plus, this card has some *amazing* rewards - 4% back towards my Verizon bill on groceries and gas, 3% on dining, 2% on Verizon purchases, and 1% on everything else!
* Comenity $1850: 26.9% for purchases prior to 9/11/2020 (about $500) and 24.9% for the rest - I'm going to pay $500 on this; hopefully that will cover the balance that has the highest interest rate of all my cards. I think payments always go to the highest rate balance on the card that you're paying but I'm not 100% sure... if not, oh well, it's not a big deal...
* Home Depot $1000: 25.99% but most of my balance has a 12 months no interest promotion - I'm probably going to leave this one alone for now because only a small portion of the balance I'm paying interest on. Or maybe I'll pay that small portion off now, if that will eliminate the interest.
* Amazon $400: 25.99% - I'm going to pay this off completely because it has one of the highest interest rates of all my cards (saving me money) and it's the smallest (so easiest to reduce utilization and percentage of outstanding balances, assuming they don't close the card on me when I pay it).",finance

# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.
*****
&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.
*****
&gt; “The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.
*****
&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.
*****
&gt; “What this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we’ve already started to see some of that in the data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they’ve reached a point where “they’re not going to get better; they’re going to get worse.”
*****
&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.
*****
&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.
*****
&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus ‘hurting’ those in need
&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House’s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration’s proposal “falls significantly short” of what is needed.
*****
&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.
*****
&gt; “This political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “To the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don’t see something now.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings season ignored?
&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.
*****
&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.
*****
&gt; “I wish I could say that next week we’re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won’t trade this earnings season,” said Hogan of National Securities. “While it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it’s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there’re so many other macro factors that are more important.”
*****
&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders’ sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The housing market is still off to the races,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.”
*****
&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, “certainly the economy could use the juice.”

&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we’re watching.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe’s Recovery blog.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We’ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.

&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. “Higher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.” Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.

&gt; Last, Friday’s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions—and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.

&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID

&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**

&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That’s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound

&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August’s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it’s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again

&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**

&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.

&gt; # Small Business Smiles

&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.

&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month—Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.

&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.

&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.

&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic

&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**

&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.

&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.

&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.

&gt; # Sentiment By State

&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the ""Future Expectations"" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the ""Current Conditions"" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**

&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.

personalfinance,When to use cash vs taking a loan?,"So I'm looking to get some work done on my house, project cost is about $15k.  We have the cash to cover this and still have plenty left over for our ""emergency fund"".  But with interest rates as low as they are, how do I know when it's better to take a loan or just pay cash?

If the contractor offers some sort of 0% for 12 month term should we take it since we have the cash to cover it anyway and we would only be dumping a bit over 1k a month to it?

Part of me wants to just pay for it so I don't have to deal with another payment.  The other part of me says if I can make more elsewhere than the interest costs me that's the logical way to do it...",finance
personalfinance,"Finishing off my student loans, check on my next steps, please!","Hi all! My stats: 27 years old, living in a high COL area but have a good deal on an apartment. No car loan, no credit card debt. I'm making my final payment on my student loans this month - I'll have paid off 40k in about 28 months. I've been throwing as much as I can at my loans, especially since the interest rate has been 0%! 
Salary: $61,500 a year. 
Savings: about 10k in an Ally bank account, I keep about $3500 in a checking account for monthly expenses.


I budget diligently and my monthly expenses (not including loan payments since I'm almost done with that!) add up to about 2000 a month. My job is very steady and not at risk at all. I don't have any anticipated big expenses coming up in the next year or two.


Since I'll have much more to work with when my loans are gone, I'm thinking about what's next. I have about 12k vested in a 401k from my last job, which I left in Feb 2020. That's through Fidelity. I also have about 1k in my 403b for my current job. I plan to increase my contributions there for sure. When I hit a year at this job in February, my employer will match 3%.


My general next steps are to bulk up my savings, increase my 403b contributions, and open a Roth IRA. 


My main question:Should I roll my 401k from my old job into a Roth IRA through Fidelity? What other steps would you recommend for someone at my point in life?


Let me know if you need any more information! Thank you!",finance

worldpolitics,Reminding the Voter: A Synopsis of Trump,"Voter memory is short, so a friend and I made this to help remind people of the things Trump has done. Feel free to copy and paste, share, or whatever.   


1) March 7, 2006 - Trump states that his daughter has a nice figure and he might date her if she wasn’t his daughter. 

2) August 23, 2012 - Trump tweets “Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism....”

3) November 6, 2012 - Trump tweets “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”

4) May 7, 2013 - Trump tweets “26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men &amp; women together?”  
5) June 25, 2013 - Trump tweets - ""@sonaderi:[ @realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)[ @coolchange80](https://twitter.com/CoolChange80) And you're okay with the government spying on you?"" Must have power to stop terrorists etc.”

6) July 10, 2014 - Trump tweets “When will the U.S. stop sending $'s to our enemies, i.e. Mexico and others.” While U.S.-Mexico relations have been complicated over the years, the Mexican government hasn’t been at war with the United States since the Mexican-American War ended in 1848 and have essentially been allies since the end of World War 2, having various treaties and cooperative programs with each other over the decades, the most recent agreement being NAFTA which became law in 1994. 

7) June 16, 2015 - In Trump’s presidential campaign announcement he stated that Mexico is “...sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" In this same speech he announced that he would build a wall to try to stop this. This wall wouldn’t begin construction until June of 2018. In 2018 only two miles of Trump’s wall would be built.   
 According to Customs and Border Patrol, in 2018 out of the 566,000 apprehensions on the border, only 17,000 (3%) had a previous criminal record. Of these 17,000, 63% were apprehensions at a port of entry. Additionally, of these 17,000 about 46% were apprehended on an illegal entry/reentry charged and only 10% were apprehended on a drug related charge. While I couldn’t find a breakdown of the apprehension charges of the 566,000, it is worth noting that the Center for Investigative Reporting reported that “Three out of four people found with drugs by the border agency are U.S. citizens, the data show. Looked at another way, when the immigration status is known, 4 out of 5 busts – which may include multiple people – involve a U.S. citizen.” In regards to drugs, there’s this element of co-responsibility that’s often forgotten. To elaborate, drugs come to the U.S. because there are people in the U.S. who will buy them. But drug addiction is another complex issue. It’s also worth noting that the Center for Migration Studies reported in 2017 that 62% of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. had overstayed a visa, rather than crossing the border illegally.   
Additionally, the Mexican government is not actually sending people to the U.S., like Trump is stating.  
All statistics aside, this is just a snapshot of Trump’s scapegoating and finger-pointing, which is hardly productive and can have dire consequences. Between ladders and tunnels existing, my favorite report has been of people just cutting through the wall. My second favorite has been a video of an 8 year old climbing a replica of the wall. 

All the anti-immigration measures are just a poor response to a more complicated humanitarian crisis.   
8) July 18, 2015 - In regards to John McCain, a Vietnam Veteran and former prisoner of war, Trump stated, ""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.” In regards to McCain’s 2008 presidential run Trump stated, ""He lost and let us down. I don't like losers”  


9)August 23, 2015 - Trump states “...we're building a wall. And it's going to be a great wall. OK? And, by the way, Mexico will pay for it."" As of January 19, 2020 the U.S. had spent $11 billion on Trump’s wall. 

\-On January 10, 2019 Trump said ""When during the campaign I would say ‘Mexico is going to pay for it,’ obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they're going to write out a check. I said they're going to pay for it. They are.""

10) November 24, 2015 - Trump mocks a disabled reporter. 

11) October 7, 2016 - The Washington Post releases the Access Hollywood Tape where Trump says “You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything”

12) October 20, 2016 - NPR publishes a list of 19 women that have accused Trump over some form of sexual misconduct. 

13) January 24, 2017 - Trump approves the Keystone Dakota Access Pipeline despite protests from The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stated that the pipelines ""risks contaminating tribal and American water supplies while disregarding treaty rights.""

PBS states that in 2017 a different Keystone pipeline leaked “407,000 gallons of oil onto farmland in northeastern South Dakota, in a rural area near the North Dakota border.” PBS also stated in October 2019 another Keystone pipeline “leaked an estimated 383,000 gallons of oil in northeastern North Dakota.”

14) January 27, 2017 - Trump signs a ban barring travel from 7 majority Muslims countries. Looking at this ban from a perspective of where people who have attacked the U.S. come from, this ban is illogical. Snopes has stated that “...Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates were not included, even though a [report](https://www.cato.org/blog/guide-trumps-executive-order-limit-migration-national-security-reasons) from the Cato Institute showed that the three countries were the point of origin for people responsible for 94.1% of American deaths due to terrorist attacks in the U.S. 18 of the 19 people responsible for the 11 September 2001 attacks also hailed from those three countries.” Additionally, since 1975, the countries banned have produced 0 terrorists that have killed people on U.S. soil  Furthermore, just because a few people from a certain country have attacked the U.S. doesn’t mean that everyone else from that country is dangerous.   
This ban also conveniently didn’t interfere with any of Trump’s businesses in Muslim-majority countries. What this ban does is prevent people living in countries that are having a refugee crisis from being able to seek refuge in the U.S. 

15) August 20, 2017 - In response to the Charlottesville Protest Trump states that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Two days after this remark he released a statement condemning the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. However, the Charlottesville Protests, which ended with a counterprotestor being killed by a Neo-Nazi, was initially started by the United the Right which was organized by white supremacist Richard Spencer to protest the removal of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Video can be found of these white supremacist doing Nazi and racist chants like “One people. One nation. End immigration,”  “You will not replace us,” “Blood and soil,” and “Jews will not replace us.” Video can also be found of these white supremacists chanting “Hail Trump” and doing the Roman solute which was adopted by Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Fascist Spain, and other Fascist groups. This event was attended by the likes of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.   
This particular statue was erected in 1924, 59 years after the end of the Civil War. It’s unveiling ceremony was a tribute to the “Lost Cause” handled by three pro-Confederate groups, the Confederate Veterans, Sons of Confederate Veterans, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The “Lost Cause” is a pseudo-historical representation that seeks minimize or deny the role of slavery as the primary cause of the Civil War by ignoring historical facts such as Texas’ 1861 declaration of secession listing the word ‘slave’ or a dirivative 21 times, and Georgia’s listing the word ‘slave’ or a dirivitave 35 times, with some other secession documents using ironic language like “...out to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.” Language of other succession documents were reminiscent of such lines like th following in Texas’ succession document: “They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and the negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.” They also ignore other facts such as the 1861 Cornerstone speech where the Vice President of the Confederate States of America states “They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the “storm came and the wind blew.”

Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.”  
This statue, like many other Confederate monuments, was built well after the Civil War during times of Civil Rights tensions in the early 1900s, and again in the mid 1900s. James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, states ""These statues were meant to create legitimate garb for white supremacy. Why would you put a statue of Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson in 1948 in Baltimore?"" Jane Dailey, associate professor of history at the University of Chicago states ""Most of the people who were involved in erecting the monuments were not necessarily erecting a monument to the past, but were rather, erecting them toward a white supremacist future."" NPR continues by adding ""To build Confederate statues, says Dailey, in public spaces, near government buildings, and especially in front of court houses, was a ""power play"" meant to intimidate those looking to come to the ""seat of justice or the seat of the law.""”  
With all this considered, one must wonder who the fine people protesting the removal of the statue actually were and moreover, what kind of ‘fine people’ would want to march with neo-Nazis, Fascists, Klansmen, white supremacists, and generally hateful and ignorant people in the first place

16) September 5, 2017 - The Trump Administration announced the ending of DACA, a program designed to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the U.S. as children or teens as long as they meet met certain academic requirements and kept a relatively low criminal record.   
17) September 28, 2017 - Trump waives the Jones Act, a piece of legislation that prohibited Puerto Rico from receiving foreign aid and supplies 8 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall. It was evident that Puerto Rico could be facing catastrophic effects from Hurricane Maria 11 days before Trump waived the Jones Act.   
18) November 27, 2017 - Trump defends Roy Moore who was facing allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers when he was in his 30s.   
19) December 4, 2017 - Trump announces his plans to roll back environmental protections by reducing two National monuments; Bears Ear National Monument and Grand Staircase Escalante. His plans would reduce Bears Ear by 85% and Grand Staircase Escalante by half to open them up to oil, gas, and mining companies. Despite Trump’s claims that this would empower indigenous people and despite Bears Ear being culturally significant to the Navajo and other indigenous groups, this decision was made without tribal consultation, which resulted with the Navajo Nation promising to sue the Trump Administration. 

20) January 11, 2018 - Trump complains about “having all these people from shithole countries come here"" using Haiti, El Salvador and Africa as examples. He then added ""we should have more people from Norway.”

21) January 12, 2018 - Trump denies he used the term ‘shithole countries.’  
22) March 27, 2018 - Politico releases an article that demonstrates how the Trump administration favored Houston over Puerto Rico. Keep in mind that Houston has a population of 2.326 million while Puerto Rico has a population of 3.194 million. “Within six days of Hurricane Harvey, U.S. Northern Command had deployed 73 helicopters over Houston, which are critical for saving victims and delivering emergency supplies. It took at least three weeks after Maria before it had more than 70 helicopters flying above Puerto Rico.”

Nine days after the respective hurricanes, FEMA had approved $141.8 million in individual assistance to Harvey victims, versus just $6.2 million for Maria victims.

During the first nine days after Harvey, FEMA provided 5.1 million meals, 4.5 million liters of water and over 20,000 tarps to Houston; but in the same period, it delivered just 1.6 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water and roughly 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico.

Nine days after Harvey, the federal government had 30,000 personnel in the Houston region, compared with 10,000 at the same point after Maria.

It took just 10 days for FEMA to approve permanent disaster work for Texas, compared with 43 days for Puerto Rico.

Seventy-eight days after each hurricane, FEMA had approved 39 percent of federal applications for relief from victims of Harvey, versus 28 percent for Maria.”  
\- July 22, 2019 - Trump says, “I’m the best thing to ever happen to Puerto Rico. Because we did a great job in Puerto Rico. They don’t like to give me the credit for it but we did a great job.” 

23) April 2, 2019 - Trump in regards to windmills: ""And they say the noise causes cancer.""

24) October 7, 2019 - Trump announces that the U.S. will abandon the Kurds in Syria, leaving them vulnerable to Turkish attacks and creating a situation where 11,000 ISIS prisoners could possibly be set free. 

25) November 12, 2019 - Trump states that some people in the DACA program are ‘hardened criminals.’ However, one of the requirements stated in the executive order for the DACA program is that recipients must “Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor,or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.”

26) January 4, 2020 - Trump releases a series of tweets threatening to destroy Iranian cultural sites. This is illegal per the [1954 Hague Convention](http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html), which the U.S. has signed. The U.N. states that “The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict was adopted at The Hague (Netherlands) in 1954 in the wake of massive destruction of cultural heritage during the Second World War.”  
27) February 6, 2020 - The Trump Administration began blowing up parts of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, an area designated as a International Biosphere Reserve by the U.N. in 1976. Parts of the Tohono O'odham sacred burial grounds were also destroyed in this process. This wall, if completed, would also cut through the middle of the The Tohono O'odham Nation. The Tohono O'odham Nation was not consulted by the U.S. government. Considering this in addition to his tweets where he threatens to destroy Iranian cultural sites, it’s becoming more apparent that Trump doesn’t respect different cultures. 

28) March 28, 2020 - The Trump administration states that the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe will lose its tribal status. This order came from the Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt who has ties to the oil and mining industry. 

29) April 23, 2020 - In regards to COVID-19, Trump states “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.”  
30) May 29, 2020 - In a tweet Trump states ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" quoting a segregationist. This tweet was then flagged for glorifying violence. I guess that there are more parallels between the current civil rights movements and the one of the 1960s than some had originally thought, even going down to exact, word-for-word rhetoric.  
31) July 21, 2020 - Trump sends ‘well-wishes’ Ghislaine Maxwell after she was arrested on charges of enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. Or in layman's terms, she was arrested on charges for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors. This is the same Jeffrey Epstein that was arrested in July of 2019 on charges of sex trafficking of minors and paying victims to recruit other underage girls, with some victims being as young as 13. In 2002 Trump stated “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”  
In an interview that AXIOS released on August 3, 2020 Trump sent more ‘well-wishes’ to Ghislaine Maxwell.  
32) August 6, 2020 - 170 medical and public health experts from leading public health schools, including the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health, medical schools, hospitals, and other U.S. institutions, release a letter to the Attorney General and Department of Homeland Security expressing concerns about a sweeping rule proposed by the Trump administration in the previous month that would deny people refugee and torture protection, allowing CBP to skirt humanitarian protections while also scapegoating newly arrived immigrants.   
33) August 20, 2020 - Reuters releases an article detailing the arrests of 8 associates of Trump. Some highlights of the article: “Steve Bannon has been charged with defrauding Trump supporters in a campaign to help build the president’s signature wall along the U.S.-Mexico border...A Washington jury in November 2019 convicted \[Roger\] Stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress, and tampering with a witness. The day before Stone was due to report to prison to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months, Trump commuted his sentence… George Nader, an informal Trump adviser on foreign policy and witness in the Mueller investigation, was sentenced in June to 10 years in prison by a federal judge in Virginia. He pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and bringing a boy to the United States for sex.”  
34) September 9, 2020 - Tapes are leaked of Trump intentionally downplaying COVID-19 despite knowing how lethal it is, stating “This is more deadly. This is five per — you know, this is 5 percent versus 1 percent and less than 1 percent, you know. So, this is deadly stuff.” He later stated that he wanted to play it down as to not create a panic. However, his presidency has been marked by fear-mongering, as demonstrated by his scapegoating of immigrants and a tweet from July 1, 2020 essentially saying ‘they’re coming to get you’ without even defining who ‘they’ is.   
Trump also stated “But if you look at our numbers, our fatality numbers compared to other countries, we are in really — I mean, it’s amazing what we’ve done.” John Hopkins reports the U.S. has a fatality rate of 66.54 per 100,000 people. Mexico’s is 67.58. The U.K., Italy, and Sweden are 65.25, 60.19, and 58.04 respectively. Other developed countries like Norway, Denmark, and Germany have death rates of less than 15. The only developed nation with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate than the U.S. is Spain with 71.81 deaths per 100,000.  
As of writing this, 217,692 people in the U.S. have died due to COVID-19. To put that into perspective, the CDC report there are 12,000-61,000 deaths each year due to COVID-19. There were 135,000 deaths from the bombing of Hiroshima. There were 58,220 U.S. deaths in Vietnam. COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death in the U.S., behind heart disease and cancer.

35) As of September 11, 2020 the Trump administration had deported 8,800 unaccompanied migrant children from the U.S.-Mexico border, citing the pandemic as the reason for this. Unaccompanied meaning that they were not with an adult/parent when they arrived in the U.S.  
36) September 29, 2020 - In a debate with Joe Biden, Trump would not explicitly denounce white supremacists and militia groups.

investing,I just have a curious question about tobacco companies and weed.?,"Okay the thing is is that these weed companies that I've been seeing are just disgusting okay they don't have the money they don't have the financial power they don't have any resources barely any okay to make themselves really grab the ball that even goes to they're drinking side of things in edibles.

I live in Canada so the entrepreneurship is completely dead because it's like a communist country any type of society that fixates on socialism and taxing is pretty much communistic and destroys entrepreneurship because the more you work the less you get paid that's how it goes it sucks I actually I'm planning to move to America someday I'm a right-wing add person I can't stand this left-sided world but that's a different topic altogether so I won't bother indulging any further

By the way I'm using speech to text so there won't be any periods or commas a little too lazy to do such.

If the USA legalized federally weed and all the states were all greenlet to go I could see baking companies in baking Goods like manufacturers that sell brownie patters and other things of sorts would dabble into edible weed products while the liquor company would dabble into the weed booze Market no alcohol just pure THC and whatever the other chemical is called. And for the tobacco company I get to see them dominating the smoking part aspects of stuff. You have your joints 10 pack of joints for $10 okay that's the average going price for cigarettes Plus the companies have the financial power and capability of doing these things.

Furthermore let's face it no one likes a hangover no one likes to barf while at a party and with weed edibles and beverages like Bacardi rum but we'd infused and no alcohol yes, it would be awesome. Because let's face it you're at a party do you really want to be sick and make a look like a fool out yourself not really show drinking a Bacardi rum that has weed and it would be awesome no headache or feel nauseous.

I don't know what do you guys think you think that some food company and liquor company as well as say Tobacco Company would dominate the weed Market. I don't see why not. Question that remains is will it ever become legalized for entrepreneurship or will it be controlled by the government. At the end of the day. And if so what company would actually take up the mantle Mass producing such stuff.

On just asking is do you think it would be even possible for there such a thing to happen if it does I could definitely see the thoughts for such companies going through the roof.

Oh also when Facebook release the ocular Rift attacks the account thing there's already been Bans and now people have $400 devices that are paperweight trash. The pandering companies like Sony Disney Netflix they're not worth March value in the stock at all they should only be worth like $0.06 a share to be honest. Also the Canadian government wants to tax Netflix big time and any type of streaming services yeah just because they're making so much money during this epidemic it's just a bunch of nonsense.

Honestly the commonwealth countries just suck I'm planning to move to the states just because there's better prospects Shield.

Oh yeah I know I went completely off topic with the other half of this but my question Still Remains do you think that tobacco companies with really dabble into weed if they could including the booze at what companies would actually take it into consideration",finance

personalfinance,How do I calculate net income for an overseas position with double taxation,"My brother currently lives in the US, has a pretty good job and is being offered a full time position in Singapore.

I (miraculously, since I have always assumed it was utterly unknowable outside of accountants, tax advisors and the IRS) managed to calculate his net US income (gross - FICA - state) and for any given gross income, seems to line up with the various tax calculators online.

Calculating the local Singapore taxes on his income over there is trivial - they even provide a spreadsheet to do it yourself.

Because he is a US citizen and will also pay US Taxes too, I want to do is calculate the **US** taxes portion of his Singapore salary so we can arrive at a **true** net salary for the new position and compare apples to apples.

Does anyone know how to do this?  

I know for example that there is a US ""tax free"" amount on the Singapore salary of around US$104,100 (varies by year).  I think that means you deduct that from the gross income figure and calculate US tax on what's left.

However, I don't know if you can also deduct the Singapore taxes he owes from the gross amount too and then calculate the US taxes on the result. If not, that seems monumentally unfair - but since where has that mattered to the IRS I suppose. 

BTW - my calculations are assuming no deductions for federal or state except the standard ones, no 401k, IRA etc.  Not entirely accurate for his situation but fine for this purpose.

Advice and insight appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Interest capitalization question,"Howdy,

May 2020 grad here, I’ve been working my first Adult Job™️ since July &amp; making just under 60k salary in a high cost of living area. I use Mint to budget &amp; for the most part don’t spend money on anything other than rent, food, and bills, so I have been able to save about $2k a month. Now that I finally have an emergency fund for ~4 months expenses, I’m hoping to start paying off my student loans. This is the first time in my life that I’ve been financially secure, so I’m hoping to do things the right way and get rid of my debt as soon as possible.

I have about $40k total in ~14 small federal student loans with about $2k in interest set to capitalize next month when my grace period “ends” (but like all other federal borrowers I have loan forbearance &amp; 0% interest until 2021)... 

Considering that I don’t have to make any loan payments until January (and it’s possible the federal loan forbearance may be extended further given the second wave we in the US are about to ride 😎) does it make more sense to pay off the interest before it capitalizes or should I use the money to completely pay off one of the smaller, high interest federal loans? Should I avoid making payments altogether until the forbearance ends? 

Any &amp; all help is appreciated... thanks!",finance

financialindependence,My journey to 50% retirement - COASTFIRE @ 33,"TLDR: 33M, 800k NW, negotiated a half time job (6 months on, 6 months off) to allow for traveling. I'm stoked!

Wanted to share my tale, as I love reading success stories and my journey has some twist and turns. Some details are obfuscated to protect my innocence :) 

### Some Background
2004 - Start in internship (during transition between High School and College) with a large defense contractor. My salary for an intern is great ($18/hr) and I'm given retirement benefits. Immediately start sinking 25% into my 401k.

2008 - Graduate college with a degree in Engineering. The job market sucks, and I take a few months off to backpack around Europe and Africa.

2009 - Come back to my HCOL city and start working as a government contractor. Salary is $55k. I'm fortunate to have the option to live with my folks so I can save up. 

2010 - Switch job/company for a new salary of $63k.

2011 - Internal job change to $68k. 

2012  - Switch job/company to $80k.

2013 - Buy a 1 BR cooperative in in the downtown area. The building is old, and the coop fees are high, but I love the location and the neighborhood. $229k purchase price with 20% down @ 3.75% interest nets me a mortgage at roughly $850/mo. All cooperative fees + additional costs add roughly the same, for a total monthly payment of $1700. 

2014 - Internal job switch. Base salary stays the same, but I get ~$20k in commission, bringing my total to ~$110k. Get married. Luckily decide to keep our finances completely separate, which was a great idea, because...

2015 - Get divorced. I decide to take a sabbatical in Q4; what was intended as 1 year off balloons into 2 years. I spend a year camping through Africa, 6 months in the Indian subcontinent, and 6 months thru-hiking the Appalachian trail. These were the best 2 years of my life. Total cost abroad for the 2 years was around 40k. When I return, I find that my NW is about the same as when I left. 

2018 - Find a new job with a salary of $132k. My two year sabbatical, surprisingly, does not seem to be an issue at all.

2019 - Find a new job with an F500 company. Lower base salary, but new company allows me to do mega backdoor roth, and there are stock incentives. Total cash comp ~135k. Over the next ~18 months, my company 401k is over 100k.

2020 - Get fired; with COVID happening decide to join a family member for a ~3 month camping road trip out west. Think a lot about what I want my life to look like, and how I can build that life. 

### Where I'm at now
* Mortgage down to ~$156k. With appreciation, my place is now worth around ~375k. (Have not refinanced, still at 3.75%. Coop fee is now almost exactly $1k/month, but this is my ""all in"" cost - includes all utilities, taxes, insurance, etc.)
* 205k in Betterment @ 100% stocks in default allocation
* 200k in an IRA @ 100% stocks
* 140k in a Roth IRA @ 100% stocks (I took serious advantage of the megabackdoor roth with my two years available)
* 13k in a solo 401k
* 6k in an HSA (invested)
* ~20k sitting in cash (for now)

### My Living Expenses
I don't do a super good job tracking living expenses, but I live a fairly simple life. My main hobbies are weightlifting, bike riding, and reading. My total household costs are roughly:

* $1850/month housing
* $250/month food
* $30/month cell phone bill
* $30/month transportation (bike share + public transit; no car) 
* $45/month gym membership
* $300/month everything else (hangouts with friends, apartment stuff, clothes, etc.) 

At my current salary, I'm able to comfortably save between $5k-6k a month. 

### Back to the story...
While on the road with my brother (this is over the summer, Jul - Sep 2020), I find two candidate companies and take interviews from hotel rooms in between camping under the stars. I'm trying to figure out how to best balance my love for the outdoors with ""professional"" jobs that allow a couple weeks off, at best. I know I don't want to go back to working full time, but I don't really know how to go about navigating the situation.

I take one final round interview, which goes really well. This is how the conversation goes:

&gt; Boss: OK, cool, the interview is over. That went well. We want to hire you.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: ...Huh, what? You've decided already?
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: Yeah, let's talk about what that looks like, if you want to work here.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: ....Uh...yeah, sure. I mean, the company sounds awesome, but I'm not sure it would work out...
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: Oh, why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Well....I don't think I want to work 12 months a year.
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: OK. Not everyone here works full time. What do you mean, you don't want to work 12 months a year? How often do you want to work?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Uhh....I'm not sure? Maybe 6 months on, 6 months off? (I could feel my sphincter tighten up as I asked for this. I was totally unprepared for this conversation!)
&gt; 
&gt; Boss: ......We can accommodate that. Any other big issues?

I was shocked how easy it was! There was almost no push back, and no negotiations on my desire to work only 6 months a year. Luckily, I work as a consultant where projects are typically 6-9 months long, so this ask isn't as crazy as it sounds. We spent some time negotiating what the offer looked like, considering the unusual circumstances, and we settled at $75/hr 1099. 

### What the Future Looks Like
I'm super excited to have the flexibility to travel six months a year, and I know intellectually I shouldn't need to save any additional money to retire at ~60. I'm also extremely fortunate to work in a field where I love going into work every day. I plan on doing a lot more ""long hikes"" - the Pacific Crest Trail, the Te Aroroa, some hikes in Europe - as well as more backpacking/camping trips. 

In terms of finances, I should bring in 12.5k a month * 6 months = $75k. I haven't run all the numbers, but as a 1099 I should be able to shelter a ton of money from the IRS:

* $19.5k 401k
* $~12k 401k (""company"" match)
* $3.5 k HSA + ~3.6k in health care costs (Bronze Plan as a Single person)
* $6k IRA
* $~12k (20% passthrough as a sole prop)

So self employment tax notwithstanding, my federal and state taxes should be quite low.

### The Elephant in the Room - My Apartment
Every time I run the numbers, paying nearly 2 grand a month for my apartment seems crazy, especially if I only plan in living in it 6 months a year. Unfortunately my HOA rules do *not* allow renters for terms under one year. 

Another option I've considered is selling my apartment, and using the proceeds to either pay all cash for a place in a lower COL (Las Vegas? Charlotte?) and never worry about a mortgage again, or possibly try the digital nomad life for a year or two. 

In the short term, I think I'm OK holding it. When I travel overseas, I usually travel quite cheaply - either camping or staying in hostels, eating street food, walking around a lot, things like that. Even if my annual expenses balloon a bit, I would feel very comfortable pulling ~10k/year (5%) from my Betterment account to cover the delta. The other option, of course, is to work 8 or 9 months a year for a couple years if I'm drawing down my Betterment account too fast. 

### Wrap Up
I've been super fortunate with my life, and I'm really excited to see how the next phase unfolds. Please let me know what you think!

### EDIT - FOLLOW-UP Q+A
*Q: You had help!*

A: Yes, I thought it was so blindingly obvious that I didn't get here alone that I wasn't super explicit about that. I thought the most interesting part about this post was my desire to go half time, and how that unfolded, but I see in retrospect adding in numbers makes everyone wants to run their own calculation.

*Q: What help did you get?*

A: **My grandmother died in early 2019 and left me ~$70k.** This *absolutely* impacted my decision and probably moved my decision up 12-15 months. College was paid for. Leveraging family connections to get my first internship. I also kept about ~10k in cash wedding gifts even after the divorce, but that was mainly out of spite, so let's not dwell on it :)

*Q: The numbers still don't make sense!*

A: Technically that's not a question, but yes, they do. I'm not sure where some of the commenters were getting an ""estimated NW of 300k running the numbers"", but here's a more granular breakdown. These are estimates, I don't have everything tracked super well. 

Years | Yearly Cash Savings | Total Cash Savings | S&amp;P Index Then | Equivalent $ Now | How?
---|---|----|----|----|----
2004 - 2007 | $4k | $16k | ~1300 | ~40k | Interns were eligible for 401 (+match). I took advantage of this, heavily. I also worked during winter break, so it was more than just 3 months/year.
2009 - 2012 | $25k | $100k  | ~1300 | ~250k  | I was living at home, with my folks. Expenses were close to zero. My savings rate some years was probably over 80%. $25k/year is lower than I saved, I excluded the ~12.5k/year * 4 years that went towards my down payment.
2013 - 2015 | $40k | $120k | ~2000 | ~200k | By 2014 I cross into 6 figures, these savings rates are not that impressive
2018 - 2019 | $60k | $120k | ~2800 | ~140k | Megabackdoor Roth, primarily.

Total ""stock equivalent"" savings = 40k + 250k + 200k + 140k + 70k (from grandma) = $700k in stocks. My actual holdings are less. The lion's share of this delta is when I pulled out $40k between 2015 - 2017 to fund my sabbatical, which has a total ""cost"", with gains, of closer to $65. (I also pulled out smaller amounts throughout the years for other trips.) 

*Q: There's an error in your math!*

A: Yeah, probably. It's not intentional.

*Q: It's impossible to buy a house for $230k in a HCOL!""*

A: I agree that it's probably impossible to buy an apartment in 2020 in a HCOL for $230k. I bought in 2013, and I technically didn't buy an apartment, I bought a cooperative. These are similar, but coops are typically more depressed in value than apartments because of restrictions. I also bought in what was a lower income, more racially diverse area, so gentrification (and therefore house prices) hadn't quite caught up. But yeah, I got an absolute steal of a deal, if I do say so myself. 

*Q: So you took 2 years off, spent about $40k, and when you came back, your net worth was about the same? Please, explain the magic of compound interest!*

A: For sure, my dude! I *think* I had about $350k invested in the market about that time. I pulled out about $40k, leaving me $310k. My sabbatical was almost exactly 2 years, Nov 2015 - Nov 2017. In Nov 2015, the S&amp;P index was at ~2020. When I came back in Nov 2017, the S&amp;P was ~2600. That's about a 30% gain. (350 - 40) + 30% &gt; 350. Go, compound interest! (This excludes the ~8k I gained in NW by renters paying down my mortgage for me.)

[Edit #2]
*Q: You don't understand what ""compound interest"" is, you noob!*

A: lol",finance
personalfinance,How does FAFSA work for grad/masters students? (US),"Anyone have insight on how to figure out whether you're eligible for federal student loans for grad school through FAFSA? Or recommended resources to understand FAFSA as it applies to post undergrad? My questions include... 

\- Do they look at income from past years even if income would be zero or minimal after enrolling?  

\- Do retirement accounts count as assets?

\- How much $$ do I need to have in assets before I'd be ineligible for any loans

\- Does it make a difference where I park my savings leading up to enrollment (529 vs brokerage account vs cash, etc)

For added context - I'm thinking of transitioning from a career in engineering to HS education, and one option would be a \~3 semester program to get a masters in education on top of my existing BSE. I might also need to take a couple undergrad math/science courses that weren't included in my engineering coursework. Getting licensed with just my BS is an option, as is saving enough to pay cash for the MA, but at this point I'm investigating all options and just trying to understand what kind of federal aid might be available.

personalfinance,Balancing debt repayment with down payment goals,"Hello PF,

&amp;#x200B;

I have already read the information on windfalls, but would like input on how to balance two goals that the windfall would go toward:

\- Debt depayment

\- Down Payment on a house

&amp;#x200B;

My current **net** income is $3,481.90 a month. This is with insurances and 401k (with matching) already being deducted. There is 2 additional checks for $1,740.95 a year, with one in December for this year.   What I am trying to manage is having cash on hand for a down payment and managing cash flow better.

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant Notes:

\- I am renting until September 2021, as I have a 1 year lease.

\- I am targeting a house in the $200,000-$300,000 range.

\- Costs per month, including estimates on food and gas come to $2,695.06.

|Item|Cost|Balance/Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$975|\-|
|Credit Cards|$275|$3,500 (2671 at 3%, rest 0$)|
|Car Payment|$200.37|$7,600 @ 1.99%|
|Car Insurance|$120|Paid 2x year, set aside monthly|
|Misc Entertainment|$130|(Sirius XM, Patreon, Humble Bundle, streaming, etc)|
|Savings (Automatic)|$200|\-|
|Student Loans (Private)|$218|$5,200 @ 7.25%, $5,700 @ 1.25%|
|Student Loans (Federal)|Student Loan Repayment Benefit|$60,000. If I was paying these it would add $700 a month.|

So I have a $70,000 windfall coming in for life insurance. If I pay off the car I will save $200 a month, I can pay the cards to save another $275 a month. These two would cost about $10,000.  My issue is when it is worth paying something versus what I lose on hand.  If I do not have a down payment when I would move out, I will likely require another 1 year lease somewhere and delay getting equity into housing. Spending $10,000 to remove interest gaining assets would reduce my long term cost, but could also add months of delay to the purchase of a home, again missing the target time.

Am I aiming too high? Give me a reality check and help me make sure I am on the right line. My credit is excellent, the student loans are not hurting me and I qualify for the best interest rates in things, thanks to 3 years working at repairing my credit and learning from the suggestions here on personal finance, thank you all for that.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Changed costs to a table

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for their input. I ran with current costs and did not factor in anything that I could not control or that was a ways off. I currently can do overtime and have a raise in 6 months and 18 months for a decent bump, but the 6 month raise is not a lot and the 18 month raise will come after I would like to get housing looked at.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be paying off the private loans, car, and credit cards. That will get me in to at least $1300 leftover per month. I am happy to finally be in a stable position with some job security. I just needed you all to snap me into things that are pretty obvious and give me a reality check.",finance

personalfinance,I need a 3 year plan,"My wife and I are in our mid 20s, college student and currently living with my parents.

We had been saving money, but decided to dump all of it into paying off debt before we fill out this years FAFSA to see if we could get some grants based off of low EFC. 

Current income is roughly $500(conservative)-$1,000+(generous) in tips a week each as we are both bartenders part time (4,000/mo).

I also get a housing allowance while I go to school from my GI bill of $1350 a month and am still going through the disability evaluation process planning on about $400/mo in disability 

We currently have about $10,000 left in savings

Our monthly bills consist of around $300 in gas and $400 in food. We don’t have any streaming services, health insurance cost(we have insurance), internet, rent or utilities thanks to living at home. My tuition is free and we pay roughly $2,500 a semester for my wife 3 times a year coming out to about $625-700 a month if you include books and supplies. We also have about $10,000 left in student loans from my first degree that are all subsidized federal loans not accruing interest while in school

Income-$5,350-6,500/mo(after tax)
Expenses-$1,400/mo
Savings-$10,000
Debt-$10,000

I am planning on becoming a pilot with a very low starting salary in 2.5 years and my wife is on track to go to med school at that same time. I’d like to best set us up for financial success while she continues school. What should I be doing with this extra $4,000 a month for 30 months? I will likely need the extra money to either put a huge down payment on a house to make for a low mortgage payment or us the VA loan with 0% down and use the money to make the house payments for the years my wife isn’t working. 

Extra information: both our cars are very reliable with less than 70k miles. Would likely be replacing at least one of them in 3 years though. We have no idea where she will be attending medical school. I will have my commercial pilots license holding a job that will likely be low paying to build flight hours.",finance

personalfinance,"23, considering pay cut for career change","I’m a year out of undergrad and have been working in a corporate desk job since graduation. I’ve been looking externally and recently received an offer for a new role.

The pay cut on its own I can live with, because my long term prospects in this new role are way better, but if I accept I will need to relocate to Washington DC (and deal with the stupid high cost of living).

investing,MoneyGram International MGI Second Most Undervalued Stock I've Ever Seen,"The first most undervalued is Fannie Mae FNMA but there are a lot of barriers to that investment actually paying off.

With MGI there are not barriers besides the market valuing the stock correctly which I believe will start to happen soon as it finally shows solid profitability again.  One of the reasons the stock is at a low point in the first place is that it lost a substantial amount of money because it had invested heavily in Mortgage-Backed Securities with its capital float in 2008. That legacy issue is mostly gone.  The second reason it became undervalued is that its heavy debt from those losses caused it to borrow money at high-interest rates which caused it to struggle to show consistent profitability.  

Up until about 4 years ago, it didn't have a strong online presence and the market misinterpreted its losses as being attributable to a lack of profitability in its core business.  But if you look at its business you'll see that it has always been a high margin business.  So the company has made significant investments into developing a digital app that is growing 180 percent a year with millions of downloads and transactions that now represent 20 percent of its total revenue.  Even better the company says that digital transactions are even more profitable than agent to agent transactions.  

Its major traditional competitor Western Union has a market cap 24x the 320 million market cap of MGI.  While it's true that Western Union has 540,000 physical locations vs. MoneyGram International's 380,000 in my opinon both companies are way undervalued in comparison to the valuations that newer companies like square are getting in the market.  Square SQ has a market cap of 88 billion, gross profit of 281 million, and a NET LOSS of -11 million.

Western Union had a NET PROFIT of  **$1.058B** in 2019 and because of covid is on pace to have a net profit of about 800 million for 2020 and its market cap is 1/10th that of Square SQ.  

While it's true that CashApp is number #1 in the app store under finance, Western Union is #20, and MGI is number #51.  

What people are missing with MGI and Western Union as far as valuation is that the combination of a digital app with hundreds of thousands of physical real-world cash pick-up points makes both networks much more valuable than one or the other standing alone.  

One of the major burdens on potential senders of remittances is the need to have to physically travel to a location and fill out forms to be able to send money to someone.  Digital eliminates the time hassle of sending money to someone who needs it and it's usually true that the sender of these types of payments is in a better financial position than the receiver of the remittances.  

What I am trying to say is that there are only two companies in the world with the number of physical locations that Western Union and MoneyGram have.  It would take billions of dollars for a competitor to try to build those networks today.  And I predict that when the dust settles these two companies will be able to generate huge sums of money licensing their use to other FinTecs like Square as well as from their own operations.  

At minimum MGI is worth 5x its current market capitalization of 320 million.  I predict that by the end of 2021 it will be on pace to net 150-300 million per year.",finance

investing,Square $SQ and debit interchange exemption status?,"One of the reasons I've been skeptical of $SQ's rise even post-Covid is that investors seem overly excited by Cash App growth, where the majority of revenue is from \*exempt\* debit interchange fees.

Debit interchange fees were regulated under the Durbin Amendment after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that put a ceiling on the amount of fees issuers can extract from every debit transaction. The amendment excluded ""small"" issuers with less than $10B in assets, which was mainly targeted toward small regional banks and credit unions. Thus, ""small"" issuers that include Square are paid more than double the interchange fees that a mid to large bank get for the same transactions when you use the Cash debit card to pay for things.

Square has been exempt through the growth of Cash App, but if you look at their last 10-Q they are sitting on $7.8B in assets already, and will likely cross $10B in less than a year from now.

For those with a deeper understanding of payments industry:

1. Does anyone know if the $10B asset threshold is for the company as a whole or just customer deposits on Cash app?
2. Has Square mentioned this exemption status and made any projections on which they would lose that status in any report?

personalfinance,"I think buying a house is right for me, any feedback?","Hello, I have been considering buying a house, and I wanted some feedback on if it's appropriate for my financial situation.

Some background. I am 26. I recently left a high paying job in industry to return to graduate school. That time in was in industry gave me enough time to 1) pay off all my student loans and 2) accumulate a sizable amount of savings. I am in a PhD program which means I will be here for about 5 yrs and have a locked in stipend for of $30,000 for the entire time. The program also pays for all of my tuition, so I am not accumulating any student loans.  Pretty much as stable a job security as you could ask. I am currently renting. I had considered buying immediately upon moving here but with pandemic/moving to a new state/yada yada it was more simple for my mental health to not worry about buying when I couldn't come and shop around months in advance (again, pandemic). My lease will be up Aug 2021, currently paying $740/month which is more than ideal, but livable with my savings.

Some more details about what I'd like to do. As I mentioned before I considered buying a house immediately and got far enough in that process to have a number of conversations with a realtor and get two preapprovals. Based on my conversations with the realtor I could qualify for a FHA loan because I am a first time home owner, have high credit (~750) and am now ""low income"". That loan would allow me to put $0 down with no PMI. I was approved for $150,000 which they cited at 3.375% interest, for $0 down and $675 a month. I think I could have gotten approved for more, but I limited it at that because I wanted to make sure it was a payment I could make comfortably without a roommate. Ideally I would get a 2Bd2Ba so I could could find a roommate easily. There are houses in this area that fit that criteria but not a lot. I obviously would spare a bed/bath if it was cheap enough I feel I could live on my own. Its a college town so there's a certain amount of stability with people around looking to rent, and a certain amount of security in people being interested when it comes time for me to sell.

Like I said, I could buy with $0 down and no PMI, I have enough saved that I feel comfortable putting about 15% down, obviously that would lower the monthly payment and the total amount of interest owed. It would also leave me with about $10k in savings, but getting rid of that much money just makes me a little nervous. I had not saved the money with the intention of making a down payment, it had been a ""make grad school livable"" fund, but it doesn't seem like a bad use of it.

I would be buying the house on my own. I am single and have no interest in starting a family. I currently am two months into a new car payment plan (didn't need a car previously, this is my first car). That is $386/month, 0% interest over 60 months.

I like the idea of owning, it honestly seems more affordable for me to get the space I'd like. I understand there are hidden costs, but that's why I intend to find a roommate, essentially all the money from them would go into the fund household maintenance, with enough safety for me to not be underwater if I don't have a roommate for a few months/a year. 

My question are:
1. Does this seem reasonable money-wise?
2. With my lease now I'd only be guaranteed to live there for 4 years. Is that too little time to make all the moving-cost worth it, or will it be okay with the low interest rates out there right now? It's possible I'd stay longer, but I don't have a strong desire to right now.
3. Other than the lower amount paid monthly and on total interest is there a benefit to putting more money down? Like, would it look more attractive to a seller?
4. Should I try to get pre-approval for a larger loan if I ask again? The lender seemed surprised I went for so little (I actually upped it an extra $10k). I assume this would give be a bit of extra flexibility in shopping, but are there any downsides if I buy for something cheaper than what I was approved for?

Mahimna motivates a third consensus property, transaction order-fairness, to rectify the ordering problem. He introduces a new class of consensus protocols that can achieve it in addition to the usual consistency and liveness properties. Finally, he comments on how order-fairness has the potential to make decentralized finance more intrinsically fair, especially to ordinary users.

personalfinance,Refinancing my house: cash out or reduce interest?,"I'm considering refinancing my house while the rate is low, and I have a few years of decent equity built up. I'm weighing two options:

1) cashing out a large enough amount to pay off my student loan debt, which is at 0% interest until Jan 2021, but will then revert to the original interest rates that range from 4.5% to 7%. Refinancing rates are as low as 2.9% right now. 
2) Switching from a 30 year loan to a 20 year loan and reducing the amount of interest I'll owe in total. My interest rate would also drop from 5.25% to 2.9%.

I'd love to pay down my school loans and have that weight lifted off my shoulders for good. However, I don't foresee living in this house for 20 more years (hope not, anyway). I'd like to upgrade in the next couple of years.

Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Getting $55K in inheritance. Need advice on best way to roll it into my retirement contributions.,"I don't really need the money right now. But it would be nice to pull it out at some point for maybe A) Down payment on next house or B) future business startup.

personalfinance,Buy outright or offset mortgage pro's and con's,"Hello,

My wife and I have saved excessively and are now looking to buy a home, and we could potentially buy a home outright with our savings (leaving not a lot behind). Recently a colleague stated that my money would be 'working harder' for me in an offset mortgage. I get the logic with regards to the interest rates for the mortgage being more than interest on savings but I am assuming there will be fee's etc. Also can you 100% offset a mortgage?

Anyway after peoples thoughts and experiences, words of wisdom. I want to have a good idea in my head before I see a financial planner for advice. If it helps I am in Australia.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,I recently looked into refinancing my mortgage. I'm currently 5 years into a 30 year fixed rate with a 3.875% interest rate. I could refinance to 2.875%. This would save me $50 a month on my payment. Is this even worth it? Should I wait for something better in a year or two? I do plan on staying in the home indefinitely.,finance
personalfinance,Stop maxing out Roth IRA to get out of debt quicker?,"Good Evening, quick question.  Right now me and my wife are both 23 years old have about $30000 worth of debt currently on cars and student loans with an average interest rate between all of them around 5%. We will not be getting in to more debt. With what we make right now we have about $1000 left over at the end of the month. Both our incomes will go up within the next year and we plan on keeping our expenses the same. My goal is to get debt free in less than 3 years. The thing is that with that $1000, it does not include the 250$ a week that goes towards other savings like e fund and maxing out my Roth IRA. My question is should we stop the other savings temporarily to get out of debt ASAP or continue that savings and get out of debt not as quickly and continue savings and investing",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Tax Deduction vs. Paying Partial Mortgage Down,"Currently have a 30-year fixed mortgage in a HCOL area (Los Angeles County) of approximately $575,000 at 2.875%. As this is considered a high-balance loan (&gt;$510,000), I'm wondering if we should pay off the \~$65,000 so that we may qualify for a better mortgage rate to refi once more before building a plan to pay off early (20-25 years vs. 30 years).

The mortgage broker we have worked with to refi has advised against it as they mentioned that the tax deductions of the mortgage deduction would be significant (as opposed to paying off the $65,000), but I was hoping to get a more detailed financial breakdown to better understand the savings of paying off the $65K vs. the mortgage tax deduction savings. 

I am at the cusp of the 24% to 32% Federal Income Tax bracket if this is helpful for the calculations. Appreciate the help and insight in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Sharing title of house when not married,"long story short.

6 yer later got divorced

back together again

looking into refinancing the house together and potentially putting my name on the deed as well.

&amp;#x200B;

should we wait until we are getting remarried ?

my question is more en regards to complexity and legality in regards to taxes.

We really want to take advantage of the current low interest rate. but we are waiting a month or so so my apartment is fully out of the picture

Both our income is pretty stable 

the refinance is solely to lower TCO not for lowering monthly  pay",finance
personalfinance,Mortage Ownership Question,"I am a single individual (W-2 employee) at the cusp of the 24% and 32% Federal Income Tax bracket that owns a single family residence with my parents (married filing jointly - both sole props). 

My parents bought this house 2-3 years ago, but needed to use my income/financials as their businesses were operating at a loss at the time of purchase.

We have since refinanced where I became the primary owner, with my dad as a co-owner on the deed and title, but using solely my income/financial status. 

I am in the market to purchase a home, but as we are in a HCOL, the mortgage rate differences (between an investment prop vs. primary residence) is something worth noting. To qualify for a second home, I would have to purchase a home &gt; 50 miles from our current primary residence, which is not something I am looking for at this time.

Since the time of the initial home purchase, my parents' tax filing and overall financial status has become more stable, enabling them to be sufficient in being the sole owners of this current home. 

Are there any pros/cons to making a transfer of ownership to my parents, and removing my name from the mortgage? 

My parents are in the 24% income tax bracket for MFJ (married filing jointly), and wondering if there are tax implications that may be favorable to keep vs. transferring ownership.

retirement,Interest rate,"What is everyone thinking a good average interest rate percentage (on stocks) is acceptable for the next 30 year? 

I'm thinking conservatively 4%.",finance
personalfinance,Advice needed: Should I apply for a lower interest bank loan and pay off my high interest credit cards?,"So I have 2 credit cards that carry a 26% interest rate. One is through my bank and has been almost maxed out for years. The other I use for dental (I don't have insurance) and vet needs. It is almost maxed out now. Combined the debt is a little less than $5k. My credit score is in the low 600's.

I ask for several reasons- I  make barely enough to cover my monthly costs while splitting bills with 3 roommates. I just graduated so I'm in the process of changing that. I don't have excess income to be able to put toward the principle. I barely survive making the minimum payments (which barely touches the principle at all). 

The other issue is I have to get some extensive dental work done ASAP that is going to go right back on that high interest card. Before the end of this year alone, I will be spending upwards of $3k on dental health. I do have a dental discount plan that helps, but I don't have the money to pay for it outright, so the card has been a godsend. I don't even have savings.

**TLDR;     I'm not sure what I could qualify for, but I know I could probably get a $5k loan with a lower interest rate than 26%! Would this be a good idea? If not, what would you suggest?**

Within a year it would get us out of being negative on what we owe vs what it’s worth. It also has the next highest interest rate. From what I calculated, it should also take about a hear and a half off the length of the loan. If we put that $340 toward the car, it would take about 2 years off the life of the loan.

personalfinance,3 years to refinance 2 mortgage loans,"Hi, Curious to know what others would do to position themselves in 3 years to refinance two mortgage loans.   
Basically, we are buying a house with equity in parents' property. Not ideal but it's what's happening.

80% of the property purchase price will be in our name and 20%plus fees (aka the deposit) will be from a mortgage loan on their home and in their names but we will pay it for them.

The 20% loan has a lower interest rate and the 80% loan has a higher interest rate. I'd like to refinance in 3 years so that they no longer have a mortgage on their property and we can get a lower interest rate also.  

The aim is to get 10% equity in 3 years to refinance so we can pay out the 20% loan. I have crunched the numbers and can get to 7% with an extra $105 per week, not including any market value fluctuations or adding sweat equity. Hoping to save the extra 3% in cash savings sitting in the offset account which will be roughly $20k by the end of the 3 years. 

My gut says to put the money on the loan that's linked to the property we are buying because that chips away at the principle but the higher interest rate on this loan has me second-guessing this.",finance

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin is Superior to Gold,"There is a constant war being fought between goldbugs, like Peter Schiff, and Bitcoin enthusiasts so I decided to make an outline, with links, comparing and contrasting gold and Bitcoin.  I made this in November of 2019 (thus the information therein is based on figures from that time) but, being scatter brained, neglected to post this for the Bitcoin community to see.  The yardsticks I used to compare the two assets included the following: shipping/transactions costs,  storage costs,  censorship factor,  settlement time,  stock to flow,  blockchain vs clearing house,  validation, etc.  I will also touch on Roosevelt's gold confiscation executive order in 1933, transporting gold during the Spanish Civil War in 1936, and the hypothetical cost for Venezuela to repatriate its gold more recently.

I will provide a brief summary first then follow that with the outline I made.  This information can be used as a tool for the Bitcoin community to combat some of the silly rhetoric coming from goldbugs such as Peter Schiff and James Rickards.  I would like to make it clear, however, that I am not against gold and think that it performed its role as money very well in a technologically inferior era, namely Victorian times but I think Bitcoin performs the functions of money better than gold does in the current environment.

I have been looking to make a contribution to the Bitcoin community and I hope this is a useful and educational tool for everyone who reads this.

**Summary:**

*Shipping/transaction costs*: 100 ounces of gold could be shipped for 315 dollars; the comparable dollar value in Bitcoin could be sent for 35 dollars using a non-segwit address.  Using historical precendent, it would cost an estimated $32,997,989 to transport $1 billion in gold using the 3.3% fee that the Soviets charged the Spaniards in 1936; a $1 billion Bitcoin transaction moved for $690 last year by comparison.  Please note that the only historic example we can provide for moving enormous sums of gold was when the government of Spain transported gold to Moscow during the Spanish Civil War in 1936.  More information on this topic will be found in the notes section.

*Storage costs*:  100 ounces of gold would require $451 per year to custody while the equivalent value of Bitcoin in dollar terms could be stored for the cost of a Ledger Nano S, $59.99.   $1 billion USD value of gold would cost $2,900,000 per year while an Armory set up that is more secure would run you the cost of a laptop, $200-300.

*Censorship factor*:  Gold must pass through a 3rd party whenever it is shipped, whether for a transaction or for personal transportation. Gold will typically have to be declared and a customs duty may be imposed when crossing international borders.   The key take-away is gatekeepers (customs) can halt movement of gold thus making transactions difficult.  $46,000 of gold was seized in India despite the smugglers hiding it in their rectums.

*Settlement time*:  Shipping gold based on 100 ounces takes anywhere from 3-10 days while Bitcoin transactions clear in roughly 10 minutes depending on network congestion and fee size.

*Historic confiscation*: Franklin Roosevelt confiscated and debased the paper value of gold in 1933 with Executive Order 6102.  Since gold is physical in nature and value dense, it is often stored in custodial vaults like banks and so forth which act as a honeypot for rapacious governments.

*Stock to flow*: [Plan B's](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD) stock to flow model has become a favorite on twitter.  Stock to flow measures the relationship between the total stock of an asset against the amount that is produced in a given year.  Currently gold still has the highest value at 62 while Bitcoin sits at 50 in 2nd place.  Bitcoin will overtake gold in 2024 after the next halving.

*Blockchain vs clearing house*: gold payments historically passed through a 3rd party (clearinghouse) in order to be validated while Bitcoin transactions can be self validated through the use of a node.

Key Takeaway from above- Bitcoin is vastly superior to gold in terms of cost, speed, and censorship resistance.  One could theoretically carry around an enormous sum of Bitcoin on a cold card while the equivalent dollar value of gold would require a wheelbarrow...and create an enormous target on the back of the transporter.  With the exception of the stock to flow ratio (which will flip in Bitcoin's favor soon), Bitcoin is superior to gold by all metrics covered.

*Breaking down Venezuela conundrum*; [http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/08/23/how-to-get-12-billion-of-gold-to-venezuela/](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/08/23/how-to-get-12-billion-of-gold-to-venezuela/)

“The last (and only) known case of this kind of quantity of gold being transported across state lines took place almost exactly 75 years ago, in 1936, when the government of Spain removed 560 tons of gold from Madrid to Moscow as the armies of Francisco Franco approached. Most of the gold was exchanged for Russian weaponry, with the Soviet Union keeping 2.1% of the funds in the form of commissions and brokerage, and an additional 1.2% in the form of transport, deposit, melting, and refining expenses.”

“Venezuela would need to transport the gold in several trips, traders said, since the high value of gold means it would be impossible to insure a single aircraft carrying 211 tonnes. It could take about 40 shipments to move the gold back to Caracas, traders estimated. “It’s going to be quite a task. Logistically, I’m not sure if the central bank realises the magnitude of the task ahead of them,” said one senior gold banker.”

“So maybe Chávez intends to take matters into his own hands, and just sail the booty back to Venezuela on one of his own naval ships. Again, the theft risk is obvious — seamen can be greedy too — and this time there would be no insurance. Chávez is pretty crazy, but I don’t think he’d risk $12 billion that way.”

“Which leaves one final alternative. Gold is fungible, and people are actually willing to pay a premium to buy gold which is sitting in the Bank of England’s ultra-secure vaults. So why bother transporting that gold at all? Venezuela could enter into an intercontinental repo transaction, where it sells its gold in the Bank of England to some counterparty, and then promises to buy it all back at a modest discount, on condition that it’s physically delivered to the Venezuelan central bank in Caracas. It would then be up to the counterparty to work out how to get 211 tons of gold to Caracas by a certain date. That gold could be sourced anywhere in the world, and transported in any conceivable manner — being much less predictable and transparent, those shipments would also be much harder to hijack. How much of a discount would a counterparty require to enter into this kind of transaction? Much more than 3.3%, is my guess. And again, it’s not entirely clear who would even be willing to entertain the idea. Glencore, perhaps?”

“But here’s one last idea: why doesn’t Chávez crowdsource the problem? He could simply open a gold window at the Banco Central de Venezuela, where anybody at all could deliver standard gold bars. In return, the central bank would transfer to that person an equal number of gold bars in the custody of the Bank of England, plus a modest bounty of say 2% — that’s over $15,000 per 400-ounce bar, at current rates.  It would take a little while, but eventually the gold would start trickling in: if you’re willing to pay a constant premium of 2% over the market price for a good, you can be sure that the good in question will ultimately find its way to your door. And the 2% cost of acquiring all that gold would surely be much lower than the cost of insuring and shipping it from England. It would be an elegant market-based solution to an artificial and ideologically-driven problem; I daresay Chávez might even chuckle at the irony of it. He’d just need to watch out for a rise in Andean banditry, as thieves tried to steal the bars on their disparate journeys into Venezuela.”",cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

**Powell: Fed open to private sector collaboration in possible digital dollar** 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.

“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.

Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

“I actually do think this is one of those issues where it's more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first,” Powell said.

Powell pointed to the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, noting that the majority of the $2 trillion Federal Reserve notes in circulation are held outside of the country.

Powell emphasized that any possible digital dollar would serve as a “complement” to physical cash — not a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Real-time payments**

The U.S. finds itself lagging other countries on payments infrastructure. The Bank of Mexico last year launched a Cobro Digital (CoDi) system that allows users and merchants to transact in digital pesos using QR codes. The People’s Bank of China recently began user testing a digital renminbi, which would allow transactions even without connection to the internet.

Although the Fed is not committing to launching its own digital currency, the Fed is charging ahead with its efforts to bring real-time payments among financial intermediaries. Services like Venmo and Cash App offer quick peer-to-peer payments, but check clearing still takes days for funds to arrive at one’s checking account because of aged infrastructure connecting the nation’s banks.

The Fed hopes to stand up a FedNow system to allow 24/7 real-time payments by 2023 or 2024. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, one of the leaders on the initiative, said the project is “on track” with that timeline.

Although many central banks are researching digital currencies, only about 10% say they will actually issue one of their own in the short-term, according to the Bank of International Settlements.",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford a mortgage? [26] [MA],"Hey PF thanks for the advice as always!

I am currently living alone, renting an apartment in Brighton, MA at 1550 a month. Heat and hot water are included. My other bills include Elec + internet + phone + groceries + health= ~$1000/month. I have zero debt, pay off a monthly credit card bill ~$250/month, and have a credit score above 730+. 

My lease ends in August 2021, so this is mostly a thought exercise/feasibility study.

I do not have a car, I use public transit, which is paid for by employer. (45 min commute) This would also be my first home/first time buyer status.

My gross annual income is 58909, and I put away 5% for retirement, with a match from my employer. I work in the federal government and pay increases are known well in advance. Come Nov-2021 my pay should increase to ~$71k.

I put in 1300 annually to my FSA. (~50 bi-weekly)

Altogether I have about 33k saved up. (Including emergency fund) (not FSA)

My questions are:
1) is it better for me to continue renting after my lease is up? Aug-2021

2) if buying a house is possible, how much home can I afford? And when?

My assumption is that I should rent until 2022, save up more money, and apply for a mortgage when I have a larger down payment and larger monthly income to show?

personalfinance,Joint Land Purchase Question,"Hi,

New to Reddit and this sub, so I apologize if this is the wrong forum (and if so, would appreciate a nudge in the appropriate direction).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question about how to best structure and execute a land purchase with some relatives.  There run-down goes roughly like this:

There are four interested parties (seven people, but the married couples count as one for these purposes):  me and my wife; wife's sister and sister's husband; wife's brother; a cousin and his spouse.  We want to purchase a large undeveloped tract of land, then divvy it up amongst the four of us so that, down the line, we can each build a house on our purchase (live near each other with a ton of space, etc.).  

We anticipate this to be a rather long-term project because most of us have enough money and income for the land but planning, the cost of construction, job relocation, etc., means this will be a 5-10 year project.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we're trying to sort out the best way to go about it.  My instinct says the following:

1)  Form a limited liability entity before the purchase;

2)  Each party contributes funds (25% of the purchase price, whatever that turns out to be);

3)  Entity purchases the land;

4)  In writing, divide the land into four portions of roughly equal value (based on whatever criteria we settle on, preference of land, size, etc.);

5) When each party determines they are ready to start building or move in or whatever, the entity terminates their interest and distributes that party's portion of the land as a liquidating distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

The questions that immediately come to mind are as follows:

1)  Does this structure make sense, or am I overlooking something important?

2)  What type of entity is usually used for such an arrangement?  (This would be in Virginia).  I'm thinking an LLC, but not certain.

3)  Will creating the LLC (or whatever) impact our ability to obtain financing?  What about the available interest rate?

4)  Tax consequences of the initial distribution?  I believe it would only be the increase in value of the 25% land interest over the initial purchase price.

5)  What sort of filing requirements would the entity have with the state and federal governments?  

6)  Anything I'm not thinking of?

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!  Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,What Do The Central Bankers Have Planned?,"What I have [here](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2020/wp20-19.pdf) is the future.

A Report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, released just four months ago.

The topic?

Central Bank Digital Currency.

The implications for society?

**Colossal.**

&amp;#x200B;

The Abstract of the paper outlines what we are going to discuss.

*""The introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) allows the central bank to engage in large-scale intermediation by competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits.*

***...the central bank arises as a deposit monopolist, attracting all deposits away from the commercial banking sector***.""

&amp;#x200B;

What does this mean in practical terms?

Well, what *is* a Central Bank Digital Currency?

**Well, it is essentially a current account at the Central Bank.**

When they say ""*competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits*"", it means the Central Banks are going to streamroll the Commercial Banks.

&amp;#x200B;

This is again emphasised in the introduction of the paper:

""*Besides its potential role in eliminating physical cash, a CBDC will allow the central bank to engage in large-scale intermediation by competing with private financial intermediaries for deposits (and, likely engaging in some form of lending of those deposits).*

***In other words, a CBDC amounts to giving consumers the possibility of holding a bank account with the central bank directly***.""

&amp;#x200B;

Academic economists are being used as a propaganda tool to push the narrative of the Central Banks and their wider Agenda.

When people hear the word ""banker"", they often think about the excesses of Wall Street and firms like Goldman Sachs.

They don't split it up into Investment Banking, Commercial Banking and Central Banking.

They think about the movies they watched and how it was the *investment bankers* who caused the Great Recession in 2008.

Complex jargon like Mortgage Backed Securities and Collateralised Debt Obligations.

**Although there were some Investment Bankers worthy of jail time in that particular crisis, in reality it was the Fed, the** **Central Bankers, who facilitated the 2008 recession.**

It is the Central Bankers who are creating these boom/bust cycles, and they are already more powerful than ever before.

&amp;#x200B;

But, we are missing a key piece.

Incentive drives human behaviour.

**If you are trying to promote a change of this magnitude, you need an incentive.**

But you also need a *catalyst* \- you need people to be desperate and psychologically worn down.

I'm not sure what that *catalyst* could be, of course...

But what is the incentive?

Well, probably some form of Universal Basic Income - but this short term carrot comes with a long term stick.

We are witnessing the erosion of free speech, and now financial privacy will be tied into that structure.

Banking,"Can Failing Banks Seize Depositor's Cash with a ""BAIL IN"" ? Dodd Frank Act","I stumbled on a youtube video (encouraging to buy gold) about how the Dodd Frank Act, Title 2, makes it possible for failing banks (that are worth $150 billion or more in assets) to ""take"" money from depositors and convert it to shareholder stock in the bank (that is worthless at that point). Then, they use your money to pay a list of priorities (think it's listed in the Order of Liquidity in Dodd Frank) and YOU/depositor are LAST! (I've heard that this process happens BEFORE FDIC insurance would cover up to $250K.) If these banks are considered too big too fail, it looks like the D.F. Act shifts from the Fed BAILING them OUT to depositors BAILING IN and essentially losing their savings. What are those with money in savings suppose to do to safeguard it? How realistic is this BAIL IN given that an economic down turn is coming? Which banks are more safe? Is this misinformation or exaggerated? I do not understand if the concern is realistic or paranoia. Plus, if it is a possibility, why aren't there more discussions about it?

[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2012/sdn1203.pdf](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0trX2pmckFiVnkxLXlLanJ4dmFlRjdLQ2tmd3xBQ3Jtc0tuTE5ydXp6RVJ2MUhwb2ozRVBZY3A4UFdhQjVVY1hoS2M2dW96SVZFM3g0MEZ4bHBSdXk2djRJOTl6R1RqRW56VUNQZ0JIRE0yREhHNjN5QXQ1NEFhT3Rpakx5b2FJU2tQeVpEb3A0NDRPQy12Y3hnaw%3D%3D&amp;event=comments&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2Fexternal%2Fpubs%2Fft%2Fsdn%2F2012%2Fsdn1203.pdf&amp;stzid=UgxyJ4w6fUy6AnqtBbJ4AaABAg) Apparently, this is the paper from which the idea stemmed and has influenced other countries that have added bail in. USA added this concept to 2010 Dodd Frank. Trump reformed some of Dodd Frank in 2017, but it does not seem that the BAIL IN was eliminated.

Do I get the loan first then go to the dealership and try to get the vehicle?

How close to buying the vehicle should I get the loan?

In terms of price action this could lead to a significant increase in the price of BTC and other crypto assets, but do we want institutional investment from a fundamental point of view?

Why was BTC created?

Satoshi Nakamoto created BTC to counter the fractional reserve banking system which creates money out of thin air, resulting in a weakened currency over time (inflation). Bitcoin and Blockchain are created in such a way that everyone can be their own bank, away from the government and third parties, due to the decentralized P2P network. Satoshi saw that during the financial crisis of [2008](https://www.thebalance.com/2008-financial-crisis-3305679) banks could not be trusted, and acted on that.

12 years forward we see these financial institutions getting involved in BTC, buying up large sums of BTC and offering financial instruments to their clients like derivates or shares like [Grayscale](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/). This creates a third party as transactions now run through these institutions. This goes against the fundamentals of BTC of 'cutting out the middle man'. Furthermore, it creates large entities or 'whales' of institutions who can manipulate the price in their favor by buying or selling large portions of BTC. They have easy access through cheap funds, because for example the Fed Funds [Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INTDSRUSM193N) has been extremely low for quite some time.

12 years ago the battle against big financial corporations and their unethical way of doing business has started, and it seems like they're up for round 2.",cryptocurrency

I've been having some problems with a few of my plants the last month or so, at first the leaves were just turning a sickly yellow/light green color which I attributed to a fertilizer I tried (Plant Rage 0-0-8) in addition to the AeroGarden plant food I've been feeding them hydroponically. I only fed them the plant rage for about 2 days before I started to notice negative effects, but it seems like I can't correct them now.

I have tried a few things; I was thinking the discoloration and the shriveled new growth might be amended with a Cal-Mag supplement since I read that a sudden increase of potassium could create a magnesium deficiency. I added some Future Harvest Calnesium (0-0-2) to my mix for a few days After I didn't notice any change, I tried a foliar spray I made with a 1/4 tbps of Epsom Salt to 1L of water. Still no change. Should I be doing longer courses of these things?

Might be worth mentioning that at one point during this whole debacle I flushed all my plants with H2O2 to deal with a thrip problem (I was noticing lots of them in the bottoms of my double cups). I haven't seen any movement since, but I know they can lead to the weird growth and shriveled leaves sometimes. I've also added diatomaceous earth to most of my plants at this point.

personalfinance,Saving for retirement vs. Getting ahead on med school tuition,"My husband just got admitted to medical school which has been his longtime dream and we’re pretty excited. When planning financially up until now we had no idea if he would get in, where, or how much tuition would cost. But now we know his tuition will round up to $20,000/year, for a total of $80,000. No clue about financial aid and I can’t get reliable information on interest rates. I had always assumed we would have to just take on debt and that it wouldn’t be too bad considering we’re both currently debt free and medical school tends to be a good investment, with the median salary for a physician being between $232K and $511K depending on the specialty (after residency).

However, we have about $24,000 in short term savings spread out between various brokerage accounts, CDs, savings account, and if I’m being honest, just sitting in checking accounts. We’re used to living just fine on only my salary ($58K) as he wasn’t working much due to the pandemic. But he recently got a new job for $40K/year, meaning we could put whatever he makes between now and when the semester starts next year (something like $20-25K) straight into savings. That, combined with what we already have saved could let us pay for at least a year or two of his school out of pocket. 

But for long term savings, I just have about $6,600 in a Roth IRA. I maxed it out once in college and only recently was able to start contributing again. I’ve heard people like Dave Ramsay say parents should focus on retirement before they start saving for their kids’ college. Now I think a lot of this has to do with his opposition in general to student loan debt and spending a lot of money on a degree, but I wonder if he’s onto something. When it comes to retirement, time is money. We’re in our mid/late twenties, so I know that our yield will be so much greater if we really push those long term savings ASAP. But the way I was raised, there’s also something appealing about having as little debt as possible.

TLDR: Dump ~$40k into retirement account(s) or into med school tuition over the next 2 years?",finance

Forex,What on earth is going on with FX trading?,"Hi All,

To preface this I just want to say that I am an educated Econ major with general knowledge of market trends, theory, etc. In late March, I was able to navigate my way through market turmoil and today am profiting off of my investments. I say this purely to give background on my mindset and knowledge level.

FX trading is a new to me, but with extra time at home I decided to experiment if for nothing else than to gain experience. What has shocked me, however, is how much misinformation and outright scams exist in this (general FX, not necessarily this page) community. I am so taken back by this that I am skeptical and untrusting of nearly every educational tool I come across. 

My question is, and I apologize if this has been asked many times before, how did you guys enter this market? Are there any sites that you recommend to learn principles and strategies? I am not looking to be spoon fed information, but rather to just understand more about this endeavor so that I can make educated decisions. As I mentioned earlier, nearly everything I come across really rubs me the wrong way as they are often full of unrealistic claims of profit. I can't help but feel out of my depth here with regards to who to trust and what to use. Thank you in advance for any help, and I wish you all health and success during these strange times.",finance

devops,Does anyone else find Azure’s portal abysmal?,"A few months ago, I decided to try Azure out because I had some experience with AWS and just wanted to see if the slightly lower prices for *seemingly* similar resources were worth it.

I didn’t have an issue with the resources, however, I seemed to always have major issues with the portal itself. I remember one night where literally nothing was loading, I couldn’t access resources, I couldn’t launch, stop, delete, restart or manage them at all. I didn’t even bother making a support request because I was just fed up. Luckily, this was for a personal project and not a contractual one.

After that, I pretty much gave up on Azure because I was so turned off by that experience. I can only imagine how someone who works with Azure for their job would feel if they needed to access something in a portal and were under tight deadlines and had to deal with that crap.

I’m okay with dealing with maybe a few minutes of downtime, but it was like an hour or two.

Finally, today, after I cancelled my subscriptions in mid-September. I got an email about an unpaid invoice for the services used for the earlier part of September. So I log on and check the bill, which I have to jump through hoops of “Cost Management / Billing” dashboards to find. Click “Pay Now”, try to select a Payment method and get an error, “An error has occurred.”, this was happening for about 3 hours while I was refreshing trying to get the payment methods to appear. Finally, they randomly appeared and I was able to make the payment and be done with Azure for good.

I don’t know if this is just my experience, but I’ve found the portal to be extremely unreliable and inconsistent.

You would think that, if anything, they’d make the part of the portal that allows them to get paid a solid and well tested component, but it’s definitely not.

https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/fiscal-cliffication-continues-as

From the post (You should just read it, its not that long)

&gt;Overall sales didn’t instantly fall off after expiration, because the supplementary unemployment benefits were so large that they facilitated many receiving unemployment actually accumulating savings. There were also the 300 dollar FEMA payments that Trump authorized by executive order. These ran out in various states throughout September. The New York Times had some good reporting on a study based on JP Morgan bank accounts that showed the median checking account of those receiving direct deposits of unemployment benefits rose significantly early on, and then fell off significantly in August. The fall off in savings is probably less dramatic for the under- and unbanked receiving prepaid debit card balances or checks, with consequently larger drop-offs in spending when supplementary payments expired. A New York Federal Reserve survey from June showed similar results for the early part of the pandemic.

&gt;A similar story is told in the aggregate data. The saving rate peak coincided with the beginning of the stimulus check payments and supplemental unemployment benefits. As the stimulus checks were exhausted, the saving rate fell. It’s not possible to get a complete picture yet: we don’t have data for September, which will likely show larger declines. With the emergency FEMA payments declining, the desperation that has already racked millions of families is spreading — and so is the virus.


I am interested to see the September data on savings rate. 

&gt;With each passing day, it becomes increasingly likely that there will not be any bill passed before the election in two weeks. 

&gt;This would be an unqualified disaster. Without any passed legislation before the election, Democrats lose all leverage to push Senate Republicans to the table and the Trump administration will lose all interest in passing anything- especially if Trump loses.",finance

personalfinance,Dave Ramsey’s Baby Steps - skipped Step 2. What’s the right move now?,"I recently discovered Dave Ramsey’s 7 baby steps to financial freedom and have been listening to his podcast. Enjoying it and wondering what his advice would be in my situation. 

The first 4 steps are:

Baby Step 1: Save 1K = Done
Baby Step 2: Pay off all debt except house - Skipped.
Baby Step 3: Save 3-6 Months Expenses = Done
Baby Step 4: Save 15% of income for retirement - saving about 10%. 

A summary of my wife and I’s financial situation:

Age: 33
Children: A two-year old, with a 2nd on the way. 
Student Debt: 50K (5% interest rate)
Car Loan: 8K (5% interest rate)
Retirement Accounts/Investments: 55K
Savings: 20K
Mortgage: 450K on a 550K estimated home value.

So we have 3 months savings (step 3) and skipped step 2. If we liquidated our retirement accounts and used our savings, we could eliminate our debt (except house) but not sure that is the right move. I am currently taking advantage of my employers 401K match but not sure if I should stop contributing in the short term to be able to pay off debt faster. 

I would like to pay off the debt, but liquidating retirement accounts seems like a bad idea because we’ll pay penalties. And I don’t want to deplete our savings too much because I’d like to have cash on hand in case of an emergency. I want to complete baby step 2 and get out of debt but just not sure it’s wise at this time.

gaming,"Dear gaming companies, stop forcing us to use reddit for replacements to forums. A RANT","I don't know if a rant is allowed on here, but I'll label it as one. To put it simply, I'm fed up with companies forcing us to use reddit and deleting their forums and forcing us to use reddit. Reddit is not forums and it doesn't work as one. Bug reporting was easier in the forums and it had multiple different posts allowing us to explain the bugs, and people would reply that the same situation would be happening to them. More people would respond and also say they're dealing with the same bugs to the point it gets a game dev's attention. This doesn't work on reddit. Just posting it and saying the bug, most of the time it doesn't really get fixed, and in fact, the smaller and less mentioned issues will NEVER get fixed. This has been an issue with forums, but it's even worse in reddit because not everyone is going to scroll down for these issues. 

It's even more apparent with when Riot did this with League of Legends. Server goes down? Not allowed to post about it it because it's against the forum's rules. You also can't talk about issues or bugs because it gets deleted also. You can't do anything against reddit rules, even if those rules are broken. So, if an issue happens, too bad, just got to wait till they notice it, which could take hours or days, weeks even. At least with the forum people could do much more than just talk about bugs. They could talk about their new self-created champion or fan-made lore with current existing ones. You're not allowed to do that anymore. To this day I've seen more and more companies abandon forums for reddit. Stop it. It doesn't work. Reddit isn't for that. I use reddit for memes, awesome videos, and confusing glitches, not talk about bugs. I use forums for that. Even more so, forums had more to offer than reddit does.

personalfinance,My position salary got public and I’m probably underpaid,"My company is recruiting for some time now and recently they decided to openly post online the salary numbers for the position they’re trying to fill on one of the job boards. This got to my attention since one of my colleagues from my previous company came across it and got interested, so knowing I currently work there he reached out to me asking how things are going there, how do I like it there, etc, sharing the job ad as well.

While I generally like the company and happy to recommend it anyway, I also found out that my salary is barely touching the bottom range of the numbers they’re advertising in the ad. What is worse, while I’m having the same position as the one in the ad I’m doing significantly more - I’m senior software engineer but we have a very flat structure and I’m effectively sharing some responsibilities with our CTO.

To give the full background - this is a tech startup during a transition phase into something more mature (we’re also after a big series A investing round recently). I’m there for 2 years now, one of the first devs in our team, top or one of top performing software engineers here (according to all mid and end year reviews in a row since I joined), having big impact on the product and processes, mentoring other devs, speaking with clients and overall doing well in my opinion in general. 

What is interesting is that 3 weeks earlier my boss reached out to me out of nowhere proposing a raise I once asked for but was declined at the time. The raise proposal came before they made the salary public in the ad (but they were actively looking for people back then already). Before the raise (and still now) I was getting significantly less (-15%) than the bottom range of their public offer. After the raise is effective (next month) I will still barely touch the bottom range of the salary given in their ad.

Normally I would be happy about the raise I’m getting (+15%) but now it seems like there a lot left on the table (the public offer is up to +45% of what I’m making now and it’s for a senior dev position, not team lead or architect). I don’t know how should I approach this, and I’m pretty bad at salary conversations to be honest. I also suspect they may be making this ad offer overly high and over the market since we are quite under-staffed currently (some people left, there’s big business pressure to iterate with the product fast and it’s very hard to find anyone good on the market right now). 

Am I in position to ask for another raise while I already happily accepted one 3 weeks ago (which they themselves proposed)? Also, to be honest, I am also somewhat overworked recently and overwhelmed with the amount of responsibility I got and was even thinking about quitting some time ago (so that I could go back to simply coding and not having to worry about managing people or delivering a multi-person project on time, I would also don’t mind taking some time off to do some open source coding for a while) but decided not to (wouldn’t want to leave things in the middle &amp; this is still very good learning opportunity for me). This didn’t impact my performance at work I think but it is hitting my personal life and energy levels outside of work pretty heavily recently, so on top of this this situation really bummed me up and lowered my morale.

 I would really appreciate an advice. I would like to talk to them about this but not sure what to say &amp; honestly this type of conversations always stress me so I would like to have a good plan for this and be prepared when I’m talking with them about this",finance

personalfinance,How are you supposed to shop around for refinancing?,"I'm looking to take advantage of lower interest rates (obviously), but I don't know where to start. It seems like when I call a bank, they all want to do their own appraisal of the house, which costs like $400-$500. Am I really supposed to do that for a few different banks?

I was wondering this when I was buying the house (my first purchase) a few years ago. The realtor recommended a company that supposedly searches for the best rates and deals. I wanted to shop around, but everything was happening so fast, and the thought of spending almost $2000 on appraisals just to get a better idea of the landscape didn't make sense to me.

I have perfect credit, never missed a payment, pretty sure it's over 800. The only knock would be the average age of my accounts because I'm 29. But still, even though ""mortage rates"" are advertised as 2.5 or 2.6%, this agent tells me the best he can get me is 3.0 or 3.1%.

Husband is in forbearance for his student loans so he’s not paying them and we’re trying to save more. Things are a little tight, but we make it work. 

We ended up buying a home for about $240k. We think we got a great deal - we used a USDA loan, closing costs were covered, got a 2.99% interest rate, and we put $0 down. We actually got a $100 credit. A bunch of our other friends bought houses and it seems like they all put money down. We kinda felt like we almost got away with something because we get to own a house and didn’t put a cent down. Our real estate agent never mentioned anything about it when we explained we didn’t really have money to put down. We could really only afford the house using the USDA loan because we didn’t have anything close to 20%, we had about $20k saved between the 2 of us. We knew we’d have to deal with PMI.

But the more our friends are talking about interest and down payments and what goes towards principal vs interest, were wondering if putting nothing down with our debt will affect us in the long run. Like I said, the agent and the mortgage company said nothing and had no issues with us putting nothing down. Is it typical to not have a down payment?

Navy federal is alright. I’ve had some fraud happen on my cc before which navy fed didn’t really do Much about it. For atms I stick to the one near me and I don’t really go for anything else..? I don’t think they charge fees other than for overdraft.

* No Debt
* 72k Gross Income (~4500 take home a month)
* 13k in Savings (12k in Checking and 1k in ETFs)
* 720 Credit Score

Currently I live at home and my parents are very graciously letting me save all of my money. I think it makes sense to keep living at home for the foreseeable future but I definitely want to buy some property in the area eventually. I have lived in the east coast for the last 8 years of my life and have traveled extensively. I love California and really want to live here for a long time. I am afraid the longer I live here the more cost of living is going to increase and buying a home will become more difficult. If I am going to be spending 1k+ on rent it makes to instead invest it into a mortgage so I build equity and also stabilize housing costs. I have a STEM degree and my job is remote so I am not tied down by a commute.

My idea is to buy property in South Los Angeles. I grew up there and know the area well. There are plenty of homes I could afford in prime locations. Currently, downtown L.A. is experiencing a boom and as the city tries to curb its car usage it will only seek to centralize more. I foresee downtown L.A. becoming a major activity center and South L.A. is right next to it.

personalfinance,Consolidate or not?,"A little background. I have a few credit card debts, one is $8k at 16.9 percent and another at $2k 21% interest. It isn't a crazy amount and we only ended up here due to some unfortunate circumstances that ate our 3 month worth of bills savings first. Things are back on track now, and I'm making $400 to $800 dollar payments towards them monthly at this time, but the interest rates are killing me. 

The problem I'm running into is I'm unable to get an interest rate thats better. My credit union won't approve me, and the places that will are offering me 30%. I have a decent Fico of 720. I really don't get it. 

The only other option I've considered are student loans. My wife and I are both currently students. Her classes are covered by fafsa and I'm on a free ride, working full time as well. Would it be a good idea to use student loans to cover this debt since they would have significantly lower interest rates? Would there be any downsides to doing so? 

I plan on paying towards them in the same way I am paying towards them now so they're gone, I just want to ask if anyone has any other ideas or advice. Thanks for any help.",finance

vet,4 month old pup with diarrhea,"I have a 4 month old Newfie, we got him August 9th. This post may long since there is a lot to go through but i appreciate anyone who takes the time to read &amp; comment! 

We got him on the 9th and at the time the breeder was feeding them Royal Canin Giant Puppy, by the tuesday i ran out and went to Petsmart &amp; Petvalu, they were sold out everywhere in my area. I chose the next best thing which was Royal Canin Large Puppy, assuming it would be the same recipe, on the 14th our pup started having very soft poop which turned into liquid diarrhea and what soon started a series of us waking up multiple times a night to take him out or clean him off if he had pooped in his crate. 

On august 21, after a week of on &amp; off diarrhea i was finally able to see a vet, they didn't do any testing and based off the info i provided they ruled out Parvo &amp; Giardia since he didn't show any signs but no testing was done to check anyways, we were prescribed antibiotics, derworming x2 &amp; sent us home with a jar of probiotics. This helped a bit, his poops firmed up a bit, still on the soft side but no more diarrhea.

In the mean time, we were trying to figure out what could've caused it and stopped giving him training treats and he was only allowed to eat his kibble until he got better. 

During the last week of august, he ate a few bites of our cats food as well as our other dogs food, believe me when i say only a few bites of each, this started a diarrhea filled week for us, i called back the vet we had went to and she was adamant that it was him eating our other pets food that made him sick and wouldn't book us an appointment. 

We both got fed up after 5 days of picking up poop that we basically said ""fuck it"", it might be an allergy or intolerance, let's just change his food tonight, i went and picked up Natures Balance Duck Formula, and after 1 meal the diarrhea stopped completely, no more poopy mornings, no more showers and we could go on walks again! We were thrilled to say the least. 

2 weeks ago i introduced Zukes Peanut Butter training treats, i figured since there isn't any meat products in them that he'd be fine, he was. When we ran out i grabbed the Zukes Duck &amp; Oatmeal, which is basically what he eats and figured again he'd be fine, he was, but now he isn't. 

On Sunday (Oct. 19), i woke up to 3 massive piles of poop in his crate, i honestly couldn't believe that all of that came out of his body. I couldn't tell if it was diarrhea or not because he has squished it by laying in it. He wasn't lethargic or anything so we figured that maybe he reacted badly to the timbit i have him the previous morning or the treats i used (Zukes Duck) to train him the previous night is what caused it, we also hadn't walked him before going to bed, which we always do to make sure he gets that last poop out before bedtime! 

Monday morning, same thing happened, not as many, but still. I rushed home after work and to my surprise there was no accident, although he did poop in my living room a few minutes later, but it was a regular hard poop (yay), we fed him his diner and everything was fine, he asked for the door multiple times that night as usual and we took our walk before bed, he did the smallest poop on our walk so i decided it would be best to wake up during the night to let him out to potty because clearly something is wrong. 

I wake up (this morning) at 2 am to let him out and he had, what i can best describe as, the biggest cow patty type poop, thankfully he wasn't laying down in it and i only had to do a quick clean up, my bf wakes up at 6 (our usual wake up time) and he had pooped again although a lot softer than at 2 am. 

What worries us is that he's doing the smallest poop after his meals and during our walk but the empties himself in his crate at night? This is what he was
doing before and now its happening again.

We are at a loss, we have no idea what could be happening with our pup, he's acting totally normal, not lethargic and his only symptom is softer poo. His schedule hasn't changed, neither has his food, he hasn't gotten into our other pets food and i stopped giving him the training treats 2 days ago when it started and it seems to be getting worse. 

My boyfriend's theory is that he might've eaten a few chunks of drywall while we were renovating and that he's blocked from the inside. 

My theory is that he might have an infection, virus or any types of GI issue. 

We're going to the vet soon for his last round of shots but i just don't know what to ask them. Do i ask to check his poop and for what? Do i get him allergy tested and does anybody know how much that costs approximately? I just have this gut feeling that something is wrong, he's a 4 month old Newfoundland and he's only 50lbs and i usually see them ben between 60-70lbs at this point so i do believe he isn't gaining as much weight as he should be.

stocks,U.S. to Accuse Google of Protecting Illegal Monopoly,"&gt; WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to accuse Google of maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising in a lawsuit to be filed on Tuesday, the government’s most significant legal challenge to a tech company’s market power in a generation, according to officials at the agency.

&gt; In its suit, to be filed in a federal court in Washington, D.C., the agency will accuse Google, a unit of Alphabet, of illegally maintaining its monopoly over search through several exclusive business contracts and agreements that lock out competition, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak on the record. Such contracts include Google’s payment of billions of dollars to Apple to place the Google search engine as the default for iPhones.

&gt; The agency will argue that Google, which controls about 80 percent of search queries in the United States, struck agreements with phone makers using Alphabet’s Android operating system to pre-load the search engine on their phones and make it hard for rival search engines to become a replacement. By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, competition and innovation has suffered, the suit with argue.

&gt; The suit reflects the pushback against the power of the nation’s largest corporations, and especially technology giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. Conservatives like President Trump and liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren have been highly critical of the concentration of power in a handful of tech behemoths.

&gt; Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.

&gt; The lawsuit  may stretch on for years and could set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company’s grip on technology for online advertising.

 Put our savings in interest bearing account, sit on it 6 months to a year, continue saving, add whatever tax credits we get for our children to it, then within 6 months we should easily be at $25,000 saved and plenty of time to build our credit enough to qualify for a mortgage.

personalfinance,My husband and I have almost paid off a joint student loan debt but we want to buy a house in 2021. Should we drag out payments until after the home purchase for credit purposes?,"I'm salivating for the opportunity to pay off the remaining $25K now (we started at $220K total so the salivating is real) but am worried about our credit going down with these accounts closing. We have the funds to pay off our student loans without touching our 20% down payment, closing costs, and emergency savings. Aside from our student loan debts, we each have a financed car. When I closed out one of my student loans about 3 years ago, my credit took a substantial hit. We have credit cards but pay the entire balance monthly.

Our student loans have pretty low interest rates - 4%. At this point, we are each paying about $40 per month in interest. Does it make sense to keep payments going until after the house buy? How long will it take for my credit to bounce back? With these numbers, does it make sense to just pay it off and free myself and my husband in about $1K in monthly debt obligations for purposes of obtaining a mortgage? Thank you, Reddit community!

&amp;#x200B;

Update: both cars are financed at 0% and 0.9% so no need to pay these any earlier. Student loans are at 4% with about 25K jointly remaining. My credit score is on the cusp of excellent (760) and my husband is in the 800s. My understanding is that the lower FICO score is the score that will determine our interest rate. My concern is that paying off my student loan will bring me out of the excellent credit tier and affect the interest rate that we would get. I'm also concerned that if I pay my student loan, the only remaining installment loan is my car loan which also affect one of the variables that determine a FICO score.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE UPDATE: Thanks to all who posted. I think many people who responded assume that my credit won't be affected by paying it off but that wasn't the case for one loan I paid off (40 points off my credit for at least 3 months). Many other posters here said paying off their student loans dinged their credit anywhere from 20-80 points for as long as 2-12 months. Not worth the risk in my book especially since I'm the limiting spouse and can easily slip back into ""very good"" as opposed to ""excellent credit."". We're going to pay off almost all the debt, wait for our large payment to post, request a disclosure, and our companies have already confirmed that they will recalculate our monthly obligation for the remainder of the loan (i.e. maybe $50 per month). Our lenders are SOFI-MOHELA. After we purchase the home, we will pay off the remainder of our loans. We think this is the best path for us especially since we don't need to qualify for a bigger loan (we only want half of the loan that we already currently pre-qualify for) and credit impact on closing student loan accounts appears to have some variable and drastic mileage.

Refinancing after a year is an option, but interest rates are likely to be much higher than the 2.75% we can get now.

&gt; McDonald’s (MCD) and Wingstop (WING) are the best-positioned stocks in the restaurant category under a Democrat sweep, according to the Raymond James analysis, while Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI), Outback Steakhouse’s Bloomin Brands (BLMN), and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) are best positioned in a Trump victory.

Okay, whatever. It doesn't make sense to me to try to pick which restaurants will prosper under which candidate, because that's just culture-picking IMO. It's not like red meat eaters will stop eating if Trump wins or Buffalo wings are poised to move for Biden.

&gt;  Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) and SunPower (SPWR) among possible winners in a Democrat sweep scenario, as well as biotechs Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), ChemoCentryx (CCXI), CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY), and NGM Biopharmaceuticals (NGM)  

I'll look those up as the ""biotech etf"" and ""clean energy etf"" are probably not the most effective way to lean into these opportunities.  

&gt; It would also be good for industrial and material stocks and consumer discretionary, the analyst said. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) find favor under a Democrat Sweep, as do United Parcel Service (UPS), FedEx (FDX), RingCentral (RNG) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), the report said.  

This makes more sense as industrial &amp; consumer spending recovery are really dependent on a strong stimulus package and Democrats are leaning into fiscal stimulus more heavily right now. These are also the same kind of stocks that should benefit from a strong stimulus package if one gets agreed upon in the next few days, regardless of which candidate wins the election.   

&gt; A split government, with Biden in the White House and a GOP-controlled Senate, however, would likely mean budget battles and gridlock on legislation for health care, financials, telecom, tech and energy. An Infrastructure bill would be possible. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Delta and Southwest Airlines (LUV), Union Pacific (UNP), and Hyatt Hotels (H) do well under this scenario.  

A less-than-hopeful result is that Biden wins and the GOP retains control of the senate because that results in gridlock. While business usually welcomes gridlock, the pandemic is a particular situation where we need effective and nimble leadership so I think what's happening here is that Wall Street actually does not prefer a divided government right now.   

&gt; The least likely scenario at this point would be a status quo, where President Trump enters a second term with a GOP-led Senate but Democrat-controlled House. This is seen as best for financials, energy, communications services, health care, staples, utilities, and real estate. Legislative accomplishments are seen being light under this possibility. Best-positioned stocks under a status quo include Halliburton (HAL), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Boston Scientific (BSX), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Salesforce.com (CRM), Raymond James said.  

I think what we're seeing here are picks for more of the same situation that we're in right now, except maybe these stocks are ready to move up.    

This is all based on an analysis and presumably some simulations at Raymond James.  

Disclosure: I haven't looked closely at the above stock picks and am neither recommending them nor avoiding them. Personally, I'm increasing positions in old energy &amp; clean energy, am shifting to US industrial/aerospace and am out of the tech bubble stocks except for BABA &amp; JD because they're not dependent on the US economy either doing well or tanking.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on Mortgage points,"Hello all!

Need some perspective on mortgage points.  I'm contemplating between 0, .5, and 1.25 point options on a $680k loan.  Point cost is $3,400/$8,500 for a 2.875%/2.75% interest rate (base is 3%) and the difference in monthly payment is $45/$90 respectively.  Looking at the amortization schedule and including the monthly savings it looks like my break even point is about 2.5years/3 years respectively.  I plan on staying in the property for at least 5 years but not more than 7-8.

I've crunched the numbers but am having a hard time trying to 'evaluate' each situation to understand what's best for me.  I'd rather keep the cash in my pocket (time value and all) and the monthly savings is negligible but I think the savings in interest (meaning higher payment to principal, greater equity sooner) is appealing, however, I won't 'feel' this difference.  What happens after 5 years is very uncertain, could either sell or possibly rent, but trying to not get too far ahead of my self.

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I've seen many offers to refinance down in the 2% range and it sounds like a no-brainer, but I've never refinanced before and want to be sure I'm not missing something. We might be moving across the country this time next year so I'm wondering if that makes it too soon to be worth refinancing. 

Is there a minimum recommended amount of time to remain in the house before it becomes worth it to refinance? How much of a factor is rolling the closing cost into the mortgage itself. Maybe someone here can share their experience or knowledge to help us make a decision. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Very Cheap Rent or Purchase Home?,"Hello PersonalFinance - for the past few months I’ve been debating on whether or not to purchase a home or continuing to live in a very low rent apartment.  I’m 37, divorced but with a girlfriend of 3 years. Here’s my current financial status:

Income: $160k gross

Assets: two rental properties bought last year worth $360k and still owe $270k (loans are commercial so paying 5% interest) 

Cash/investments (not including 401k):  $80k

Expenses: 
Rent: 6k / year (utilities included)
Insurance: 2k / year
Cell phone: 2k / year
Gas, food, entertainment, travel:  14k / year
Auto and student loans are paid. 

Should I buy a house to live in for $200k-$300k with interest rates being so low?  Property taxes would be around 3k which is half my rent for the year.  Or should I keep renting, saving money and or pay off my rental properties early?  

Thank you for your input!",finance
personalfinance,Pay off debt or continue saving for mortgage,"I currently have ~$65k in savings, and I want to better understand if I should continue to build on that for a down payment on a $650k house (would have the funds by October 2021, including a nice cushion for any renovations) or pay off my debt first (particularly #2 and #4 below). 

Situation: I’ve been living in a high COL city (Rent = ~$3,250) making ~$11k per month after taxes and 401k / HSA contributions. I also receive a bonus in September that ranges from 40-100k depending on the year (40k this past year—2020). I don’t necessarily want to bank on that this year just yet. My lease ends in December and I will be moving back to my parents house up in the mountains in Colorado (enjoy the ski season if there is one). I’ve been cleared by work to live remotely for up to 2 years, and at that time, they would re-evaluate the situation. I’d likely need to move to one of my company’s hubs (all in high COL locations). While I can stay indefinitely at the parents house, I’ll likely need to move out sometime in the summer from a sanity perspective. My fiancé and I would like to find a place that we can live long term (at least 4 years), and as a result, we don’t want to sign a lease at that time.

Debt: I’ve managed to pay off over $54k over the last 1.5 years, which is why my savings is lower than I would want it to be given my annual salary. Below is what’s remaining (~1600 per month in payments)

1) 18k principal remaining @ 3.5% APR (202 per month)
2) 52k principal remaining @ 3.85% APR (1066 per month)
3) 20k principal remaining @ 5.19% APR (fiancé and I are splitting this car payment so it’s 203 per month)
4) 20k principal remaining (not sure the APR; it’s a fed loan so it’s not collecting interest right now) (273 per month)

Starting in January, I’ll be able to save ~$6-8k per month since I won’t be paying rent. I’d like to buy a house in the fall, but if I make the payment on the debt, I won’t be able to put down the 20%. 

My thinking is I should pay off debts 2 and 4 ASAP and look to save over the next couple of months to put down 10-15% come August / September.",finance

This is an old interview from 2016 but it's 100% relevant to what's happening around the world today.  Whether you believe in MMT or not, this is still a very eye-opening discussion.  Richard Koo describes his prior experience dealing with a financial collapse in South American and applying those lessons in Japan.

The key takeaways are:

* The ""experts"" didn't have a good grasp of what was actually happening in reality.  Luckily, Japan didn't go down the path of deep austerity, which is what they tend towards culturally.
* Monetary policy doesn't work when there is weak demand for credit from commercial banks.
* The effects of fiscal stimulus are dampened when individuals/corporations are in a rush to pay down debt (i.e. fix their balance sheets).
* Japan has a financial crisis but their GDP and unemployment numbers were always relatively healthy.  Demand for exported goods remained high and there were no obvious structural issues besides demographics and entitlement programs.
* Japanese equities market responded well to QE but it seemed more speculative than based on fundamentals (i.e. front-running perceived inflation).
* In the wake of massive QE and fiscal stimulus, it's important to stay ahead of inflation.
* Macroeconomics is still very young and there's still much to be learned.  The stuff taught in schools is sound theory but only in the context of regular business cycles and not during a full-blown debt crisis.",finance

technology,"Possible compromise for Big Tech, data collection, privacy, and security.","Now that the cat is out of the bag, so to speak. Major corporations are likely in panic mode, trying to come up with a plan to save the sinking ship. That ship being tens of thousands of jobs, technological innovation, and extensive financial investments such as retirement funds. It’s become apparent to me banning the practice of collecting sensitive data isn’t a viable proposal. I have an idea for consideration, which will allow big data and its consumers to keep innovating. Potentially even increasing the worth of the data substantially, while helping to protect privacy of citizens and businesses, and therefore national security. Mind you, this general idea applies only to the US.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

First, a few important points to keep in mind about big tech, social media, and the data being collected. The individuals that innovated and established the current business model, or the “Zuckerberg’s” if you will. And the many brilliant minds that work for those companies should not be blamed or demonized. It seems obvious to me that everyone involved was seeking to accomplish good for society, gather data for science, social improvement, and technological innovation. The situation unfortunately is being abused by entities with malicious intentions by exploiting the data and platforms designed to help connect people. Black hat hackers and adversarial nation-states.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

So what should we do? If data isn’t being collected, many jobs are put in jeopardy, investments put at risk, and innovation stifled. On the other side of the issue, is the data collected worth the risk to national security? The Misinformation, Disinformation, Extremist groups and cults, divisiveness, election integrity, and many other issues the country is facing are being amplified by the data in question. While none of these issues are new by any stretch of the imagination, until recently, we have even done a pretty good job at marginalizing the instigators. What has changed? The internet is more connected globally, more robust, and much faster than in the past. Seemingly everyone now has a microphone, camera, and an audience to broadcast for. Each consumer device had many sensors jam packed inside constantly generating data. The data in question is detailed enough that it points out weaknesses or vulnerabilities to exploit. From both an individual level to entire populations. The data can correlate a person or groups, Interests, religion, sexual preference, age, race, political leaning, possibly even favorite alcoholic beverage. It can also capture an individuals mindset about a particular topic. Whats worried about the most?, what makes them happy?, sad?, etc. That data is then converted into numbers and metrics. Almost any successful business from fast food to politics is now using information generated from the data to make practically all important decisions. Many customers of the data are now combining datasets from multiple sources which enriches the information. At this point profiles can be created of an individual. For instance, name, email addresses, accounts from other sites, physical address, phone number, place of employment, credit score, criminal history, marriage certificate, friends, family, children, schools attended, automobiles, income, estimated wealth, debt. Eventually, almost everything about a person, their friends and family, can be profiled for exploitation.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

From my perspective, American’s data should be thought of moving forward as a national asset. I think about how it might be regulated and managed similar to some combination of the US dollar and oil. By restricting who gets access to the information, anonymizing it,  purging old data, proactively seeking unauthorized databases for deletion, and protecting the new data, will increase it worth. The Federal Government should take control of the data being gathered. Enforce stringent regulations and guidelines about who can purchase access to the data, and how to safeguard citizens’ and businesses’ privacy. How to scrub data from personal identifiers. Equally important, Government will be in charge of finding the appropriate data and getting it to approved customers. Big Tech and others will still write algorithms that generate the data, however, it needs to be turned over to the government’s possession. The government will have to get in the business of cybersecurity, data science, privacy and tech policy. Private sector data centers might fill immediate needs such as AWS, Azure, Google. It will require strict oversight to make sure the data is in control of the government, and not accessible to others.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

Smaller companies can’t easily afford to secure and store the data they collect, and much larger ones aren’t in the business of securing that data. They are in the business of generating and selling it. The problem is data getting into the hands of bad actors. “Good” and “bad” are subjective. We can’t expect corporations have the best interests of citizens or their privacy in its business operations. This should be obvious to anyone by now. To be fair, that’s not their primary goal or purpose. We should allow them to do what they do best. Who they sell the data to and for how much isn’t in the scope of my proposed solution. However, it should allow for small and medium-size American businesses an opportunity to flourish.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

For those that might make the argument that innovation might be stifled, or that customers of data will simply buy elsewhere. My argument is, each country and society generates unique information. South Africa will not generate the same data as the United States. A communist country will not generate the same information as a Democratic country. (At least outside of the basics) I believe information from a democratic, technologically advanced society will be of more value than from other countries. That’s not to say we can’t or shouldn’t try to collect as much information as possible from other countries. If US data is properly regulated, marketed, and proves valuable to our businesses giving an edge over global competition. Its monetary worth may very well increase exponentially. As the situation currently stands regarding data brokering, it’s more or less a smash and grab free-for-all, race to the bottom. The current business model needs to more accurately reflect the importance of the data.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

Anyone from Politicians, Judges, CEO’s, Celebrities, Intelligence, and any other individual in a position of potential influence, authority, or gatekeeper is at risk of blackmail, intimidation, and other micro-targeted forms of coercion.There would need to be some technically minded committee that oversees the data to make sure it’s not being abused by its owners or anyone else. And can quickly make policy changes if serious issues are identified. My thought is. There are three entities or stake holders in this situation. (1)Corporations, which get paid from the data their algorithms and services generate from the citizens. (2)The citizens, who generate the data from the corporate created services and who's online privacy needs protected by government. (3)The government, who controls and stores the data, pays the corporations from its sale, protects the citizens privacy for national security reasons. The idea being, if government tries to abuse its power and use the data to spy on its citizens, that data will eventually be leaked or stolen, or at the very least  put at risk, which in theory would significantly reduce its monetary worth. Therefor, corporations and their deep pocketed lawyers would protect the citizens privacy from government spying. The Government doesn't want its citizens privacy leaked to other countries or hackers because it can lead to national security issues, and doesn't want to be sued by corporations for accessing data needlessly. (work in progress, still trying to figure out an equitable balance.)  
&amp;nbsp;

 

Those that control the data and information will control the power in the world order. We already understand this. We don't want corporations to have more power than government. Therefor government needs to have the information. Where things get lost (in my opinion) now that the internet is here to stay and globally connected. A private business or corporation isn’t restricted to only buying and selling to American’s. Shareholders can be international. This means the free market mindset, and small-government doesn’t play out. From small businesses to multinational conglomerates, with varying interests, subsidiaries, and supply chains will not stand a chance against an adversarial country targeting them or their market share. Especially a communist country that doesn’t play by the same rules as everyone else. Unfortunately, from my perspective, getting government involved is a necessary evil for many reasons. In short, It’s better to debate domestic policies and regulations among ourselves, than allow adversarial nations the opportunity to pick apart American businesses and technologies one at a time, erode the economy, and America’s global influence.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

This proposal or general framework isn’t perfect and possibly raises more questions than it answers. Changes would obviously need to be made in certain areas and possibly require new advancements in tech. For instance, how do we keep American data from leaving the country, how can we ensure other countries aren’t collecting Americans data on American soil, and how can we ensure it’s secure? It’s not apparent to me we have a firm grasp on keeping information secure at this point in time. I say that as a Cybersecurity Engineer. When Intelligence agencies, contractors, creditors, hospitals, banks, virtually every industry has had serious breaches in the past several years with no end in sight, that tells me the situation is not under control. After all, we have humans designing and operating the systems. The reality of the situation is the US has more to lose than anyone else. We gave every country in the world a means to potentially inflict loss. We can’t defend against every possible enemy, from every possible attack, at all times, especially those unknown. Constructive criticism is always welcome. As they say, If you are agreed with by everyone, you’re likely in the wrong place. The status quo is a danger to the country for many reasons as is hopefully clear. Regulations will not fix the multi-dimensional issues. There are too many other connected pieces at play that need addressing. Technologist and guru of security, Bruce Schneier, said it best, “Now that computer systems are connected to everything, its rules now apply to everything.” This solution tries to tackle all the major issues at once while acknowledging the importance of the data collection, privacy, economy, and national security.  
&amp;nbsp;

 

One last point. This proposed idea gives a potential way out from the direction we have been heading for the past 20 years or so, towards an authoritarian rule. We have been straying from a free society now for sometime. The internet has generally been a Pandora’s box of unforeseen consequences. It's important to get out in front of the coming fallout from big data collection and sort of hijack the anger and blame, and redirect it at the root cause, and offer an appropriate solution before politicians get involved and do what they do best. Applying simple non-technological solutions to complex technical problems, addressing only the symptoms, and causing more issues than the original problem presented. We also need to enlighten policy makers on the proper way to think of security going forward. We will never catch “All the bad guys”. Eroding the privacy and rights of 99.9999% of the population in an attempt to squeeze the last drop of evil from society, is a shortsighted and foolish idea. Especially, when there are 4,450 federal criminal laws on record to be broken, It’s likely impossible not to break federal laws regularly, even if you don't know it. Specifically, in a for-profit corporate ran system, in which shareholders and their quarterly earnings depend on the head count of “criminals” imprisoned. People are products of their environment, if you treat people like criminals and terrorists they are eventually going to act like them. *Show me a man with nothing left to lose, and I’ll show you a man not afraid of losing.*

personalfinance,How to handle spouse student loan payments?,"My wife and I got married this year, and I've inherited 47k of her remaining student loans. I'm trying to come up with the best plan to tackle this and would love some advice. 

My wife is an elementary school teacher - and has taught at title 1 schools in two different districts since she started working. This year marks year 7. All of her time is eligible for teacher loan forgiveness/PSLF and 37k of her loans are eligible for forgiveness and have an average of 6% interest rate (0% right now obviously). 

A little background - Her current salary is about 58k, and I make about double that. She figured out last year that she has been paying her loans back using an extended graduated repayment plan - which is not eligible for PSLF. However - TEPSLF was funded for 700 Mill and has only given out just under 90 Mill so far. So i'm fairly confident that it will still be funded in 3 years - but definitely not a given. Teacher loan forgiveness is also an option and she could apply for 5k of forgiveness today if she wanted to - but it would reset the clock on any possible forgiveness with TEPSLF. 

My initial thoughts were to just take the free 5k - and aggressively pay down the remaining amount. I paid off about 80k of my own loans and i seriously just want these gone. But the more I read about TEPSLF - I'm reconsidering. Theoretically - she could continue making her graduated repayment plan until halfway through year 8. At that point we would switch it to one of the income based plans (this is where I need to do some more research on how our tax filing status will affect which one would make the most sense here) and follow all of the steps to apply for TEPSLF once she has made 120 payments. You only need to have the most recent 12 months of payments as an income based plan to qualify there - but purposely need to apply for and get denied PSLF first. 

Plan A:

-Continue to pay current plan - 287/mo until sometime in early/mid 2023 (it may go up slightly once during this period because it's a graduated plan). $33.5k principal still remains - will have paid a little over 8.3k with more than 60% of that going towards interest. 
- Put Extra money towards 10k private loan every month and have it paid off in at most 2 years. 
-March-May 2023 - Apply for Income Based Repayment - payments would either jump if we take both incomes into account, or may only slightly go up depending on the route taken here. Worst case payments jump to around 1200-1300 a month for say 15 months and there is still around 15k remaining which could be forgiven. Best case - that number is far lower and a lot more eligible to be forgiven.
-August 2024 - Apply for PSLF/TEPSLF - total paid somewhere around 27k with 15k forgiven worst case. 

Plan B:

-Take the 5k teacher loan forgiveness which will drop the federal loan to 32k. 
-Pay an extra 500 a month towards these
-Federal loan paid off in August 2024 having paid around 37k total. 
- Could probably put some lump sums or pay more than 500 some months so this could ultimately be less.
- Private loan wouldn't be able to be paid down as quickly so more interest paid over the life of this loan. 

Plan C:

- Follow Plan A - pay minimum's on the federal loan and knock out the private loan by early/mid 2023. 
- Be denied TEPSLF or find out funding has ran out. 
- Get 5k teacher loan forgiveness - loans down to around 28.5k
- Aggressively pay off remaining amount. 500 extra a month would be paid off around february 2024 at a total of a little more than 31k + the 8.3k prior to getting denied. 

I guess would you recommend even trying for TEPSLF vs. just taking the teacher loan forgiveness and rolling with it? I think if we can get the public service loan forgiveness it would be the most cost effective. I'd almost rather risk paying 2k more over the next 4 years  (probably less if you consider private loan interest) to possibly receive total loan forgiveness. Is this stupid? Should I be looking at this some other way?",finance
cybersecurity,IT Security Intern - Need Advice,"Using throwaway - username checks out.

I work for a small financial company. I'm an intern in the role of IT Security. My boss is an ex-English teacher but does hold a CISSP. We need to be compliant with quite a few US regulations as one would imagine for a financial company. My duties include designing training and assuring compliance for the IT sector. The problem is I have ZERO visibility into infrastructure or ANY technical aspects of the company other than face value. The infrastructure manager is exceptionally dismissive of anything I say. Additionally, someone from help desk recently became an admin and is now a self-righteous royal fucking prick (excuse my language).

I'm concerned about criminal negligence due to the inability of the ""CISO,"" my boss, to verify anything that infra does. Lack of log monitoring, lack of CVE checking (unless Windows rolls out an update I don't think we keep up-to-date for other software we use), few or no authority reviews, lack of audits, lack of external or internal pen-tests, and a slew of other issues.

Despite the flaws I like the company as a whole and I like where I live so I would like to stay. I'm also on an intern wage so it's not like I can afford to up and move wherever very easily.

How do I communicate to the IT manager or maybe even my boss that I'm not comfortable in this position with such a lack of visibility? Am I in the wrong and should just keep my mouth shut? If there is a major breach am I on-the-line, as it were, for criminal negligence when a state or federal authority inevitably comes into the picture?

I have about a semester left of a bachelors in CyberSec and I've developed modern web apps in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), MSSQL, jQuery, and Bootstrap. I can run nmap and wireshark understanding the results produced. I AM technically proficient, maybe not exceptional but certainly proficient and I know compliance violations when I see them.

Do I plan my escape now or maybe whistleblow to stay in the area I'd like to stay in?

Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance.",technology

\- Pay no taxes on the loan

How is it that you could do this infinite times? You'd have to pay off the original loan at some point, so do you keep taking larger and larger loans, to pay off the previous loans and also allowing you to live off the loaned money?

Loan from 2019 - $14,986 principal @ 6.08% APR

I have reached out to the service provider for the federal loan because I could not find what my repayment plan is so I do not know how to calculate my monthly payments.

Is there any benefit if I consolidate these two federal loans into one so I have one payment? If I treat and pay monthly payments to two separate loans how should I tackle repayment?",finance

personalfinance,Help: home refinance options with points vs without points,"Hi all,

I'm currently trying to refinance my home and have two options on the table. I'm going from a 4.99 to a 2.99 in both. However, one of the refi deals is using points to get me to a 2.99 (rolling another $9000 into the total loan amount). I have 440K left on my original loan (started at 450K last year). More details below:

Deal 1: 

2.99 interest rate (using points which cost $9000)

P&amp;I: $1922

Total closing cost (rolled into loan): $15324 

Total loan amount: $456000

&amp;#x200B;

Deal 2: 

2.99 interest rate (not using points)

P&amp;I: $1859

Total closing cost (upfront): $8400

Total loan amount: $441,500 (add closing costs if you want)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, why am I paying for points to get the same interest rate in the first deal? Is this something the loan officers do so they can also make more income? As of right now, it seems like a no-brainer to choose second option as I don't mind paying upfront to avoid a higher loan amount plus interest. If someone sees something else please enlighten me (also let me know if I should include more background info). Thank you all in advance!",finance

stocks,Biogen Quarterly meeting today/earnings,"Expected eps 8.14 actual 8.84
    BIIB Biogen has posted earnings today I think it’s been a positive day for Biogen despite the media narratives being negative. 
Media is focusing on Tecifedra a MS medication revenues being less than previous quarter due to a couple factors. Corona virus, and competitors. 

I believe the articles focus on only negative aspects for some reason concerning phase 2 failure of opcinimab. 

The positives are that tecifedra consumption is actually up, but maintenance doses are less than initial doses. They are selling more in other countries and emerging markets, spoke of regulatory talks with Japan China as well as others. 

Next month the true factor is USDA pending approval on their upcoming Aducanomab treatment for Alzheimer’s next month. Biogen has been preparing for a full release as planned and was optimistic about approval. 

This would really impact Biogen in a huge way if accepted, and there has been good evidence to believe it will be. The company has shown to be undervalued as it maintains a strong balance sheet and just spent 5bn? (Don’t remember exactly) on stock buybacks announced today. 

Now if Adu- fails to be approved it could have an adverse affect on other pending approvals from other countries, same if its accepted then Biogen would have a greater chance of some other medications being pushed through in the rest of the global market.

I remain optimistic, and the media narratives pushing this price low right now really makes it an attractive buy. Some revenue from its MS drugs have been pushed over to help Adu- prepare for launch. I’m 45% concentrated in Biogen and if accepted by USDA we could see this stock go extremely high, even past the 52 day average up into the high 300’s mid 400’s per share. Currently sitting at 262. I’m super excited!

personalfinance,"Employer provides two different HSA plans, need advice on optimal plan","Hi everyone!

My employer provides two different health insurance plans that include HSAs for individuals, both of which offer the same health benefits, but have different pricing structures. Details below:

||HSA 1|HSA 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium ($) (annual)|960|1800|
|Deductible ($)|4500|1500|
|Co-Insurance (%)|0\*|20|
|Out-of-pocket Maximum ($)|4500|3500|

\*Co-insurance is N/A for HSA 1, as the deductible and OoP Max are the same value.

Employer provides $500, I'm planning on maxing out contributions with $3100 ($3600 max for 2021). Fed tax is 24%, state (MD) is 4.75%.

I've been using HSA 1 for the past 3 years and have hit the OoP max once, used \~$1000 and \~$2000 in the next two years. Next year I plan on hitting the OoP max regardless of the plan (couple surgeries incoming...), but things could change. I also plan on only paying from the HSA.

I understand if I'm hitting the OoP max, its better for HSA 2 due to total premium+OoP max being lower than HSA 1 AND I keep $100 from my contributions in the HSA.

Therefore, for 2021, probably going with HSA 2.

I have done some research using online calculators ( [https://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/learning-center/compare-your-health-plans](https://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/learning-center/compare-your-health-plans) ) and the spreadsheet from the wiki and its pretty much tells me that HSA 2 is always better due to tax savings, as long as the medical expenses are at least \~$1000 per year, which I expect them to be.

**What I don't understand is why HSA 2 is cheaper/better when there is a higher premium, but I'm not even hitting the deductible?**

All of the tax savings seem to come from the premium, which isn't contributed to the HSA account. It feels like I'm throwing $840 into the abyss for the premium, and only saving because I'm not paying taxes on that amount. That (post-tax) money, maybe $500, could go into an Roth account or into my checking account and be better used. I feel like I'm missing something.

FYI my priorities are my bottom line. **What plan between HSA 1 and HSA 2 would give me the most money toward my net worth (IRAs, HSA, savings, checking)? Is there an amount of medical expenses that would benefit me to switch between HSA 1 and HSA 2?** I can switch between the plans every year.

I understand many of the values are not static forever, but understanding which is the optimal plan will help me in the future if options changes.

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks.",finance
investing,Currency Conundrums,"The different principles and definitions of currency (especially fiat) have always confused me. I don’t understand how anything can be seen as a non fiat currency. All currency seems to only be given value because of a government backing (aka forcing public trust) or natural public trust. History’s fix to this problem, gold, is an example of the latter. It’s just a piece of metal that the public has all agreed on to be worth something. The modern day’s fix to the problem, crypto, is legitimately just 0s and 1s on a computer. At least gold has, while very limited, some production uses. I understand, the appeal of these items and what makes them a “currency” is that their they have a limited supply etc. but the main feature of a currency and its main use, a storage of value, they are not. Their value fluctuates just like other financial instruments, and in certain situations (collapse of society, for instance) what are you going to do with blocks of metal or 0s and 1s on a computer? 

Another thing that I have been confused about recently regarding currency is the talk of “digital currency”. Does the US not already have a digital currency? We get a direct deposit into our bank account, use cards for most transactions if not all, Venmo our friends instead of giving cash, even the fed has admitted they don’t print the money any more they just “create” it digitally. I would understand the want and use for a blockchain currency, but most of what I see on the subject indicates that it’s not blockchain related (no way the fed would ever do blockchain either). So I guess my overall question is, what the fuck is a good with currency? Lol",finance
CryptoCurrency,Nft's Crypto Bonds and the sync network.,"Focus on the [DeFi](https://cryptoadventure.org/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-or-defi/)  space is shifting immensely following the invention of numerous digital  assets and other crypto-related projects. Both new and expert traders  come onboard the DeFi community with high hopes of earning a good  income. 

However, most of  these protocols are usually fungible. In simple terms, fungible assets  can be exchanged with another user as long as both assets are similar.  Crypto Bonds, on the other hand, are non-fungible tokens that run on  SYNC Network. Before looking into the functionalities of [Crypto Bonds,](https://syncbond.com/) we have to understand what non-fungible assets are to get the bigger picture.

## A Brief Description of Non-Fungible Tokens

Unlike fungible assets, [non-fungible assets (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) eliminate the exchange of any token or cryptocurrency. NFTs mostly contain some information indicated on their [smart contracts](https://cryptoadventure.org/smart-contracts-behind-the-scenes/),  making them very different from each other. Therefore, no single token  can represent the NFT. Among the identifiable information contained in  the smart contracts include stuff like secure file links and even the  owner’s identity. 

Revealing  identities may seem far-fetched, but in the end, it plays a significant  role in the proof of ownership. The gaming industry is an excellent  example of an area that utilizes NFT. Items available on the gaming site  represent non-fungible tokens, so the rightful token owner must  purchase the items. Other use cases for NFTs may evolve around issuing  documents such as software licenses or birth certificates. 

## The Birth of Crypto Bonds on SYNC Network

The  dawn of a new asset is here with SYNC Network launching its own Crypto  Bond. SYNC Network requires users to add 50% SYNC Tokens to every Crypto  Bond. This measure ensures the maintenance of the tokens’ status as  well as improving their liquidity pools. SYNC is set to be paired with  over 150 different liquidity pairs. SYNC’s bonding to other crypto  assets strengthens SYNC while supporting its assets bonded to via  liquidity pools. Since Crypto Bonds fall under the NFT bracket, anyone  can develop a bond for themselves. There’s no need for a middle man.  Generally, SYNC Network empowers the crypto space’s growth through [blockchain adoption](https://cryptoadventure.org/12-countries-set-to-dominate-blockchain-industry-reveals-pwc-report/), safeguarding users’ wallets, and integrating research markets.

## Features of Crypto Bonds

A unique [ERC-721](https://cryptoadventure.org/beginners-guide-to-token-standards-ethereum-neo-tron/)  contract drives Crypto Bonds. So when formulating a new NFT bond, one  has to seal an adequate amount of SYNC tokens and liquidity tokens from [Uniswap.](https://cryptoadventure.org/uniswap-exchange-the-ultimate-guide-for-beginners/)  The lock duration entirely depends on the decision of an investor.  Crypto Bond durations range from 90 days to 3 years. Choose between  quarterly dividend payouts or earn higher interest with a term Crypto  Bond. Dividends are paid out in the form of SYNC tokens.  
   
   Token distribution of SYNC is divided into various sections whereby  48.7% goes to the public users, 25% is meant to sustain the Crypto Bond  Market, partnership and marketing funds consume 16%, the developing team  gets 7%. Private sale amounts to 2.5% of the total tokens. That being  said, Crypto Bonds enable a couple of distinguishing features,  including:

### Improves Longevity

SYNC Tokens are scraped off the cumulative supply after the creation of a Crypto Bond. This action alone ensures [SYNC Tokens](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xb6ff96b8a8d214544ca0dbc9b33f7ad6503efd32)  remain scarce and highly valid to the crypto market. After that, a  re-minting procedure of the SYNC Token and interests gained starts once  the Crypto Bond maturity lapses.

### Adjustable Interest

Crypto Bond’s interest rates keep changing daily to keep up with the demand for SYNC Tokens’ current supply.

### Effective Trading

Users can trade their Crypto Bonds on the automated bond market maker or through auctions. Utilizing [bot technology for trading](https://cryptoadventure.org/what-are-cryptocurrency-trading-bots-and-why-we-need-them/) purposes saves an investor’s most important resources, time, and funds.

### Easiness of Transfer

The SYNC network facilitates an easy mechanism of sending Crypto Bonds to other [wallets](https://cryptoadventure.org/wallets/). 

### Liquidity Maintenance

Crypto  Bonds boost the liquidity structures of every pool that associates with  it. Liquidity withdrawal is possible only after the maturity period  comes to an end. 

## Why You Should Choose SYNC Network

SYNC Network is undoubtedly one of the modernized [DeFi projects](https://cryptoadventure.org/defi-platforms/)  in the market today. It increases the liquidity power of specific pools  through the Crypto Bonds. It also deploys a strategy meant to elevate  the SYNC token in conjunction with their respective pools. 

SYNC  Network also allows users to design the Crypto Bonds according to their  individual preferences. The network’s automated bond market maker  executes the bond’s immediate sale on behalf of a user. 

Assets  with higher chances of gaining more interests are traded together,  thanks to the Crypto Bond marketplace. Whether or not you decide to  trade on a different market is also your choice; however, it won’t  interfere with an asset’s price linked with Crypto Bonds.

## Conclusion

SYNC  Network seemingly carries the massive potential to serve its users  comfortably. It isn’t possible to trade all day even though the crypto  market operates full time. Nonetheless, merging Crypto Bonds with DeFi  allows for a robust secondary market that aims to support the crypto  market as a whole. The direct effect of crypto bonds being created is  larger, stronger, and more liquid markets. 

Moreover,  it will be difficult for SYNC tokens to lose its value considering the  effective strategies to ensure its stability. The network also enables [REN protocol](https://cryptoadventure.org/investing-in-republic-protocol-ren-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/)  procedures, which facilitate the transfer of assets across other  chains. SYNC Network is consistent with its plans, which is why, moving  forward, it plans to establish a decentralized Crypto Bond trading  platform.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Buy, refi, payoff oh my!","TL;DR What should I payoff or not pay off, and in what order, so I can buy the best primary residence I can afford after divorce.

I (50F) am in the process of getting divorced after 13 years, 2 elementary aged kids, SF Bay Area, Credit Score around 840 (I have credit cards in my maiden name that won't be disrupted with divorce).  I have:

$750,000 FMV 1BR/1BA Rental House (protected by pre-nup), rental income $2500.

\-$94,000 remaining mortgage on Rental House, about 7 more years left, 3.125%, monthly is $1500 (really $1390, but I put extra toward principle)

\-$6,000 remaining balance on student loan debt, about 5 years left, 2.125%, monthly is $125.

$100,000 very liquid cash

$300,000 investment accounts, not as liquid, but still pretty liquid

$1.3m retirement accounts (protected by pre-nup)

$1.0m estimate of net settlement.  This is a complete SWAG, but lets use it for purposes of this discussion.  Also assume the $100,000 and $300,000 are also the ""cleared"" amount after settlement - meaning my take away is $1+.1+.3 = $1.4m.  I list them here separately to show my liquidity position (whether that's valid or not, I'm not sure).

I will need to retitle the rental house, and hopefully soon after settlement, buy a primary residence for my kids and me.  Estimate that this will be around $1.2m-$1.4m depending on fixer or move in-able condition.

Also I should add that I am not employed, but will be looking for a job probably starting in January.  I think I can easily get a job for $70,000 that gives me flexibility to pick the kids up after they are back in school, but if I really put myself back into my previous ambitions, I can probably get a $120,000 job.  But I don't really want that because I had no spare time with that job, and I really need that now as I expect to have more than 50% responsibility (if even only 50% custody; mom job, right?).  So let's assume $70,000, and let's assume $3500 take home per month.

I expect $3000 in child support (no alimony - pre-nup :-(  ).  That could go lower depending on the job I get.

Rental property rents for $2500, but say $2000 after considering property taxes.  Mortgage payment is $1500 with the current mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should be my ordered plan once everything is settled?  Here are the things that can/should happen:

* Refinance Rental or just pay off Rental?
* Pay off student loan
* Buy primary residence

I'm wondering whether it makes sense to just pay off the rental vs refinance and have to pay closing costs/fees (I don't even know what that might amount to - $3000 in administrative paperwork, $1000 in origination fees?).  But I'd hate to lose the cash to put toward the primary residence.  I know I can cash-out refi this property (say, to put towards the primary), but I believe that I lose any tax deductibility of the mortgage interest since the funds wouldn't be put toward that property.

Should I just pay off the student loan to make sure I don't have any dings for existing debt?  Or will that make me look worse for ""closing"" an account?

For the primary residence, I'm thinking of buying at the low end whatever I can buy with all cash (meaning a fixer).  Then after I get a steady stream of income, do a cash out refi and remodel it.  So potentially buy $1.2, then take out, say $250,000 in the future to remodel.  So my LTV would still be very favorable to any bank.

On the other hand, a $1.2-$1.4 means usually 1,200 sq ft, and I'd really like to get a few hundred more sq ft to be able to carve out an office space, so I'd like to be more in the $1.5-1.6m range.  Can I get a loan using child support and rental income (14 year rental history) alone?  ($1.5m would still be fixer upper for something around 1,400 sq ft - sad, I know, and no, I'm not moving out of the area; this is home now.)

Should I look to buy the primary before doing anything on the rental so I don't have multiple transactions on my record, meaning either less to possibly borrow or a higher interest rate?  I know this probably wont be an option since 1) need to retitle shortly after settle (but say I had 6 months to do so; what should I want/ask for in settlement?) and 2) may take a while to find the right house.  But if the stars aligned and I did my timing right, would it be better to transact the primary residence first before the rental property?

Yes, there's a lot of expenses to consider too.  There's also some fudge factor in the numbers.  Aside from this, what're the most financially efficient things/order to do?",finance

defi,Payship: Truly Decentralizing Pool Based Cryptocurrency Lending Economics,"Cryptocurrency has created an entire financial subspace called Decentralized Finance which has taken the technology industry by storm. People are able to yield interest on their dormant crypto, gamble it, hedge it in a Non-Fungible Token, and even borrow against your portfolio using it as collateral. With the latter, decentralization is often forgotten on the technical level, with “interest rates and collateral factors on these lending platforms are decided either by algorithms with variables set by “leaders” or by governance voting dominated by “leaders.” The previous quote is from the Payship whitepaper, which plans to bring a truly decentralized cryptocurrency lending economy to the world.

Payship (***PSHP***) is an ERC20 Token (***Contract address: 0x88D59Ba796fDf639dEd3b5E720988D59fDb71Eb8***) that aims to accomplish the task of creating a crypto lending by following 6 models that breaks down the ecosystem. Payship allows you to use any ERC20 token as collateral. It allows you to stake ***PSHP*** to earn a portion of Payships income while also allowing you to vote on the future of Payship with ***PHSP.*** *Payship is also unique because collateral factors and interest rates are re-calculated every day with the rates depending on the performance of the entire ERC20 ecosystem*. On top of that, every rate has a 24 hour guarantee through the single recalculation once a day. In addition, after every deposit made to lend, you are given back the equivalent of that deposit in PSD, the Payship stable coin.

The first is a model that **allows all ERC20 tokens to be useful**. However, Payship will only recognize ERC20 tokens that are older than 90 days to prevent spamming.

The second is a model which allows all ERC20 tokens to be used as collateral through an algorithm which uses the global ERC20 market that identify the rate. This rate is determined by 3 factors, called the Stability factor, volume factor, and collateral factor. They are outlined in the white paper as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/71uag8e3khu51.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=062bc9fe9253aafc34f80f63582e711c1e0f00e0

Due to the design of this algorithm, no borrower would be able to receive 75% of their total value.

The third model states ***all ERC20 token deposits can earn interest, all ERC20 tokens can be borrowed provided there’s supply.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rzxl1j1ekhu51.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa3e9fae3bd172236e9bb2a337e0027e59ae4d8

&amp;#x200B;

The 4th model states **all ERC20 token deposits are insured towards lenders via the PSD stablecoin**. The intial supply of PSD will be generated during a LGE, or Liquidity Generating Event which will create a large portion of collateral for the ecosystem which in turn will provide stability. The 5th model states **all economic updates happen once a day at 09:00 AM UTC.** This is another example of decentralization playing a key factor in the ecosystem, as no one can manipulate update times.

Lastly, the 6th model states **all economic models can be adjusted internally during the beta period**. Further adjustments after full launch will be performed by the PayshipDAO. Following this model ensures the ecosystem is launched appropriately and effectively before being released to the PayShipDao so it can fulfill duties on behalf of the governance layer which will be implemented in the future.

The supply of the ecosystems native token ***PSHP*** will be 11,000 tokens. Distribution and subsequent rewards are outlined in 3 phases. The first phase begins after the 11,000 ***PSHP*** are minted, they will be distributed as follows:

* *1,000* ***PSHP*** *tokens are given away proportionally to the top 32 SwapShip (SWSH) holders based on an Oct 10, 2020 snapshot.*
* *4,000* ***PSHP*** *tokens are offered in a 5 day presale starting on Oct 12, 2020 with a starting price of 0.25 ETH per 1* ***PSHP***\*.\*
* *2,000* ***PSHP*** *tokens are reserved for DEX and/or CEX release. The first DEX launch will happen on Uniswap with a starting price of 0.4 ETH.*
* *2,000* ***PSHP*** *tokens are reserved for the team and locked after the presale for at least 6 months.*
* *2,000* ***PSHP*** *tokens are reserved for advisers, promotions and marketing.*

Phase 2 is known as the ***Pilot***, which wil last 14 days. “100% of Payship daily income denominated in PSD since the pilot launch of Payship will be distributed among wallets that connect to Payship and become active participants of lending and borrowing, proportionate to each wallet holdings’:

&amp;#x200B;

Phase 3 is known as the ***Soft Launch***: Every wallet that decides to stake PSHP in the Payship staking pool will receive daily PSD proportional to its stake and daily Payship income:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4iam2v2lkhu51.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6634e8696db8546d929a4161b84507d2f314039

Payship has also decided to experiment with a solution for reducing gas costs on the Ethereum network, which is outlined in full detail in their whitepaper. 

https://preview.redd.it/4kbgiegtkhu51.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb073f18a8371ae06f4bf0c23b911c1ec927d14

After outlining how Payship can present itself as a viable and trustless decentralized crypto lending and staking platform, its easy to see that its success and outlook is simply dependent on its usage. The team working on the project is in line to succeed, as Payship is one of the many parts of a larger ecosystem called RTC (Read This Contract).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yz3vyfaukhu51.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb2924bb67c28a11123d31179ea1936943f7f87

&amp;#x200B;

With the foundations made in this ecosystem, Payship looks to rise to the top and provide the first truly decentralized lending platform with automated rate updates.

cybersecurity,Next door neighbor hacked my phones camera,"I live in an apartment building, and 2 months ago, I discovered that my next door neighbor has been violating my digital  privacy. Let me start off my saying I practice general safety guidelines (i.e. Password protected phone/pc/wifi. I rarely use public wifi, but when I do it is from a trusted source, and I always strap up (vpn)).  They have hacked all my phones and pc. They have spoofed several of my phones, and my pc. They have accessed my wifi. They have never been in my place, and have never had access to my stuff. Despite  the precautions, I know for a fact that they can read my messages or what ever is on my phone screen (ex: if I text about a movie, I can hear them discussing it. If i open the camara app and and point it at my vacuume, i can hear them talking about my vaccume.)  It has gotten to the point that I will not use any device  while I'm home, because I think there ability to hack me is based on proximity. I don't know how they are doing it, or why for that matter. I am afraid that their access to my digital privacy, is much more invasive than I know. Please help me understand  how they are doing what there doing, and what I can do to stop it. Any help is appreciated.


Edit: I'm simply  looking for an explanation as to how they are able to do what they are doing, so I can put a stop to it.

Edit 2: A few days ago, when I checked my router, my pc was listed twice, with 2 different  mac addresses. There were 3 or 4 other devices (that weren't  mine) listed there as well.",technology

investing,"Investment Idea - Invest in securities with high yield/low volatility, invest in sector ETFs expected to increase","This is the new investment strategy I think will work over the next couple 5-10 years. I think high yield securities with high dividend yields are usually very very safe when it comes to price unless it’s Exxon(RIP). Most other securities have shown record highs in volitility due to the way the market has been. Also, I highly doubt I’ll beat the market, so investing in Clean energy/biomed/tech based ETFs is smarter than picking select companies and hoping you get the one that takes off. And then obviously add in some sort of total world etf/S&amp;amp;P 500 for some balance. I see absolutely no value in bonds due to low interest rates and negative returns on a lot of foreign bonds so why not treat your securities as a sort of bond with quarterly payouts, and ETFS for the risk with reinvesting of the dividends. Just a strategy that I see as being very good in returns in the future.",finance
personalfinance,Rent? Buy a House? Planning next steps after SO's graduation,"Hi! We're 27 and 29 and Here's the rundown of our current financial situation:

I have a decent job making 85k a year. 401k etc, all the good stuff. We have around 16k saved and are saving around 1k a month. Rent is $1200 and we own a 14k car (I know, not great...) with 320$ payments. My wife is only studying right now and will graduate from dental hygiene school next spring and we will owe around 12k in federal student debt.

Our biggest doubt right now is whether we should continue renting, or start preparing to buy a house. We honestly hate our current apartment so we **will** be moving soon, and any rent that's appropriate for us will be around that 1200 to 1500 price.

Right now I'm being conservative and doing all planning without taking into account any sort of income she might bring in after graduation. By then, we should have more than 20k saved, so what to do with it? Pay off the car? Pay off student loans? make a down-payment towards a house?

We're in northeastern US by the way, but we are recent immigrants. Still confused about many things and trying to figure it out.

Thank you for all the help!",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 21, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi’s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is “optimistic” about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell’s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans’ attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in “all-or-nothing obstruction” as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. “There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent — my goal — or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.” It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

solar,Who benefits from a clean energy stimulus?,"Hi! I've been thinking about this a lot, but obviously we don't have a lot of clear information so I wanted to see what you guys think...

If Biden / Dems win the election and we see a massive clean energy stimulus at some point in the next couple years, who in the solar section would benefit from such a stimulus? In terms of residential solar, are we expecting something similar to the federal tax credit on EVs? With so much stress (rightly so) on environmental and racial justice, would it be out of line for companies like Tesla to receive huge stimulus from the government / as opposed to subsidizing smaller energy installers? Are solar manufacturers immune from such politics? If x number of solar panels need to be produced regardless of who they are sold / installed through, does it matter to them? Nobody is immune to politics of course, and I imagine American companies will get extreme priority if there is such a stimulus, but can our American supply chain even meet such a demand?

Just some of the things I'm thinking about, but I am way less knowledgeable than most of you. Would love to hear some of your insight :)

Disclaimer: I invest (not a lot of money, but significant to me) in solar energy stocks so I am somewhat coming at it from that angle, but I'm also just curious how people are imagining the mechanics of clean energy stimulus playing out.",energy

personalfinance,BAD BB&amp;T Experience (8 years in the making),"**Typed earlier today**

I do not recommend BB&amp;T (now Truist) to anyone. I’ve had this bank since I got my first job at 15 years old. As a 23 year old with a new job and new life style, I opened a new savings and checking account with them (without my parents having access to either new account). All they had to do was transfer my money from those BB&amp;T accounts to the new accounts. When I say it has been a DISASTER - wow. I sat and opened these accounts over a month ago and am STILL dealing with them fixing issues they created. First, my accounts had different NEGATIVE amounts for about a week. -$36, then -$45, then -$58. I called to ask what happened and no one ever answered then finally I got some one and their explanation was “oh yeah the banker messed up somewhere, she’ll call and apologize and fix it”. Did she? Nope. Then, they sent my new debit card to the WRONG location which then cancelled my temporary card. 

I am a teacher so I called Apple Federal Credit Union (with raving reviews from others) and they created my accounts over the phone in LESS then 10 minutes. How is it possible that I sat inside at MY bank (during COVID) and it took over an hour, but a brand new brand bank did it completely remotely in less then 10 minutes. It’s mind blowing to me.

I called BB&amp;T to figure out how to close my accounts and they said and I quote “it’s so easy, just go to the drive thru!” So that brings me here in the lobby of my BB&amp;T Branch once again. I go to the drive thru and am told I have to go inside the lobby. I’m standing outside the building for about 20 minutes. Finally I just call and ask to be let in. She forgot about me between the drive thru and the parking lot! Now I’m waiting inside and it has been 30 minutes. Why would someone tell me this is a simple drive thru operation when I could’ve made an appointment instead of sitting here waiting. I am so sick of this place! I want to be objective and not emotional in this post but I am so frustrated that I’ve had this bank for almost 10 years and am treated this poorly. My savings account interest rate, by the way, 0.001%. Apple Federal 0.05%. 

MAKE THE SWITCH PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY TEACHERS! There is a better way. I’m typing this in the lobby of BB&amp;T and now it has been 40 minutes.  Wish me luck, and don’t bank here!",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Furlough Question,"So with Covid me and my wife filed for a furlough with our mortgage company, which was 3 months. 

With that being over, they are willing to extend it but we also had discussions about the past payments and basically we may have 2 options that can be discussed: 

Option one is to permanently change our loan to a 40 year versus the 30 year we are on, the interest rate would drop from 4.5 to 3 and would lower our payment by approx. 200$ a month, but would obviously mean a much longer payoff.

Option two is potentially just deferring the 3 payments  to the end of the term of the loan, keeping our current payment monthly and interest/term.

I’m thinking 2 is way more practical because we can still afford the monthly payment with being back at work, but I just want to make sure there wouldn’t be any reason anyone would think the other option is a more practical solution. The only thought I had that came to mind was lower mortgage payment could mean more money to allocate to pay off other existing debts such as credit cards/car loan.

personalfinance,Mortgage Points for Dummies - help me understand please,"tldr: I have googled a lot and as I understand it: 1 point will cost 1% of loan value up front and lower the interest rate 0.125%. Is my understanding correct? So paying 3.5% of the loan value up front would be buying 3.5 points and lower the rate 0.4375%?

I’m looking to refinance and have a few loan estimates. One is 3.5% (so that is 3.5 points?) of loan for an interest rate of 2.625 and the other is 2% (and this is 2 points?) of loan for an interest rate of 3.625. This is a ‘cash out’ refinance and one (Quicken aka Rocket) said I needed to make their “minimum of $150k” and they are the higher rate. That “minimum” pushes the LTV to 78% where the other estimate is around 71% LTV. No they are not 1:1 but pretty close. 

I guess the difference in rates in where the lenders compete because I don’t think they could even get down a full percentage point if I pushed for it and if they did I can’t imagine they would be competitive. 

I feel like I am missing something and this I’ve come here to see if someone can enlighten me. If the percentage of the loan they charge is directly equal to 1 point then I’m just trying to over complicate it. I want to understand. TIA",finance

**Initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week**

New US jobless claims fell to the lowest level since early March last week but remained elevated above 700,000, as the Trump administration and Democrats remained at odds over a broad package of economic aid under two weeks before the presidential election.

Initial applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 787,000, compared with 842,000 in the prior week, the US labour department said on Thursday. The figure was lower than economists’ forecast of 860,000 claims.

The federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programme, which offers benefits to the self-employed and others who would not qualify for regular benefits, registered 345,440 new claims on an unadjusted basis, up from 337,228.

The number of Americans actively collecting state jobless aid totalled 8.4m in the week that ended on October 10. That continued a positive trend in continuing claims, having dropped from 9.4m in one week and from 12.7m in the span of one month. However, economists have partly attributed the fall to unemployed workers exhausting regular benefits.

The insured unemployment rate, considered an alternative measure of joblessness, dropped to 5.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent.

Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, have continued stimulus negotiations into this week in a last-ditch attempt to hammer out an agreement before the poll.

Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday he was “optimistic” about the talks. “We do share one goal, and that is hopefully to get some kind of deal in the next 48 hours or so,” he told Fox Business. He added that funding for state and local governments was the biggest sticking point.

As coronavirus outbreaks in America’s south and west this summer faded, hopes for a steadier recovery in the labour market rose after big states including Florida and Texas loosened curbs on businesses.

But health officials have warned that other regions, particularly the Midwest, could be at risk of outbreaks. Wisconsin, where the rate of positive tests has hit highs this month, has emerged as a new virus hotspot. The north-east states of New Jersey and Connecticut have also reported a rise in infections after quelling earlier outbreaks.

Federal Reserve officials have warned that the economy’s rebound could sputter without further stimulus from Washington. Republicans in the Senate put forward another $500bn bill this week that would increase unemployment aid, among other measures, but it was blocked by Democrats before reaching a vote. Donald Trump has said he would support a bigger spending plan, while House Democrats have backed a $2.2tn proposal.

The jobless claims report showed that 23.2m people were claiming benefits in all state and federal programmes as of October 3, down from 24.2m, according to unadjusted figures that are reported on a two-week delay.

The US has recovered half of the 22m jobs lost in March and April, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7.9 per cent in September — below its pandemic-era peak of 14.7 per cent.",finance
personalfinance,"Had some savings in Schwab's Money Market fund, looking for a better alternative?","Some background:

I have a couple thousand in savings that I was trying to hold in low-risk, interest bearing accounts. Just enough out of reach that I can't easily spend it, but it's at least out there making money for me, too. I have other investments - that's a whole other thing.

Anyway, for a while I did short-term CDs, but found that Schwab's Money Market fund often gave the same yield as the 3 or 6 month CDs, and it was still inconvenient enough that I wouldn't touch it, but not so inconvenient that I'd hit a penalty if I needed it. It worked out well for the first year or so; I wasn't earning a bunch, but it was giving me a few bucks here and there.

....and then they cut the interest rate to zero. The 7-day yield has gone down to .03%. I haven't seen a dividend from this thing in 6 months. It's just inconvenient money that's not doing anything.

Which brings me to my question:

What are some other alternatives for storing the cash? 

So far all I've come up with is to move it to a high-yield checking account, which I don't really use much, as I solely opened the account for my car loan about a year ago. Problem is, I'd have to start making at least 15 debit card transactions every month to get the 3% APY, which defeats the purpose of having it somewhere I can't touch it. Though if I don't do the transactions, it puts the APY at %.05.

I could put it into an index fund or ETF, but I'm concerned about volatility.

My last thought was bonds, but that might make it a little too inaccessible, though not impossible.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay 20% equity to remove PMI?,"Hello everyone!

I was hoping to get some insight into whether or not it would make sense to allocate my funds to removing PMI on my home (new build purchased July 2020). Here are some figures:

House Cost: $339,950 with 5% down --&gt; principal of $322,953

PMI: $124/month

Interest rate: 2.99 on 30 year mortgage 

As of right now, I would need $49,881 in additional payments to reach 20% equity and remove PMI. Considering the interest rate is already so low and the PMI only amounts to $1,488/year, does it make sense to throw almost $50k into something so illiquid, or does it make more sense to just invest the money? 

Other than the mortgage, we are debt free (spent the last year paying off $120k in student loans, which is why we could only put 5% down) and make $220k/year in a MCOL area with no state taxes (including call/OT --&gt; without it, about $200k) and spend about $54,000/year total. We max out our IRAs/401ks/HSAs, so I think we are relatively well prepared for future retirement, so anything involving the house payoff is after taking advantage of retirement accounts. Just not sure if it's worth locking up so much money when the PMI is relatively low and a lot of our cash is already locked up in retirement.

personalfinance,Home Refinance Advice,"Hi Reddit

I'm planning on refinancing my home from a 30 year to a 15 fixed. I still have 25 years left this December. Current rate is 4.125%. Unpaid principal about 157k.

I've been shopping around but I'm getting lost in all the numbers as to what makes the best package. I'm hoping I could get a little more clarity here. Here are a few scenarios I've found as of today:

My credit union is offering 2.625% with closing costs at $4,638

Sebonic (found through bank rate) is offering 2.615% with $1,288 upfront costs. I'm guessing that doesn't include all fees for closing. 

My current lender is 3.5% at the lowest while using discount points so I've pushed them toward the back.

I tried plugging in numbers in the Zillow refinance calculator and it's showing a breakeven point at 240 months. I got confused because I thought I just had to see how much I saved a year between old and new interest rates and see how long that savings catches up to closing costs.

I have to give a precise number to go to the 457, so should I just subtract these numbers from the gross? I'll probably subtract a little extra just to give a little cushion so it doesn't screw up the system like it did last time I tried this.

stocks,"Thesis: Synopsys ($SNPS) is going to be one of the Best Buy’s is this decade. 1. Continued earnings growth. 2. Very Healthy balance sheet. 3. Great exposure to 5G, IoT, autonomous driving, semiconductors 4. Continued buybacks from the business","For background SNPS provides software for chip design and testing so there are not many competitors in the area. Also It isn’t often you see companies like this that are valued under $50B. The balance sheet is very healthy with over $1 billion of cash and minimal liabilities and long term debt which bodes well for when interest rates inevitably go back up in 2023 and beyond. Earnings and margins also continue to increase year of year. Margins most recently increasing over 5% from 2019 to 2020. 5G and autonomous driving are finally set to take off this decade too. Also they are doing hundreds of millions of buybacks every year. 

Do your research but my take is this is going to be one of the Best Buy’s of the decade... possibly increasing 10 fold for a $300B valuation

personalfinance,Home Loan Advice - NACA,"I am close to qualifying for a NACA loan, I'm not sure if many of you have heard of it but they have really low interest rates and some interest buy down opportunities. The process is really annoying, but if you're patient I believe it pays off. Essentially I am looking at two options for a $500,000 home. 

Option 1: 30 year mortgage at 2.5%, that I can for every $5,000 that I pay (not towards the principal just a fee) they will take .25% off of the loan interest rate up to $25,000. So I can buy it down to 1.25% for $25,000. 

Option 2: 15 year mortgage at 1.875%, that I can for every $5,000 that I pay (not towards the principal just a fee) they will take .25% off of the loan interest rate. I can buy this down to 0% for $37,500.

My question is which is preferable, the 15 year allows me to buy down the interest rate to essentially 0, but that's a high mortgage payment per month, and I will likely purchase a condo with a $1K HOA fee. I am just trying to see as many viewpoints as possible, and get an idea what math I should use to figure this out.

personalfinance,"Investment questions - TSP, PSLF, Roth IRA!","My wife recently got a job as a federal employee, so she's eligible to invest into TSP. She has student loans, and is working towards PSLF. We've regularly contributed to our roth IRAs (entirely into VFFVX), but our household income now exceeds the limit to be able to contribute to our roth IRAs.

For context, we are both in our early 30s with a child. We're looking to buy a house within the next 6 months or so, and we have enough to put 20% down. We want to maximize our retirement investment potential with any leftover savings.

Questions:

* Given her PSLF, we want to keep our AGI as low as possible, so we plan to max out her traditional TSP. I am superficially aware of the backdoor roth method; can this apply in this case, and if so, would it be more beneficial? Or is it better to just keep it in the TSP and choose a mixture of C/S/I funds to invest aggressively?

personalfinance,Medical bill payment options recommendation,"Hello, I am trying to determine the best way to handle this bill. I am capable of paying outright but the office offers interest free financing in house so I want to know if I should take advantage of it.

Total bill cost = $7250

Option 1. Downpayment of $1050 and 20 monthly payments of $310. This totals to $7250

Option 2 = $7250\*.93 = $6742.50 in a single payment. They offer a 7% discount for an upfront payment in cash or check.

Since they offer the deal on option 2 I'd like to view option 1 as a 7% interest rate of the life of the loan (20 months) but not sure if that's the right mindset. What is the effective interest rate in this case and would it be best to pay upfront?",finance

personalfinance,Buying vs renting - understanding Zillow monthly estimates,"I think I have a really dumb question on my hands for all of you.

I'm a total newbie when it comes to properties. But I had read that it often doesn't make **strictly financial** sense to purchase a property if the price to rent ratio was high - the general rule of thumb seemed to be quoted as 20. And most US cities have higher P/R ratios than 20. I was just going to stick whatever savings I had in ETFs.

Now, doing some searches for houses on Zillow (I was looking in DC, Baltimore and Boston) yields a bunch of attractive properties in attractive areas where the **estimated monthly cost of buying (including principle, interest, taxes and insurance) is lower than the monthly rental value.**

What am I missing here? Surely if you can buy a house and build equity at the same time, while paying a monthly amount comparable to (never mind *less than*!) renting, it's a total no-brainer? Granted, this assumes that the property price estimates on Zillow are reasonable, that I can obtain prime interest rates and put down a large down-payment, and that I'm willing to go through the hassle.

But is that it?  I'm scratching my head looking for the catch.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on optimal refinance strategy,"Hey PF,

Recently my wife and I have been looking into refinancing due to historically low interest rates. We have a couple of different options and I'd really appreciate any input from this sub.

**Current Situation**

Primary residence valued at roughly 380k. We have approx 160k and 16 yrs left on a 20yr loan at 3.5%.
Investment Property (townhome) valued at roughly 200k. We have approx 125k and 29 years left on a 30yr loan at 3.8%.
In talking through options with our mortgage person we've come up with the following potential options.

**Option 1**

* Primary residence - refi to a 15yr for 280k at 3.0%
* Investment Property - pay off mortgage with cash out from primary residence refinance

**Option 2**

* Primary residence - refi to a 15yr at 2.5%
* Investment Property - refi to a 30yr at 2.7%

My original plan was to pay off our primary residence as fast as possible and keep/leave any risk on the investment property. This way if the economy takes a dump, we could always let the investment property go and hold onto our primary residence. I'm leaning toward option 1 here though as it would completely pay off one mortgage and would mean we could potentially have it all paid off in 15 years.

Curious on your overall thoughts/opinions. Is option 1 the best course of action? Is there an option I'm not considering?

personalfinance,High-Yield Liquidity Questions,"Hey everybody,

First off- I know this question has been asked many times before. Asking now due to 1) changing market info, specifically APY rates, and 2) my somewhat-unique financial situation.
TLDR; student w/ very limited monthly expenses, potential for tuition costs appearing in the next 1.5 years. trying to figure out how much of a security fund I should have, and where I should put that cash.

I'm a student (21M) who is fortunate to have my most of my tuition covered by a private scholarship, which runs out at the end of this academic year. I expect another half year or so of school after that (graduation winterish 2022) to finish my degree (planning to apply for my scholarship funding and am in no rush to join a COVID-decimated workforce w/ a degree in geography). I'm also fortunate to not have housing or vehicle costs- I alternate between my family home and my partner's place, so all I'm paying is gas/a plane ticket every few months. My parents are grateful that I am handling my education myself and provide me with a  stipend ($250/month) that covers food and other small expenditures. I am also fortunate to be healthy and on their health insurance and phone plan.

My questions for you all:
Firstly, **How much money should I keep in my rainy-day fund?**
Knowing I can always fall back on my folks and my lack of big outstanding costs have incentivized me to invest a very high proportion of my savings (boglehead style). I expect that the TOTAL tuition costs for the rest of school will sit at around $5k, and imagine my living situation will be pretty similar a year for now given COVID and telework shifts. 
Two other relevant points of info: 
-I can reasonably expect a summer income of $10-15k next year. That work is in a very COVID-vulnerable industry (wilderness tourism) and summer 2020 I still was able to work quite a bunch.
-I think my chances of getting more funding through either my institution or my private scholarship organization are pretty strong.


Secondly, assuming that the rainy day fund has been determined, **where should that shit go?**
I looked into high yield savings/checking accounts, but the variable interest rates kind of spook me. Posts like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bkvn8f/a_quick_comparison_of_highyield_savings_accounts/) have been helpful to an extent, but even just a year later, things have changed significantly- APRs from the mid 2%s to between 0.5 and 0.8%.
High yield checking accounts have potentially way higher rates (and don't seem to have followed the APY decline of their savings counterparts) but a lot of the good ones have all kinds of hoops to jump through, monthly transactions, etc and when I'm looking at only having a couple thousand in them it doesn't seem worth the hassle. Plus, their rates are also subject to change at any time. Any thoughts on these?

I've also been looking into bond index funds as an alternative semi-liquid option and actually (somewhat heedlessly) ordered a chunk of the vanguard bond index on Robinhood a few weeks ago. What do folks think about this as an option? Is it totally stupid to put money into bonds with overall interest rates so low right now? An index investment seems relatively involatile if I'm looking at a 1-3 year timeframe, and I don't have to manage anything.

I'd ruled out CDs, buying real bonds, and other instruments that lock up my cash for precisely that reason. Are there other tools out there I'm overlooking?


Thirdly, (and most abstractly), **what of my habits/risk assessments do I need to change once I pivot into real, salaried, grown-up life?** I obviously know a bit about maxing out 401(k)s, diversifying assets, mortgages, and the like. Wondering more about the perspective shifts that come from the responsibilities of full-functioning adulthood. What else will I need to start factoring in? I am obviously in a very priviliged situation  (family support, moderate social capital, no debt, education) and want to set myself up to contribute as much back as possible while enjoying high quality of life. Since money plays an unfortunately major role in making things happen, it seems pertinent to get everything dialed in as much as it can be.

personalfinance,Investing kid's savings?,"My goal is to have $10000+ for each of my 3 kids when they move out to give them a cushion or what not. I've nearly achieved this after my parents gifted us some money a few weeks ago. I'll probably bump it up to $15000 each.

Ages are 15, 13, and 11. Right now the money is parked in a ""high"" interest rate account in wealthfront earning a whopping 0.35%. I'm tempted to put the money in my investment account lump sum and earn a little extra to go towards the goal.

personalfinance,Family is moving to a new state with a lot of surplus money but no substantial cash inflow as of now. How should I best manage the money?,"Long story short, my mother, sister and I are moving from California to Texas. We had to move on relatively short notice so I haven't been able to find a job quite yet before out we head out there, which is the next few weeks. Because of the obvious disparity of house prices between the two states, we ended up with a net profit of about 135k from the sale of the house, factoring all the real estate expenses, taxes, etc. In name it's my mother's money, but I'll be the one to handle where it goes and how it is spent for the most part.

This is a fair amount of money that will last us a while, but obviously we can't go crazy with it. The only cash flow we would have would be my mother's social security benefits which is 1k a month.

Moving expenses and new furniture/appliances are going to eat some of that and my mother wants to pay me back for the personal money I spent on renovations (25k), I'm going make a estimate that about 100k is going to be left over. How should I best manage the money that's left over until my sister or I find a job?

I'll also be making a budget and trying to maintain it so the money doesn't disappear on extraneous expenses.

General advice is welcome, but here are some specific questions.

1. Currently the money is money is in a Trust Savings Account over at Chase, but the interest rate isn't the best, so it would probably be better for the majority of it to sit in some other account?
2. My mom offered to pay off my sister's and my student loans with the leftover money. We have 14k and 16k in loans respectively. My sister is all for it, so that's probably another 14k to subtract. I, on the other hand, think that I can eventually pay it off and I have enough saved up that I don't need to worry about the monthly payments so I'd rather just keep the money for a rainy day. In this situation would you more like my sister or me?
3. This is a question about my personal finance rather than the leftover money. Assuming I take the 25k that I'm owed, that 25k was initially just sitting in a Chase savings account until I needed to pull it out for the renovations. If I were to take it, I'd have 8k in my Checkings and 30k in my Savings. After reevaluation, 30k is too much for an emergency fund. So I've been thinking about maybe just paying off my student loan outright or invest it. Then whatever is left over I put into a high yield savings account.

Also worst case scenario we have family in the area that have said they'd be willing to help us financially if anything happens, so we have some sort of safety net there as well.",finance

cybersecurity,Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Compromises U.S. Government Targets,"This joint cybersecurity advisory—written by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)—provides information on Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actor activity targeting various U.S. state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) government networks, as well as aviation networks. This advisory updates joint CISA-FBI cybersecurity advisory AA20-283A: APT Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities Against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure, and Elections Organizations.

Since at least September 2020, a Russian state-sponsored APT actor—known variously as Berserk Bear, Energetic Bear, TeamSpy, Dragonfly, Havex, Crouching Yeti, and Koala in open-source reporting—has conducted a campaign against a wide variety of U.S. targets. The Russian state-sponsored APT actor has targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation networks, attempted intrusions at several SLTT organizations, successfully compromised network infrastructure, and as of October 1, 2020, exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers.

The Russian-sponsored APT actor is obtaining user and administrator credentials to establish initial access, enable lateral movement once inside the network, and locate high value assets in order to exfiltrate data. In at least one compromise, the APT actor laterally traversed an SLTT victim network and accessed documents related to:

Sensitive network configurations and passwords.
Standard operating procedures (SOP), such as enrolling in multi-factor authentication (MFA).
IT instructions, such as requesting password resets.
Vendors and purchasing information.
Printing access badges.
To date, the FBI and CISA have no information to indicate this APT actor has intentionally disrupted any aviation, education, elections, or government operations. However, the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize SLTT government entities.

As this recent malicious activity has been directed at SLTT government networks, there may be some risk to elections information housed on SLTT government networks. However, the FBI and CISA have no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised. Due to the heightened awareness surrounding elections infrastructure and the targeting of SLTT government networks, the FBI and CISA will continue to monitor this activity and its proximity to elections infrastructure.

Add to that the trade war and other uncertainties, US stocks(especially the tech stocks, these are the ones that are actually distorting price of VOO or similar ETFs) may have a meh decade ahead of it just as foreign stocks have had a meh decade in the 2010s.

defi,InfinityDefi(INFI): The Like of COMP,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wlukm7tc6tu51.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43872ddeeb814058d51fd66e475abf1930279033)

Thanks to the emergence of new smart contract platforms (like decentralized finance), Ethereum yet again became the most popular kid on the crypto block in 2020.

Ethereum has countless DApps, but InfinityDefi (INFI) has caught our eye because it has been soaring wild.

### What is INFI?

INFI is the ecosystem token of InfinityDefi. INFI holders can participate in project management and control its financial risks, sharing project dividends in return, which serves for the stability, transparency, and efficiency of the protocol. Like Compound, InfinityDefi also does decentralized lending with deposit interest and collateralized loans.

InfinityDefi beats the traditional DeFi lending with:

* low pledge ratio (10 to 20% lower than mainstream platforms)
* cross-platform secondary loans (use your collateral from other platforms for secondary loans on InfinityDefi)
* low interest on loans (10% lower than the mainstream average)
* high interest on deposits (higher than the mainstream average)
* low fees
* MVA loans (multi-value-added loans: when your collateral currency value increases by 33%, you can borrow the value-added part)
* a wide range of supported currencies (Dai, USDT, USDC, TUSD, BUSD, HUSD, HT, and OKB)

### What rights does INFI entitle to?

INFI governance rights include:

* addition or removal of a cryptocurrency supported for collateral;
* adjustment of redemption and liquidation fees;
* adjustment of pledge ratio and interest rate;
* polymerization Pool profit distribution;
* selection of nodes for price feeder;
* triggering of the emergency mechanism and shutdown;
* issue of InfinityDefi derivatives;
* launch of InfinityDefi operations, maintenance, and marketing.

### How to get INFI?

INFI total supply is limited to 21 million tokens 30.5% of which is reserved for conversion to PPT (InfinityDefi’s equity token).

Reserve for the future derivatives applications: 39.5%  
Community, market: 15%  
White List: 5%  
Team: 10%

At project launch, users can apply to join InfinityDefi White List and get INFI.

During the first 96 hours after the launch, users have special PPT rewards that can be exchanged to INFI. After the event, PPT is distributed only for deposits, collateralized loans, and secondary loans.

InfinityDefi Foundation will not keep any INFI and will give up all voting rights. Independent team members will have the voting rights.

### INFI soars. What valuation model backs it?

InfinityDefi is similar to Compound, MakerDAO, and Aave, but is more competitive.

As of 08:00 UTC Sep 30, 2020,  
the price of Compound’s COMP is $135, circulating market cap is $436.9 million  
MakerDAO’s MKR is priced $520, circulating market cap is $469.9 million  
Aave’s LEND is priced US$0.53, circulating market cap is $671.6 million

**Trend analysis:** MKR and COMP are not worth investing before changing their tokenomics. LEND is risky. Users should diversify investments.

**Vertical analysis of pros and cons:**

MakerDAO (MKR): repayment of Dai (USD) loans incurs the Stability Fee of X% (centralized decisions). According to the Stability Fee, MKR is burned and Dai is deposited to DSR. MKR is able to issue additional tokens to manage the liquidation risks. MKR is currently the basis for Compound / Aave funds. Users can only deposit limited collateral and can only lend the platform’s own USD stablecoin DAI. Its net interest rate is expressed as the Stability Fee.

Compound (COMP): This token’s only rights are voting on changes in Compound protocol rules. The token has been released recently. COMP is distributed to users based on their deposited/borrowed assets.

Aave (LEND): 0.025% interest on loans (0.09% on flash loans), 20% is paid to the platform and 80% is used to burn LEND. Good flat and floating interest rates. Great flash loan platform.

InfinityDefi (INFI): Floating deposit and loan interest rate, low pledge ratio, low interest on loans, cross-platform secondary loans. INFI is the tool for voting and ecosystem management.

Instead of a summary.

INFI has the potential to reach COMP’s price and a $1B market cap.

personalfinance,Whole Life Insurance Options,"When I was born my dad took out a $50k whole life policy, and once I graduated college he signed it over to me as a gift (about 5 years ago). I haven’t put much thought into it at all since then, other than getting the annual statements in the mail. Over the past 2 years I’ve been developing an interest in personal finance, and I feel pretty good about my wife and my financial situation. So with what I’ve learned over the past couple years when I got the annual statement this past month, I naturally, decided to actually look more into it. It’s a $50k policy that’s paid up, has ~$33k in paid up additions, and it’s cash value is $13k. After looking at the past few years’ statements I realized it’s only growing at 0.2%, so in my head I’m thinking “jeez I could be doing a lot more with this money.”

So now my wheels are turning trying to figure out what options I have to make this money do more work for me. The thing is, if I cash it out I’ll end up with only $13k, whereas the current death benefit is the $50k + $33k paid up additions, so $83k. But if I were to just take that $13,000 and throw it in an S&amp;P index fund (assuming 7% growth) it would be worth much more than $83k in 35 years, which is when I’ll likely be retired. I know I can also take a loan for up to 90% of the cash value at a 4% interest rate, so I’ve also considered doing that, putting it in an index fund and just paying loan interest each year. That way, I’d have another, more aggressive investment, AND I’d be able to keep the death benefit less the loan amount to help my family in the event that, God forbid, I die early. But... then I have a pesky interest bill to pay each year, but maybe that’s a small price to pay.

So I’m honestly just curious what you would do if you were in my situation? Do I cash out the whole thing and invest the $13k? Do I take a loan out, invest that, pay the interest and keep the policy? Or do I just leave it alone for the rest of my life? 

FYI - I have a $750k term life insurance policy, so I don't necessarily need this whole life policy. We have no debt other than our mortgage, which is $270k, and our combined annual income is around $135k.",finance
personalfinance,Microsoft &amp; cancellation period issue!,"I purchased a bunch of Microsoft gift cards on 22nd Sep for our in-laws birthday which was on 1st Oct with the belief that they were instant, or at worst, would be received within 48 hours max. After 3 days I contacted MS and was told that they weren’t authorised by my card issuer so I contacted them. They subsequently informed me that the payment had been authorised our end and that it was down to MS to complete the transaction. 

A few days later I contacted MS again and was again told it wasn’t their issue. Now running out of time I again contacted my card issuer and told them I was fed up and wished to cancel the transaction. They informed me that after 7 days if MS hadn’t finalised the transaction that it would be cancelled. I then went onto the MS website and tried cancelling them via there however there was no option. After the 7 days had passed I checked my card &amp; it had been cancelled.

Over the next few weeks I kept checking the MS purchases and whilst they were still showing they were stuck saying pending! I assumed they would just fall off once a certain time had passed however after spending 2+ hours speaking with MS I really didn’t want to call them again.

On 22nd Oct (a full month after the purchase) Microsoft put the payment through. I immediately contacted them and was told a refund request was made and I’d hear from them in due course. A few hours later I received a very short reply stating that they could t provide a refund as it was longer than their refund policy allows for digital products. I responded stating that not only did I believe it had been cancelled but that the purchase was made on 22nd Oct and they didn’t put it through until 22nd Oct. I received another email stating they’d closed the case!

This morning I called and spoke with them directly. After about 40 mins the rep said that I could ‘always just sell them if I wanted’. I told them I should have to do this. I was then told to request a refund online. I told him that I’d tried to do this previously but the option was never there, nor was there an option to cancel. After walking me through it he then directed me to the Xbox website. I informed him that the purchase was done on MS website and nothing to do with Xbox. He insisted so I tried and after visiting the refund section in Xbox I was able to see the gift cards and request a cancellation. He then told me that I may have to put it through several times as it will probably get rejected but that I should keep trying!

So where do I stand with this? The payment was put through on my credit card however I thought I’d at least give MS the chance to rectify it.

Thanks in advance.",finance

So, the GuardaWallet Team has prepared a small step-by-step guide for $COMP Farming. Check it out -","[Guarda Wallet](https://guarda.com/?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=how_to_farm_comp) has prepared a small tutorial on how to make a deposit to the platform. You can read more in detail in our [Guarda Academy](https://guarda.com/academy/?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=how_to_farm_comp).

Compound step-by-step: 

1. So, we’ll start, perhaps, with the most fundamental part — buying ERC-20 tokens.

2. Once you have purchased ERC-20 tokens, you need to tie your wallet with Compound Finance. In order to do this, you need to go to Compound Finance website, and on the main screen click on the App button.

3. The next step is about the connection to the wallet.

4. After the connection, a panel opens with a list of available cryptocurrencies, their balances, and interest rates on Supply and Borrow.

Then, in the control panel, you need to select which cryptocurrency to put (deposit) on the platform. Compound rewards its users both for providing assets for credit (Supply) and for obtaining credits (Borrow). To get the most out of it, users take both sides of the deal. They make a deposit, take out a loan, and deposit it again.

HSA: $2000

Trad IRA: $8400

Roth: $500

Taxable: about $3200 combined

I feel so late to the game at my age. My strategy is to max out the HSA and Roth every year. But after that...? My choices:

1) fully max out my 401k ($19,500)
2) put that money towards taxable account
3) a combination of both

Taxable account would prolly be dividend stocks. my issue with option 3 is that compound interest yields more when there’s more money stuffed into one account and less when money is divided. Any guidance is appreciated, thank you!

ethereum,"Raoul Pal and Michael Saylor's Bitcoin vs Ethereum analysis is deeply flawed, and here is why.","**Regarding the Bitcoin vs Ethereum narrative**

Allocating capital in Bitcoin but not in Ethereum is a bet that the planned road-map for Ethereum will not be successfully implemented and/or its economic properties will not function as designed once the final phase of ETH 2.0 goes live. The combination of PoS, sharding and EIP-1559 will allow for a monetary policy that can sustain the system with zero, possibly negative, issuance. Detailed explanations of how this is possible has been documented through numerous interviews and blogs with developers and pundits. We also must take into consideration that even if the issuance is above zero, the returns from staking Ether must be accounted to compare the long-term holding value proposition against something like Bitcoin. If the staking rewards provide \~3% annual returns and issuance is \~2% then the equivalent issuance for a PoW protocol would be \~-1% (this will never happen in the Bitcoin protocol).

**Addressing the claim that Ether is not money**

The narrative that Ether is not money because the Ethereum protocol is not designed to exclusively function as money is akin to saying that the Internet is not a good emailing system because it is not exclusively designed to transmit emails. This type of narrative is trying to restrict the definition of money by suggesting that its underlying protocol should not have functionality that extends beyond the conventional way we think of it. The reality is that Ethereum is much better suited for a digital economy - Ether is its native monetary asset. The ability to issue other forms of digital assets and execute computer logic in a trustless unified system with a natively defined monetary asset encompasses all the fundamental building blocks of a future digital economy. This is a future where monetary, financial and information systems can take advantage of the inclusiveness, permissionless and trustless aspects that are central to the Bitcoin value proposition.

The Ethereum protocol is designed to do a lot of wonderful things, but it costs money to operate the network and that cost must be covered by something of value that can be easily liquidated or exchanged into other things of value.... otherwise known as money. The idea that Ether is more akin to oil than gold/money just because the price metric for computations is called ""gas"" falls apart under scrutiny. Ether is strictly used as a monetary incentive. It is not magically burned to propel a fictitious machine that runs the network... the computers that run the Ethereum network run under the same physical principles from the ones of Bitcoin - they consume energy and someone has to pay for it. It just so happens that the monetary rewards and cost of transactions operating the Ethereum network are done exclusively in Ether, and therefore it serves as a monetary base. In addition, Ether has been used as the monetary base for the acquisition of other digital assets during their ICO phase. Lastly, Paypal has revealed they will be including Ether as a means of payment for online merchants. Saying that Ether is not money is like saying the sky isn't blue.

**Additional thoughts**

1. The combination of staking, EIP-1559 and sharding will allow ETH to reduce issuance ahead of Bitcoin's schedule. It is very likely going to allow for sustainable zero issuance which is something that is still up in the air for Bitcoin.
2. The switch from PoW to PoS will dramatically reduce the operational cost of the network while incentivizing ownership of Ether. The reduction in operational cost is a huge factor contributing to a sustainable monetary policy.
3. The true soundness of Ether as a store of wealth needs to account for the returns from staking. That means that even if the nominal issuance remained higher than Bitcoin, it could still a better investment when you account for the staking returns.
4. Ethereum can operate as an entire financial system. It allows for issuance of new tokens and it can operate autonomously as a digital assets exchange... so that means that it can be an exchange for tokenized FIAT currencies, cryptocurrencies, tokenized securities and commodities. Think of a global market for stocks, commodities, future contracts and derivatives.
5. The integration with digital assets is done natively in one network. Ethereum serves as a native monetary asset with sound properties. Tokenized bitcoins would not only significantly reduce security (value would be lost if EITHER network is compromised) it also makes little sense if Ethereum's soundness (staking - issuance) is superior to Bitcoin.
6. There are a gazillion more use cases for Ethereum that would benefit from having a natively defined monetary asset.
7. Ultimately Bitcoin might serve as digital gold as a hedge against Ethereum. So they can coexist, but they are still competing with each other in terms of building value. Every investor who is getting into cryptocurrencies should be asking what assets to buy and why. Money allocated to Bitcoin cannot be allocated to Ethereum and vice-versa.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is it time to sell our house?,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here. 

DH and I purchased a small ranch in February 2018 for $115K with an FHA loan (3.5% down and 4.6% interest rate). Right before we moved in, the owner had gutted the kitchen and redone 2 of the 3 bathrooms. It's fairly small, like 1000sqft and has a half finished basement. We did some other updating since we have moved in (putting in can lights, painting all doors and trim white, etc) 

Currently we owe $109k on the house and our cost of living is very far beneath our means, which has allowed us to start paying off debt quickly and save. By next August all that will be left is the mortgage and student loans and we will have roughly $2,500 a month in our budget of money that is not tied to any bills that we will be free to save or pay off on student loans each month. 

My delimma is this. The public school system in the city is BAD, like really bad. 1/10 on all great schools bad. We could send our child to private school but that is upwards of $20k a year in tuition and we make way to much money to qualify for tuition assistance. So we need to move in under 5 years regardless. 

My step dad is a realtor and did a price match for us yesterday and he thinks our house could list for the low $160's and would potentially sell for the mid $150's. We would walk with about $32-35ish grand and paired along with our savings we could have 20% down on a $250k house to get rid of PMI, and the rates are incredibly low right now. The problem is the market where we are is super hot and while we very much are not upside down in this house we could potentially be in the next house. 

I would really like to take advantage of the up market with our current home since it is in the city. The houses here don't move very fast in a down market but people are desperate since there is low inventory. 

What (financially) makes the best sense for us? Should we just hunker down in our cheap house and possibly miss out of making some $ on our home to continue paying things off?",finance

I need a car, like really badly, as in “drove my 20 year old Volvo with 200,000+ miles until it requires a repair (new engine) more expensive than the car itself is worth” badly. My fiancée and I have been getting by with sharing, but that’s about to become unsustainable. 

Here’s the deal: my credit score is “in repair” bad because of medical debt I incurred when I had no insurance. I’m in the process of sorting it out, but that’s not where I need advice.

I’m looking at trying to get a used car around $5,000-$8,000. My APR, using online calculators, looks insane with my credit, like 20%. My fiancée is willing to co-sign for it and her credit score is in the 700+ range (she has like $30,000 in credit available to her). I have about $3,000 I can put down in cash. We both have steady, well paying jobs. 

I’ve considered several things: 1) trying to negotiate my interest rate down, explaining the circumstances of my debt, having her as a co-signer, and making that significant of a down payment. 2) trying to wait and make the other $2,000 and buy outright, but I’m unsure if I can go that long. 3) buy it outright now with my $3,000 cash and my lovely fiancée being willing to put the other X amount on her credit card and I would make payments on her card like a car payment and try to make larger ones as possible. 4) buy a cheaper car that I can buy outright right now, but I’m concerned about the mileage range and age that puts the cars in. I’m trying to stay around 80,000-120,000 miles.

stocks,Seemingly shady 401k Investment,"I was looking to move some of my 401k money invested in stocks into T-Bills but my 401k doesn't offer a mutual fund that invests in T-Bills. It offers this product by Invesco called the Invesco Stable Value Trust ([https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/collective-trust-funds/products/product-detail?audienceType=Dc&amp;fundId=87](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/collective-trust-funds/products/product-detail?audienceType=Dc&amp;fundId=87)). The problem I have with the fund is although it uses T-Bills as a benchmark, it actually invests the money into a number of insurance companies through ""wrap"" contracts. 

Digging deeper I see two statements that worry me about SEC and CFTC oversight:

"" No Registration Under U.S. Federal or State Securities Laws. The Fund will not be registered with the SEC as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) in reliance upon an exemption from the Investment Company Act; therefore, the provisions of the Investment Company Act applicable to registered investment companies (i.e., mutual funds) are not applicable to the Fund. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration under U.S. federal securities laws and, accordingly, this Fund Description does not contain information that would otherwise be included if registration were required. Similar reliance has been placed on exemptions from securities registration and qualification requirements under applicable state securities laws. No assurance can be given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under one or more exemptions due to, among other things, the manner of distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or the retroactive change of any securities laws or regulation. ""

"" No Registration with the CFTC. Since the Fund may purchase, sell or trade exchange-traded futures contracts, options thereon, and other commodity interests, the Fund may be viewed as subject to regulation as a commodity pool under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and the rules of the CFTC. However, pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5, the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator with respect to the Fund. The Trustee has filed an exemption notice to effect the exemption and will comply with the requirements thereof. As a result, the Trustee, unlike a registered commodity pool operator, is not required to deliver a disclosure document or certified annual report to participating trusts. Nevertheless, all participating trusts will receive a copy of the Declaration of Trust as well as an annual report for the Fund. The Sub-Adviser, a registered commodity trading advisor under CFTC regulation, will provide commodity interest trading advice to the Fund as if it were exempt from registration as a commodity trading advisor with respect to the Fund pursuant to CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(8)(i)(B).

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it’s possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it’s up to President Trump. She said, “We put pen to paper… we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it… we could do that before the election if the president wants to.” Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that “the ball’s not really moving much right now” in discussions, and that he “doesn’t want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.”

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate, Joe Biden warned of a “dark winter coming” and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was “going away” and that the US is “rounding the corner.” These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number’s perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

personalfinance,24 and looking for advice on retirement and savings,"Hi friends.

I see a lot of posts about where to put your money to save. Would you kindly tell me the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the following items I keep see popping up:

401k, HSA, Roth IRA.

Personal info:
I make 72k and my employer matches 401k contributions up to 7%. I put in 15% with an aggressive profile. 

I have 75k student debt (50 private). I typically pay double or a little over double my minimum payment. The extra money goes to the principal of highest interest loans. I paused payment on fed loans until interest comes back. About 3k savings for emergencies 

I am about to get married and my spouse will be starting his job in January. Once we move in together I will have extra money since the expenses will be in half. Where do I put this to be most effective?

Thank you",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Using AWS Rekognition To Automatically Grade Surgical Residents - Thoughts?,"We’ve been experimenting using [AWS Rekognition Custom Labels](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) to recognize good and bad suturing by medical residents in the hopes of one day incorporating this into our video assessment tool the [Skills Evaluation Station](https://info.sessimulations.com/). We’ve heard from several surgeons we work with that grading surgical assessments videos is laborious and time consuming work. In some cases, there are too many students to grade, the videos are too long and there is not enough time, meaning sometimes these assessments simply never happen so we wanted to see, could machine learning help us out?

https://preview.redd.it/qkij8tfy3xu51.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a99f4fd22cbbea01feaab83310eca0d2090b9ca

Our idea, which actually came from [another conversation on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/surgery/comments/jce9oc/using_ai_to_assess_wound_suturing_thoughts/g91b4by?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), was to draw a grid on a suture pad and have students attempt to suture the mock wound. Surgeons would then identify the finished grid images on the pads as good or bad. We'd feed these images into AWS Rekognitition custom labels, train the machine learning algorithm and then test it with other images to see how it did. Here's the idea of the grid on paper, we fed this through AWS first to see if it could recognize the grid and the broken grid as different, which it did no problem because it was black on white.

https://preview.redd.it/yqu2w5444xu51.png?width=1322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=783660565cd44e32f605f73a3d55fe8deb53f237

Now we had to train our model to recognize good and bad sutures on actual suture pads.  We were concerned that the model would have trouble with the lines because we couldn't draw really well on the suture pads.

https://preview.redd.it/f9hxe6b94xu51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffa2e60e0e611f39eda600ca2accaf12295eaf75

But it actually wasn't a problem.  We were able to train our model to recognize one kind of grid as good suturing and another as bad suturing. So that was promising, it didn't seem to have a huge problem with the lines. When we uploaded our test image, drum roll please........it worked! It was able to recognize it as a good suture.

The actual response from AWS is a JSON object containing a confidence score, the location of the object in the image and its size.

https://preview.redd.it/o28rft8l4xu51.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66187b8ba6b3b28b34fb0f06a846908d13de331d

Our model also recognized a bad suture on a test image as well.

Using AWS Rekognition was super easy, I did not write any code, I drew bounding boxes and labeled them and then used a command line API call to test it, it cost about $1 to run the model. Make sure to turn off your model when you are done 'running' it, AWS will charge you per hour to run it and then you'll have to beg them to refund you the money later.  I've been there, it sucks.

stocks,Where do you all see stocks going for the next 30-40 years?,"Hi everyone :)

Hugely speculative question I know, and one that is obviously asking you to predict the future wayyyy in advance. Everyone knows the stock market (S&amp;P 500) has returned 10% a year before inflation with dividends reinvested, over the last 40 years or so. I'm 21 now, and looking to start building a portfolio. I missed the covid crash, I didn't really have the funds to build a position but in the next year or two am hoping to. My main concern is this pre conceived notion that if you wait long enough, stocks always go up. However, looking at other markets, such as the Japanese market that still has an all time high set in 1989, and the chinese market which still hasn't got back to 2008 levels I am concerned that US stocks might not do the same they've done for the last 40 years. If you were to give the S&amp;P the same 7% before inflation gains it's had (excluding dividends here), you'd be looking at a price of 50,000 in the year 2060, which looks absolutely crazy to me. Other factors which fuel my worries are the fact population growth will slow, so economic growth will stagnate. Debt has also never been higher and if interest rates ever go up, tens of thousands of companies would likely be out of the game forever. Maybe I'm an idiot suggesting this, but I wanted to get people's take on the macroeconomic view. 

Thank you :)",finance
investing,Opinions on Municipal Bonds?,"I'm at a point in my life / career where I have acquired a fair amount of wealth. I'm in a higher tax bracket and reside in California. I normally keep the majority of my stocks in tech and more speculative stocks and I'm looking to diversify some at this point.

My personal opinion is that I believe the stock market is now slightly overvalued and I've read a few articles that speculate the same. I know all the stimulus talks are keeping it afloat, but it still feel it's a bit high.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble)

However, despite me believing it is slightly overvalued I'm not very keen on pulling out of my current holdings. I think they are all strong for 5-10 years.  I would rather move for a brief make any new investments into something more stable (bonds). It seems to me that Municipal Bonds are more effective than other options (Treasury, Corporate, TIPs, etc) because they somewhat uniquely provide a good combination of

* Not likely to default
* Tax efficient (federal and state)
* Solid yields

I also read this article discussing some of the risks and benefits and helps explain how they help punch above their weight as you get into the higher tax brackets. I also thought it was interesting that they recommended diversifying state municipals during the pandemic in case of a risk of a State defaulting

**Questions**

1. Should I worry about diversifying states in municipal bonds, or should I go all in California to take full advantage of State tax exemptions?
2. Does anyone have any other strong considerations / worries about municipal bonds?
3. Or should I focus on something else?

I'm not interested in actively hunting / looking for the best municipal bonds - I likely would pick one of these 3 ETFs

* MUB (Diversified with .07% expense)
* VTEB (Diversified with .06% expense)
* CMF (California focused with .25% expense)

personalfinance,New immigrant wanting to go to university. How can I afford this?,"Hello!I'm a newly minted US permanent resident. Currently, I'm a first-year student studying economics at an American (US accredited) university abroad in my home country with not a lot of opportunities. I can't afford college in the US. However, my brother is going to be graduating with a masters in engineering in spring. He can then offer me to stay in his place and go to university. He offered to help pay the tuition, but I'm going to try to do this on my own. Economics is a fun subject, however I'd like to transition to computer science in case I have the liberty of taking my time at a community college and then transferring to a better state school knowing I most probably would've gained state residency by then. That would only be possible if I had the liberty of not paying for rent or any other expenses, so just in the case that my brother finds a job.

&amp;#x200B;

That is one plan. However, knowing that my brother's field is very niche, I'm not very hopeful of him finding a job right out of graduation. Thus I'd like to devise a backup plan. I was thinking that I could transfer to accounting at a cheap university such as BYU without losing many credits. I have good grades, straight As, 1330 SAT, but there are almost no good universities that offer scholarships to transfer students. So I need to figure out a way to pay / budget for BYU or any other cheap university. I was thinking FAFSA, internships at Big 4 if I get lucky, try to get a continuing student scholarship, or whatever? FedEx jobs help with tuition. Maybe I could get some family contribution, but I don't want to waste my family's savings that they worked hard for. Will I be forced to go into debt? That's the last thing I want to do personally speaking.

I don't know if this is the right sub, but I'm getting kinda desperate. I apologise if it isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: BYU's sticker price is $25,624 including housing, board, books, and personal expenses. They do not offer academic scholarships to transfer students, however scoring a 3.9+ GPA will make you eligible for a full tuition academic scholarship after the first semester or first year IIRC. BYU does not offer non-federal financial aid.",finance
personalfinance,Why are private student loans bad?,"I've seen from many that student loans are bad. For example, a person can borrow $10,000, over time pay off $10,000, but with a final balance of $10,000. Doesn't it seem simple to continuously pay off the interest over time, preventing the interest from capitalizing? If it's a variable interest rate, I would just make sure I'm paying the max interest rate + a fraction of the principal per month.

I'm asking this because I'm going to need to take some student loans out. I've already taken out $7,500 in federal loans (sub and unsub) for a yearly tuition of \~$18,000. I'm going to take a loan to fulfill the difference of the tuition left to be paid. (I know it's not the best. I haven't got scholarships + no parental help).

personalfinance,Did I make a mistake? Re: Insurance and HRA account choices,"I'm not sure if this is r/personalfinance appropriate, but since it entails both insurance and investing and retirement, it seems like the best place.

TL:DR: HSA seems to be a worse option for me than a taxable account. What am I missing?

So for years, my husband and I have had insurance that did not have an option that allowed for an HSA account.  This year, I found out that hubby's work was adding an option, so I was really excited to go that route, since everything I see everywhere (including the wiki here) says max that first.

However, after reviewing all the options, I've decided NOT to go that route, and stick with the same insurance we've had.  I still have time to change that option before October 29th, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something obvious.

Here is our situation:

We are pretty frugal people, DINKs, homeowners, in our 40s.  We gross $50-60k a year, and save almost half of our net each year.  Our average annual expenses are around $25k right now (and haven't varied much over the last 20 years, other than inflation increases).  We have no 401k options at work at this time, so instead max out 2 Roth IRAs each year.  We have a fully funded emergency fund, have about $250k saved for retirement, about 5 years left on our mortgage, and no other debt.

We expect to retire early and only need about $15k annually in today's dollars plus whatever health care costs (possibly $0 at that income, depending on politics, but we are preparing for costs up to $15k/year average - doubling our expected budget to $30k/year).  So we will probably end up in a low tax bracket in retirement, with a large portion of our money tax free.  We do have some in a Traditional  401k from a prior job, but that is pretty minimal, it is mostly in Roth.

I recently learned that at our income level, long term capital gains on taxable accounts are taxed at 0%.

When we looked at the HSA, we found that the premiums were going to cost about $1000 more annually than our current plan, and prescriptions wouldn't be covered until deductible was met for the entire family, which means probably never, which would cost us about another $1000 per year.  So even in a year where we DIDN'T have high medical expenses, the plan was $2000 extra per year, right off the bat.

So I decided to run the numbers for a different option. Rather than putting $7200 per year in an HSA that cost us $2000 per year extra, there didn't seem to be any reason we couldn't just put that $7200 per year into a taxable account instead (probably with more investment options and lower fees).  The long term capital gains would be tax free on withdrawal anyway, unless I'm misunderstanding that.

We currently pay an effective rate of about 15% total in state/federal taxes, and of course 7.2% in SS/Medicare taxes, so we could potentially save about $1600 (22.2% of $7200) of the $2000 we spent extra from our taxes this year in a best case scenario.  But worst case, the deductible and total out of pocket are much higher.  If we are losing money even in a best case scenario, with no tax benefit at withdrawal, the HSA didn't seem worth it.

personalfinance,Payoff motorcycle before financing a car?,"Hey everyone, first time posting here. I’m having trouble deciding wether or not I should pay off my motorcycle before financing a new/used car. The balance I have left on my motorcycle lien is roughly $5,000. I bought it two years ago on sixty month plan with the idea of starting a credit history because I had none at the time.

vet,Sudden(ish) aggression from one cat to another - nothing works!,"Hello! We have three cats - two males and one female. The girl and one of the boys are possibly siblings, 3 years old. The other boy is 1.5 years old and came to us later (obviously).

One of the boys (the older) is good - never gives us a moment's trouble, gets on with everyone, generally chill and easy.

The other two though, oh lord. The girl cat was not overjoyed at the addition of the younger boy when he arrived, but she got over it quickly - we did a very slow phased introduction etc, enough litter trays, plenty of beds and hidey spots and climbing towers in the house, plus they all go outside too, so no real issues for ages between them.

Now, in the last few months (so about a year after he arrived) she just HATES him. Like, will fight him, hisses and howls whenever he walks by, guards the door when he wants to go out. 

What's changed during this time period: lockdown, obviously, although one of us worked from home fulltime before so nothing too obvious; food change from v expensive fancy stuff from high end pet shop to cheaper stuff due to financial circumstances changing (although the aggression was some time after this); she did have a fight with a local intact tomcat (so possibly redirected aggression); younger boy cat used to exclusively love my boyfriend but now he loves me HARD, and she sees me as her person.

What we've tried so far:

- Feliway: only did it for a month due to cost, made no difference but may need longer to work
- completely separating food and water (they were all fed close together before which wasn't an issue, but moved them apart just in case)
- ignoring her aggression, keeping calm, stroking them both and talking normally when it happens
- treats for both at the same time 
- buying her her own special toy he isn't allowed to touch at all (none of his smell on) and making sure she gets plenty of one on one playtime when he's not there to exuberantly wrecking ball his way in
- TONS of extra love and attention to her
- discouraging him from spending time in 'her' areas of the house
- limiting how much attention I personally give him when she's around to show I'm still 'hers'? She isn't remotely bothered when the other boy cat drapes himself across me, so I'm not sure that is it

Nothing has helped - she's just so angry whenever he's nearby. He's now obviously anxious and meek around her, which I think is just firing her up more. Food will be switched back as soon as we can afford to, in case that's the change that has bothered her, but she's mostly fine with the other boy cat (who we think is her sibling, although not 100% sure as they were rescued from a kitten farm). 

What do we do? Please help! I love them both very much and I'm sad for both them - boy cat because he's being bullied, and girl cat because she's obviously unhappy about something all of a sudden.",cryptocurrency

If I want to get a loan, every company wants an inspection for a refinance. Does them finding it in shambles mean I might not get the loan or Id have to get a refinancing loan? Can my wife refinance in her name without a ton more fees, or in both our names? Is there a way to refinance without an inspection?

By my math, the lower interest loan is actually costing me more money because the balance is so much higher. In that case, it seems like the real avalanche method should be to pay down the higher balance loan until the actual accrued interest dips below the other loan, THEN switch to paying off the higher interest loan.

Throughout college, I had a terrible credit score it wasn't that I was terrible at managing money but because of circumstances I was in debt and still am I'm paying it down as fast as I can, about $2000 a month (living with parents so no cost of living) and have always tried to make payments on time. My credit until this past December was about 590 ish and right now it's at about 677 which should go up at the end of the month. I plan on getting a new car on a loan sometime around the beginning of 2021. I still have about $8,000 in debt at 15.59% (down from $18,000) WF cc.   


Question is: While in college I opened a Capital One Platinum card its about 5-6 years old cc which is for rebuilding credit. The limit on this has been $1300 for a while. I got an email from Capital One saying that I am eligible to upgrade to their Quicksilver card this are the benefits offered.  

* Your interest rate and credit limit will stay the same.
* Upgrading won't affect your credit score since you don't need to apply.
* You'll keep the same card number, payment date, and account settings.
* You'll have a new security number and expiration date.
* You can keep using your current card until your new card arrives.
* You're not eligible for promotions or bonus offers that new cardholders get.

I was thinking about asking them to raise my credit limit on the current instead of an upgrade. What do you guys think should I upgrade or ask them to raise my credit limit. I don't need a higher credit limit atm but if they do increase my credit limit(has anyone tried that with Capital One ?)my usage % will hence a small bump in credit score. Do any of you guys have the Quicksilver card do you think it's worth upgrading or increasing my credit limit.",finance

computers,Laptop overheating in sleep mode,"This has been happening for a 2-4 months maybe longer. I don't know the exact dates as I wasn't paying much attention when it first happened (the earliest I can remember is sometime in the summer). I would be on the laptop then close it when I was done with it. Usually it wouldn't be a problem (whether or whether not it was on charger). One day I closed it and woke up to it being hot to the touch. I was confused so I let it cool then opened it up the battery was dead (or not dead if it was charging). I really didn't know much about computers besides what to look for in chosing a computer and that you are not supposed let it overheat or it would go slow or shutdown from it, so when I booted it up it was fine and I thought ok it's fine. I continued with my day. I can't tell you if it was the day after or sometime after but it did it again. I was lightly concerned but the computer is still fine. It continued doing that for a while (not daily) and I went from lightly concerned to mildly concerned to moderately concerned. I didn't like what was happening so I would shut it down every night which was annoying. Then there would be the times I would forget(usually from be drained from the day) and sometimes(not all the time) it would just heat up. Then, I noticed that  that I hadn't shut it down once to which I went and didn't but at that point I was fed up with it happening so I tried to find out what was going on which led me here. What should I do about it and is there anything else I should do?",technology

Overseas borrowers have flocked to the dollar this year at a record pace, with sovereigns from Indonesia to Colombia and companies from Nissan Motor Co. to Manila’s water utility racking up sales of $1.29 trillion.

It’s a key economic takeaway from the Covid-19 crisis: just as happened in the wake of the global financial meltdown of 2008, the dollar is cementing its role as the world’s dominant currency even as unilateralist policies from President Donald Trump rile allies and rivals alike.


“Whenever there is a crisis, companies and countries rush to make sure they have all the funding they need,” said Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist who coined the BRIC acronym.

“The dollar markets are the only real source available, so the whole situation builds on itself,” according to O’Neill, who is chair of the international policy group Chatham House.

The ease of borrowing in dollars across the globe has been key in preventing the health and economic crisis spiraling into a financial one by providing companies and governments cheap access to funds. But it may also be sowing seeds for the next crisis: If the greenback sees a sustained appreciation trend, it will drive up debt-servicing costs, potentially creating, for some, repayment difficulties down the road.

Everybody Loves Dollars

That’s a particular risk for emerging markets, where external debt including dollar borrowing is climbing at the fastest pace on record, with full-year issuance on track to eclipse $750 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Damian Sassower.

For now, the dollar’s been moving in the right direction. The Bloomberg dollar index has plunged about 10.5% from its 2020 high reached on March 23.

A lack of global alternatives helps explain some of the dollar’s role. The euro’s status as a reserve currency remains limited, and China’s currency is still subject to capital controls.


It’s also a function of cost. With the Federal Reserve unleashing massive liquidity, and now expected to keep interest rates near zero for years to come, the greenback is all the more attractive as a funding source.

U.S. Treasury yields fell to record lows as Fed cut rates, added stimulus
Easier Fed policy helped the Philippines sell sovereign dollar debt at its lowest interest rate ever back in April. The dollar is the “universal currency” and the unit of global trade, according to Rosalia de Leon, treasurer of the Philippines, who says her country will continue to rely on the greenback to help fund its budget deficit.

Philippine and Indonesian companies have each sold more dollar bonds in 2020 than in any past full year.


“The domestic financial market is not yet deep” in Indonesia, said Deni Ridwan, director of sovereign bonds at the nation’s Finance Ministry. By selling debt in dollars, Indonesia’s government can avoid crowding out local rupiah issuers, he explained.

For Nissan, the Japanese carmaker struggling to bounce back from both corporate scandals and the Covid crisis, the broad base of international investors was appealing when it turned to the dollar debt market for the first time in decades. It priced an $8 billion dollar offering in September, one of the largest corporate issues in Asia on record, as well as a 2 billion euro deal ($2.4 billion).

The total issuance of $1.29 trillion from non-U.S. borrowers this year is up 21% from the same period of 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


The record boom in offshore dollar bond sales has been echoed on the U.S. domestic front. Behind it all: the Fed not only cut its policy rate near zero in March, it introduced corporate-debt purchase programs that helped ensure the flow of credit even as coronavirus lockdowns walloped the economy.

The Fed also enlarged and expanded swap lines with monetary authorities around the world to address a sudden shortage of dollars abroad.

Fed provision of dollars to other central banks soared in 2020
The critical role of the U.S. currency also has a downside, however -- it leaves emerging markets reliant on American policy settings. While it seems distant now, Fed tightening down the road could spur dollar appreciation.


“The extensive dependence on the dollar leaves the international financial system hostage to the whims of U.S. policies, especially those of the Federal Reserve,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team, and is now at Cornell University. “For emerging market economies, in particular, it can create whiplash effects on capital flows and exchange rates.”

While other major bond markets are seeing a bumper year too -- Europe’s primary bond market has surpassed 1.5 trillion euros of annual sales for the first time -- when issuers do go offshore to borrow, it’s still likely to be in dollars.

Even as the share of dollar funding relative to the size of the global economy remains below its peak of a decade ago, its slice of international borrowing has climbed to a two-decade high, Bank for International Settlements data show. “It is clearly the dominant international funding currency,” the BIS wrote in a June report.",finance
personalfinance,How I improved my debt and quadrupled my savings in 2 months.,"Totally a clickbait title, but also true. Most people who read this will not likely be in a situation to have the same opportunity I did, but perhaps one person will, and the gears will start turning. 


So 2 months ago I had 10k in the bank and a 150k mortgage (27 years left at 3.85%). I pretty much lived paycheck to paycheck with a constant 10k cushion. No budget. Hadn’t grown my savings in years. Bad with finances but getting by just fine.


Then I got into investing. This led me to want to start a budget. Then I realized how exciting mastering your finances can be. I came to really enjoy it!


Long story short I sold my house I had bought a few years ago because I knew I could make a nice profit in this seller’s market. I bought a slightly smaller (but ironically nicer) house and got a 15 year loan at 2.265%. 


So now the dust had settled and I have a 15 year loan at a much smaller interest rate and my monthly payment is only $100 more than my previous 30 year. I also have 40k in the bank (house profit) which I plan on opening a roth with, as well as a 529 for my toddler son. 


At the very least people, look into refinancing! You may be able to go from a 30 year to a 15 year and not have a substantially higher monthly payment!


**TLDR Took advantage of seller’s market and turned house for a profit while simultaneously taking advantage of low interest rates and improving my mortgage debt immensely.**",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.

# **There’s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**
*****
&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter’s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “For some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.
*****
&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.
*****
&gt; “We’ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. “If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we’ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there’s still some significant areas that we’re working through.”
*****
&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “So I’m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it’s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It’s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.”
*****
&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.
*****
&gt; “The market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It’s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.
*****
&gt; “We are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,” said Grohowski. “I think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.”
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.
*****
&gt; “As we get closer to the election, we’re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,” said Grohowski.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. “Active managers have the most net long positions they’ve had in a number of years because they’re fearful of missing a year-end rally,” said Emanuel. “The options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.”
*****
Emanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.
*****
&gt; “What we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It’s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,” Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.

&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance

&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.

&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**

&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.

&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery

&gt; The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing—a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers’ new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.

&gt; “It comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.”

&gt; The decline in manufacturers’ new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.

&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time

&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:

&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.
&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.
&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.
&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.

&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.

&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.

&gt; # ""Quitters""

&gt; Like an old pair of ""quitters"" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**

&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.

&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders

&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**

&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to decide if it's worth refinancing / would you do this?,"Purchased current home in 10/2017 for 200,900 with loan of 194k at 3.99% with P&amp;I at $929 and PMI at $102.

Once the COVID-19 situation started and the rates started to drop, I refinanced right in the beginning in March down to 3.25% on a $190k for a monthly of $827, was able to get appraisal waiver, closing costs at $2.5k, and was able to drop PMI, so I effectively dropped my monthly payment down by about $204.

Therefore, I would be able to recoup my closing costs in about 10 months, which would be January 2021 about for me.

So what I'm trying to decide is, if it would be worth it for me to refinance once again with the rates being just slightly lower, and buying the interest rate down even more. My current loan balance right now is at about $188,113. Just for curiosity I checked the rates on Bankrate for a few lenders and the amount of points they're charging to bring the interest rate down to around 2.5% is in the range of $3.6k-$4.2k. I should be able to get another appraisal waiver and I work with a closing attorney so I would be able to waive pretty much all settlement fees and just pay a few items at cost so that would help keep closing costs lower.

So if I just dropped the interest rate down to 2.5%, it'd drop my monthly down to about $743-751 (depending how much of the costs I'd decide to roll into the loan) resulting in about $76-$84 monthly savings.

So the reason I'm trying to decide if I should refinance is to see if I can find lenders who haven't started to include the market adverse fee coming up in their fees (if possible) but overall just to start the ""savings"".

I know how to calculate the math and all that. We have no plans of moving from this house whatsoever in the near future, and don't have no long term plan of considering moving say in the next 5-6 years. But even if we did, I think I'd be willing to try to put the house up for rent instead of trying to sell it and continue building equity. If I had a monthly payment in the $740 range, taxes and insurance comes out to about $220 a month (I don't have an escrow account, I manage myself), and in current market I'm sure I could possibly rent this place out for about $1.3-1.4k conservatively and so I imagine 5-6 years down in the future I could probably rent for more.

So my question is, is this something you all would consider would be worth doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I want to rephrase the overall/actual question. Is this something you all would consider would be worth doing with the intention of possibly renting the house out in the future?",finance
Bitcoin,"Understanding it's not VITAL to Bitcoin, but: What are the main avenues by which we get truly decentralized layer-2 smart contracts on Bitcoin? I understand Taproot helps with this. But do we still need to rely on ""Federation trust"" approaches ala Rootstock/Liquid?",,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Federal Reserve Making Moves To Limit Bitcoin More With Travel Rule Changes,"The main argument that the reddit community makes to me is that they will always have total anti-regulatory powers with bitcoin that allow them to do bitcoin like things and that regulators cannot stop them.

I would urge you to look at the recent legal precedents set by the verdict against Helix, the verdict against Bitmex, the recent DoJ Guideline documents, and the recent proposal in the federal regitrar to amend the travel rule down to 250 dollars from 3000 and to include cryptocurrencies as part of the money outflows rules.

&amp;#x200B;

What the Government is really doing is using OFAC and BSA to enforce mandatory global KYC on all countries. If you are a software developer anywhere in the world, they can just say you touch american servers even if you don't and that you enable terrorism even if you don't. They are creating the framework to prosecute software developers anywhere in the world that do not backdoor KYC. 

This is de facto global censorship on bitcoin. It basically breaks bitcoin. Bitcoin is largely inhibited by it's dependence on software wallets. Well they forced Komodo to institute KYC on its atomic swaps. They forced in on Waves. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can and should post your comment on the federal registrar public comments against the Fed's proposal, it is deeply wrong. But they are going to extend it to crypto. 

The real key result here is that America is ending free market cross boarder trading anywhere in the world and instituting extremely strong capital flight controls on Americans and Westerners in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only way that cryptocurrency will truly remain uncensorable and fungible is if you transact between people in a cash like manner under the table while using software that deliberately anonymizes the developers. ***The Government knows you have the bitcoin, it is a frame work for forced confiscation.***

***This is why Satoshi hid his identity, he knew this was possible. But bitcoin's dependence on software for trading is it's achilles heel.***",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Tax saving advice: Benefits of before-tax deductions,"“Nothing is certain except for death and taxes.” Since you can’t escape taxes, then reduce what’s taken away as best as you can. One method is through pre-tax deductions such as a 401K, medical, vision, dental, disability, life insurance, commuter plan, FSA and HSA. This is for those who are interested in learning such as the younger generation just starting out in the working world. The earlier you know, the better.

I’m going to make this brief and simple as possible by producing a sample and illustrate the impact on salary and tax benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Marital status: Single

Location: New York, NY

Pay frequency: Weekly

Hourly wage: $34 ($70,760 annual)

Federal allowance: 2

State allowance: 5

Local allowance: 5

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s start with the above and see what the result is for the weekly paycheck:

||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Gross Paycheck**||**$1360**|
|Taxes|20.21%|$275|
|FICA &amp; State Insurance Taxes|7.82%|$106|
|**Take Home Salary**|**71.97%**|**$979**|

As you can see, **28.03%** is taken away in taxes which equals to **$19,812** ($381 x 52) in total taxes for the year.

Now let’s use the same example above but have that person max out his/her 401K for the year which is a **$19,500** limit for the year 2020 (for anyone younger than 50) or **$375** per week. The result is:

||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Gross Paycheck**||**$1360**|
|Taxes|11.35%|$154|
|FICA &amp; State Insurance Taxes|7.82%|$106|

personalfinance,Can anyone advise on hardship agreements with disability (no SSDI) and zero income 1 year+,"I'm 32. I have a disability and to those who aren't privy with the system, essentially no one is approved for SSDI on their first try. You need to almost always get a lawyer and fight and then get a court date and the whole process takes 1.5-3 years I'm told. I foolishly was turned down after waiting 6 months and did not appeal so now I need to start all over.

Meanwhile I'm unable to achieve any income. 4 jobs over the last year have not worked out. I am living with my parents for 4 months now. I am working with the Illinois Dept. of rehab services who are trying their darnedest to find me work but there hasn't been an appropriate match.

The reason I bring up the system is because I want to try to look into hardship agreements on my nearly $30,000 in credit card debt to try and stop the bleeding some and I know it would help if I had a ""documented"" disability but that is years away and even then may not happen. I also have $10,000 in a graduate school loan. I do have about $9,000 dwindling that I have been hoarding because I know I cannot work and I have been saving it to pay my rent/minimums.

If I request a hardship agreement I know I should do it with each creditor individually. I'm assuming there would be no legal way for them to validate my disability with medical info as it is probably illegal for them to delve into that even if I willingly provided it... Would they look at my 2 bank accounts and see I had no deposits from an employer in 12 months and would that help me out possibly? Would the fact I have 9k give me less wiggle room? I don't think I'm looking to write any of these creditors off as this debt is all within the last 5 or so years believe it or not so it's not like it's ancient. I am just hoping to lower interest rates unless you think there is some chance of reducing balances. (Is there?)

What should I say when I call? Do I mention my grand total of CC debt? If they ask my monthly income it's been $0 for a year and before that just LTD from my previous employer. But I have basically no expenses for 4 months. Just food. And cell phone. All advice is appreciated!

I'm sinking fast. I know bankruptcy is an option if everything else fails here. But I'd rather not obviously unless it's a last resort. I'm hoping I can find some kind of job with the department of rehab services but we will see. It would likely be part-time minimum wage... Even then I'll probably still be in the negative every month with my debt and never be able to move out of my parents' :(

I know I've spent way more than I should have. I used to have a really good job and this disability took over gradually and I lived above my means thinking I could still get my career back. I've finally just last week applied for SNAP food assistance which I should have done a long time ago.

Again any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,First time poster wondering if they are making the right financial moves,"I have been working on getting out of debt and rebuilding my credit after a divorce for a couple years now, but I haven't had any advice to follow. Just been doing what sounded logical. I'm now wondering if my ideas on paying off my debts are correct or if there is anything I should be doing differently.

What I do:
Take the amount of interest from a card and round up to the nearest $20 increment. I then double that amount to get the payment amount and make payments every two weeks. I adjust the amount of the payments once per year.

So for example: Card A charges $15.43 a month in interest. I round up to $20 and double that to $40. I pay $40 on the 1st of the month and another $40 on the 15th. 
Card B charges $23.76 in interest. Round to $40, double that and pay $80 twice a month. On Dec 31 I check the bill and the interest on this card is at $19.31 a month, so the payment goes down to $40 twice a month.

I have raised my credit score over 200 points and am down to $4,125 of debt. I'm wondering if I should continue with what I am doing, or would I be better off getting a personal loan with an interest rate that is 6-10% less than the credit card rates. From some of the offers I've seen on credit karma, my payment amount would be $190/month (which I would double, so $380/month). I am currently paying $320 a month. I can easily afford the extra $60 a month. 

So should I 1)keep doing what I have been, 2)get the loan, or 3)am I doing this all wrong?",finance

personalfinance,State tax residency status,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I am a new grad that moved to California from Canada in fall of 2019, I did not pass the SPT last year, but will pass it this year for federal tax purposes. My question is more about state taxes. I plan on asking a tax professional about my situation in more detail, but was hoping to get some preliminary information here first.

**Background**

I was in California for around two months in 2019 and then went on vacation late December and returned to California middle of January. I was in California till early July and then went back to Canada.

I returned to the USA mid October, but I am not in California right now. As of writing, I have been in California for fewer than 180 days in 2020.

While I was in California, I was always living on a sublease and signed no formal lease agreement with a property manager, never had any utility bills under my name, no license, nothing really.

The most I have is a credit card and a post paid phone plan which both have a relative's address as my address. Oh, and the same address is on file with my employer. My employer is based in California and has been withholding my salary on the basis of me being a California resident.

I am currently back in the US but am staying at a friend's in the east coast. We're going to drive through the US and make our way to Seattle and then settle there.

**Questions**

1. Can I claim to be a non-resident of California for the purposes of the 2020 tax year?
2. Are there any real benefits to me of being a non-tax resident of California?
3. If I am not a tax resident of California, would I be a tax resident of any state for the current tax year? Given that I will not have spent more than 180 days in any state this tax year, nor will I have had any real residential ties to any state.
4. Do I need to do anything to be a tax resident of the state of Washington?
5. When can I start my claim to being a tax resident of the state of Washington? I do not currently know whether I will be living any differently in WA compared to how I was living in CA, i.e., I might not really establish any strong residential ties.

EDIT1: updated to add that I am not an American citizen and am in the USA on a TN visa.

EDIT2: I am in the east coast right now, staying at a friend's place. The idea is to spend the next 1-2 months driving to WA (we both have day jobs and will only be driving a few hours a week, while responsibly keeping ourselves distanced from the residents of the places through which we drive).

EDIT3: I have no current residence under my name, no sublease, no lease, no property. I have two suitcases with me containing my belongings.

EDIT4: to complicate things further, as mentioned in EDIT1, I am in the USA on a TN visa which is not a dual-intent visa. Technically, I am only employed with my California for up to three years (with the option to renew my immigration status, change to a different kind of visa/immigration status, moving to a different country, quitting). So, I will have to check whether California will take that into consideration, with regards to my residency status.

EDIT5: I realize this is a non-standard situation, at this point this has just become a place for me to publicly write down my thoughts. When talking to a tax professional, I might just send a link to this post, in which case, hello tax professional.",finance

personalfinance,Getting cold feet about upcoming home purchase,"So to add to my previous post (it has the context) I have an accepted offer now. Now I'm getting cold feet. I haven't yet signed anything nor have I given away any money. I don't want this post to sound like I'm definitely leaning one way or another, because I'm genuinely unsure and need some direction or soul searching.

I currently live in a studio in Long Island City, comfortably, at \~$2400 rent. It's not a shoebox but not a super large studio, but I made it work. It shares only one wall with a neighbor but almost never heard them (this will come up in a second). The place I have an offer with (to buy) is a 1 bedroom apartment in Astoria. It is a new development about to open up. And it is gorgeous. It is in the high 600s, under 700. Here, my monthly would be approximately $300-400 more a month (this includes mortgage and HOA/taxes, not including insurance).

I am great budgeter, and thankfully have no money issues. No debt, saving, investing some, not yet maxed out but have a good bit in my 401k. This 1br shares the living room with a next door neighbor's bedroom and the bedroom with a next door neighbor's living room. The soundproofing, from what I've been told, is excellent. One of my top priorities is to live in a quiet apartment. I know you can't choose your neighbors, but to be honest my apartment is amazing in that respect, I can hear nothing, and when I have my projector + 5.1 surround and bass watching movies and shows, nobody complains. My current commute to the city is excellent. In the condo I'm looking to buy, the commute to Manhattan would increase by 10-15min. In the grand scheme of things not a big increase I guess, but the walk to the train is definitely longe (about 8min). I am WFH for now for the foreseeable future, but nobody will know what we will be doing in a year.

I know you can't predict what will happen in the future. But I feel stuck. If I'm going in with this purchase, half my net worth would be used up on the downpayment + closing costs. My mortgage would be a good bit higher. But I would be a homeowner and would have equity. The interest rates would be low (2.6 or 2.7). I would still have a 6 months emergency fund in cash. I would still have all my money in my investment and retirement accounts. The place would be mine and I would be able to do what I want. I would have a larger, most likely nicer apartment which even has a balcony. Because I am currently single, there would be the added bonus of sharing the space and the mortgage if that situation changes. And hopefully, over time, once COVID becomes less of a problem, NYC will come back and real estate will begin to really appreciate. 

If I stay where I am, I will be able to save and invest a lot more money, have a better commute to the city, won't be subject to a possible downturn in the market. I know the area and I know my building. My super and landlord are great, and I have no issues here. But I'm tired of living in studios (been 8 years now). And to be honest, I'm somewhat tired of renting too.

I really don't know if I should be pursuing this or not, and perhaps just need some direction here.

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Where do I start? Baby on the way and I'm starting to get anxious,"I'm a complete newbie when it comes to investing and saving for retirement and feel a bit overwhelmed now that I'm trying to learn a bit more about what to do.

Age: 35

Income: 170k/yr base salary (varied 0-15k bonus annually)

Debt: 20k left on two cars (total of 40k), payments of about $500/mo each (APR at 5% and 1%), house mortgage with about 400k left (4% interest rate). no other debt (pay off credit card statements every month)

$ saved (in savings/checkings accts): 50k

401k: 70k (just started maxing out contributions a couple years ago)

besides the house and 2 cars (one is for my wife) - I don't spend too much and save probably about 1k/mo after mortgage + utilities + car payments + small personal expenses. My wife works but earns much less than I do (she also saves about 1-2k/mo) - we have a baby on the way and honestly I'm worried about all the upcoming costs.. decent day cares are 2k/mo here, will also likely have to enroll in a private school so I'm assuming an 2k/mo costs for the next 18 years + whatever other child expenses.. (the good public schools are in areas with 1m+ homes)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure we can get by with no planning (and thus erasing any savings we're having) - but admittedly both my wife and I have been irresponsible when it came to keeping up with 'finance smarts' and the lack of planning has made some anxiety start creeping up on me. my mantra when I was younger and only earning 40-100k was '*spend now, earn more later*' - i think i may be reaching close to a  plateauedin terms of earning power and its time for a change in my thought process.

personalfinance,Math of buying a new car vs. recent used car,"I always thought I was really savvy by looking for a dealer service loaner (used car, one year old or so, a few thousand miles) instead of buying new. However, the math surprises me -- a new car with 0% financing is usually the better buy for something like a Toyota or Subaru.

If you're financing for 60 months:

\- Used car: 3.25% interest rate (a good rate)

\- New car: 0% interest rate (commonly offered)

Assume 0% down for both for simplicity -- the used car has to be 15% cheaper to break even with the new car (not even considering higher mileage, etc). In my experience, the out-the-door price of the dealer service loaner is unlikely to be 15% off the out-the-door price of a new car. 

If you put 50% down on the used car only and adjust for inflation, you're breaking even at 10% off.

tl;dr do the math when buying a ""used"" new car. A brand new car may be better.",finance

investing,Why I'm not worried about a resurgence of inflation,"**TL/DR**: Despite massive fiscal stimulus packages and seemingly never-ending quantitative easing programs, I don't believe we're headed towards a world of out-of-control inflation. Why? The prospect of permanent economic scarring in certain sectors due to extended lockdowns coupled with rapid technological adoption are two factors that are likely to keep price pressures low.

**Investors seem quite concerned about rising inflation risk**, which is likely supporting the strong bid for inflation-hedging assets like gold and bitcoin year to date. Adding fuel to the fire, top money managers, like Bridgewater and BlackRock, have been vocal in financial media lately about the risk of a high-inflation regime down the road. A high-inflation regime would be a remarkable departure from the past decade, where inflation was relatively tame even despite ultra-low interest rates and the introduction of unconventional monetary policy tools, like quantitative easing (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC](https://ibb.co/Dt8nVFC)).

Similar to what was observed over the past cycle, I don't see recent policy action leading to sky-high inflation in the future. 

* First, it's important to note that **fiscal and monetary stimulus is a** ***response*** **to a weak economic outlook**. Direct income assistance (i.e. the CARES Act) is meant to help offset lost wages due to extended lockdowns and business closures. Those who believe inflation is going to materially rise would argue that the government built a ""bridge too far"" - though so far the pandemic has outlasted the duration of U.S. stimulus measures.
* Second, **the pandemic has supercharged the digital economy**. E-commerce is exploding (see chart here: [https://ibb.co/7GQknX6](https://ibb.co/7GQknX6)) - a long-term trend that I believe is likely here to stay.  It is well studied that e-commerce is a deflationary force (read more here: [https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24649)). The intuition is straightforward - the internet increases price transparency, lowers barriers to entry, fuels competition, and increases aggregate supply. More online shopping is likely to keep goods price inflation in check for now. This goes without mentioning innovations in the services sector, such as telehealth and online education, which could also keep inflation at bay.

Lastly, as a professional investor focused on global macro, predicting where the global economy is headed is *hard* and an incredibly humbling exercise. I prefer preparing my own portfolio for a range of outcomes - so while I personally hold *some* gold and bitcoin, I wouldn't bet the farm on a resurgence of inflation in the future.",finance

personalfinance,Tax problem- Can't sleep - Help,"Hello,  I am terrified of the shame that will come with this conversation with my local CPA. 

So here ya go, dear personal finance gurus. Tell me what to do next.

For the past five years, I have been a non-filer. I am head of household of a family of 6 (four kids and disabled spouse). We qualified for public assistance, and this has kept the family fed. 

During this time, I worked as counselor at a mental health center. I was paid through a business entity I set up in 2012. Each year I probably made around 30k. 

I cannot sleep thinking about all those years that my business did not pay taxes because I took every red cent to keep lights on and food on the table. 

Questions:.

What kind of tax professional should I contact, a CPA or tax attorney?

How far back can you change a business status from sole proprietor to S- Corp or LLC?

If I am audited, how much does it cost to have a professional help with this?

Where do I even start? 

Thanks all.",finance
personalfinance,Paying Off Student Loans via PSLF vs. Higher Salary,"I am an attorney, have a lot in student loans, and work for the government.  The goal has been to have my loans forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.  For those who don't know, the government will forgive your federal student loans if you work for a non-profit/government organization for 10 years, while making regular payments based on your income.  If I leave the government and work for a firm, I will more than double my salary.  How do I calculate the point at which, from a purely financial perspective, I should go to a firm or stay in the government?  In other words, how do I figure out the tipping point for staying in the government and relying on the PSLF, or going to a firm and paying it off the old-fashioned way?",finance
personalfinance,What student loan repayment option makes the most sense?,"(will cross-post to r/StudentLoans as well)

I'm 26 years old and will graduate dental school in May 2021. I will have taken out $390,000 in loans, with $24,000 interest already accrued.

I don't know my starting salary, but estimate it will be **$110-140K**. I could theoretically make up to $200K, but it would be unlikely and would require crazy hours. 15-20 years down the road, if I were to own my own practice, I could make $250-300K.

I ""live like a resident"" and plan on continuing to do so. I genuinely don't have an interest in flashy brands, cars, houses, etc. I'm very minimalist. My monthly expenses hover around $2000 total.

**Expenses**

per month = **$2000**

* rent + utilities = **$940**
* necessities (groceries, public transit, etc.) = **$450**
* non-necessities / ""fun"" (restaurants, concerts, clothes, coffee, etc.) = **$610** usually, down to \~$200 with COVID

I absolutely love my life and don't ever feel like I'm restricted at all, I feel like I have the money to do whatever i want. I don't for-see too much lifestyle creep or increased expenses, except that I may rent a more expensive 1 bedroom apartment (currently living with roommates), so my rent + utilities may jump to $1300 total. I'm childfree and will never have kids.

**Loans**

\~$230K federal graduate plus (average interest rate \~7%)\~$160K federal unsubsidized (average interest rate \~6%)\~$**390K** federal student loans total

**What loan repayment option makes the most sense?**

Post-tax monthly income estimated at \~**$6000** for 100K salary, **\~$11K** for 200K salary.

**(1) ""Normal"" repayment ASAP**

* Monthly loan payment \~$4400 over 10 years with $530K paid total
* Or, monthly loan payment \~$2600 over 25 years with $785K paid total (oof)
* Barely afloat on 10 year plan, unless I drastically increase income
* Total paid on 25 year plan is repulsive
* Allows me to work wherever I want, with potentially increasing my salary much faster by working in a private office, but also relies on me working my ass off probably

**(2) Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)**

* Pay income-based repayment for 10 years, with loans 100% forgiven, no ""tax bomb""
   * \~$800 per month on 100K salary with \~$90K paid total
   * \~$1800 per month on 200K salary with \~$200K paid total
* Work at a public health job with extremely restricted in job options &amp; growth options — salary will not increase much

**(3) Income-based repayment for 20 years, then loan forgiveness &amp; ""tax bomb""**

* On 100K salary: \~$800 per month for 20 years, with $190K paid total and $700K forgiven &amp; taxed — potentially $200K tax bomb, making total paid $190K + $200K = $390K
* On 200K salary: \~$1800 per month for 20 years, with $440K paid total and $450K forgiven &amp; taxed — potentially $125K tax bomb, making total paid $440K + $125K =  $565K
* Allows much more freedom for me to work wherever &amp; as many hours/days as I want

Looking at it objectively, PSLF makes the most sense. It's the thought of being locked in or ""trapped"" for 10 years that makes me nervous. But I likely cannot afford ""normal"" repayment, nor does it even really make sense with these insane numbers.

personalfinance,Go for a bigger single family or settle for condo(need opinion desperately),"Hello,

So I am thinking quite a bit in making a decision and wondering if you guys can provide some thoughts. Now that interest rates are so low, I am unable to decide if I do a good down payment(\~150k) and go for a single family home(home costs \~450k, 30yr mortgage) or go for a condo(condo costs \~225k, 15yr mortgage).

My thoughts are, even if I go for a condo, I do see myself moving out once kids start to grow up(say 10yr old). As interest are so low, I am thinking if the single family home say 10yrs from now will be about 600k(considering the average appreciation rate) and interest rates say about 4.5% then.

Should I be going for a single family home now? If I say go for a condo now, will a single family become out of my reach?",finance

From undergrad, I have several federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, as well as private loans, already (first generation college student). They amount to $43,928.22 currently with interest. I have yet to make payment on these loans as I cannot afford to pay interest, but payments will be deferred for at least another couple of years. I plan to get my PhD after this Master's program, so I expect them to be deferred even further out (7-ish years), but plan to start making payments during my PhD.

With my stipend paycheck barely allowing me to make rent + groceries, and the need for a computer and desire to pay off credit card debt entirely, **I am wondering if it would be appropriate to take out yet another private loan amounting to my total credit card debt + new computer + a bit of fluff (\~$5,000 total).**

I also plan on financing a new car next year (been driving the same 1999 model for a few years and it's about to combust on me); perhaps this is relevant.

CryptoCurrency,PSA: What is the “Travel Rule” and how regulators are using this to kill Cryptocurrency and financial freedom,"The Travel Rule is fundamentally changing the way we use cryptocurrency today. In basic terms, the Travel Rule requires financial entities to share information about their clients and customers to authorities and report suspicious activities that they “suspect” their clients are upto. This Rule is promulgated by FATF -Financial Action Task Force as a way to combat money laundering and terror financing and they require all banks, card companies etc to follow this rule. But as usual, using the umbrella of “money laundering”, they want to spy on and monitor every user’s transaction much like an Orwellian Big Brother. 



In June 2019, FATF extended the Travel Rule to crypto exchanges as well. In FATF terminology, crypto exchanges are known as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASF) - this includes all exchanges, custodians, ICO/IEO issuers, payment providers and any regulated entity in the crypto domain. In the FATF guidance for VASFs, they extended Travel Rule to cover crypto assets and transactions above $1000. 

Under these guidelines, not only do the exchanges have to share data with authorities, but also with other exchanges. For example, Coinbase can easily pull up your entire information from Binance, if they just notice a transaction between your address and Binance! (this is easily possible by blockchain analytics) 


They are also required to build a profile of every customer to track patters. For example, if you are trading size is around $1000 and have a monthly average balance of $5000, but suddenly deposit $100k worth cryptocurrencies, this will internally raise alarms at the exchange and alert authorities, lock your account asking for further information. This is already enforced by most exchanges. 



But the main privacy concerns arise with the requirement to track your withdrawals. Some countries like Switzerland have already enforced a rule asking their crypto exchanges to link and verify each blockchain address to a person before allowing on-chain withdrawals. Imagine a world where the regulators directly link your blockchain address to your identity like SSN! The Swiss model is a pilot and in next year FATF may mandate such a model for every country!


Now the Federal Reserve has put up a proposal that threatens to **lower the threshold of reporting from $3000 to $250 for all transactions outside USA**! This means that details of every transaction between exchanges outside of the USA exceeding $250 would have to be collected, retained and reported to US authorities. So if you send $500 worth ETH from say Kucoin to anywhere (a DEX or an ICO or your own wallet address), Kucoin would have to preserve information about this transaction, map it to your personal identity like SSN and report this to the US authorities! 

You can view the draft proposal here: https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-23756.pdf


The FED is also inviting comments on this, you can also submit your comments here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/secure/forms/ElectronicCommentForm.aspx?doc_id=R%2D1726&amp;doc_ver=1",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What does early repayment on a student loan entail?,"Hey all, so this might seem like a silly question but I am unable to find an answer to this.

I am about to take out a student loan for $72.5k at 10% interest. (Based on my nationality and current situation this is the best I can get now)  Basically, on a 15 year repayment term I have to pay some $900 per month which comes down to $162K total.

So my question is say 3 years down the line, I want to pay it all in lump sum, do I still have to pay 162k or can I avoid paying a portion of the $162K that was calculated based on the interest over 15 years?

If it is not 162K, could you please tell me how to calculate the amount I will need to pay in total?

The financing company says there is no early payment fee but they haven't mentioned anything about how much of the interest I will have to pay.

personalfinance,Higher house payment with low other payments (and zero transportation costs),"I'm trying to figure out if it would be about the time now to try to move from renting to purchasing a townhouse, or if I should continue renting for a while longer.  If I were to buy, my total housing costs (PIMI) would be probably around half my post-401k take-home income, which normally would be bad, but I don't have many other large expenses.  Notably, my transportation costs are usually $0 -- I have no car and I walk, ride my bike, or use my job-provided transit card to get everywhere and have been happily doing this for 5 years.  I'm close enough to a grocery store to be able to walk there anytime I want, which really helps, and the places I'm looking at are in this same area and also walking distance.

I keep going back and forth over this.  I'm probably more strongly on the ""no"" side right now, but still would like some others' opinions.  Sometimes I look at the numbers and they look doable, and sometimes I think having to pay that much per month is a really bad idea.  (At the very least, it would force me to actually try to budget.)  At the same time though, currently my savings rate is nearly 50% of take-home, which is on the way to FIRE-level, and I'm not actively trying to FIRE.  Owning a place now would just be ""nice"" -- I really wish I had a small bit of outdoor space for example.  I can keep renting for a long time and stay happy too, but I think the older I get the less likely I'm going to want to.  I can wait longer and save up more money too or hope that my income goes up later on (although, faster than the price of real estate or mortgage interest, that'll be harder).

Here are all the approximate numbers for my current situation:

Age: 30, single  
Location: Seattle  
Current liquid assets: $430k, with $130k of that in bank accounts (a large amount here because I was considering possible down payments) and the rest invested  
Current retirement account balances (401k and IRA): $247k

Monthly numbers:  
Take-home: $6850 monthly after taxes and 401k contributions. If you add in additional income that does not come every month (average annual bonus and 401k withholding that doesn't happen at the end of the year because I maxed out on the pretax amount) and average it across all 12 months, it increases by an estimated $700 to $7550.  
Necessary expense approximations:  
- Rent: $2115  
- Phone: $90  
- Internet: $70  
- Food $600 (this is without even trying to save money here and I could easily cut this down if I tried)  
- Other utilities: $110  
The expenses add up to $870 per month.  Adding in my rent, my necessary payments right now are $2985.  This is currently leaving me with $3865 extra per month without counting the bonus and the post-maxed-out-401k money.

I went through my last several months of expenses by looking at my bank and credit card statements and without even trying to budget, I'm spending around $3450 per month on average for everything.  I know these are Covid times and a lot of people's spending habits are different, but as I said earlier I don't have a car and my transportation is free, and that is probably the biggest savings in most people's budgets during this time, so my ""normal times"" spending would probably be only somewhat higher per month, accounting for going out a couple of times with friends or other social activities.

In a lot of places, my liquid assets would be enough to put a substantial down payment on a place (if not buy a lot of houses outright, like back in my hometown) but I live in Seattle now where stuff costs more.  If I were to do this, I would be putting about $200k down on a townhouse, and due to fees and capital gains taxes I'll say that would leave me with $200k liquid left.  My monthly housing cost would increase to somewhere around $3300, and I'll add 50% to the utilities costs (making it $175 but I don't think they will be that high), making my total necessary payments per month $4235.  This would leave me with $2615 per month (or $3315 if you average in the bonus and the post-maxed-out-401k money but I'm not going to use those numbers), of which I would invest $1370 (from the 50-30-20 rule) and do whatever with the remaining $1245.

I could put down even more in a down payment and reduce the mortgage payment, but everything I'm reading says that with interest rates as low as they are (I can get 2.75%), it's probably better to take a larger mortgage and keep the money invested.

I know too that there is a maintenance cost to owning a home, and they do usually say it's 1% per year of the home value on average (so averaging $7000 to $8000 in Seattle), but I don't know if that still applies in a HCOL place where the majority of the value of the home is the land it sits on.  I know there will be maintenance costs, but the townhouse isn't all that large and might not have that level of maintenance needed.

Lastly, if this is a bad idea (and like I said, I think I'm currently leaning that way), what would be a good middle ground between my current situation and this?  Like I said I'm fine with my apartment now but I do eventually want to get something with a bit more (either outside space or at least some more room).",finance

Does it matter for stocks who wins the White House? Is there anything unusual about the candidates this year that could impact the markets, regardless of who wins? 

For answers, we turn to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. Strategist for Ned Davis Research, who has studied elections and the impact on markets going back to 1900. 

This Q&amp;A was derived from written research and an interview with Clissold. It has been edited for brevity.

***There seems to be a lot of confusion about this election and the impact on the markets. What’s your take?***

Part of the problem is that this is an unusual situation. The incumbent is in the middle of a recession and a big drop in the market, even though that occurred earlier in the year. I don’t mean a “recession” as technically defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); I mean that a large portion of the U.S. believes we are in a recession.

***Why is that perception important?***

When those conditions are in place, the incumbent is a serious underdog.  Since 1900, the incumbent party has won five times and lost nine when there was a 20% decline in the DJIA or a recession in the election year.   But the last incumbent to win under these circumstances was Truman in 1948.  Since 1952, no party has retained the White House when there was either a 20% decline in the markets or a recession, and both have taken place in 2020. 

***But isn’t this a unique recession?  This was caused by Covid-19.***

Yes. Because the cause of the 2020 recession is an exogenous shock, one of the biggest questions heading into the fall is whether voters will blame President Trump for the economy. Most recessions have a more complicated genesis than this one, and Trump is certainly trying to make the case that he is the better one to handle this.

***Is there anything unique about Biden?  He is proposing changes in the tax code on both a personal and corporate level.  That matters to Wall Street, doesn’t it?***

Yes. The main concerns we have heard from our clients is that higher taxes and more regulations would be detrimental to stocks.

***OK, you’ve made it clear the circumstances are unusual this year.  But what about the historical record?  Does the stock market do better or worse when a Republican or a Democrat is in the White House?***

The markets tend to go up whether there is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. When adjusted for inflation, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of 3.8% annually under Democrats since 1900, versus 1.1% under Republicans.

***Why is that?***

The President is not as influential on the economy as many people think. There are many factors that drive returns and who is in the White House is only one of many factors, including the fact that the U.S. is a capitalist society, where the means of production is mostly in private hands, and that there is a court system that enforces contracts.

***What about when one party controls both the Congress and the White House?***

When Republicans control both the Congress and the White House, returns have averaged 7.09% a year.  Under Democratic presidents, the market has risen faster when there has been a check on their power. When Democrats control the Congress and the Presidency, the market has risen an average of 2.96% a year, but 5.21% with a Democratic President and a Republican Congress.  

***What about immediately after an election, going into the end of the year?***

The market tends to perform better when the incumbent party wins than when the incumbent party loses.

***Why is that?***

It’s likely because the market often reacts to uncertainty, and a change in party leadership represents an additional unknown.

***Does it matter for that short period whether it is a Republican or Democrat who has won or lost?***

The strongest gains going into the end of the year occur when incumbent Republicans win, and the biggest losses when incumbent Republicans have lost, on average, likely because Republicans often positioned themselves as pro-business.

***Does that outperformance when the Republicans have lost extend into the following year?***

No. That relative performance has reversed in post-election years, with the strongest average gain in years following incumbent Republican losses. 

***So what does this tell us?  Seems like this debate about the Republican vs. Democrat impact on stocks is a lot about perception.***

Yes. Party control may be more about sentiment than fundamentals in most cases. Also, once the election is over, investors can focus on other things, like earnings, economic growth, or interest rates, so whatever sentiment-driven market action that occurs in the election year tends to fade and reverse itself.",finance

Banks get millions in fines, compensate for losses, and are forced to protect your credit and ID for years after crypto exchanges get laughed at.  The third-party party that Binance, Bittrex, Kraken, Gemini and others were using for confirmation got hacked just last year and  thousand of IDs and personal  were available for purchases at cheap rates the current plan to comply revolves around a network of crypto exchanges sending your personal data around every time you make a transfer to other crypto exchanges through a mechanism separate from the actual transaction  Given their track record, this is the worst idea possible. As a US consumer, we have protections in what we purchase and how are data is handled under a bunch of local and state laws. Im pretty sure ""increasing risk of fraud and identity theft by sending my private information with every transaction"" violate that somewhere.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking to achieve financial independence with new business. Am I accurately calculating inflation?,"Good Morning,

I've recently quit my job to pursue a business idea that I am hoping will bring me financial independence. I've been going to the grocery store each week and measuring the prices of stable household goods and a few additional necessities (not going to say exactly what, because of the business, but I can be more specific if needed). Usually, it is bread, milk, peanut butter, and my proprietary blend of other factors.

I'm measuring the changes in price over time and using that to calculate weekly (sometimes daily) changes in inflation. I then use that inflation information to decide how to invest in the stock market before official inflation estimates come out.

I want to know how exactly the FED measure the basket of goods they use for inflation. Is it national average? Including sales or actual price paid? I'm looking to take my idea public soon and start offering my services and suggestions to customers and want to make sure that I can't be sued for fraud or incompetence. 

My investing based on this information has been profitable in the stock market so far, but I don't have enough capital to live on investments alone (I have about 10k that has been growing about 40% from the start). That is why I want to open my business up to customers for additional income. 

If my system works, then it should be fine right? Just because it might not be an official method of inflation doesn't change anything in terms of profit? I've adjusted my model based on the public inflation figures and they are pretty close. Therefore, my proprietary blend of products and personal measurement shouldn't run afoul of any insider information or fraud laws because it is my own blend and not exactly the official inflation measurement right?

Thanks in advance for any help.",finance
personalfinance,Getting a loan with bad credit.,"Hello, currently I'm looking into moving out of state because my current states expenses are too high and I'm being kicked out with nowhere available to go in my current state. I have until about February or so to move out, but at the moment I'm struggling to make ends meet and my paychecks are barely covering my bills, let alone an out of state move. For that reason I've been looking into the possibility of getting a 10k personal loan to cover my move, necessities (as I wont be able to really take any furniture / much clothes / etc), and paying rent in advanced as I've read it's the best route to go when I've had no leasing experience and bad credit. (I should note that I already have a job in mind that I'm qualified for, pays above minimum wage, people working at the company who'd be able to refer me, and I wouldn't move unless I was sure to get the job.)

My credit score is about 520, as I have two collections notices and had a family member create debt for me by using my SSN that fell off after seven years and have never done anything that'd garner me good credit. I have been researching and found that a loan company (Avant) will give person loans with the cruddiest interest rate of 35.99%, but you must meet a credit score of at least 540. I've recently got a credit card through my bank that I can only use if the amount I'm spending is already in a credit account (secure credit I think it's called, basically if I wanna use it for $20 I have to have the $20 already in this specialized account for it). If I settle my collections notices and continue to use my credit, would it be feasible that I'm able to raise my credit to 540 and get a loan of that amount? I really know nothing of finances / loans / credit cards and have only been able to try to find the information on the internet.

personalfinance,What to consider when refinancing a home,"Good Afternoon,

Everyone I talk to says that you should refinance when you can save 1% now a days. I am looking at refinancing personally but I had a question about what should be considered when refinancing.

Right now we have a 4.125 interest rate and we could re-finance at 2.99. Currently have a 30 year and will be re-financing with a 30 year. But we have lived in the house for about a year and a half and with the **interest we have already paid** ($12,000) on the house + **closing costs** ($2000) that we will have with the refinance the total cost comes out to be around $14,000. 

**Here is the Question**: Should you take what you have already paid in interest into consideration as a loss that needs to be recuperated? 

If it needs to be considered as a loss, then why would anyone refinance?? The savings would be around 100$ a month so this would take 12 years to recuperate.  Am I not understanding something?",finance
personalfinance,Is it really better to buy/lease at the end of the year?,"Hi everyone,

My husband and I have both always driven used cars that we owned outright. Both our cars are older and run well, but mine is a 2001 coupe. Normally I’d keep driving it until it gave out on me, but we’re planning on having kids next year and an old coupe is neither safe nor practical. 

We have about $20k saved up, but that is our emergency fund and I don’t want to use it on a car. We will have more saved up by December, but we’re moving next year and the extra savings will go towards that expense.

Since we’re going to be starting a family, I’d like to get a safe and reliable small SUV. Our combined salary is roughly $150k annually and our expenses are pretty low. I know we could definitely do a payment on a car, but I’m leaning towards leasing because I can get a brand new vehicle with payments under $250/mo - plus I hardly ever drive anywhere (although with kids that will change slightly - dr appointments etc). Still, I expect my annual mileage to remain very low where leasing would make sense. 

Is it true that you really get a better deal at the end of the year? I’m tempted to wait until February to get a new vehicle (after our move in January) but I don’t want to miss out on a bargain when it comes to interest rates and lower monthly payments. 

Should I shop in December or does it not matter?
Also, thoughts on leasing vs buying certified used?

personalfinance,Student loans entering repayment. Need help figuring out next steps.,"Hey everyone!

I graduated from a private university in May with a lot of debt. Just over $150,000. Most of it was through Sallie Mae and approximately $25,000 of it was through federal loans. As it stands, my monthly payment is in the ballpark of $2,500, likely more.

personalfinance,Student loan interest tax question,"So I know loan interest paid can be a tax deduction - but what about federal SL loan interest that has been compounded into the principal already - does that also count as interest paid once that gets paid off?

2015 - took out 20k
2015-2018 - made zero payments so tons of interest capitalized or compounded (whichever it's called) and new principal in 2018 is like 27k + there's whatever interest accrues daily. 

2018-2020- catch up on payments, get the tax deduction etc.  

2021 - Now loan is down to 23k &amp; it's all ""principal"" according to the loan administrator even though original loan amount was 20k - in this example will the specific 3k I pay in 2021 be counted as interest paid in terms of receiving a federal tax deduction? Specifically let's say I make a full payoff in January 2021 and have no other SL and meet the other criteria - can I expect any tax deduction?

personalfinance,27 year old looking for thoughts and suggestions planning for the future,"I won't inundate you all with the backstory, but some kind person from /r/wsb recommended I reach out to a more reasonable crowd for advice on my recent windfall.

Essentially I was very reckless and irresponsible and went far outside my acceptable risk limits, but I have ended up with a gain of \~$520k CAD from $138k CAD (a total of $658k CAD) from doing very short term options.

**Let me be very clear:** I fully recognize the foolishness and gravity of the situation and I fully intend to take a timeout to allow my excitement and mood to subside lest I squander this fool's luck of a windfall. I'm also confident that I will do not anything similar again but talk is cheap and I'd like allocate good chunks of this into less liquid instruments so it's not readily available.

A bit of necessary background information about myself:

I'm 27 living in Vancouver, B.C, Canada and worked a decent paying (for local standards, which is extremely depressed) job in tech as a developer up until I got laid off 2 weeks ago. In terms of the job situation, I've been frantically applying and interviewing, and as of this morning, have received verbal offers on hand, so that front is (hopefully) settled given we are able to hash out the details.

I purchased a small, modest, condo just shy of 10 years ago that I reside in and has appreciated in value. Never missed a mortgage payment to date and never intend to. It's effectively cheaper for me to live here than to rent anywhere else in the city even after the strata fees, so I have that going for me. I have no intentions to sell said property anytime soon, and I also have a home that I put 20% down on (using a HeLoC) with the equity I own in this condo.

The home is currently rented out to a family, albeit not for a great amount and it does not cash flow (as is the case with pretty much all properties in this place), but the plan was stow away as much income as I possibly could while I'm earning decent money, because who knows what comes tomorrow?

Interest rates in all cases are between 2.5\~3%, I have great credit score also. I am fairly okay with my current exposure to real estate and don't intend to take on too much more exposure on that front, and I'm of the belief that interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future so I'm not too keen on throwing cash at that so long as I'm able to continue to service the mortgage payments. As of this morning, I am positioned to have no worries servicing those payments in that regard, and I do prefer to keep them as I can write off part of the interest against my rental income.

I would love to put this money to good use to create a nest egg for my future family and to be able to have more freedom in what I choose to do so I can better contribute to society and teach my kids to be great people. I'm expecting (and will) keep my income either the same or increasing for the next few years so I'd like to plan around that (about 160k CAD or so pretax), allocate a portion for respectable dividend companies, *pay the taxman his significant cut* and have the rest generate a return outpacing interest rates (but am not concerned if I have a down year or three).

*I guess what I'm asking for is for opinions on what you would do if you were in my situation, with one caveat: I have no interest in bonds or paying % fees annually for someone to manage my funds for me (aside from ETF MERs)*

I grew up from a really rough background and lost every single member of my family along the way, including my parents, and I also live frugally and a minimalistic life so lifestyle inflation is not a concern. I've lived and spent more or less the same since I was keeping the family alive at 14 vs now.

CryptoCurrency,A Detailed Summary of Every Single Reason Why I am Bullish on Ethereum,"The following will be a list of the many reasons why I hold and am extremely bullish on ETH.

#This is an extremely long post. If you just want the hopium without the detail, read the TL;DR at the bottom.

#ETH 2.0

As we all know, ETH 2.0 phase 0 is right around the corner. This will lock up ETH and stakers will earn interest on their ETH in return for securing the network. Next comes phase 1 where the ETH 2 shards are introduced, shards are essentially parallel blockchains which are each responsible for a different part of Ethereum’s workload, think of it like a multi-core processor vs a single core processor. During phase 1, these shards will only act as data availability layers and won’t actually process transactions yet. However, their data can be utilised by the L2 scaling solution, rollups, increasing Ethereum’s throughput in transactions per second up to 100,000 TPS.

After phase 1 comes phase 1.5 which will move the ETH 1.0 chain into an ETH 2 shard and Ethereum will be fully secured by proof of stake. This means that ETH issuance will drop from around 5% per year to less than 1% and with EIP-1559, ETH might become a deflationary asset, but more on that later.

Finally, with ETH 2.0 phase two, each shard will be fully functional chains. With 64 of them, we can expect the base layer of Ethereum to scale around 64x, not including the massive scaling which comes from layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups as previously mentioned.

While the scaling benefits and ETH issuance reduction which comes with ETH 2.0 will be massive, they aren’t the only benefits. We also get benefits such as increased security from PoS compared to PoW, a huge energy efficiency improvement due to the removal of PoW and also the addition of eWASM which will allow contracts to be programmed in a wide range of programming languages, opening the floodgates for millions of web devs who want to be involved in Ethereum but don’t know Ethereum’s programming language, Solidity.

#EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity

As I covered in [a previous post of mine,](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/) ETH doesn’t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of “minimum viable issuance”, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the addition of EIP-1559, it leaves the door open to the possibility of ETH issuance going negative. In short, EIP-1559 changes the fee market to make transaction prices more efficient (helping to alleviate high gas fees!) by burning a variable base fee which changes based on network usage demand rather than using a highest bidder market where miners simply include who pays them the most. This will result in most of the ETH being paid in transaction fees being burned. As of late, the amount which would be burned if EIP-1559 was in Ethereum right now would make ETH a deflationary asset!

#Layer 2 Scaling

In the mean time while we are waiting for ETH 2.0, layer 2 scaling is here. Right now, projects such as Deversifi or Loopring utilise rollups to scale to thousands of tx/s on their decentralised exchange platforms or HoneySwap which uses xDai to offer a more scalable alternative to UniSwap. Speaking of which, big DeFi players like UniSwap and Synthetix are actively looking into using optimistic rollups to scale while maintaining composability between DeFi platforms. The most bullish thing about L2 scaling is all of the variety of options. Here’s a non exhaustive list of Ethereum L2 scaling solutions:
- Aztec protocol (L2 scaling + privacy!)
- ZKSync
- Loopring
- Raiden
- Arbitrum Rollups
- xDai
- OMGNetwork
- Matic
- FuelLabs
- Starkware
- Optimism
- Celer Network
- + Many more

#DeFi and Composability

If you’re reading this, I am sure you are aware of the phenomena which is Decentralised Finance (DeFi or more accurately, open finance). Ethereum is the first platform to offer permissionless and immutable financial services which when interacting with each other, lead to unprecedented composability and innovation in financial applications. A whole new world of possibilities are opening up thanks to this composability as it allows anyone to take existing pieces of open source code from other DeFi projects, put them together like lego pieces (hence the term money legos) and create something the world has never seen before. None of this was possible before Ethereum because typically financial services are heavily regulated and FinTech is usually proprietary software, so you don’t have any open source lego bricks to build off and you have to build everything you need from scratch. That is if what you want to do is even legal for a centralised institution!

Oh, and if you think that DeFi was just a fad and the bubble has popped, guess again! Total value locked in DeFi is currently at an all time high. Don’t believe me? Find out for yourself on the DeFi Pulse website.

#NFTs and tokeniation

NFTs or “Non-Fungible Tokens” - despite the name which may confuse a layman - are a basic concept. They are unique tokens with their own unique attributes. This allows you to create digital art, human readable names for your ETH address (see ENS names and unstoppable domains), breedable virtual collectible creatures like crypto kitties, ownable in game assets like Gods Unchained cards or best of all in my opinion, tokenised ownership of real world assets which can even be split into pieces (this doesn’t necessarily require an NFT. Fungible tokens can be/are used for some of the following use cases). This could be tokenised ownership of real estate (see RealT), tokenised ownership of stocks, bonds and other financial assets (which by the way makes them tradable 24/7 and divisible unlike through the traditional system) or even tokenised ownership of the future income of a celebrity or athlete (see when NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie tokenized his own NBA contract.)

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the Baseline protocol which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises.

#Institutional Investment

One of Bitcoin’s biggest things it has going for it right now is the growing institutional investment. In case you were wondering, Ethereum has this too! Grayscale offers investment in the cryptocurrency space for financial institutions and their Ethereum fund has already locked up more than 2% of the total supply of ETH. Not only this, but as businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield. As a result, I expect to see companies having ETH holdings become the norm just like how Bitcoin is becoming more widespread on companies’ balance sheets.

#The state of global markets

With asset prices in almost every asset class at or near all-time highs and interest rates lower than ever and even negative in some cases, there really aren’t many good opportunities in the traditional financial system right now. Enter crypto - clearly the next evolution of financial services (as I explained in the section on DeFi earlier in this post), with scarce assets built in at the protocol layer, buying BTC or ETH is a lot like buying shares in TCP/IP in 1990 (that is if the underlying protocols of the internet could be invested in which they couldn’t). Best of all, major cryptos are down from their all-time highs anywhere between 35% for BTC or 70% for ETH and much more for many altcoins. This means that they can significantly appreciate in value before entering uncharted, speculative bubble territory.

While of course we could fall dramatically at any moment in the current macro financial conditions, as a longer term play, crypto is very alluring. The existing financial system has shown that it is in dire need of replacing and the potential replacement has started rearing its head in the form of crypto and DeFi.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. We now have ENS names and unstoppable domains which allow you to send ETH to yournamehere.ETH or TrickyTroll.crypto (I don’t actually have that domain, that’s just an example). No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. We also have smart contract wallets like Argent wallet or the Gnosis safe. These allow for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. While there are competitors which are each formidable to a certain extent such as Polkadot, Cardano and EOS, each have their own weaknesses. For example, Polkadot and Cardano are not fully operational yet and EOS is much more centralised than Ethereum. As a result, none of these competitors have any significant network effects just yet relative to the behemoth which is Ethereum. This doesn’t mean that these projects aren’t a threat. In fact, I am sure that projects like Polkadot (which is more focused on complimenting Ethereum than killing it) will take a slice out of Ethereum’s pie. However, I am still very confident that Ethereum will remain on top due to the lack of a clear number 2 smart contract platform. Since none of these ETH killers stands out as the second place smart contract platform, it makes it much harder for one project to create a network effect which even begins to threaten Ethereum’s dominance. This leads me onto my next reason - network effects.

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a [previous post on.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/guffdj/the_network_effect_is_king_what_i_have_learned/) The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and the most adoption in most metrics (ETH beats in in some metrics these days). The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (Jitsi for the zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. I know personally I have refrained from investing in altcoins because I would have to install another app on my hardware wallet or remember another recovery phrase.

Overthrowing Ethereum’s network effect is one hell of a big task these days. Time is running out for the ETH killers.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also arguably the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform (except for maybe Ethereum Classic on the neutrality part). Unlike some smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes as they wish like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Even if governments around the world wanted to censor the Ethereum blockchain, under ETH 2.0’s proof of stake, it would be incredibly costly and would require a double digit percentage of the total ETH supply, much of which would be slashed (meaning they would lose it) as punishment for running dishonest validator nodes. This means that unlike with proof of work where a 51% attacker can keep attacking the network, under proof of stake, an attacker can only perform the attack a couple of times before they lose all of their ETH. This makes attacks much less financially viable than it is on proof of work chains. Network security is much more than what I laid out above and I am far from an expert but the improved resistance to 51% attacks which PoS provides is significant.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap that it is the most secure and neutral way to transfer value between these adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place - on Ethereum - then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to over 5 years of proof of work - a system where miners have to sell newly minted ETH to pay for electricity costs - newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchnages. As pointed out by u/AdamSC1 in [his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ga20nv/32_findings_from_manually_analyzing_ethereums_top/) (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests. Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community is great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will [happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jh3zyy/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2020/g9vg1jw/) (there are plenty more examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an ETH 2.0 staking node on the testnets (Shoutout to u/superphiz who does a lot of work over in that sub!). Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **ETH 2.0** - Huge scaling and better tokenomics.
- **EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity** - ETH issuance will be super low and could go negative in the coming years.
- **Layer 2 Scaling** - Literally dozens of different solutions/projects. Many of which are live on mainnet now.
- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.
- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously.
- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol is bullish AF.
- **Institutional Investment** - Grayscale investments now owns 2% of ETH supply and growing. With institutional adoption comes awareness of the benefits of being an ETH holder and staker. ETH will complement the growing trend of companies holding Bitcoin.
- **The state of global markets** - Crypto is just about the only asset class not at an ATH and the system Ethereum wants to replace is looking very broken.
- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use.
- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect.
- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.
- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under ETH 2.0, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for adversaries like the US and China to transact on so that they don’t have to trust each other’s banks.
- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many. ETH supply is more decentralised than Bitcoin.
- **The community** - Super duper mega friendly. Shoutout to the kind folks the r/EthFinance daily!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Reduced debt from $45k to $17 in 28 months need advice..,"So, I've been with this program for about 29 months now, the lawfirm that the program is run through has notified me that due to consistent on time payments that I was eligible for a loan to help negotiate the remaining balances on my cards.

Thing is, I dont understand where they are getting their numbers from or if it's a good decision to go ahead with the loan or continue paying how I have been.

So here are some specifics.

Repayment program
$596 per month no concrete end date as negotiations are on going based on what is in the savings account that the frim uses.

Loan 
Loan amount: $17694.37
Monthly payment: $590.09 or bi weekly $272.35
Interest rate: fixed 21.99%
Loan length: 45 months

So the loan would be for this amount but would be used to negotiate lump sum payments to the creditors in hopes that they will reduce the amount owed, then if the amount needed was less than what was loaned the balance would be used to pay down the loan.

How do these numbers work? $17.6k loan at 22% should be like21.5k right? Not only that doing the 590 x 45 is like $26.5k

Should I go with the loan or stay with what I've been doing? Why isn't the math adding up with the loan details I was e-mailed?

*Update: after speaking with my father in law and wife again, in addition to all the feedback from the community here I've decided to not accept the offer. 

Seriously thank you all for your time and input, I've learned some new things in this thread and hearing other peoples sucess with similar situations is really inspiring. 

There is no quick fix, after I finish saving a $2000 emergency fund I'll dump any extra I have at the end of the month into the firms savings account to speed up the process myself.",finance
personalfinance,Wrongfully charged $2700 extra on credit card putting card over limit drastically impacting my score,"Recently purchased an engagement ring from a jewelery chain using their store credit card. We ordered the setting and the diamond separately. The setting required payment up front due to the custom design, $2700 was charged to my card. The diamond would be payed for after arrival and approval by me that it looks good. Here's where things went wrong.

When I went to pay for the diamond, there was a promotion running for a nice discount, the salesperson was helpful in getting me a good deal and returned the setting I originally ordered, to re buy it at the promotional price with the diamond. I received a receipt and paperwork showing the $2700 from the setting return going back to my credit account. We then repurchased the setting and the diamond together with the discount applied. 

Fast forward a month when my bill is due, and I notice my balance shows $2700 higher than it should. Looking at the transactions there is nothing showing the return we processed originally. This put my balance over the credit limit by nearly $1500. 

I'm currently in the process of car shopping and finally found one I like, contacted the dealership and made an appointment to test drive. I was checking my credit score before going in to get a rough idea of interest rates, and I noticed a 70 point drop from last month with the ONLY change to my credit coming from the jewelry card. 

The store has been extremely helpful trying to correct it, but the credit company has left us in the dark while they ""look into it"".

I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to correct this on my credit ASAP, and what other actions I should be taking? I'd rather not wait months to buy a new car because some system screwed my credit. 

Tldr; $2700 return never processed to my credit card putting balance over limit by $1500, dropping my credit score by nearly 70 points. How can I get my credit fixed?",finance
personalfinance,Repay student loans on income-based repayment &amp; live a more relaxing/fulfilling life?,"I posted yesterday &amp; y'all helped me out so much. I'm back with a few questions.

I'm going to graduate dental school in May with $390K in loans and $23K already accrued in interest. All federal loans, average rate 6.5%.

I have a low cost of living — $2000 a month. (\~$1K rent, $400 necessities, $600 ""fun""). I don't foresee much/any lifestyle creep as I am a minimalist and do not buy pretty much anything. Edit: I am childfree and will never have kids.

Tackling these loans with a standard repayment plan would mean a **$4700** monthly payment for 10 years with **$560K paid total**. It is most definitely possible for me to do the standard repayment, but I'll have to hustle my ass of, working 6 days a week crazy hours for 7-10 years, making hopefully $200K per year.

I truly believe in work/life balance and ""working to live."" This has me considering the PAYE/REPAYE option for loans. Here's the math:

* I work 3-4 days per week and make $100K salary (pre-tax), making my post-tax monthly income \~$6000
* My PAYE/REPAYE loan repayment is **$675 per month**
* I spend \~$2000 per month
* This leaves me with $3025 ""extra""
* If I can invest $2000 per month, with a 5% return rate (conservative estimate) , I will have $830K saved in 20 years, which is more than enough to use to pay off the ""tax bomb""
* After 20 years, I've now paid $200K total toward my loans — even so, the remaining balance has ballooned to $750K and is forgiven — at a 40% tax rate (conservative estimate), I pay $300K income ""tax bomb"" on this forgiveness
* This plan results in paying **$500K** total toward my student loans

Am I missing anything?

I just don't understand why I would work my ass off for 7-10 years to end up in the same position I would end up in with casual lifelong working. If it were working my ass off for 2-3 years, I could do it — hell, I just did it in dental school for 4 years. But TEN years is a lifetime. Shit.

I would also like to add that I am much more inclined to work as long as possible part time, than work super hard early in life and retire early. I truly don't have a desire to 100% retire at all, so long as I'm physically/mentally capable of working part time.

personalfinance,Want to drop current lender during refinance process for another. Is that ok?,"So we started the refinance process with lender-1 back in July. Both my wife and my credit are excellent, appraisal was waived, and we were making progress. At some point they assigned some rep to handle our loan and suddenly communication tanked: delayed response times, repeatedly requests for same documents, hard to reach via phone, etc. Long story short, fast forward nearly 4 months later and I'm fed up. Loan approval finally came through last week  and the rep (new one was assigned to us) called me to schedule a closing. Closing day and time came and passed and no show, no follow-up. On top of that they email me additional loan documents to sign a day after the fact and state that they have to be signed before they can schedule the loan closing.   


Due to my frustrations, today I decide to contact lender-2. They got me approved same day, and the rates and closing costs are significantly better than lender-1. I have a couple questions:  


Lender-1 is currently servicing our mortgage - is there any issue if we stop the process with them and move forward with lender-2? Can they cause any issues with the transfer given we also have an escrow they have deduct insurance and taxes from?  


We are planning on buying a house in 1-2 years. The closing costs of lender-2, although much more competitive, are still high. It would take us a year to break even with the new P+I payment. My thinking is we do it anyways because there's no guarantee we'll be moving in 1-2 years. Any insights on that?",finance

personalfinance,Searching for the Best Vehicle while Paying Down Student Debt,"I am beginning to question the reliability of my current vehicle. Even though it is a Honda, I understand that I will have to come up with a plan sooner than later. While doing some research, I began breaking down the costs of ownership and it got me thinking about the benefits of an electric vehicle in my situation. I am trying to determine if this move would be financially irresponsible. Any feedback is appreciated.

I want to make sure that I am not making a huge mistake by taking on more debt and underestimating my student loan payments. My monthly payments for my loans are around $750/month and I do not have other bills at the moment other than gas, a few meals per week, and entertainment every so often on the weekends (\~$250/month) . I have about $12,000 saved up and I do not have any credit card debt.

The biggest benefit to purchasing an electric vehicle would be eliminating gas costs (\~250/month). There are also no oil changes, no fluid replacements, no timing belts to replace, less frequent brake component replacements due to regenerative breaking, etc. The maintenance costs would basically be tires, windshield wipers, and wiper fluid over the lifetime of the car to the best of my knowledge. I already have a 220v charging outlet in my garage at home and would be able to charge the car overnight at a cheap rate, eliminating the need to pay for charging elsewhere. Electric vehicles also appear to hold their value very well. I told myself I would never buy a new car, but used electric vehicles that are a few years old are going for a few thousand under the purchase price of a new one. The difference in insurance costs are also minimal, only a few hundred dollars per year difference.

If I were to purchase a used vehicle, I would most likely end up dealing with similar issues that I have now. Is it worth it to bite the bullet and make the investment now or deal with the costs of owning a used gas car until my loans are fully paid off? What is a reasonable amount of money to spend on a car while having this amount of student debt?

**Finances:**

* Salary: $75,000
* Bonuses: About $10,000/year with annual raise
* Currently living with family &amp; fortunately do not pay rent
* Have very minimal bills other than student loan payments (\~250/month on ""other bills"")
* No credit card debt
* Student Loan Payments: \~$750/month
* Savings: $12,000
* Spend \~$250/month on gas
* Spend \~$250/month on a few meals, entertainment, etc.

**Student Loans:**

* Private: $50,000 (Refinanced to 3.5%)
* Federal: $30,000
* Student Loan Payments: \~$750/month

Was wondering what your thoughts are on the title of this post.

* I am 28 yrs old / Work as a RN / Have lupus/renal failure
* $22k in my 401k/Roth I started 2 years ago 
*  $22k in my Fidelity brokerage account I started in March. 
* $8k / 6m living expenses (renting a room)

**Goal**

Save up for a down payment on a house in the bay area ideally to house hack / utilize as an investment. (Basically 60k - 175k I need to save) I also am thinking about lowering my 401k contribution (@15% now) to meet this goal sooner and give me more room to invest into my fidelity account where I have more control. Ideally I can buy before interest rates increase but it seems like that may be too late, unless I don't do conventional or move to a cheaper area. Range is 2-8 years.

**Why**

I hate my 401k-roth/Transamerica stock options and browser. Their are only market indexes with no option to choose my prices to buy or set limit orders etc. I cant manage my own portfolio besides setting allocation percentages across the market indexes and bonds available. I am basically doing it by recommended cap sizes. Theirs only 1 S&amp;P 500 index I am okay with in there and have 80% of my 401k into it and no single stock options are available, and no option for me to easily focus on dividend investing in this account for the roth tax benefits. 

**Question**

Would it be alright for me to withdraw my contributions into my regular brokerage account and likely most of it into a IRA w/ fidelity to get better stock options and portfolio control without taking any penalties?

side note what's your guys opinion on using 401k contributions for a down payment. I personally would likely want to avoid this but since I enjoy investing and do it heavily (12-25% of income per month) in my primary account how much am I likely to get hurt long term by this?

personalfinance,"Chase Bank is closing my new checking account, money I transferred myself through Zelle disappeared","UPDATE (10.27.20 11:30am PST): So I took some of your advice and went down to a branch and spoke with a banker. I'd also like to preface with the fact that I created my account with Chase in person and not online, and when I created it, they took my ID and SS and had me sign the appropriate paperwork; I did not do it online. Anyways.. I spoke with the banker who created my account and apparently my social was blank in the system, as in it was all zeroes. So it seems it was a mistake on the side of the bank. I had assumed it was 'suspicious activity' that got my account restricted since I had personally typed in my social into the form when the account was created, but apparently it wasn't that. I went in and confirmed my ID and social, and the banker told me that after the forms are submitted, my account will be released in a few business days for normal use. As for the Zelle issue, even though it processed before the restriction was placed on my account, it bounced back once the restriction was placed. The banker told me that Zelle is holding on to it, and that it will be returned to my original account in 3 to 5 business days as well. Overall, it's been a stressful process, but going in person immediately really helped solve the problem. Thank you for your advice all, Chase is a difficult bank to work with.

---

I recently opened a Chase College checking account (not even a month ago) and just received a notice that my account is being closed due to ‘suspicious activity or failure to produce needed information.’ Now... I did a quick Google search and found out that Chase is trigger happy on closing accounts and mine probably got flagged because I have been moving money from my checking account with Navy Federal into my Chase account through Zelle to keep myself afloat until my direct deposit updates. So my problem isn’t that my account is being closed, I’ll take that loss. The problem is that the money I transferred through Zelle has since disappeared. It’s not an issue of the money having never gotten to my Chase account, or being sent to a closed account. I sent the money last week and the transaction had been cleared, delivered, and completed. It cleared from both ends and showed up in my account almost immediately. I just received a notice of account closure about an hour ago through the e-statements (dated today, October 27) so the payment wasn’t sent to a closed account. I checked my account through the Chase mobile app and on a web browser and the Zelle extension confirms I received the payment, but it doesn’t show in my checking statement or activity anymore. The money is gone, and doesn’t show up in my Navy Federal account either.

Does anyone know if the money will be returned to my Navy Federal account through Zelle? Or does anyone have a similar experience? This is stressing me because I sent most of my paycheck to my Chase account and now it’s gone.

TLDR; I sent myself money through Zelle from one bank to another, then the receiving account got shut down and my money disappeared from both banks. What should I expect?",finance

* Currently maxing out 401ks with matching on top of that, IRAs, buying additional equity assets as well. 
* High absolute debt, but only around 2x total income. All low interest (think mortgage, federal student loans).

I don't want to put much down in the way of cash. ~ 5%. Rental income would be around $50-$100/month in post-cost/expense return. I know that there are unexpected expenses that can come up (new water heater, furnace, etc.) and maintenance that will need to be done.

""Justification"" -&gt; leverage/diversification. Interest rates are low. We can throw extra cash into the property to pay down the loan.

Without me disclosing that quote, the other lender ALSO came back and said ""if you put down 106,600K, we can do 2.625% for a 30 year loan"". Basically, they both said they could offer better interest rates if I put down exactly the same amount. The purchase price is 617K, so that would be a random number of 17.277147% down payment... Why did both lenders come to the same % of down payment to offer a lower rate???

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - I know a higher down payment could lower your income to debt ratio and therefore make the loan less risky for the lender. I'm just curious why two separate lenders came to the exact same down payment number. The first lender actually doesn't even have my current salary, as I got a small raise since I first talked to her (just 3K difference).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2 - Thank you all, now I know about conforming loan vs jumbo loan and how getting under the conforming loan can get you a better rate since they can sell the loan to freddie mac and fannie mae. I've asked my lenders why they are usuing $510,400 as the threshold even though the county I'm purchasing in has a conforming loan limit of 690K.",finance
personalfinance,Job Switching: Not Sure Where To Go,"Hey Everybody,

I was hoping to get some more opinions on a decision I've been lamenting over: leaving my current job for a new one. Here's the deets:

Industry: Banking

Current Role: Personal Banker

Pros: 4 weeks PTO with another week of sick-time, paid; 6% 401k match; high-deductible health care supplemented by an HSA with matching, dental, and vision. Great manager, and I'm well respected by regional manager and even higher. 

Cons: Workload - I'm easily filling the role of an assistant manager for 50% less pay. Coworkers - most can't keep up with their jobs and I assist as I can to keep things running smoothly, while others flex their long standing with the manager and try to act like one. Commute 25 miles to and from work. General corporate culture and demeaning messages for not hitting performance goals. Have applied for positions in other departments in which I was qualified only to be told by my regional that they ""don't look"" at internal applicants and don't expect a response.

New Job: Also banking, but at an all digital credit union, so no in-person and no sales goals  Similar benefits all around except for 3 weeks of PTO and no certainty on sick time. Work from home for the foreseeable future, but when I have to go back my commute increases to 45 miles. Less prestigious position, going from personal banker to call center, but retain a lot of my same functions just without the title. 

The counter: My current workplace has now offered me a mentorship by the department head I was originally applying for, along with a promotion to my immediate next level. 

The real problem: I'm getting held up on a lot of little conveniences - if I'm running late, I tell my manager and I'm good. Wanna take vacation? No sweat. I am running on fumes, though. I've worked with people for in different jobs for 8 years, and I am good at it, but I am so jaded by some of the interactions I've had that's it's slowly becoming impossible to separate myself from my emotions. People seek me out actively, which is great for business, but keeps me from doing other things that I need to do and hitting goals. I want to help and keep things running efficiently, but we are terribly understaffed on purpose and will continue to be, leaving me being a banker and teller all throughout the day. My coworkers are catty, always having a comment on if I have a day off and trying to get me in hot water, and I'm just trying to do my job. Im challenged, which I enjoy, and am concerned about this new position being too easy. Both will pay me equally. A mentorship is great, but we're spread so thin I just don't know when I or anyone else has the time to offer me something like that. Current job has given fuck all about the pandemic and continued to service customers in-person regularly, even during the shutdown. I'm concerned over the more rigid structure of this new job, shorter lunches, and just feeling bad about a call center from where I'm at now, although on paper it's not less than in any way. Advancement opportunities are available at both, but ive been soured by my current workplace at attempts to leave retail. 

TL;DR: I have a lot of great, little things at my current job that keep me loyal and placated. I don't want to feel like I've moved down from where I'm at currently, but continuing to work where I do grates on me so much that it's hard to keep motivated",finance

personalfinance,Very exciting day for me. I need some help though.,"Hello everyone! 

I've been working relentlessly to fix the credit I messed up when I would walk into Sears, Filene's, and Macy's and they all gave me cards so easily at the age of 19. 
I knew nothing about credit, I didn't have anyone telling me about how important it was etc. I'm just into my 40's now and I was finally in a spot to start really working at it about 3+ years ago. 

I came from somewhere in the low 500s and today I made it to a 701! 
I'm not extremely versed on how to effectively use and gain credit, but I've been reading everything in this sub daily. 
I know I need a couple more cards, and to expand my credit with a loan at some point too.
 I need to get my credit utilization down from 48% to below 30%. This is something I can do, I only owe ~$740 total between the 3 cards.I learned from this sub about how important this is. I have excellent on time payments (100%) but I stupidly used a lot of credit very early in this journey.

So here is my question for anyone who can help with advice. 
I've been wanting to get the Discover It card and I've been matched with the Chrome It and CashBack. They both offer 0% APR for 14 months introductory, so I was thinking of transferring my remaining balances to one of these and just pay towards the actual balance and I could get this done much quicker without paying the interest rate. It would probably take me 4-6 months. I know it's not nearly a lot of money to owe, but I'm paying back as much as I can with other bills and a child with special needs, and a freshman in college. 

The only thing I worry about is taking the chance of being approved. I know I need another card or 2, I'm just sort of frozen because I don't want to mess anything up with the time and effort I've put in.
I care so much about this, I know at my age I should know more than I do, but I'm getting there!

Is there any catch with the introductory 0% for 14 months?
Do you recommend applying, and if accepted, should I transfer my balances?",finance

investing,LUMN is Currently trading at a 8 P/E ratio and 11% dividend yield,"I continue to remain very bullish on this stock. While the dividend was cut to its current level in early 2019, that was done when interest rates had been rising rapidly, and due to fear of runaway borrowing costs if interest rates continued to rise, the company's leadership decided shareholders would receive better value if they used their earnings to deleverage rather than pay dividends.

Since then, the company has been redeeming callable notes with high interest rates, as well as refinancing existing debt at lower interest rates. Interest rates ended up going down rather than up, but it did push the company to address its debt risk.

I would argue that current market conditions are better for LUMN than ever. Historically, during recessions telecommunications companies have performed very well, as their services are needed and paid for regardless. We Additionally, the low interest rate environment helps the company manage their debt load and ensure lower interest expense, boosting earnings. We saw very strong earnings in Q2 despite many other industries being hit very hard.

I think it is very unlikely LUMN cuts their dividend any time soon. If they do, it will probably only be a partial cut rather than a full cut, and be better for shareholders in the long run anyways.

I see LUMN as a solid play for this low interest rate environment. The only other major company I know with a similar yield is XOM, but their dividend is not sustainable, they are experiencing massive losses for the forseeable future.

Disclaimer: I own shares in LUMN.",finance

stocks,Here's how I'm getting Infrastructure exposure ahead of the election...,"Got asked on another post to do a deep dive on how I'm getting exposure to infrastructure ahead of the November election. This is far from exhaustive so please feel free to offer additional thoughts or \*thoughtful\* critiques/countervailing narrative.

I'll offer two elements of analysis:

1. A rationale for why I believe infrastructure is a smart bet and the general investment timeline I'm working toward
2. Specific stock and ETF picks that I think are likely to grow with the undertaking of a national infrastructure project

# It's Infrastructure Week in America, but for real this time.

""Its infrastructure week"" has become something of an inside joke for political enthusiasts in the past few years as the [Trump administrations efforts to advance an infrastructure deal have been repeatedly derailed by political turmoil](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/donald-trump-infrastructure-week/index.html). During the 2016 campaign, a prominent commonality between the insurgent campaigns of both Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and then-businessman Donald Trump was an infrastructure spending package totaling upwards of $1 trillion. Infrastructure spending is broadly popular and supported by both parties elected's as both an effective tool in the economic stimulus toolbox and a worthwhile investment as America's highways and bridges age. Legislative leaders on both sides of the political aisle have signaled their openness to bipartisan collaboration and its a smart bet that any administration will make it a priority next year.

With all of that said, the next element of my analysis assumes two things:

&amp;#x200B;

* Joe Biden will win the election. Emotions run high whenever folks offer an assertion like this but what you should know is that [Wall St is positioning itself for a Democratic sweep.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/27/wall-street-biden-blue-wave-432710) I'll say ad nauseum that of course, Tump has a *chance* to win the election. However, most of the major forecasting models place that chance between 7%-12% which AGAIN is NOT the same as 0%. The smart money is preparing for the most likely outcome, regardless of what MAGA world might believe about the polls and Nate Silver. With that in mind...
* It probably doesn't matter who wins. The contours of an infrastructure deal under Biden define my investing strategy but a second Trump term will likely deliver some sort of infrastructure package anyway. As I see it, the main differentiator is the extent to which we should expect investment in ""green"" infrastructure that include things like grid efficiency upgrades, EV charging stations, and renewable energy projects.

All of this to say, infrastructure and infrastructure-as-stimulus is likely to be funded in the neighborhood of $1-$3 trillion in the next 24 months. There are a lot of politics at play here that eat up space, but if you want a breakdown of the dynamics and specific proposals being considered I can follow up with more context.

# Investing for Infrastructure Growth

I'm expecting an infrastructure deal that expands federal spending through the federal highway act and block grants to municipalities, continues the expansion of 5G, expands ""green"" infrastructure, and spearheads the first serious investment in rail in over a century.

A few disclaimers

* I should note that with one exception, I am limiting my exposure to infrastructure to around 8% of my total portfolio which is particularly aggressive for my risk profile. More on that exception below.
* You should do your own due diligence because no analysis is objective and your investment goals and profile differ greatly from mine
* You can find a lot of this information and analysis with pretty limited research and follow up on it by doing a deeper dive on each pick to suit your interests. This is very much supposed to be a guide to help you think about the players in this space and not at all a framework to blindly invest in.

&amp;#x200B;

**CAT - Caterpillar - Heavy Equipment Manufacturer**

CAT is a key heavy equipment provider across the globe. Despite some tough times in the past two quarters, their stock price has largely recovered from the frenzied selloff in March. In a 48 month timeframe, we'd expect to see consistent growth in sales from their 2020 low points.

**USCR - US Concrete - Industrial Scale Concrete Provider**

Despite some recovery, USCR is still down almost 50% from its 2019 highs after getting slammed in March. The companies fundamentals however are very strong. Signaling their confidence, company management bought the dip contributing to a $400 million cash raise with just $32 million in debt. I'd expect to see some sustainable growth here as infrastructure talks leave the runway.

**UNP - Union Pacific - Railroad/Railway Operations and Procurement**

Its no secret that Uncle Joe loves trains. So much so in fact that investment in rail is a fixture of his [infrastructure plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#). Railways essentially operate as monopolies, positioning UNP to reap most of the reward from any major investment. Whats more, they've maintained steady (if not particularly strong) returns throughout COVID and offer a solid 2.3% dividend to make holding some worth your while.

**ERIC - Ericcson - Telecommunications**

With the 5G race well underway, I'd expect to see funding for 5G expansion either tied directly to an omnibus infrastructure package or as a standalone provision. Ericcson and Nokia are the only two telecomm companies besides the infamous Huawei that can deliver, a factor thats been driving Ericcson returns. Already a favorite for investors that want a piece of 5G action, Ericcson also offers a modest 1.3% dividend.

**AMT - American Tower - Cell Tower Construction/Management**

AMT is already the biggest player in cellphone tower space, with a bulk of their holding in the American markets. Still, they're rapidly growing in South America and India and are another key piece of the growing 5G framework in the United States

**PBW and ICLN - ETFs - Clean Energy**

If you even tangentially follow this sub you've probably seen a lot of hype for ICLN and PBW (including from yours truly). Clean energy ETF's are coming off something of a sugar high, but even Wall St is willing to pay a premium for exposure. Together, these ETF's cover a mix of domestic and international clean energy solutions that are poised for substantial growth in the next decade. Its likely this growth will be catalyzed by not only major ""green"" spending in a Biden infrastructure package, but key policy choices (like extending solar tax credits) that will boost the entire industry. I'm also looking forward to the ChargePoint IPO sometime in 2021, as I'd like to get some money into EV charging networks specifically.

\--

There are of course some other pieces here that I've avoided due to controversy (looking at you TSLA). Hoping this helps you start to think about how you want to position yourself and/or which pieces of the pie you think are most promising. Like I said, please feel free to sound off with additional analysis",finance
personalfinance,Can parents get a large personal loan to cover credit card debt? Can you explain like I'm 5?,"Illinois. They have 20 years left on a mortgage. The mortgage is very cheap and not the issue. They have a fixed income and are on social security disability/retirement only. The issue is approximately 50% of their combined $2,500 income goes towards credit cards that they irresponsibly rang up their adult lives and are now paying for with this fixed income. (Haven't had credit cards open in years but still owe $33,000)

They had been ""making ends meet"" (not really. Supported a lot by children) but now they have a $2,000 vet bill (They shouldn't have pets either, I know.) and are behind $3,500 in property taxes for the 2nd half of 2019. We can't keep covering for them.

All they care about is keeping their home and there is a lot of equity in it. They own $165,000 of equity in it. (Yes they have a 20 year mortgage on $80,000) but their credit scores are around 660 and my mom has TERRIBLE credit HISTORY. She gave up at one point paying all her credit cards and has numerous 60 and 90 day lates as recent as January 2020. The bank they have their current mortgage with won't do a heloc or a cash out refi or anything to tap the equity.

A cosigner isn't possible right now either.

My question was about personal loans. Or would my mom's credit history ruin this too? I briefly searched this today. I read that it may be possible for credit unions to make personal loans with high APR. Would this benefit them in their situation? The interest rates on their cards are low thanks to a debt management program they are enrolled in that lowers their interest rates on all cards. At the current rate it would take until October 2023 to pay everything off and take $1,250 each month of their pay. Would there be any realistic way they could take out a personal loan where they could pay off the cards now and pay less each month even if it took longer than 3 years? I feel like that might give everyone some breathing room. Or am I misunderstanding what a personal loan is altogether?

I am seeing a banker at BMO/Harris where they currently have their mortgage to make sure there is nothing they can do to assist my parents and see if there are any options she can suggest. But I kind of wanted to know if I could squash this idea before bringing it up. (I know BMO isn't a credit union) thanks!",finance

The employees will help pick, pack and ship customer orders across Amazon’s network of warehouses in the U.S. and Canada. Amazon will hire the most workers in California, Texas, Maryland, Georgia and New Jersey.

Amazon [hired](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-double-seasonal-hiring-record-200k-workers-business-continues-boom/) 200,000 temporary workers during last year’s holiday season, twice as many as in 2018.

In May, Amazon [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/amazon-to-offer-permanent-roles-to-70percent-of-175000-new-us-hires.html) it would offer permanent roles to 70% of the 175,000 workers it hired at the height of the pandemic. Even after it brought on 125,000 warehouse employees, the remaining 50,000 workers will stay on seasonal contracts that are expected to last up to 11 months.

Amazon employed 876,800 people [as of June 30](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2020/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results/default.aspx), excluding contractors and temporary workers.

The coronavirus pandemic has reshaped this year’s holiday shopping season in a number of ways. Amazon postponed [Prime Day](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/amazon-announces-prime-day-2020-results.html) to October from mid-July, which kickstarted the holiday rush earlier than ever for many retailers.

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated from college and am working a job where I make about $2.3k net a month. I've been working on paying off my Parent Plus loans before the time I'd need to start making payments on my personal federal loans. I will have those finished by the time my grace period ends. My expenses are pretty minimal. I am paying for my groceries, gas, phone bill, and auto insurance. That's it. Needless to say, I have a substantial amount of income that I don't have allotted to other things. 

I'm not 100% sure what my student loan payments look like, but I'm fairly confident it'll be around $300. My phone and gas is around $110. I am saving up for a ring ($2.5k) so that's another focus of mine. I'd just generally like some direction. Any and all advice is welcome!",finance
personalfinance,How soon is “too soon” to refinance a personal loan?,"Backstory: I am knee deep into my debt free journey and want a bit of advice with a personal loan I recently took out to consolidate the last of my CC debt. Long story short, I had just over $23k in CC debt when the pandemic started  and have worked that down to just under $9k as I sit here today. Been a struggle to say the least but the journey has been extremely financially rewarding. I was able to take out a personal loan for $8500 at a 12.89% interest rate for the last of my credit card debt. I just took out this personal loan a couple of weeks ago and at the time my FICO hovered at just above 700, but since I have paid off the credit cards, and my FICO score has increased to 762. I was able to refinance my auto loan from 6.89% down to 3.79% just today, and my question is, is it too soon to try and refinance the personal loan I just took out???

personalfinance,What questions to ask the lender when refinancing my home from 30 year to 15 year fixed mortgage?,"Hi All,

I'm a mid 30's single guy. My neighbor and I live in an area with rapidly rising property and home values.  He has taken a recent refinance of his home at 2.5% APR for a 15 year fixed mortgage, and is trying to convince me to do the same.  I purchased this home back in 2015 with a loan for a 4.3% APR, with a one-time PMI payment.  I only had enough liquid cash for a 5% down payment on the house due to my somewhat limited savings at the time, so my interest rate wasn't the best for this loan.

Fast forward to today.  I have pretty significant improvement in income and the ability to refinance to a lower interest rate and a 15 year mortgage. Since I have the means right now to pay a higher monthly payment,  I know I need to target a fixed mortgage, but am a little worried about the utter eagerness of all the lenders I have talked to.  It seems like when something is too easy, it may be making the other party a lot of money and costing me instead.

With that in mind, what kind of questions do I need to ask the lender to make sure that I don't get ripped off, and that this is a good deal for me?  Is there any wiki post or easy formula to figure out a cost break-even to see if this is the right decision for me?  Saving almost 2% in interest and significantly lowering my term to 15 years seems like a good idea, but I am also 5 years into this current loan.

Thank you in advance, and please let me know if there's other information I should provide to help get the best answer possible.  I know one factor is how long I plan to stay in this home.  Currently I have a quite stable work from home job, and likely don't need to move any time in the future so far as I can plan.",finance
personalfinance,Just got approved for a BT CC (Citibank Dbl Cash - 0% for 18mo on BT) - lower limit than was hoping - just want to confirm I'm looking at things right,"To be honest, dealing with finances intimidates me, so I often just leave stuff as is and chock the less-than-ideal stuff up as lessons learned.  COVID and the resulting chaos has really opened my eyes as to how vulnerable I'm letting myself be, or rather, how much I'm letting myself get fleeced by high interest rates, so here we are.  After stewing for years on pursuing a low/zero % int. rate BT card, I finally chose one that I felt good with.  As the title states, what I applied/got approved for, just this morning, actually, is this:

* **Citi Double Cash Card - 18mo 0% Balance Transfer (3% fee) - $6200 limit**

The card I will be bringing the balance over from is this:

* **US Bank REI Co-op World Elite - 19.99% - Balance: $7142.28**

I guess I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was hoping for a little bit higher limit.  I have other CC debt, but this is the worst % rate, so I want to tackle it first.  Taking into account the 3% fee and the $6200 limit on the new card, I believe what I would be looking at is the following:

* Transfer of $6019 from USBank card to Citi card (assuming the transfer is approved, it's my understanding it's not necessarily a given?)
* $6019 + 3% = $6199.57 on my new, 0%/18mo Citi card - Broken evenly into 18 payments, this comes to \~ $345/mo.  That doesn't take into account if I pay more each month.
* $1124 would be left on the US Bank CC at whatever %r it settles at (currently 19.99%)

What I need to do, once the transfer takes places and balances are settled, is this:

* Budget funds!!!   I know I will allocate, at a minimum, for the 18mo - even split payment ($345) on my Citi card, but I want to pay all other monthly bills (rent, utilities, cell, etc...) first.
* Once those bills are paid, I need to figure out where to maximize my payments with my remaining funds, so either to the balance remaining on the US Bank card (**option A**), towards my other CC debt balance (Chase CC, $9k @ 14.99%ish) (**option B**), or towards the maximizing on the new Citibank CC balance, so $345 + whatever else I can (**option C**).  I'm leaning towards option B, as that's where the most damage, in terms of a financial hit, will be happening.

Does this make sense, or am I thinking about this all backwards?  I chose not to initiate a balance transfer upon approval, as I wanted to make sure I felt confident of an approach.  By NOT initiating the transfer immediately, I'm stuck waiting until I have a card IN HAND before I can setup my online banking profile and getting the transfer setup, so I have a little time to figure things out if I'm going about this all wrong.",finance
personalfinance,Just cashed our check for a personal injury settlement....now what?,"My husband was in a pretty serious car accident about two years ago. Thankfully he just walked away a bit banged up and needed some staples in his head, but his (newly paid off) car was a total loss. We were able to get an initial check from the other guy’s insurance for about $11,000, which we immediately used for a down payment on buying a nice but used car. Got the final check this week and it comes out to a little over $30,000. My question is...what’s the best thing to do with it as a young married couple with some debt, but would like some savings? (Note: our attorney told us that personal injury settlements cannot be taxed by the IRS, but we definitely want to make sure that’s true and save some money just in case we get hit with extra taxes for the extra income).

My husband is a geologic engineer making $45,000/year (not many rocks in the state where we live!). I am a full time law student planning to graduate in May, where I have a job waiting (assuming I pass the bar) paying about $80,000. My husband will likely get bumped up to $50,000 come May as well, and has the chance to double his salary in the next five years once he gets his final certification. We live in a state with a very low cost of living, which helps out a lot.

We know for sure we’d like to pay off the rest of his car (still owe about $12,000 on it). Our monthly liabilities are: $280 car note, $400 student loan (my husband owes $30,000 and I owe $36,000 currently with a 0% interest rate until December), $980 mortgage (still owe $158,000 on house), ~$150 car insurance, $30 life insurance policies, ~$150 utilities each month, $400/month groceries and out to eat, and maybe $100 misc. Phone bills and health insurance are paid for by husband’s work. We live very comfortably on a single income of only $45,000. My husband is hourly, and when he works overtime he easily makes about $65,000. 

We are extremely frugal when we can be. We have about $5,000 already in regular savings and $1,200 in a high yield savings account (though our rate dropped when Covid hit). Once we pay off the car, we’re looking at about $20,000 left over. Where should we spend it? Should we put a few thousand down on mine and my husband’s student loan since we have no interest through December? Should we just pay on his loan since I will have until next year to pay mine? We were kind of of the mind that once we pay off the car, to add that amount that we would have been paying ($280) to my husband’s student loan, making total monthly payments to the student loan to be about $680. I also would really like to stow away a decent chunk into savings, as my husband and I will likely be having children in the next few years and I want to make sure that our income will be supplemented in case I decide to become a full-time stay at home mom.

personalfinance,Investment Property,"Hi all,

I've been looking into getting started with an investment property recently. I have around $25,000 saved including some in shares. I'm still living with my parents as the area I live in is expensive to even rent. I want to get myself a property so at least I have a foot in the door and am not stuck paying rent my entire life. I'm looking into semi-remote areas of my state (NSW) and have found several areas where a 2-3 bedroom house can be purchased for around $125,000-150,000. The listed rental return is around $200-$250/week. Since the borrowing rates are so low at the moment this seemed feasable to me.

My parents have offered to guarentor for me to help me get a mortgage.

My plan would be:

Rent out the property and minus all fees funnell all the money from the property back into it. Then I would put another \~$200 a week out of pocket into paying off the mortage to save on interest rates. I am currently working as a full-time casual and on about $800/week after tax. I'll be able to live with my parents for another 1-2 years during which time I would plan to pay off as much of the mortgage as possible, and down the track if things go south and I have no other option I could always move into the house. The ultimate plan is to be able to sell this property once the mortage is payed off and be able to get a mortage out on something closer to Sydney to live in in the future so I am at least paying off a mortage and will gain something out of it rather than just funnelling money into rent every week that I will never see again.  I am not expecting much in terms of capital gains but do think there is some potential for growth in semi-rural areas as work begins to turn more digital and more people are starting to work from home.

Basically what I want to know is:

How feasable does this sound?

Are there any potential issues that I am not seeing?

Just signed the latest change management document, I was the last in the chain so I signed it today for changing the d parameter from 0.52 to 0.5. That means we are just about to cross the threshold here in a little bit for d to fall below 0.5 which means more than half of all the blocks will be made by the community and not the OBFT nodes. That's a major milestone and at this current rate of velocity it looks like d will decrement to zero around March so lots to do, lots to talk about. Product update, two days from now, we'll go ahead and talk about that but it crossed my desk today and I was really happy and excited about that and it seemed like yesterday that d was equal to one and people were complaining that we delayed it by an epoch and now we're almost at 50 percent. For those of you who want parameter-level changes, k-level changes, they are coming and there's an enormous internal conversation about it and we've written up a powerpoint presentation and a philosophy document about why things were designed the way that they're designed.

**Increasing k parameter and upcoming security video and everybody's a game theorist**

 My chief scientist has put an enormous amount of time into this. Aggelos is very passionate about this particular topic and what I'm going to do is similar to the security video that I did where I did an hour and a half discussion about a best practice for security. I'm going to actually do a screencasted video where I talk about this philosophy document and I'm going to read the entire document with annotations with you guys and kind of talk through it. It might end up being quite a long video. It could be several hours long but I think it's really important to talk around the design philosophy of this. It's kind of funny, everybody, when they see a cryptographic paper or math paper, they tend to just say okay you guys figure that out. No one's an expert in cryptography or math and you don't really get strong opinions about it but game theory  despite the fact that the topics as complex and in some cases more complex you tend to get a lot of opinions and everybody's a game theorist. So, there was enormous amount of thought that went into the design of the system, the parameters of system, everything from the reward functions to other things and it's very important that we explain that thought process in as detailed of a way as possible. At least the philosophy behind it then I feel that the community is in a really good position to start working on the change management. It is my position that I'd love to see k largely increased. I do think that the software needs some improvements to get there especially partial delegation delegation portfolios and some enhancements into the operation of staking especially.

**E-voting** 

I'd love to see the existence of hybrid wallets where you have a cold part a hot part and we've had a lot of conversations about that and we will present some of the progress in that matter at the product updates. If not this October certainly in November. A lot of commercialization going along, a lot of things going on and flowing around and you know, commercial teams working hard. As I mentioned we have a lot of deals in the pipeline. The Wyoming event was half political, half sales. We were really looking into e-voting and we had very productive conversations along those lines. It is my goal that Cardano e-voting software is used in political primaries and my hope is for eventually to be used in municipal and state and eventually federal elections and then in national elections for countries like Ethiopia, Mongolia and other places. Now there is a long road, long, long road to get there and many little victories that have to begin but this event. Wyoming was kind of the opener into that conversation there were seven independent parties at the independent national convention and we had a chance to talk to the leadership of many of them. We will also engage in conversation with the libertarian party leadership as well and at the very least we could talk about e-voting and also blockchain-based voting for primaries that would be great start and we'll also look into the state of Wyoming for that as well. We'll you know, tell you guys about that in time. We've already gotten a lot of inquiries about e-voting software. We tend to get them along with the (Atala) Prism inquiries. It's actually quite easy to start conversations but there are a lot of security properties that are very important like end-to-end verifiability hybrid ballots where you have both a digital and a paper ballot  delegation mechanics as well as privacy mechanics that are interesting on a case-by-case basis. 

**Goguen, voting, future fund3, competitive marketing analysis of Ouroboros vs. EOS, Tezos, Algorand, ETH2 and Polkadot, new creative director**

We'll keep chipping away at that, a lot of Goguen stuff to talk about but I'm going to reserve all of that for two days from now for the product update. We're right in the middle, Goguen metadata was the very first part of it. We already have some commercialization platform as a result of metadata, more to come and then obviously lots of smart contract stuff to come. This update and the November update are going to be very Goguen focused and also a lot of alternatives as well. We're still on schedule for an HFC event in I think November or December. I can't remember but that's going to be carrying a lot of things related multisig token locking. There's some ledger rule changes so it has to be an HFC event and that opens up a lot of the windows for Goguen foundations as well as voting on chain so fund3 will benefit very heavily from that. We're right in the guts of Daedalus right now building the voting center, the identity center, QR-code work. All this stuff, it's a lot of stuff, you know, the cell phone app was released last week. Kind of an early beta, it'll go through a lot of rapid iterations every few weeks. We'll update it, google play is a great foundation to launch things on because it's so easy to push updates to people automatically so you can rapidly iterate and be very agile in that framework and you know we've already had 3500 people involved heavily in the innovation management platform ideascale and we've got numerous bids from everything. From John Buck and the sociocracy movement to others. A lot of people want to help us improve that and we're going to see steady and systematic growth there. We're still chipping away at product marketing. Liza (Horowitz) is doing a good job, meet with her two three-times a week and right now it's Ouroboros, Ouroboros, Ouroboros... We're doing competitive analysis of Ouroboros versus EOS, Tezos, Algorand, ETH2 and Polkadot. We think that's a good set. We think we have a really good way of explaining it. David (David Likes Crypto now at IOHK) has already made some great content. We're going to release that soon alongside some other content and we'll keep chipping away at that. 

We also just hired a creative director for IO Global. His name's Adam, incredibly experienced creative director, he's worked for Mercedes-Benz and dozens of other companies. He does very good work and he's been doing this for well over 20 years and so the very first set of things he's going to do is work with commercial and marketing on product marketing. In addition to building great content where hope is make that content as pretty as possible and we have Rod heavily involved in that as well to talk about distribution channels and see if we can amplify the distribution message and really get a lot of stuff done. Last thing to mention, oh yeah, iOS for catalyst. We're working on that, we submitted it to the apple store, the iOS store, but it takes a little longer to get approval for that than it does with google play but that's been submitted and it's whenever apple approves it or not. Takes a little longer for cryptocurrency stuff. 

**Wiki shizzle and battle for crypto, make crypto articles on wiki great again, Alexa knows Charles, Everpedia meets Charles podcast, holy-grail land of Cardano, wiki on Cardano, titcoin**

Wikipedia... kind of rattled the cage a little bit. Through an intermediary we got contact with Jimmy Wales. Larry Sanger, the other co-founder also reached out to me and the everpedia guys reached out to me. Here's where we stand, we have an article, it has solidified, it's currently labeled as unreliable and you should not believe the things that are said in it which is David Gerard's work if you look at the edits. We will work with the community and try to get that article to a fair and balanced representation of Cardano and especially after the product marketing comes through. We clearly explain the product I think the Cardano article can be massively strengthened. I've told Rod to work with some specialized people to try to get that done but we are going to work very hard at a systematic approval campaign for all of the scientific articles related to blockchain technology in the cryptocurrency space. They're just terrible, if you go to the proof of work article, the proof of stake or all these things, they're just terrible. They're not well written, they're out of date and they don't reflect an adequate sampling of the science. I did talk to my chief scientist Aggelos and what we're gonna do is reach out to the scientific counterparts that most of the major cryptocurrency groups that are doing research and see if they want to work with us at an industry-wide effort to systematically improve the scientific articles in our industry so that there are a fair and balanced representation of what the current state of the art are, the criticisms, the trade-offs as well as the reference space and of course obviously we'll do quite well in that respect because we've done the science. We're the inheritor of it but it's a shame because when people search proof of stake on google usually wikipedia results are highly biased. We care about wikipedia because google cares about wikipedia, amazon cares about wikipedia. 

If you ask Alexa who is Charles Hoskinson, the reason why Alexa knows is because it's reading directly from the wikipedia page. If I didn't have a wikipedia page Alexa would know that so if somebody says Alexa what is Cardano it's going to read directly from the wikipedia page and you know and we can either just pretend that reality doesn't exist or we can accept it and we as a community working with partners in the broader cryptocurrency community can universally improve the quality of cryptocurrency pages. There's been a pattern of commercial censorship on wikipedia for cryptocurrencies in general since bitcoin itself. In fact I think the bitcoin article is actually taken down once back in, might have been, 2010 or 2009 but basically wikipedia has not been a friend of cryptocurrencies. That's why everpedia exists and actually their founders reached out to me and I talked to them over twitter through PMs and we agreed to actually do a podcast. I'm going to do a streamyard, stream with these guys and they'll come on talk all about everpedia and what they do and how they are and we'll kind of go through the challenges that they've encountered. How their platform works and so forth and obviously if they want to ever leave that terrible ecosystem EOS and come to the holy-grail land of Cardano we'd be there to help them out. At least they can tell the world how amazing their product is and also the challenges they're having to overcome. We've also been in great contact with Larry Sanger. 

He's going to do an internal seminar at some point with with us and talk about some protocols he's been developing since he left wikipedia specifically to decentralize knowledge management and have a truly decentralized encyclopedia. I'm really looking forward to that and I hope that presentation gives us some inspiration as an ecosystem of things we can do. That's a great piece of infrastructure regardless and after we learn a lot more about it and we talk to a lot of people in ecosystem. If we can't get people to move on over, it would be really good to see through ideascale in the innovation management platform for people to utilize the dc fund to build their own variant of wikipedia on Cardano. In the coming months there will certainly be funding available. If you guys are so passionate about this particular problem that you want to go solve it then I'd be happy to play Elon Musk with the hyperloop and write a white paper on a protocol design and really give a good first start and then you guys can go and try to commercialize that technology as Cardano native assets and Plutus smart contracts in addition to other pieces of technology that have to be brought in to make it practical. 

Right now we're just, let's talk to everybody phase, and we'll talk to the everpedia guys, we're going to talk to Larry and we're going to see whoever else is in this game and of course we have to accept the incumbency as it is. So, we're working with obviously the wikipedia side to improve the quality of not only our article but all of the articles and the scientific side of things so that there's a fair and accurate representation of information. One of the reasons why I'm so concerned about this is that I am very worried that Cardano projects will get commercially censored like we were commercially censored. So, yes we do have a page but it took five years to get there and we're a multi-billion dollar project with hundreds of thousands of people. If you guys are doing cutting-edge novel interesting stuff I don't want your experience to be the same as ours where you have to wait five years for your project to get a page even after government's adopted. That's absurd, no one should be censored ever. This is very well a fight for the entire ecosystem, the entire community, not just Cardano but all cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum and Cardano have all faced commercial censorship and article deletions during their tenure so I don't want you guys to go through that. I'm hoping we can prove that situation but you know you don't put all your eggs in one basket and frankly the time has come for wikipedia to be fully decentralized and liberated from a centralized organization and massively variable quality in the editor base. If legends of valor has a page but Cardano didn't have one until recently titcoin, a pornography coin from 2015, that's deprecated, no one uses it, has a page but Cardano couldn't get one there's something seriously wrong with the quality control mechanism and we need to improve that so it'll get done.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I Consolidate My Debt?,"Good morning everyone! I am receiving many notifications recently about lower interest rates and that now is a good time to consolidate debt. I am 26 and have been working on lowering the credit card debt, etc that i gained over the past 8 years as a college student mostly on my own. Not one to ask for help, I found myself like many young adults with credit cards and in over my head in rising debt. I currently have around $18,000 in debt. I work full time, and i am currently working on a PhD full-time as well. I have grown to manage my money better than before, but i still see that it will take a long while to break even with the high apr credit cards I received as an 18 year old. I found an offer to consolidate my debt to 18.5% apr over a five year term paying a rate that is about $230 cheaper a month than paying each individually, and by just paying the bare-minimum, which I don’t plan to do, I would still pay it off sooner than what i would do with individual payments. My question is whether I should take this personal loan to consolidate my debt or not. I am weary about financial decisions like this after my past mistakes so any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",finance

solar,Solar Financing,"I've been working with a local solar installer who has offered financing through EZ Solar Loans. I applied for a 15 year loan to finance the total cost of the system (about $20k), and they are offering a 5.99% interest rate, with no origination fee. They did offer other options with lower rates, but they involve a pretty hefty increase to the total cost, and I'd like the flexibility to pay off early without eating that cost.

Does this sound reasonable, and if not, does anyone have alternative suggestions for financing?

stocks,U.S. stock market 'fear gauge' VIX jumps to highest level since June,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Cboe Volatility Index , known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" surged on Wednesday to its highest level in more than four months.

In morning trade, the VIX was last at 40.35, its most elevated since June 15, as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 .SPX stock index fell nearly 3% amid worries about the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe. [.N]

Along with the pandemic, concerns about stalled efforts in Washington toward further fiscal stimulus measures and the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election have helped to boost the VIX. The index has surged more than 12 points this week and is on track for its biggest weekly points gain since mid-March, during the sell-off that confirmed the end of the previous bull market.

VIX futures, which have long reflected expectations for higher volatility around the election, also rose. Earlier in the session, December futures VXZ0 touched their highest level since they began trading in March.

Even so, the VIX itself is now trading at a significantly higher level than the futures, an indication that near-term concerns have dwarfed worries further out on the calendar.

The coronavirus has become the top concern for market participants, Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group, wrote on Wednesday.

""Lockdown potential is concerning investors and overwhelming even election issues,"" he said.

I am a 23 year old, just finished school and started full time as a nurse. Unfortunately I have about $175,000 in student debt. I'm pretty  much starting from the beginning in terms of financial literacy, and I am doing a lot of self-teaching on the fly. 

I have both private and federal student loans, and luckily I work for a hospital that participates in a federal loan forgiveness program so I feel like there is some (very, very, dim) light at the end of the tunnel. However, I am so completely overwhelmed by the thought of the sheer amount of money I will be paying back for what feels like the rest of my life. 

So far, with my limited knowledge, I have started an application with Earnest to consolidate my private loans because my interest rates ranged from 5-12%. The new rate I was offered was 5.17%. With that rate, over 20 years, my private loan payments alone are $740/month. Federal loan payments are looking to be about the same. I bring home an average $4500 a month. 

I am honestly not even sure what advice exactly I am looking for. Does anyone have any tips to tackling this debt? Or how to make decisions financially so that I can not only pay these loans but also save money so I am not living paycheck to paycheck until my loans are paid off? 

Welcoming any and all advice. Feeling very alone and overwhelmed. Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Avalanche or continue to save?,"My wife and I are about half way through paying our student debt (yay!) and have also been saving for a house. The desire for a house if because we are tired of renting and want to start diversifying into a home as well. We recently just finished paying off a large previous expense (we straight up ignored our wedding budget and ended up with a 6-figure wedding -_-), and want to take better stock of our finances to not fall victim to needless spending.

Ultimately, we want some advice on whether we should just avalanche out our student loans before going in on the house, or try to rapidly save and then buy. We are in the Boston area and were looking to spend roughly $800-900k on a house, so we are trying to come up with about $200k as the down payment and any fees. The one thing we are taking advantage of is paying our federal loans at 0% due to covid, normally it is spread out but we are attacking the high interest rates first.

Here is our financial breakdown for a month:

Wife income: $6372 (after tax)  

Rent: $2550  
Loans:  
- $1009 ($55k remaining - 3.895% - Private - ends 09/2025)

Into Savings: ~$6k

I also receive about $100k a year of stock after tax as RSUs from my company. We currently have $16k in savings and will have about $160k in stocks after a RSU vest next month.

So my question is, should we pump the $6k into savings or to the loans. The loans do not have large interest rates (save the 6% ones that are currently 0%). We could also sell a portion of the stock into loans, but since everything is a fixed interest rate, we wanted to save that for a house or an emergency. How do you think we should proceed? We would like to buy in late 2021 or early 2022.",finance
personalfinance,Bank scam that almost wiped out my accounts,"Today I effed up by almost falling for a scam.  It started relatively normal, a number representing my bank's fraud department called and inquired about a potential fraud charge across the country from me, this is not abnormal for my bank as they have contacted me prior in instances of fraud and locked the account. 

The person in question sent a text message alert similar to what my bank does:  ""Bank of xxxx has detected abnormal activity on your account.  If you did not initiate x transaction reply with NO to freeze your account.""  Immediately after replying, the 800 number associated with my bank called and a ""rep"" talked me through ""security steps"" that began innocent:  ""confirm the on-file email, confirm the on-file username"", but it got a lot more red-flag apparent when they started asking me to provide confirmation numbers that were sent to my phone via text message.  The first one seemed okay, but then they informed me they would be ""setting up zelle protection"" and needed a new confirmation number.  When I got the text, there were big bold letters stating ""WE WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR THIS CONFIRMATION NUMBER. IF ANYONE ASKS FOR IT AND YOU DID NOT CONTACT US, HANG UP AND CALL THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATELY.""

Needless to say alarm bells started ringing, I told the ""rep"" I was not comfortable with this phone call and to be safe, I was going to contact the bank myself.  He kept trying to assure me he was a bank rep and that he was ""calling from the number on my card, just check it"".  After a moment of back and forth, my intuition won and I hung up on him and immediately called my bank. 

Several things had happened: 1. There were no original fraud charges the ""rep"" claimed had existed, 2. He had gained access to my online account and was trying to empty my account via Zelle and needed approval (thank goodness), and 3. His activity would have flown under the radar had I not called and inquired.  

My account is considered compromised and the bank has frozen ALL funds and cards associated with the account.  I have to wait for the morning to go into a branch to sign an affidavit and open a new account to roll my current finances into it.  

Lesson learned the hard way, NEVER trust a call that you did not place, even if everything looks and sounds right.  If your gut says ""something isn't right"" it probably isn't.  No banking rep is going to get mad if they start helping you and you suddenly don't trust them, their job is to protect you as an asset and they will understand if you hang up and initiate a call on your own. 

TL;DR:  someone pretended to be a banking rep for my banks fraud department. Called from a bank number and did everything as a ""normal"" rep would until they started asking for confirmation numbers my bank, luckily, sends with a warning message never to give out.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance vs. loan modification battle - am I missing anything?,"I'm planning to refinance, and spoke with our current lender as well a few other lenders and brokers.

The current lender is offering a loan modification from our current rate of 4.0% to 3.25% - zero closing costs, effectively no paperwork, nada - we're about a 18 months into our 30-year mortgage and this wouldn't reset the clock; the only thing that would change is our interest rate. There is no negative impact on our credit (our status will still be reported as current and paid in full).

I'm comparing this to an offer from one local broker I trust, also a 30-year fixed at 2.875%...but closing costs (which would be rolled into our new mortgage) are about $4,400. 

We'd save about $75 a month with the lower rate in the new mortgage compared to the loan modification rate, but the way I'm thinking about it, that means it would take us roughly 5 years to break even on the closing costs from the refinance.

That's right at the edge for me, since I dont know whether we'll be in the house for 4 more years or 7 more years - either is about equally likely. But what I want to know is whether this is the right way to think about these two options? Is there anything I'm missing in the comparison - any other factors that might tip the scales in one direction vs. the other?

I am a little stuck in deciding what to do. I currently have a 2005 Honda Pilot with 200,000 miles on it. It started giving me troubles so I’m looking into buying an updated car. 

I’m currently living at home and work from home since graduating in May. 

I will eventually be driving to work, about 30 miles round trip. Right now I’ve been doing a side hustle driving after my day job averaging about 250 miles a week. 

I’m looking at used cars under 50k miles. My one contingency is that it needs to be an suv. I feel guilty about having to spend 15-20k on a car even though it is a sort of a necessity. 

If I get a newer car 2015+ it should last me at least 10 years. Looking strictly at Nissan, Toyota, and Honda. Specifically the Murano and Pathfinder. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on buying cars in general? How to properly finance the car? Should I put down a large chunk instead of using that money for my student loans? I have good credit (780) so I’m assuming the interest rate on the car will be lower than student loans. Hoping the no interest period gets pushed back. 

Ive been trying to save every penny I make while also working two jobs. This is my first big purchase so I’m having trouble trying to justify it. 

Any comments appreciated. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Could my student loan be affecting my mother's credit to the extent she claims?,"My mom co-signed a private student loan for me in 2008. The original amount was $20k, and it's now down to around $13k. I have always made on-time payments, except when it's been in forbearance (a total of about 4 years). My mother keeps hounding me to pay it off, because she says it's bringing her credit score down significantly. She estimated her credit was in the low 700s, but couldn't tell me an exact number. She complains that she's not able to apply for the credit she wants/needs because of this one loan.

She also has a mortgage, a home equity loan, two car loans, at least one (if not two) motorcycle loans, and several credit cards (some of which always seem to have a balance). She makes on-time payments on all of these. My dad is retired, and my mom still works full-time, though her hours have taken a hit because of COVID. Still, they are upper middle class and have nearly $1 million saved for retirement between the two of them.

My credit score, according to Capital One Credit Wise, is around 806 (so probably a bit lower in reality).

I'd LOVE for this loan to be paid off, but I the interest rate is very low (3.1%). Because I graduated in 2009, I was under-employed for a long time, and had a low income even when employed full time. The highest salary I earned was $24k/year until last year, when I finally got a decent job at a local university earning $40k/year. (My parents, on the other hand, earned close to $200k/year between the two of them.) I am married and my spouse was in a similar boat until 3 years ago. He now makes $50k/year. We are finally financially stable!

We've been married for 10 years, and have gone through multiple layoffs and periods of part-time employment. Our average combined income maxed out around $50k/year until very recently. This means that we unfortunately had to rely on some loans and credit cards to get us through the really hard times. Which means that my $13k student loan with a very low interest rate is literally on the bottom of the list of debts I want to pay off. 

Because we're both still employed and have reduced costs because we're working from home (plus the federal student loan payment freeze), we've been aggressively paying off high interest debt. We had about $8k in credit card debt that we finished paying off this month. Next we are going after our car loan, which has about $3k left on it. After that, we have a personal loan with a 5% apr we want to knock out. THEN we can start working more aggressively on student loans, but that won't be for another year, probably.

I find it hard to believe that this ONE loan is really impacting my mom's credit score so much it's having a real negative affect on her, but she insists and keeps hounding me about it. Should I just suck it up and pay it off, even though it would mean losing money on higher interest debt?",finance

personalfinance,Help with wildly varying house affordability guildelines,"I'm confused by how much house affordability guidelines vary.

For reference, my annual income is $100k and we are a single income household living in Seattle, WA. We have 110k saved up for a down payment, and no other debt.

I've seen these three methods:

1. Mortgage [no greater than 2.5X your salary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/05/030905.asp). This would mean my max home price would be **$360k** (2.5 X 100k + 110k down payment).
2. Monthly payment no greater than 28% your take-home (though sometimes its gross instead). This is a max home price of approximately **$430k,** with a monthly payment of $1960 depending on interest rate.
3. Monthly payment [no greater than 36% your gross pay](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS863US863&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00kvEXzY3J-_S_RXfkmXv-vYhgOUg%3A1603990723146&amp;ei=w_SaX5HBCMKPtAbusIjoDA&amp;q=Mortgage+calculator+google&amp;oq=Mortgage+caclulator+google&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1AAWABgqSloAHAAeACAAQCIAQCSAQCYAQCqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRrpqKo9rsAhXCB80KHW4YAs0Q4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5) (based on debt to income ratio). This is a max home price of approximately **$610k,** with a monthly payment of $3000 depending on interest rate.

The difference between $360k and $610k is mind blowing. I realize there's different factors for everyone, but I'm very confused as to why affordability calculators would vary this wildly.

In greater Seattle, $500k is pretty much the cheapest house you can find, so we're thinking somewhere between $500-550k, but I would be going wildly over the first two methods if we did purchase. The first method seems unbelievably unrealistic, as I would have to save up $300k to buy a $550k home.",finance

personalfinance,Is it time to find a new job? Is it too soon?,"Howdy y'all,

I recently started a new job, but so far, I've been very turned off from it. The job itself isn't bad, but nearly everything else about it is bugging me. 

To start, I work as a contractor that visits office stores in order to build and maintain furniture for them. The job itself isn't bad and is pretty neat. I'm not bothered by a manager breathing down my neck while I work and I can kind of decide when I want to work, which is awesome as I'm going to school full time. 

However, I feel the bad outweighs the good at the moment. To start, I often drive at least an hour a day, sometimes two, just to get to and from the job. This didn't seem like too bad a thing at first as they pay for milage and hours driven, but they only really pay for in-between job sites on the same day. So for example, from home to the first job of the day, as well as from the last job back home, they only pay for milage after the first 30 miles and hourly after the first hour of driving. Most jobs are less than an hours drive and usually around 30-40 miles one way, so most days, I'll only get a few dollars for the drive. Additionally, they have been paying less per hour of driving than I was offered. I even have an email stating what it should be, but paystubs show they're paying $2.50 less. 

Additionally, I feel they have deducted too much money from my paycheck. To give an example, one of my paychecks showed around $235 gross income. I calculated that around $30 should've been deducted from the paycheck for taxes to include federal and state, but it seems that around $75 was deducted. 

Finally, I feel that the hours are nowhere near enough to what I need or was really promised. It's been around 13 hours a week, which is no where near the 30-40 I was told by the hiring manager. Additionally, everything about this company is slow. From the time I was offered a job to the time I actually first started working was around a month. Then it was nearly another three weeks before I got my first paycheck. 

I may just be used to having retail and food service jobs that just need bodies as fast as possible, but that seems like an unnecessarily long amount of time after the initial job offer. 

This is really stupid because I was expecting to be getting around $800-$900 a paycheck, but so far, all my paystubs have been around $400 or less and I am trying to save up some money for a bigger purchase. I guess I'm just frustrated and want someone else's opinion on the topic. Should I try to wait it out and see it it gets better and I get more hours, or should I just move on?",finance
cybersecurity,Looking for MITM solutions with cool UI,"Hello!

I am **looking for a solution to perform a MITM attack demo to a very general audience** (non-technical). The goal is to teach attendees what are the risks of connecting to non-trusted Wi-Fi networks and even worse: ""Trusting"" unknown certificates.

Scenario: The audience connects to the demo Wi-Fi AP, ignoring/accepting an ""unknown certificate"" security alert, then recognize their smartphone network activity on the hacker screen. In a second part a few websites could be spoofed, and people would witness credential harvesting. (Thinking about websites people actually do not use to avoid revealing actual passwords)

I would like the demo:

* to work 100% of the time (Repeatability for a given setup with LTE modem)
* to be graphically friendly (to show to the audience the ""hacker"" live screen).
* to not be too complex to build (Keep dirty scripting to a minimum, prefer existing solution)
* to run on a RasPi 4

I imagined few different ways so far:

* Use *Bettercap* with hacker PC connected to the demo network.
   * Fast tests showed that the repeatability part was not very convincing - ARP spoofing was unstable for some clients, SSL stripping / deep inspection was not straightforward nor really successful.
* Use *mitmproxy* running directly on the router [looks easier](https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2019-01-09-running-a-man-in-the-middle-proxy-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/). However:
   * How to force clients to install the demo certificate in the most effortless/invisible way? (Avoiding installing a profile that they would have to retrieve manually ...)
   * Does having a client trusting a certificate with a wildcard CN during a captive portal connection allows the gateway to perform HTTPS inspection (not sure about the certificate store used by the OSes)?

Would you have recommendation regarding the points above or some other existing projects/tools that would be a better fit to perform this (MITM w/ SSL) demo?

personalfinance,Worried about not saving enough for retirement,"So I’m only 23 and currently in graduate school for the fine arts. I’m fortunate to have many (but not all) of my expenses paid for or free through generous family. Last year I worked full time at a small restaurant and with family gifts (cash from my birthday and Christmas), I saved just over 12k. By the time I finish my MFA (Spring 2022), I’ll have about 23k in federal student loans (as of now 0% interest). I only have 1k in my Roth IRA at the moment.

investing,Ticker Discussion - MIC - Macquarie Infrastructure Corp,"Hi,

MIC currently presides in the special situations bucket as the company is undergoing a strategic sales process.

I have a question only for those who have a in depth understanding of the company... but in the interest of providing a brief walkthrough for anyone who would also like to learn about the idea, I shall elaborate a bit on the situation...

**Walk-through**

MIC is holding company owning 3 distinct/unrelated operating businesses... These are 1) liquid tank terminal business (IMTT) which charges contractual rates to storage various industrial/petro/commodity liquids in the tanks terminals; 2) Fixed-Based Operations for airports (Atlantic Aviation), which provides fuel filling and ancillary airplane handling services at airports; 3) Hawaii regulated gas utility and LNG (MIC Hawaii), which is a gas utility company in Hawaii.The three businesses are all up for sale after MIC ran into some trouble in 2018 in the IMTT business and cut dividends. Though IMTT has recovered, the company ran into problems again on all operating fronts as covid engulfed the world. MIC responded with cost-cutting measures which saw a complete elimination of already reduced dividends. These events has since decimated the stock as an MLP and a dividend yielding name. In Oct 2019, the company announced a sale process for all or any individual pieces of MIC....

The attraction for the stock lies in that all 3 operating businesses are fundamentally sound from a long-term perspective and all are on the trajectory of recovery even in the current environment. Second, a consensus has emerged in recent months that a SoTP valuation indicate that the company is undervalued, though a catalyst will likely lie in an actual sale - which has yet to materialize.

If the above run-through is intriguing to you, I'd invite you to delve in depth and arrive at your own conclusions. I hope you found it useful.

**My question for those are familiar with MIC - Tax Leakage**

Can anyone elucidate on the topic of tax leakage upon disposition of any of the three businesses? I've heard that the leakage could especially be an issue for the aviation business (is this because the carrying/book value of AA is small compared to where it could be sold ? I have 1.3 billion in equity value for an AA takeout / $14.95/sh). how do you calculate or account for tax leakage in your after tax calculation of value?

Here's why they are part of my investing plan.

Pro:

* Safe (backed by US government)
* Guaranteed to match or beat inflation
* Will not lose principal due to deflation
* Tax deferred (and tax-free if used for kid's college tuition)
* Flexible maturity

Con:

* Can only purchase $10k per year
* With other bonds, suffer from low interest rates (1.06%) right now, but better than 10-year treasury
* Illiquid for 1st year and withdrawals &lt;5 years lose a few months of interest

# I Bonds for Emergency Fund

I think that I Bonds are perfect for an emergency fund or saving for intermediate-term savings goals (e.g. saving up to buy a house in 5 years). Personally, I like having an entire *year's* worth of basic expenses (food, shelter, insurance, transportation) in my emergency fund. The obvious downside of a large emergency fund is that you'll hopefully not need it, so it languishes in low-return vehicles. I Bonds are a good way to do that without worrying that my savings will lose buying power over the years.

# The Benefit of Safe Investments

I believe that low-cost equity funds are the most likely investment to perform well over the long term and are a good hedge against inflation. That said, the volatility of the stock market is a significant risk. Young people should accept that risk in order to achieve the returns they need in order to reach their financial goals. But for short-term savings goals or once you've built a large nest egg and are approaching retirement, there is a huge benefit to truly safe (i.e. nonvolatile and government-backed) investments.

***It is a fallacy that stocks are less risky (EDIT: volatile) in the long run***: it is true that a dollar invested in the stock market will be almost certainly be worth more than a dollar invested in bonds after 30 years, but at any point in time, the current value of your stock portfolio can halve. So if a dollar you invested three decades ago is now worth $8, that's great, but it doesn't mean you're actually worth $8 unless you sell ... you might be worth only $4 in a few dismal months. Sure, you might still be better off than your friend whose dollar is only worth $3 after 30 years in bonds, but how much consolation is that?

My point is that, when you need to lock in the value of your money—when you can't wait a few decades to get back to your current net worth—stocks are a bad idea.

# Deep Risk of Inflation

**EDIT:** I didn't delve into the idea in the original post, but another motivation for diversifying into I Bonds is my concern that—some time in the next half century—we might experience a period of unexpected and high inflation. Equities are good against inflation, but aren't perfect; nominal bonds lose terribly. TIPS and I Bonds are insurance against inflation, and like most insurance, you come out behind if the event they insure against doesn't happen. I was influenced by William Bernstein's *Deep Risk*, which I recommend: [https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Risk-History-Portfolio-Investing/dp/0988780313](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Risk-History-Portfolio-Investing/dp/0988780313)

# I Bonds for Retirement

Over the years, I'm hoping to build up a large I Bond fund (\~10% of my net worth). I anticipate eventually relying on I bonds in years when I want to reduce withdrawals from the rest of my portfolio (e.g. in years when equities drop substantially).

In retirement, I anticipating using a percentage-based withdrawal scheme instead of an amount-based approach (""4% rule""). Maybe I'll use a simple percentage, a CAPE-based withdrawal approach ([https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/08/30/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-18-flexibility-cape-based-rules/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/08/30/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-18-flexibility-cape-based-rules/)), or the Boglehead VPW ([https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Variable\_percentage\_withdrawal](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Variable_percentage_withdrawal)). The main drawback of percentage-based approaches is that the withdrawal amount can drop precipitously in years when the market is down, and it is very hard to cut spending in half. So I plan on having a floor of guaranteed income from Social Security and I Bonds (and if necessary a TIPS ladder and/or a SPIA) to help mitigate the pain of the down years.

On top of the floor, I'll withdraw a percentage of my equity portfolio to cover discretionary spending. In bull markets, I'll probably have surplus, which I can use to replenish my I Bonds and/or TIPS ladder as necessary, or just reinvest in equities.

I don't think this is the most efficient route to FIRE. But for those who are more risk-averse and want a guaranteed spending floor, I think that I Bonds + Social Security (or TIPS or SPIA) can provide that floor. And spending a percentage of the equities means that you can experience the upside to a large bull run (which statistically is more likely than a long bear market). If you lock yourself into a constant amount (adjusted upward only by inflation), you definitely risk dying with a huge net worth.

Anyway, that's my current thinking, at least. Please comment if you think I'm way off or you have any other pointers about I Bonds.",finance

personalfinance,Use downpayment money for student loans?,"My fiance and I have set aside 30 grand for a downpayment on a home that we are purchasing from my parents. We have already paid around $60,000 for remodels to the home over the last 6 months. Remodeled houses in the neighborhood have gone up in price and are selling between $500-525,000.  

Originally, the plan was to buy the house for $430,000 with my parents gifting us $70,000 in equity and we would put down an additional $30,000 to get to over 20% down. We are looking at a 30 year mortgage at 2.5% interest. 

My fiance has $50,000 in student loan debt with a 5.2% interest rate. He pays $790 a month and has about 7 years left on the loan. My parents have offered to raise the purchase price and increasing their gift equity so that we can use our downpayment money to pay off the student loans. In this situation we would raise the purchase price to $475,000, my parents would gift us $115,000 and we would borrow against the house and borrow $380,000 instead of $330,000.  We would plan to still pay additional towards the principal each month for the next 7 years as if we were making the student loan payments. 

Is this a decent plan or should we stick to the original? In 7 years, we would save around 5 grand in interest and more importantly have flexibility in our monthly expenses. We would be looking at $1820/month (+$650 principal payment) on the mortgage vs $1620+$790 for the student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Need help with a mortgage decision,"Throwaway account, in case. I have a conundrum. Just bought a house and the bank I currently have a mortgage with has given me two options to finance it. I need to borrow $304,000.00. 

Option A is to port my current mortgage, which I unfortunately just renewed, which is worth approx 200k. It’s good until Aug 2025. The interest rate is 1.85%. There’s about 17 years left on it. It’s on a 5 year fixed term, just renewed in August of this year. 

The remaining $104,000 would have an interest rate on a 4 year term at 1.69% amortized over 25 years. 

Option B is to payout my current mortgage with a payout penalty of about $1000 (I’m not happy the bank won’t waive this) and get the whole 304,000 at 1.69% on a 4 year fixed term, amortized over 25. 

The monthly payments on option A are about 1250 per month and on Option B the monthly would be about 1450. 

I’ve run the numbers and it looks like either way is a wash with interest. Of course option B would inflict the payout penalty.

It’s not as though I can’t pay the extra $200 a month, but as best as I can tell it just goes towards my principle, so theoretically I could save that and put it towards my principle at the end of 4 years. 

So, I’m wondering if someone would be so kind as to tell me if I’m missing something, and also give your opinion on which option is best. 

Thanks!",finance

Let's say I am buying a house with 20% down payment and take loan for the remainder with the current APR (say 3%) for 30 years. In case I decide to sell the house before the loan is paid, does it come with any caveats or do I just sell it to someone for the market price and keep/lose the profit/loss? 30 years interest rates are low so I am not sure why anybody would go for ARM at this point even if they want to sell the house in few years. I can pay off the remainder of the loan with the sale  and be off the hook, right? This seems obvious but the question is stemming from a lot of foreclosures that I'm seeing in a very popular neighborhood.

stocks,Today might be a good day to pick up BABA &amp; Chinese EV stocks before the ANT IPO,"Today might be a good day to pick up BABA &amp; Chinese EV stocks before the ANT IPO, because of an alignment in the mainland markets and futures here. 

There was [a pullback last night after multiple days of very strong gains in Chinese stock markets this week](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/world-indexes/asia-pacific) and, here locally, [US stock futures are down after yesterday's bounce.](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/futures)

Predicting moves for Asian ADRs listed on US exchanges is complicated by there being different factors in multiple economies, but when overnight markets in Asia are aligned with US futures, that often indicates a clear direction for the day. This might be a good day for people who think they missed the boat on some EV stocks or BABA. On the other hand, those stocks haven't done that badly in recent pullbacks in the US markets this week. 

______

Also, this is my first heads-up that while US retail investors are being fed one line of warnings and dire accusations of worthlessness about Chinese assets in the popular media and from politicians, US institutional and professional investors, including [our leading investment banks,](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/goldman-sachs-among-banks-working-on-41b-ant-ipo) have been quietly ramping up their holdings of Chinese stocks and a record amount of [Chinese corporate bonds](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/inflows-into-chinese-bond-market-hit-records-in-july-spurred-by-fears-of-missing-out-2020-08-12) and [Chinese government bonds](https://www.ft.com/content/c1e8897c-32a5-402d-837a-ba7df135c069), and opening new business leading activity in China this year. This includes Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan.

Personally, I've seen enormous amounts of steady volume that suggests and strong, steady but quiet institutional buying, in Chinese stocks during this period of volatility. For example, trading in Chinese EV stocks can be routinely in the tens and hundreds of millions of shares a day now, which far outstrips the trading even in US mega cap stocks on volatile days. 

The information gap between the information that the average retail investor in the US gets from popular media about how bad Chinese investments are, while US professional investors and investment banks are piling into China, according to information that we get from reading international news about that subject, is pretty significant. It seems to me that a lot of US retail investors are being misled into holding the bag for a couple of dozen inflated mega cap stocks in a US stock market bubble while professional, institutional and investment bank majors have been quietly building magnificent stakes in Asian investments in Q2 and Q3, to the point where they're piling in with billions even as retail investors are being constantly warned about how bad the investments are. But this is my personal opinion.

On Information Asymmetry: I feel that there is a very significant information disconnect and that it provides US retail investors with political agenda-driven, misleading information about investment risks of Chinese assets and that the negative information about those risks is at odds with international news reporting about what our investment banks and institutional investors are actually doing in China, and that information disconnect is the real risk of investing over there, because of the [information asymmetry disadvantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) that creates. Information asymmetry and its role in market failures and valuation errors, is a fundamental and well understood economic dynamic.

I have been scratching my head on how to attack my student loan debt. I have 138k in federal loans that I would like to pay off as aggressively as possible in the next few years. However, I would also like to efficiently save/invest as much as possible.

Recently started a job after graduating in August. Net income is 6.2k per month (after taxes). I have roughly calculated/considered that I can maintain my QOL with 33% of my income. Leaving me 66% of my monthly income to pay loans or invest.

I do have a Roth IRA that I recently started (have not even come close to maxing out in 2020)

I do not anticipate any large purchases in the next year or 2. (possibly a sprinter van!), but I do plan to keep about 10k in emergency funds (grad gift from parents)

Any advice? Should I max out my Roth IRA every year and dump everything else into loans? or dump everything into loans? I do plan on refinancing after the interest restarts on the federal loans.

Personal Income

Current-dollar personal income decreased $540.6 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of $1.45 trillion in the second quarter. The decrease in personal income was more than accounted for by a decrease in personal current transfer receipts (notably, government social benefits related to pandemic relief programs) that was partly offset by increases in compensation and proprietors' income (table 8). Additional information on several factors impacting personal income can be found in ""Effects of Selected Federal Pandemic Response Programs on Personal Income.""

personalfinance,"HSABank 2020 - Must keep 1k balance, cannot transfer all to investment brokerage. My money is held hostage! What are my options?","Edit:  Thanks to all the swift answers!  Seems like my option #1 is the best route, assuming I can find a HSA provider that does not have this rule _(which is apparently fairly common)_, and the math for cashing out of current investments plus any fees/charges to swap works out favorably.

----

This is my third year maxing out a HSA from HSABank.

In 2018 and 2019 I was able to move 100% of my HSA cash balance into my investment portfolio and invest it into a mutual fund of my choice.

Now however in 2020 it appears HSABank has changed its policy and now requires I keep a minimum of 1k in the cash account of HSABank itself.

When I called to ask how to get around it, I was told it is not possible. Basically ""Sorry pal, rules are rules, and no it isn't based on some new federal law.""

Why do they care if I have cash in there for medical expenses or not? I don't even have a HSA card to access the account and use it for medical costs!

To me it sounds like HSABank wants the 1k per customer so they can invest/play with it, and I'm not too happy about that. (Just a guess...) It should be my choice how/where/when I pay for stuff in my life. HSABank shouldn't be able to keep my money hostage.

So, what are my choices here?

1) Liquidate my invested HSA money, transfer full balance back to HSABank, and try to transfer to a new HSA account at a more favorable HSA provider? (Suggestions?)

2) Do a cash withdrawal of that 1k balance and take a huge hit on taxes/fees (20%), but at least they don't have my money hostage?! Granted, this just means the same issue next year so this is likely a terrible terrible idea unless that $800ish has great returns wherever I put it...

3) Just live with the 1k minimum and grumble about it, since other HSA providers are still worse?  Next year would allow the full contribution to transfer, but I'd still always have 1k in an HSA that isn't earning me anything.

Curious what people think about this situation, and welcome any advice.

A final note: I never plan to pay for medical expenses from the HSA for many many years (knock on wood). I'd rather dip into emergency funds.  For me it is just another pool of tax incentivized retirement savings. My goal is to transfer 100% of contributions every year into investments.",finance

Bitcoin,How the US Conned the world into using its Dollar Fiat currency as a reserve asset,"Fiat currencies are not meant to be used as a store of value such as a federal reserve, or treasury reserve asset, but the US pulled a fast one on the world. 

They told everyone the dollar was backed 1 to 1 by gold, which lead to the world using the dollar as a reserve store of value asset many many years ago. After we got them to use our dollar as a reserve asset, we detached from the 1 to 1 change for gold and began to take control of most of the oil-producing nations, forcing them into treaties with us to only trading their oil for US Dollars. This forced other countries to hold onto their dollars they had already been using as a store of value because it was once backed 1 to 1 by gold. So many countries still hold it till today as a reserve asset because it inflates slower than their currency, and because they also need it to buy oil. This is why we've been Globally going to shit for almost the last Century. The US has tricked the world into use their dollars as a reserve asset, something that should have been stopped as soon as it stopped being backed 1 to 1 by gold, and this has lead to most of the Countries of the world's financial instability, now using a fiat currency as a large part of their countries federal treasury reserves. Bitcoin will fix this, and reset the world to the ways of the old days. We're assets were actually used as reserves and not the US's fiat currencies that is no longer tied 1 to 1 by gold, or any other asset for that matter.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020. What a crazy day, hope this helps a bit :)","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday’s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by “about a third” and daily deaths by “close to 40%” this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it’ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

personalfinance,Hoping to get some info on why I am being taxed so much.,"So I just want to start of by saying I'm not even sure this is the right place to post or that anyone will actually be able to help me, but I'm just very confused and annoyed.


I started a new job, and I don't make very much money doing it. My paychecks have been around $300-$400 gross income every two weeks. I have only been seeing a very small fraction of that amount. Well I found out today that I am having nearly $250 deducted from my paychecks just for federal taxes alone and I just don't understand why that is. I thought that the amount of tax taken was based off of how much you actually earned. However, my first paycheck, which was less than $250 was entirely withheld for federal taxes. 

I'm curious if this has anything to do with the fact that I'm married. Either way, I'm quite upset as it's forced me to eat into my savings.",finance
personalfinance,I have a student loan debt that I'm not sure I owe. What do I do?,"So, A few years ago, I went to a college in Nebraska. I got my music scholarship and some federal loans to cover the rest. I filled out the correct forms and got confirmation letters saying the loans have been received and they will dispurse them. The end of the semester comes and I notice that I cant enroll in classes for semester 2. It turns out that there was a clerical error at the college and that they can't release the loans to me, but they definitely do have them. They recommended that I do a ""deferment "" and have the balance rolled over to next semesters balance. So, I go ahead and do that but by the time thats all figured out, I couldn't pass any of the classes I needed to because the process above took too long so I would have been missing out on some huge point tests or i would have technically missed too many days. I talked to the finance manager at the college and she admitted fault and said there just wasn't anything they could do at that point and the only way to actually get back into that college would be to pay like 8 grand. I decided on moving to California instead and she said that would be a good alternative since they wouldn't have any way to find that debt apparently.  Years go by and I notice by credit is literally at 450. Yeah, I am still paying off the student loans for the other college and I have 2 credit cards that are maxed (but only a few hundred dollars)  but I have that 8 grand in collections still and its really affecting my credit. Is it worth it to pay off or what should I do? The college admitted in a sit down meeting that it was their fault and I have the email confirmations. Do I pay this off or ignore it for a few years til it drops off?",finance
solar,Does residential solar make sense any more in California?,"Maybe this question is specific to PG&amp;E's service area. Wondering if going solar is economically insane for us.

* My understanding is that going with solar requires us moving from our current tiered rate to TOU metering with peak hours between 4-9 pm.
* It would also require using a Gen2 net metering plan, which has drastically reduced the payback from any electricity fed into the grid (compared with Gen1 net metering).
* With solar in place, we want to update our HVAC and other services from gas to heat pump to, you know, help the environment. But it's only feasible if we can generate sufficient energy to power those systems, which, while efficient, would probably double or triple our current electricity usage (which currently costs us about $200/mo on our tiered plan).
* We had hoped to leverage battery storage to enable minimizing/eliminating grid draw during peak TOU (obviously, we wouldn't be generating much solar electricity after 5 or 6 pm). Also, we're on a well w/pump, so we lose our water supply during grid outages -- which are very common where we live, due to intentional PSPS events due to wildfire danger -- so a battery would help us stay in our home during outages. But California doesn't have an SGIP incentive available anymore, so &gt;$50K for battery storage can never be paid back. And without battery storage to avoid bankrupting ourselves from peak TOU charges -- exacerbated by doubling/tripling current consumption -- solar payback would never happen.

What am I missing? It sounds like California's rules of the game have eliminated solar as a feasible electricity source for homeowners, despite official objectives to encourage renewable energy use. I just can't see a model where it's not economically suicidal for us to go that route. Maybe it will only make sense when grid-provided electricity costs 4-5 times what it does today? Anyone from California -- especially in PG&amp;E-land -- have thoughts about this? How would you justify solar under the circumstances?

financialindependence,Don't Overlook EE Bonds As A Tool For FIRE Planning,"EE Bonds (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm and https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/savingsbonds) are often overlooked but I like to keep them in mind as a great possible option in my FIRE Toolbox, especially when equivalent yields on a marketable 20-year treasury today is 1.5%. Here's why:

Pros:

* Safe (backed by US government)
* Will not lose principal due to deflation or **rising interest rates.**
* Tax deferred (and tax-free if used for kid's college tuition)
* State-tax free.
* If held for 20 years the Treasury will double the face value. If you cash it in right after it doubles it is a 3.53% annual interest rate.
* If you bought these treasuries in the 24% tax bracket and say cashed them in from age 65-70 delaying Social Security in a low income year, it could be tax free. If that is the case a taxable yield equivalent to 3.53% deferred is 4.64% on a marketable 20 year treasury.

Cons:

* Can only purchase $10k per year per person or trust. 
* You can use revocable living trusts to get around purchase limits for I-Bonds and EE-Bonds - ie another $10k for your individual trust, and $10k for a joint trust, as the actual law specifies the limit as *per entity*, not per SSN per what Treasury Direct states: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=213142
* Not allowed to be redeemed in the first year.
* Could lose purchasing power if inflation averages above 3.53% over 20 years.
* Likewise, you don't get any capital gains if interest rates go even lower.
* Yield-to-Maturity Opportunity cost to redeem bonds early. You don't want to redeem a 19 year 11 month old EE bond as it's Yield-To-Maturity is essentially 100%. There are very few safe investment options with a Yield-To-Maturity of 100%.

Citation on EE Bonds Doubling after 20 years: 
https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued052005andafer.htm

&gt; Treasury guarantees that an EE Bond will be worth at least its face value after the first 20 years. If an EE Bond does not double in value (reach its face value) as a result of applying the fixed rate of interest for those 20 years, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment at the 20-year anniversary of the bond's issue date to make up the difference.

# Possible Use Cases where EE Bonds Shine

* [Liability matching](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liabilitymatching.asp) of future debts such as the remaining 10 years of a 30 year mortgage.
* A self-funded bond ladder creating personal annuity for a guaranteed level of nominal income for early retirement years. For instance you could start a 5 year ladder at age 45 to provide a income floor from age 65-70 helping you delay social security, or go for a 30 year ladder per this article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/thebogleheadsview/2013/03/01/build-your-own-annuity/?sh=5f5ae77d7ba3
* Reducing sequence of returns risk by providing a very safe floor for income spending.

# Arguments against EE Bonds

* If I'm going to lock up my money for 20 years I'd rather throw it in the liquid stock market, or a venture capital firm, or private equity, or as part of a real estate deal. 
* It's a nominal non-marketable bond and the EE Bond's Yield to Maturity opportunity cost is so severe, if rates jumped back up to 3.53% in 5 years you'll wish you never bought the EE bond.
* EE bonds are just mental accounting. You should have a portfolio view, and view investing $10k extra as in your portfolio, which more assuredly will return more than 3.53%.

I personally really share a ton of beliefs with the first argument against EE bonds. Today, I will be arguing against my beliefs and show counter examples to all three arguments against EE bonds.

# EE Bonds Yield To Maturity Table (24% marginal tax bracket)
The biggest con of the EE bonds is it's 3.53% interest rate is fixed at year 20. If you cash out your EE bonds in year 19, 11 months in, right before the treasury doubles it, you'll only be getting $10k instead of $20k, or a (Yield-To-Maturity)[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp] of 100%.

Here is a table of for how long you hold an EE bond and the pre-tax/tax-adjusted yield you need on the remaining duration to make cashing out a EE bond financially worthwhile. 

Year |YTM|YTM - Tax Adjusted| Years left
:--|:-- |:--|:--         
1|	3.53%	|4.64%	|20  (NO REDEMPTION) 
2|	3.72%	|4.89%	|19
3|	3.93%	|5.17%	|18
4|	4.16%	|5.47%	|17

6|	4.73%	|6.22%	|15

18|	25.99%	|34.20%	|3
19|	42.42%	|55.82%	|2
20|	100.00%	|131.58%	|1

For example, in year 5 of holding an EE bond you need 15-year treasuries to have a 5.83% yield to make it financially worth it to cash out your EE bond if you're in the 24% tax bracket. If you're in the 0% tax bracket it's 4.43%. Likewise, at year 10 the 10-year treasuries need to yield 6.50% - 8.55%.

I like to think of EE Bonds as a 20 year CD with a 1 year lockup, a 1-3 year put option, and a severe all interest accrued early redemption penalty from years 3-20. 


# EE Bonds vs Buying a Marketable 1.5% 20-Year Treasury Example
Argument:
&gt; It's a nominal bond and the EE Bond's Yield to Maturity opportunity cost is so severe, if rates jumped back up to 3.53% in 5 years you'll wish you never bought the EE bond.

Here is how the math works out using a bond calculator (https://dqydj.com/bond-pricing-calculator/):

First off, EE bonds NAV does not fluctuate with interest rates. You can cash out a $10,000 EE bond for any time after 1 year for $10,000.

For a $10,000 1.5% treasury bond that jumped 2 points and it now has 15 years duration your bond is worth $7,681 on the open market. Add 5 years of 1.5% coupons being $750 and your position is $8,431. The EE bond still saved you $1,569 with your ability to redeem at the $10,000 face value + 0.10% nominal interest(not calculated). EE saves an extra $180 with the tax deferral if you're in the 24% income bracket for the 5 years of coupons too.

Winner: EE-Bond to the tune of $1,569 + possibly $180 from tax deferral it saved you from NAV loss. 

Yes, you will probably want to hang onto the EE bond for the 4.43% YTM opportunity cost, but if you think rates may drop and you want early capital gains on the new 20 year treasuries, or if your situation changes and you think you'll want the money before 15 years, you're still massively ahead if you decide to cash out the EE bond vs had you purchased the 20 year 1.5% treasury bond.

One caveat to keep in mind though is if you're in a 20 year treasury bond fund, this is a much harder position to calculate in, as 1/20 of the fund is buying new treasuries each year and selling treasuries each year to keep a constant duration. If interest rates rise very gradually then the bond fund may smooth out/hide NAV losses from the increase in yields of the newly purchased bonds. On the other hand, if you're investing in EE bonds you also probably have a ladder going and can choose to cash out ones you bought a year ago as well to take advantage of the new yield in treasuries.

# EE Bonds For Portfolios Example

Argument: 
&gt; EE bonds are just mental accounting. You should have a portfolio view, and view investing $10k extra in your portfolio, which more assuredly will return more than 3.53%.

While true, for accumulators, an EE bond doesn't do as well as a 90% stock, 10% bond portfolio. Using Personal Capital from the year 2000 - 2020s, $1,000,000 starting balance, $40,000 added annually, for accumulators the money weighted return rate (MWRR) is around 3.95%-4.29%, beating the 3.5% EE-bond: 
[PV Results](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2000&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=1&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=40000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VGTSX&amp;allocation1_1=90&amp;allocation1_2=90&amp;allocation1_3=90&amp;symbol2=VUSTX&amp;allocation2_1=10&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_2=10&amp;symbol4=VUSTX&amp;allocation4_3=10)

For 4% SWR withdrawers though, the [MWRR tells another story.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2000&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=1&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000000&amp;annualOperation=2&amp;annualAdjustment=40000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VGTSX&amp;allocation1_1=90&amp;allocation1_2=90&amp;allocation1_3=90&amp;symbol2=VUSTX&amp;allocation2_1=10&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_2=10&amp;symbol4=VUSTX&amp;allocation4_3=10)

These MWRR rates are all under 3.5%! They range from 3.08% to 3.40%! For this portfolio adding in some EE bonds to help with withdrawal would have been superior. We can see the 4% rule so far for those who retired in 2020 with this 90-10 portfolio looks to be dire. 

EE-Bonds are just one tool you can use for asset allocation purpose of your bonds. They should only be considered when you have a bond component to your portfolio. Looking at Vanguard's Total Bond Market holdings they allocate 20% to 20+ year long term treasuries. I'd personally would not allocate no more than 10% of your bond portfolio to EE bonds. If you're 90% stocks/10% bonds then you'd need a $1 million portfolio before buying 10k of EE bonds a year is worth your consideration, ignoring other decisions such as mortgage liability matching. 80% stocks/10% bonds - $500k. 70% stocks/30% bonds - $333k. 

At a 10% ""of bonds"" portfolio rule it will be very unlikely you'll need to sell EE bonds to rebalance into stocks or other treasuries. It's just not going to happen. I'd consider EE-Bonds as a tilt, just like tilting to small value in stocks, to try to gain a little bit extra yield and tax advantage space.

Winner: Toss up, you'd be rich if you can predict the future. You cannot predict the future. There are withdrawer portfolios that having EE bonds that can potentially help. On the other hand my example was pretty contrived as you probably don't want to retire on a 90/10 portfolio with 4% SWR. EEs are an attractive tilt when nominal treasuries rates are so low. My suggestion is if you want to tilt to EE, do so with no more than 10% of your entire bond holdings. A 5% - 10% tilt warrants consideration. If you're one to deploy a small value tilt then you should do the same with the EE side for the extra yield given current market conditions. 

# Mortgage Liability Matching Example

Right now a 30 year mortgage has competitive rates of 3%, under the 3.53% tax deferred rates of an EE Bond. Furthermore, it may be possible to itemize interest deductions on your mortgage, and if you fall in that camp it may only be a 2.28% after-tax rate if you're in the 24% marginal tax bracket.

On the other hand we want a paid off mortgage in early retirement, as carrying a mortgage is a huge risk to sequence of returns. Lets say we just bought a mortgage, and we plan to FIRE in 20 years, and want the mortgage to be paid off by year 20.

EE bonds warrant a serious look with their safe 3.53% nominal rates vs paying off a 3% mortgage early. (Obviously if you have a 3.53% or higher mortgage and can't refinance to 3%, paying the mortgage off early is superior.)

Just to make the math easy assuming $10k of EE Bonds (even though you can get around the limit through trusts), I'll liability match a $1,666/mo mortgage, which costs $20,000 a year. Per the 4% Safe Withdrawal Rule to cover this mortgage in the last 10 years to avoid sequence of return risk, you will need a portfolio that is $500k larger - ouch. $20,000 / 0.04 = $500,000. 

However, if we liability match with EE bonds doubling in 20 years, we only need a portfolio of $100k extra dedicated to EE bonds, as we are guaranteed $20k nominal income per year ($10k interest, $10k principal) for years 20-30 of the mortgage. 

I'll be using this calculator:   
https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-loan-payoff-calculator.aspx

A 30 year mortgage at 3% annual interest rate of $395,315 will be $1,666.66/mo.

It's an interesting math problem as if you make $10k/year payments ($834/mo extra) for 17 years to the above $1,666.66/mo mortgage, you'll pay off the 3% mortgage and save 96,363. However, you've paid $170,000 of illiquid equity into your mortgage doing so. With EE Bonds doubling you'll save $100,000 and ""paid it off"" at year 20 when the EE bonds start doubling, while having liquidity access if you need to cash EE bonds early.

So, because of the interest of EE bonds you can stop paying extra to your mortgage at 10 years, save $70k in liquidity, and have $3,637 extra left over vs paying off the mortgage. 100,000 - 96,363 = 3,637. Of course the mortgage is ""paid off"" at year 20 vs year 17 though. Unfortunately, I can't find a calculator that would model what would happen if you made extra payments for only the first 10 years though to equal the scenarios a bit more.

I'll give it a shot by calculating it with the amortization table. At 30 years in the original mortgage balance you'll have paid $204,684.97 total in interest, and have a $184,114 remaining balance. For the remaining 20 years a bank would re-amortize the payment to be $1,021.09, so your extra payments would be $646/mo to get your original $1,667/mo payment.

With the 10k/year extra payments are a total of $88,738.12 in interest. For the next 20 years at the original $1,666.66/mo mortgage rate you'll pay $31,612.58 in interest.

So by paying $834/mo into the 3% mortgage for 10 years, then making the original payments, equivalent to the EE bond scenario, you'll pay a total of $120,350.70 in interest. Your savings is 204,684.97 - 120,350.70 = $84,334.27 savings.

So with the EE bond liability matching route you've ""paid off"" the mortgage one year earlier, and have $15,665.73 extra cash vs if you paid the equivalent amount of money into a 3% mortgage for the first 10 years then made your original monthly payments.

Winner: EE-Bond

# Summary

Argument: 
&gt; If I'm going to lock up my money for 20 years I'd rather throw it in the liquid stock market, or a venture capital firm, or private equity, or as part of a real estate deal.

I've shown how EE-Bonds can *potentially* be useful for FIRE planning. They are extremely safe. In this low interest rate environment they can be effective tools, such as liability matching reducing sequence of returns risk for $100k cost vs building a portfolio $500k larger to cover the last 10 years of a 30-year mortgage. (Or you can pay down the remaining 10 years of the mortgage when you FIRE straight out of your portfolio.)

Even if you don't have a specific known future payment to match, adding some extra fixed income can help with withdrawing down a portfolio as certain withdrawer portfolios may have a money weighted return rate (MWRR) that could be less than 3.53%. EE-Bonds are a useful low cost ""insurance"" option to consider.

Finally, all the above investment options carries significant risk for significant reward. For anything involving venture/PE/real estate the minimums start at 25k to 500k for accredited investors. With EE bonds the minimums are $25 per bond and you can withdraw in $25 increments. 

Finally, of course, EE-Bonds are not ideal if you have a need for money less than 20 years, for people aggressively saving for FIRE in 15 years (ie 50% savings rate or higher), but they still warrant consideration. They could still help out with income for in year 5 of FIRE after all. In my 90% stocks the withdrawer situation 2003 was looking pretty nasty so having some EE bonds kick in by then would still be very helpful.

Lastly, I would not even consider an EE-Bond when we're back to 2.5% - 3% CDs/savings accounts, 4% mortgages, etc. They're only an interesting option to consider in this current extreme low interest rate environment.",finance

I can’t afford to get sick (hospital bills), so taking on low wage part time work isn’t feasible where I live- people are known to not wear their masks, low wage employers are known to ignore safety requirements of the pandemic. I’m not the most healthy to begin with so I’m more likely to wind up in the hospital than not. 

So basically— I’m broke and the bills keep coming. I live with my family so there are no other costs of living. I don’t shop. I have no credit card debt. 

Please help me dig myself out of this horrible mud pit.",finance

personalfinance,[USA] Considering keeping house for rental and refinancing or selling,"I’m in the military in the and moving next year. I bought my house in February (don’t know why I waited so long after getting here), but I’m moving next year and trying to decide what to do with my house. 

Renting will be mandatory. At least until I’ve owned the house for two years. At that point I can sell it and not pay for the capital gains tax. However, I want to see if it’s worth it to refinance the house and keep it as a rental. My interest rate is 3.625%, so I want to know at what point would refinancing be a good decision. Supposedly I can get about 2.3% according to my friend that works in real estate. He gave me a contact to refinance through. I’m a little wary, but I still think it could be a good idea for me. Currently my payments are 

Another consideration is that I’m converting a bonus room into a bedroom which will raise the value of the house when I sell it or raise the rent slightly. It seems like most of the houses in my area are 3 bed 2 bath that rent for $2k to 2.3k, and I’ll have a 4 bedroom with roughly the same sqft. In my head it makes sense to charge at least $2.2k a month for rent. My total monthly payment including escrow is $1700 a month. 

Is there a calculator or does somebody know the formulas to calculate this myself? When would it be a better idea to just sell? I want to have that extra income but I’m still new to this and want to weigh all of my options.

solar,Northern CA folks: Incentives from utilities for upgrading electrical panel to install solar &amp; equipment,"Hi All,

I got really excited by the prospect of adding solar panels when I saw how low the price per watt got recently. I received quotes for 4kW systems from $6 to $9K after federal incentives from two companies whose site technicians said everything was good to go with my existing roof and electrical system. In doing my research, I realized that leaving my main service panel at 100 amps would put a squeeze on my existing electrical system and really box me in for any future needs like the replacement of my gas-powered water heater and furnace with more energy-efficient electric options.

Because my electrical service to PG&amp;E runs underground, the quotes I've gotten so far to upgrade my 100-amp electrical panel to a 200-amp panel have been from $5,700 to $9,000. **I'm hoping anyone here who's gone through the experience of upgrading their electrical systems to make solar work can share whether or not they were able to take advantage of any programs that reduced their site preparation costs or could provide some recommendations on how to avoid headaches?**

Neither solar company is providing much help here with navigating this process other than to tell me not to use their contractors since they'll rip me off (thanks). It seriously bummed me out when they agreed things like back-up batteries, which I was considering, weren't really feasible to install once they got back in stock. They suggested that I upgrade the electrical panel once I got to that point--as in after the solar was already installed.

* I noticed [PG&amp;E mentioned cost savings for connecting solar to my meter](https://www.pge.com/en_US/for-our-business-partners/interconnection-renewables/simple-solar-wind/contractor-resources/standard-nem-process-and-requirements.page), but the solar companies nor the electricians I spoke with knew about it and I'm not even sure if it's relevant to my situation.
* Another program PG&amp;E mentions is [$1,918 savings allowance for any upgrades needed to be made to my panel when adding an EV charger](https://www.pge.com/myhome/customerservice/other/newconstruction/projectcosts/results.shtml?proj=pev_under), which I'm doing. Again, no one I've talked to knows anything about it and PG&amp;E hasn't gotten back to me either.
* I am also aware of the [$800 rebate](https://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/solar-and-vehicles/options/clean-vehicles/electric/clean-fuel-rebate-for-electric-vehicles.page?WT.mc_id=Vanity_cleanfuelrebate-ev) through them that exists for buying a EV.

I gave up hope on this year's 26% [ITC](https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc) a while back once I realized upgrading my service panel would take an additional 2-3 months because of the underground wires. I know that I can include site work into the ITC, but I'm not sure what counts and doesn't count based on when I elect to do each step of the project.

financialindependence,Finally worked up the nerve to tell my little story in the hopes that it can inspire people here,"I’d like to tell my story because it’s been different, difficult, and hopefully it can revive some of your spirits as we keep packing those savings away. 

Also, this isn’t necessarily short. But trust me, I left a lot of things out. If you have any questions feel free to ask or DM me. 

My path to FIRE wasn’t very conventional. I spent my 20s—well, spending. I was a hard drinker, a writer (still am), and fairly good at my job, which was in capture and contract writing for the family sign language interpreting business. 

I guess that’s a pretty organic way to segue into my upbringing and circumvallated route to FIRE. I’m an only child of deaf parents. (They call us CODAs for child of deaf adults, but that sounds weird to me.) We were poor when I was born. My dad had quit his job at IBM to start his own interpreting business. By the time I was 8-9 years old, we weren’t poor anymore. He’s a pretty incredible person for a lot of reasons, especially within the deaf world. 

I grew up with that sort of presumption, not that we deserved anything but that my parents would always do what needed to be done to keep us in good shape. It wasn’t until I hit 14-15 years old or so that I stopped unconsciously assuming such. That’s around the time that I started doing drugs. 

Long story short, after grad school I started working for my dad while pursuing my writing career. I spent pretty much every dollar I had in a very very very very HCOL city. You’ve probably heard of it. It sounds like me religion and what we’re not allowed to eat. I always dealt with bad depression and anxiety, and drugs and alcohol were my coping mechanism. They were always a problem that I kept under control until about 27, when my agent left the industry and I couldn’t find another one. When I started with the hard stuff on a regular basis, it was downhill from there. It’s such a complicated irony because drugs were the only reason I survived into adulthood—but they’re also what kept me from finding the correct solutions (which were definitely not the 16 years of therapy and psychoanalysis). 

Just before my 31st birthday—July of 2019–I entered rehab, and my life changed immediately—for the worse. Okay, not really, but sort of, in that I couldn’t cope with anything. But at least I wasn’t threatening my own life. By the time covid hit, I’d basically separated from my girlfriend and moved back home with my parents. 

They were in Florida at the time, so for the first time since getting sober I was alone. I was so terribly down, I didn’t have a job (my father and I agreed it was for the best that I leave), and I was slowly breaking up with my gf. I’m still shocked that I didn’t relapse, but that’s probably because I always think the worst of myself. 

Around that time I remembered that my 401k was still with the company, and I could roll over the rest of what I’d invested after my bar mitzvah. I realized I had a somewhat decent nest egg, without having even paying attention to the 401k, since I’d maxed it out and hadn’t paid attention to it. Added up I had $45,500, which may not sound like much to a lot of the 32-year olds here, but for me, who had always lived under the assumption that I’d be poor until I died, it was a fairly great awakening: wait a minute, I can actually take this somewhere. 

Before I ever heard about this thread, I started scheming out the numbers. If I lived at home for a few years and sacrificed an adult life pretty much, what kind of progress could I make? I started picking up odd-jobs to pay the remaining 6 months’ worth of rent in the religiously/banned food HCOL city. I walked dogs, picked up groceries for elderly people remiss to go out during lockdown, and started carpet bombing my resume. 

I got some business up and running through Rover and the neighborhood listserv. I started working for instacart and Grubhub. I got to about $500 a week. Then I got a remote position with a small communications business, in capture, only without the bigger contract writing duties I had with the family business. So easier than my last job, right? 

I should’ve seen the red flags. The boss flippantly joked, when we met for the third interview, that they were working on Memorial Day because ‘what else is there to do?” They bullied me when I negotiated my salary, which was so low I can’t even repeat it here. The first week, I worked 70 hours. No mention of OTP. So I quit. 

Only if it were that easy. 

This was the first time I was confronting a ‘boss’ in my adult life. The only bosses I’d had outside the family business were at SUBWAY and the UMD dining hall. And of course, no drugs, which for me was the equivalent of no one to talk to about my situation. I totally broke down. I mean 100% lost it. It was so bad that my dad had to bring the equipment back to them. I was so ashamed that I couldn’t simply tell them the job wouldn’t work out for me that I just shut down and was suicidal. I know, it sounds crazy, but it’s the way I’m built. It’s not fun. I’m a totally rational person—in my mind. But my emotions totally overwhelm me in specific situations. 

For the next few weeks, from July through early august, I slowly came out of my deep funk. I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me medication that’s been utterly miraculous. I started picking up the same work I was doing before the full time job. Then I got some freelance writing work. I got an editorial consulting job. One of my short stories got published in a contest magazine and came in second. I picked up a tutoring gig for a little kid here in the neighborhood. I started getting really good at the delivery business, hustling every single night and gaining an edge to the point where that alone bags me a cool grand a week. The people at the company I freelance for fell in love with me and are giving me more and more work. 

Nine months ago I was unemployed, broken, alone. Now, I have a clear mission: FIRE. I’ve always wanted this kind of freedom. It’s why I wanted to become a writer, to get lost in stories unrelated to this rat race. It’s why I love books and really why I love life, for being human outside of the capitalist grind. But in another sense, I do enjoy numbers, business, and economics. I’ve always loved investing. So when I found this sub, I felt verified. 

At this point, I’m making a bit above $92,000, PLUS I have crazy deductions and some under the table pay. I went from totally hopeless at the beginning of 2020 (like many of us), to feeling more sure of myself than I have in YEARS. 

I’m up to $84,000 in assets, all stock, with no debt. Again, nothing too impressive for a lot of you here, but for me it’s truly special. I know the market is a bit frothy right now so things could be rocky, but I’ve been investing since I was 13, and that first decade was a hell of a ride. And I plan to sacrifice my early 30s to get as much money stuffed into the market as I can. 

I hope this can help some folks here who feel like things are too hard. If you’re here, you’re already ahead of the curve because you’re starting to work toward FIRE. Most people spend their money mindlessly like I did until recently. But more than the chance for freedom, this movement gives people such a healthy, simple goal. It’s so pure. I’m so thankful for it. 

Wishing you all the best in these tough times. Keep in mind that a lot of people are suffering right now. Keep your heads up and appreciate what you have!",finance

# **Investors are hoping for a clear presidential and Senate election outcome to end the sell-off  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/investors-are-hoping-for-a-clear-presidential-and-senate-election-outcome-to-end-the-sell-off.html)**
*****
&gt; The best hope for markets in the week ahead is that there is a clear cut winner in Tuesday’s presidential election.
*****
&gt; The election looms large as the biggest wild card risk for markets, and there is a real concern that no outcome could lead to a period of uncertainty and turbulence for markets and the economy. On the other hand, some strategists say a clear winner and quick concession by the other candidate could lead to a relief rally. Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.
*****
&gt; “If there’s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They’re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The overall landscape is not a political one. It’s that we’re in a pandemic, and we don’t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.”
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.
*****
&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it’s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it’s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.
*****
&gt; # Senate key for stimulus
&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.
*****
&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there’s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.
*****
&gt; “The overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected” to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.
*****
&gt; “A short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,” according to BofA strategists. “Once there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.”
*****
&gt; # Watch bond yields
&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.
*****
&gt; “We expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,” the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.
*****
&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.
*****
&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.
*****
&gt; “We expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,” the BofA strategists added.
*****
&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September’s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.
*****
&gt; “The most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don’t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,” Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. “This week is the one with the turmoil, and I don’t think the next week is the one where the market’s going to be crazy.”
*****
&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; “There’s no rule we need to declare a victor,” said Golub. “We have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don’t go off the rails, and they really shouldn’t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.”
*****
&gt; Golub said there’s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. “The chances are that we’ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Earnings reports
&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “The reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there’s no recession, no downturn,” Golub said.
*****
&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. “It is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don’t believe he’s going to implement these tax increases he’s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,” said Golub.

&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**

&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

*****

&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish

&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.

&gt; # GDP Bounces Back

&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending—the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output—rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services—consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.

&gt; “GDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone’s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,” stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Barring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it’s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don’t expect a double-dip recession.”

&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.

&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!

&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we’ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.

&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence

&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**

&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**

&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**

&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.

&gt; # Industrials Malfunction

&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**

&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.

&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.

&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**

&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.

&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge

&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.

&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.

&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.

personalfinance,Fed employee disability insurance,"Curious do other fed employees have supplemental disability insurance? I currently have a fed advantage policy, short term, long term combo, 60% of pay, own occupation coverage, which I pay $82/mo for 90k in coverage. Wondering if other fed employees see supplemental coverage as ""worth it""? I realize that's a subjective question and so seeking others' subjective opinions and thoughts",finance
personalfinance,Is it that bad we did 15 years instead of 30 years for house mortgage?,"Background: My wife (85K) and I (105K) 30 M/F make \~190K. We brought a home 380K with a mortgage of 304K @ 3% interest rate 15 yrs. We have about 60K cash, and 230K in retirement.

Our parents persuaded us to do 15 years to pay it off quick. Their reasoning was while 30 years is the ideal outcome for investing more into the stock market they also said it's better for peace of mind to have a ""paid"" off house then have something latched on to you for another 15 years. They said the stock market isn't also so great all the time and our retirement is already decent to keep putting even more in than needed. They  also pointed out if we did 30 years we were more inclined to buy a bigger / more expensive home as well.

I was thinking of doing refinancing to 30 years but I am unsure now. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Questions,"Looking to refinance our house with the low interest rates.

Currently have ~150k with a 4.25 interest rate on a 30 year loan.

I've been pre-approved for 2.25 rate on a 15 year fixed, however it'll add on 10k in closing costs (5k in loan fees + 5k in property tax), increasing our monthly payment by ~300 (manageable, but less than ideal).

A few questions.

Shopping around am I likely to get a lower rate or reduce closing costs elsewhere?

We could pay the closing costs up front instead of financing it, but this would significantly reduce our cash on hand, putting us in a bind if something unexpected happened while we save back up. Should this be considered?",finance
investing,Moving average drawdown protection in place of TMF - Hedgefundie's strategy,"To  start with, I contribute approximately 15% of my gross income to my  union defined contribution pension plan, so I'm fairly well covered for  retirement through that alone. However, being a DINK with 200k combined  income, I still have substantial funds for investing (with lots of room  in tax-free accounts) and would like to invest aggressively in those  tax-free accounts. Age 33.

That  said, I have to say I'm interested in the [Hedgefundie strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192) and the  principles of Lifecycle Investing. The former has certainly worked well  in backtests, when equities have been rather steadily rising and  interest rates steadily falling. I'm comfortable with assuming equities  will continue rising but not as comfortable assuming interest rates will  continue falling. And with interest rates being as low as they are, I  see little value in holding Treasuries (or almost any bond other than  high-yield ones, for that matter) other than as cheap insurance (in an  asset that has historically been negatively correlated with equities).

I'm  wondering what people's thoughts are on using moving average crosses  mostly as sell signals to prevent the significant drawdowns that can  seriously harm leveraged ETFs (i.e. using moving average crosses as the  cheap insurance). I've been considering a strategy of liquidating all  leveraged holdings when the S&amp;P500 crosses below its 350EMA and  re-entering when it crosses back over the 50EMA, as a way of staying out  during significant drawdowns and the accompanying increase in  volatility. And perhaps holding TMF during those times, rather than all  the time as per the Hedgefundie strategy. I feel like, going forward,  TMF will underperform UPRO/TQQQ and thus will have an opportunity cost  to it that makes it no longer cheap insurance.

I  understand that moving average strategies offer little protection for  black swan events that cause significant gap downs, and I know there's  the potential for false negatives when the market whipsaws (which would  lead to unnecessary selling and buying - thus transaction costs), but I  feel like the pros&gt;cons.

Please criticize.

personalfinance,Is 5.8% a good mortgage rate for someone in my situation?,"Hey reddit,

I was looking into getting an investment property. I don't have a steady income as a med student, so it can make getting a traditional mortgage difficult. Through family, I found a broker that is willing to give me a 5.8% rate on a 30 year mortgage with 25% down.

Wife says this is too high given how low post-COVID interest rates are. Usually interest rates are higher on investment properties, and given I have no monthly income and would be relying on renting to pay the mortgage I think this seems relatively fair. (I do not foresee renting as an issue as my family/friends rent similar houses in the area and there are 0 vacancies.)

Any advice would be appreciated",finance
personalfinance,Should we refinance?,"The original loan was for $417k at 3.875% interest rate.

We’re down to $409k principal balance now, after a year.

The new loan is tacking on 20k! It seems like so much to me. The lender says it makes sense, but I feel like there’s so much jargon.

So the new loan would be 430k with a 2.5% interest rate. Supposedly we would save about 100k in interest, but that’s assuming we stay the whole time. If we stay for say 5-10 years. Would it still be worth it?

The market were in is very hot and after a year there the house already appraised for 65k more than when we purchased it. Not sure how much that matters, but it was part of the refinance. 

Is it worth it?",finance

personalfinance,Not sure if the right sub and also might be too late but..,"Long story so I’ll sum it up then explain 

TLDR: wife and I tax refund finally got processed in August, qualifies us as not a dependent obviously, still haven’t gotten stimulus check and still shows up as “eligible for payment will update when we have your payment date” on IRS Website 

So my wife and I got married last October (2019) filed our taxes before the original April 15th deadline (before it got extended to July) then COVID hit which I expected would slow down the IRS so figured it would take longer than usual to refund. Flash forward to August still no refund, we get a letter from the IRS that they need to verify our identification as we had just been married and filing jointly for the first time, no longer claimed as dependents. (I forgot the name/number of the form we needed to complete but you may know what I’m talking about) so I complete that process online before the 30 day deadline, then shortly after that we finally got our tax refund. I figured after that filing was complete then they’d be able to send out the stimulus checks to both of us since we were qualified, but here we are end of October and the IRS tracker still says we’re eligible for stimulus payment but do not have a payment date yet. Just wondering if there’s anything I can do to speed this up or anyone to talk to cuz obviously trying to get in touch with the IRS is useless lol, we’re not in desperate need of the money but obviously we want our 2400 combined since the federal government said they would give it to us and we don’t want to fall thru the cracks on this lol.

personalfinance,How to get a good personal loan without controlling Asian parents finding out?,"I am starting treatment for mental health and I anticipate medical expenses to the tune of $20,000 over 5 months. I have to pay out of pocket due to insurance issues. This is my first time getting a loan. I have CPTSD, anxiety, depression, and ADHD so currently I'm pretty overwhelmed with the entire loan process. I'd like to get a personal loan for medical expenses.

My only issue is that I live with controlling Asian parents who check my credit card statement every month, and I'd like them to not know about my loan. They also have control of all of my money so I am planning on getting treatment, getting high paying jobs, pay off loan, get savings, and moving out. They also do my taxes every year.

I have an excellent credit score and I was pre-approved for a loan on Upstart for this amount, however I'd have to put it on a credit card and I'm not sure if the high APR is worth it.

* Payment est.\***$416/mo**
* Length\***60mo.**
* Interest &amp; fees Est.\***$6,768**
* APR Est.\* **13.22%**
* Loan amount **$18,200**

I also am looking at credit unions for loans as well. I feel like credit unions might be better for lower interest rates, but am worried about how to access money. And also I'm looking at banks like Wells Fargo or other financial institutions. I plan on paying back the loan in less than a year, but due to monthly payments, am looking at 60 month time frame.

I want to get a personal loan which can be hidden away in a separate bank account or credit card from parents, a quick process with no hassle, repayment of loans early without penalty, and a loan which won't hurt my credit score. I'm pretty confused about the APR interest rates, would a lower interest rate be better? And which financial institutions are better for me, Online, credit unions, or banks, or small independent loan companies? Thank you.

EDIT:

I currently get unemployment from California as as source of income, but my parents have access to it.

THe mental health treatment is designed for me to function better. I'm doing somatic experiencing as well as neurofeedback, which can help me focus and keep jobs, lower anxiety and depression and reudce symptoms of CPTSD. I've been fired from so many jobs. It will literally rewire my brain as my brain is currently extremely emotionally dysregulated and my nervous system is dysregulated.

I have a bachelors degree in Economics, so I estimate I can get a 40k-60K accounting job. Plus I'm pretty charismatic, funny, and friendly and have restaurant experience. A lot of customers like me. I can drive to a populated, wealthy area and I can apply to high paying restaurants and can bank $500-$1,000 in tips per night. But I do not have the mental health right now to hold or obtain a job. 

Regarding current job situation: Right now my anxiety, depression, ADHD and CPTSD symptoms are at an all time high. I almost got a job on Wednesday and even with my psychiatric medications Adderall and Lexapro I was freaking out massively because the salary negotiations went sour. I felt like my body was literally on fire, extreme fight or flight mode. And I have issues reading and focusing. So I feel like if I could just concentrate on treatment for at least 3 months and applying for jobs after that, it would be worth it.

To me the investment of 5 months is worth it. But that's if I have a healthy brain.",finance
