personalfinance,Roth IRA Confusion,"[Pardon my basic-ass subject matter. Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa]

I had an Econ teacher in high school who always told us to start a Roth IRA as soon as we had any kind of money to put aside for retirement. So, I started up a Roth IRA Money Market account a few weeks ago, despite being not particularly knowledgeable about IRAs, banking, or money in general. I'm an Apprentice Rigger; basically a monkey who has more than $1K for the first time in his life. 


So I set one up with my bank, just knowing I was after a Roth IRA but really nothing else about it. The banker was not explaining things in a way I understood very well at all, so I started doing some research, and looking at the exact details of my account online. Turns out, the interest rate on this account is .01%, which even my dumb ass knows is functionally useless. What I was expecting an account that I had to create an investment portfolio for, that I could potentially see long-term growth in. 

I went back in today to see if that was correct, or if I had somehow missed a step, or if there was something I needed to do to make this account something more than a more complicated savings account that was worse in every way than a vanilla savings account. Apparently not. This account is functioning at full capacity. Fortunately, I was a little leery of an account that I didn't understand well, so I only put in 1k, so I'm not crippled if that money is just stuck there for 38.5 more years, but I'd like to make an account that... Well you know. Works. 


I'm just after a post-tax retirement account that I can see long-term growth in, and I thought that's what I had done. 


What am I doing wrong here? Did I open the wrong kind of account? Is the banker wrong about how the account works?",finance
personalfinance,"Move money from pension to IRA, pay off loans, none of the above?","I am about to leave my first full time job at a large public university for a 1 year, international position that does not offer employer-sponsered retirement plans. Over my 2 years at the university, I've contributed ~$8,000 to a pension plan (which was my only option), but I haven't vested (need 5 years total). I probably won't be making any retirement contributions over the next year.

I'd appreciate any advice on whether I should:
1) Keep the money where it is. The university is in a state with a lot of campuses that I may realistically return to for future employment, and keeping the money in the pension lets me keep my 2 years of employment on the record for vesting in.
2) Move the money to a Roth/traditional IRA.
3) Pay off some of my ~$18,000 in student loans. The highest rate on those is 5.5%. Most of them will be in deferment for the next year. But withdrawing the money, of course, incurs a 10% penalty. I've read I should also expect another ~20% to be taken out in taxes, but a previous coworker did this and said she only lost ~10% total.

My current thoughts are that an IRA would (hopefully?) make more of an % interest than the % interest on most of my loans, though then it's that interest rate*8,000 vs loan interest rate*18,000.

I know that no one can give me definite advice, especially not knowing whether I will return to my current employer, but I appreciate any thoughts and insights you have!",finance
worldpolitics,How UBI can be Funded by Supporters (Using the Forbes 400),"12 Americans who appear in the Forbes 400 as of May 31st, 2019, support universal basic income; they are the following in order of net worth from highest to lowest.

1. Alice, Rob, Jim, and Lukas Walton combined (of Walmart)
2. Jeff Bezos (of Amazon)
3. Bill Gates (of Microsoft)
4. Warren Buffet (of Berkshire Hathaway)
5. Mark Zuckerberg (of Facebook)
6. Elon Musk (of Tesla)
7. Thomas Peterffy (of Interactive Brokers)
8. Ray Dalio (of Bridgewater Associates)
9. Pierre Omidyar (of eBay)

Their combined net worth is currently $616.1 billion. According to Elizaveta Fouksman, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Oxford, it would cost the federal government $526.15 billion (adjusted for inflation). If each of the people mentioned in the list would contribute a fair percentage of their net worth into a public ""charity"", UBI would be fully funded. They would then have up to $67.57 billion left.

Of course, this may not likely happen due to the publicity of their campaign and, of course, their egos.",finance

&gt;20. Furthermore, this review is critical to determine the exact class of plaintiffs which may satisfy the standing test in the start-up environment. If an entrepreneur had a business idea involving Bitcoin, but took no affirmative action to start the business before the Regulation went into effect, certainly that entrepreneur could not satisfy the standing test. If an entrepreneur had an established business in New York involving Bitcoin for ten years leading up to the Regulation going into effect, courts would easily find that this person suffered an injury and therefore satisfies the standing test. However, if an entrepreneur created a start-up business and took affirmative steps towards that end, then got stopped by a regulation, the entrepreneur’s rights would be severely impaired under this Court’s ruling. Therefore, the Court of Appeals must be provided with an opportunity to determine when a start-up business that has taken affirmative steps and expended a non-trivial amount of money can satisfy the injury prong of the standing analysis.

His fears were well-founded because DFS has an inherent power to enforce all its regulations since their promulgation.  Furthermore, in early 2016, the Bitcoin industry was roiled by the U.S. Department of Justice’s numerous prosecutions of both businesses and individuals who offered cryptocurrency exchange services.  SeeUnited States v Murgio, 209 F. Supp. 3d 698 \[SDNY 2016\]; United States v.

personalfinance,Advice for federal vs private loan,"Hi!

This is kind of a weird thought I've been considering, but I wanted to get some opinions.  I'm sitting on over 30k in private student loans, plus some federal.  This is from my undergraduate.  I am now in grad school, with the opportunity to take out federal student loans.      I don't need the money for my current studies, as I can afford the tuition because I am working fulltime.  

My private loan is at 6.6% interest, which is variable and keeps going up. As a grad student, I qualify for fed unsub loans at 6.6% fixed interest. 

My question is: is it worth taking out the fed loan and just paying off part of my private loans?  Presumably I could do this in future terms also, replacing my private loan with federal loans.

Or is this just dumb?

Before it is asked: I am paying my payments during school, not taking deferment,  but I can't just pay more to pay of the private loans faster, given that I'm actually paying tuition.

personalfinance,Should I use a private student loan to pay off credit card debt?,"Hi!

I am approaching my senior year of my BA, and thankfully I've managed to make it this far without needing to apply for any private loans (though I do have about $6500 in federal loans taken out). Over the last few years, though, I have accumulated about $7000 in credit card debt at just over 16% APR. It is beginning to get very difficult to make the minimum payment every month without dipping into my savings (just under $1000). With expenses and interest compounding, the debt has been slowly going up, along with my stress levels.

It occurred to me that it might be a good idea to use a private loan (which I will need this year anyway) to essentially buy out my credit card debt. At least then I wont have to lose sleep over making enough money to make the minimum every month.

Is this a good approach, or would it be a huge mistake? I haven't started thinking about where I want to get the loan from, so I have no info regarding the interest rate. Any and all advice is appreciated. I'll try to stay active if any clarification is needed.",finance
investing,Outcome of Mass Migration to Index Funds,"**tl;dr** if *everyone* were to buy index funds, that would open up more opportunity for professional money managers and individual investors to have more chance at beating the market, ultimately reducing the amount of index fund investors while possibly increasing professional investor return performance

**long*****er*** **tldr @ end**

\---

so ive recently seen lots of people in discussions and blogs getting worried about impending mass-migration to index funds, typically blaming groups like FIRE etc that promote the *simple* investing into index funds like VTSAX, SPY, whatnot, rather than individual stock picking or buying mutual funds and investment company equity. the people that seem to be getting worried about this claim that if everyone was to only buy index funds, their prices would skyrocket and they'd become too ""expensive"", reducing their efficiency and total return. I see people that have some amount of their portfolio in a Total Market Fund, and then some of their portfolio in a similar Total Market Fund offered by another, different company (Vanguard/iShares/Blackrock whatever). while this would somewhat make sense if the primary company were at risk of collapsing, these people state that it is in case of one of the funds becoming too expensive due to an influx of passive investors.

these kind of discussions remind me of Charles D. Ellis' 1995 article **The Loser's Game** and his subsequent '98 book **Winning the Loser's Game**. Ellis explains that during the mid-twentieth century professional investors were doing bloody well at beating the market, and the average Mr-and-Mrs-spare-cash were more than happy to invest with mutual funds and investment companies in order to retrieve these returns. although once people realised that there was money to be made in stock picking, many more small-time investors had a go at picking individual stocks and studying to become professional money managers. this increased influx of professional investors is what creates the Efficient Market Hypothesis, theorising that, on average, company stock prices are where they should be based on all publicly available information. This makes it extremely difficult to beat the market since you have exactly the same information about a company as anyone else. Ellis claims that, unless one is intent on becoming a professional investor in order to stock-pick themselves, individual investors could do much worse than ""joining the market"" via purchasing shares in an index fund or the like.

evidently, FIRE communities advocate index funds as a way to retrieve \[pretty darned good\] stock market returns over the long run with relatively passive investing. some people are worried that increased numbers of investors \[due to increased numbers of people joining these communities\] will figure the benefits of index funds, thus retarding their efficiency. I include Ellis' theories that increased numbers of money managers reduces potential for outstanding portfolio performance; though I believe that an extremely drastic increase of index fund investors would then do the opposite and allow for the \[reduced number of\] professional money managers to come in and have more chance at garnering increased portfolio performance. this would evolve much like the increased numbers of passive investors in mutual funds allowed for professional managers to start their own successful funds a few decades ago.

**In short (though more of a long*****er*** **tldr):** in the late 1900s, money managers were doing very well at beating the market and retrieving high returns; this introduced many more professional money managers as they all wanted some of the action; increased number of professionals creates an Efficient Market and reduces potential for beating the market and achieving outstanding returns; many are currently realising that professional money managers are achieving substandard returns relative to the index total market; passive investors thus flock to low-cost index funds; some in FIRE and similar community discussions state that they are worried that mass migration to index funds will reduce their accuracy and efficiency of the market; i believe that mass migration to index funds will allow for professional money managers to come back into the picture and will allow for further possibility of them garnering increased returns; this creates a cycle of money managers being discouraged and a flock to index funds that become inefficient then a flock to money managers and a flock to index funds with probably many other factors like bond markets and interest rates/taxes etc affecting returns available that i dont know anything about though honestly i think we have nothing to worry about if we all buy index funds

CryptoCurrency,Stop telling people to stop leaving their funds in exchanges every time they get hacked or if an exchange gets hacked,"You know, I keep seeing this, and repeating this non-stop every time someone loses their coins on an exchange doesn't help anyone.  Self-custody is hard.  Self-custody is not for everyone.  Self-custody is not always superior to an account on a properly secured and managed exchange.  It depends on the person.

Do you remember the password you used on your cell phone 10 years ago?  Do you still have the hard drive backups you took 10 years ago?  Do you still remember the PIN for your ATM card from 10 years ago?  Can you guarantee your home will never burn down?  Can you guarantee you won't get in an accident and lose your memory?  Can you guarantee you'll never suffer from alzheimer's? Can you afford the cost of a safe-deposit box at the bank?  (And a trip to the bank every time you want to spend?)  Do you have the discipline to make regular backups, and secure them as safely as your primary storage? Has your smartphone or PC ever been compromised with a virus or other malware? Have you ever misplaced your USB key and not been able to find it a few years later? I think for many people the answers to these questions make it clear that self-custody *might* not be for them. At least not yet. Thus for now all you're doing is rubbing salt in the wound.

Absolutely be extremely careful about what exchanges you use. If the exchange doesn't require 2FA, or supports SMS, go elsewhere. (Use Google Auth or Yubikey that cannot be chipped)  If the exchange cannot demonstrate full cold wallet balances, adequate use of multisig warm and cold storage, and adequate customer support, go elsewhere.  Look for exchanges that prioritize security and that don't mind making it a little harder to trade if it means better protection of your funds.  Eg, per-trade 2FA, auto-expiring API keys, and multiple notification paths for trades and account actions. (Like my exchange supported all the way back in 2012.)

If your favorite exchange doesn't have this stuff, demand it. Refuse to support them until they add it.

Sorry if I got a little carried away, but I've been around a long time and unfortunately have seen just about as many losses with self-custody as I have with exchanges. It’s always the same fucking people who joined the space a month ago who think they’re onto something or help anyone when they say shit like “you deserve it for leaving funds on an exchange”.

A relative of mine passed away recently, and I'm set to receive in the neighborhood of $14,000 as a result. I have several obvious ways that I can use the money, and I thought it important to get some advice. Here're my options that I'm currently considering:

1. Pay off my car. I bought a used car earlier this year and I still owe $11,600 on it. I'm currently paying $236 a month on the car, and I'm getting enough money that I could just pay off my car and completely eliminate this from my monthly payments, and I'd even have a little money left over going this route. Otherwise, I'm going to be paying this baby off for the next five years. **The interest rate on this loan is 6.99%**
2. Put it towards my student loans. I currently owe $31,800 in student loans, and I'm paying $214 per month here. The money I'm getting wouldn't wipe out my debt, but cutting in half ain't bad. I'll be paying these off for way longer than the car loan, so taking such a huge bite of it off now could really alleviate this long-term. **The interest rate on this loan is 4.375%**
3. Use it to help with a down payment on a house. I'm currently house hunting, looking for stuff in the $100,000-$110,000 range, and currently I'd only have enough to put down about 10% of that comfortably. If I add this in, however, I could hit 20% and avoid Mortgage Insurance, which sounds appealing. Plus, I'd still have some left over to help with the initial phase of home ownership. Buying furniture, doing any work to the house that it needed, etc.

Those are my main ideas. Which one makes the most financial sense? Am I missing any other option that might be better?

BTW, if it helps, I bring in about $1,300 every other week (after taxes, benefits, and my 401K contribution).

EDIT: I've got about $13,000 in the bank at the moment, but I plan to be making a down payment of at least $10K-$11K within the next few months.

# **Fed officials and Trump’s latest trade threat could decide whether June starts with a market swoon  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/fed-officials-and-trumps-latest-trade-threat-could-decide-whether-june-starts-with-a-market-swoon.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials speaking at a policy conference may get a lot more attention than usual in the week ahead after President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat against Mexico ramped up expectations for interest rate cuts.
*****
&gt; Markets will also start the month of June, which is often flat for markets, coming off a painful 6.6% monthly loss in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Stocks lost ground in May on worries that the U.S. trade war with China would hurt the global economy and bite into earnings growth. They will begin trading in June with new worries that tariffs on Mexico could hurt the economy and threaten a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
*****
&gt; The coming week has a full calendar of economic data, with the highlight being Friday’s May employment report. There are also monthly auto sales and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data due Monday, and international trade data expected Thursday.
*****
&gt; But it is the Fed that should get the most attention, with central bank officials gathering at a much-anticipated conference hosted by the Chicago Fed Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make the opening remarks at the conference, which is about monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. For months, strategists have been hoping the conference will provide insight into how the Fed intends to address sluggish inflation.
*****
&gt; Interest in the event is even higher after the market and Fed watchers are increasingly convinced the central bank will now cut rates this year, and maybe more than once. The futures market priced in increasing expectations for two rate cuts after Trump’s threat to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if the Mexican government does not stop immigration into the U.S.
*****
&gt; After the last Fed meeting, Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory, suggesting the Fed would not have to cut rates, but markets still anticipate a rate cut, and inflation continues to run below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economists, said investors hoping to hear Fed officials discuss their thinking on current policy could be disappointed. Gapen said the Fed is also about nine months away from its decision on how it will frame inflation, and the conference will be more about academic views on it.
*****
&gt; Gapen was one of several Wall Street economists Friday who changed his view on the Fed’s rate policy. He said he now sees the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 75 basis points in two cuts this year, with the Fed starting at 50 basis points in September. The Fed has said does not foresee any rate cuts this year, nor hikes, and has stressed it is on hold.
*****
&gt; Gapen does not expect to hear much from Fed officials at the conference on rates, though investors will be combing through every word looking for policy clues.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think that’s the type of setting where anyone would make a monetary policy comment in advance of an FOMC meeting,” he said. The Fed next meets on June 18 and 19.
*****
&gt; Gapen said he went from expecting no Fed move to two rate cuts because the trade war with China has become more extended than expected; manufacturing and business spending are weakening, and because of Trump’s threat to put tariffs on Mexico if it doesn’t control immigrants heading into the U.S. over the southern border.
*****
&gt; “It does suggest the administration is willing to pursue multiple fronts. It lowers the bar for tariffs on Europe,” he said.
*****
&gt; Interest rates continued to slide Friday, to multi-year lows. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, fell sharply and was at 1.93% in late trading. The 10-year yield, at 2.55% in early May, was at 2.13% Friday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was down 2.6% for the week, ending its worst week of the year at 2,752.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief market strategist, said a “May mauling usually leads to a boom in June.” Going back to World War II, whenever there was a strong start to the year, the market traditionally fell in May but rose in June. Plus, this year was the third best start through April.
*****
&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said beyond the trade headlines, there are quite a few market catalysts in June.
*****
&gt; “June is going to be very event-driven. It’s going to be the Fed on June 19. It’s going to be OPEC on June 25; it’s going be the G-20 on June 29,” he said.
*****
&gt; He added, “We’re going to stay balanced and diversified because we don’t know how things are going to come out.”

# Time For A June Swoon?

&gt; Well, it finally happened. The S&amp;P 500 Index pulled back more than 5% from its all-time high, marking the first 5% pullback of 2019. As we have discussed many times over the past two months, the odds were high that some type of pullback or even correction (10% or more off the highs) was likely after the 25% surge off the December 2018 lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-Corrections-are-normal.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; May likely will be the first negative month of the year (down nearly 6% with two days to go) and likely will be the first time stocks closed in the red in May since 2012.

&gt; Now, seasonality hints to more volatility ahead, as June doesn’t have the best history for stocks. “We finally had a 5% pullback, but the bad news is June can be a tricky month for stocks,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Going back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the day shows, stocks have tended to be weak in June over various periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Time-For-A-June-Swoon-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are six thoughts to chew on as we turn the calendar:

&gt; * When the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5% in May (like it could in 2019), June’s performance has been weak. May has lost 5% or more only four other times in the past 50 years, and stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June twice.
&gt; * However, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up more than 10% year to date heading into June (like it could in 2019), the S&amp;P 500 has gained 9 of the past 12 times (going back 50 years), and has been higher 1.9% on average.
&gt; * Equity markets in Greece, Brazil, India, Argentina, and Australia are all very strong. If we were truly entering a global recession, we would see more broad-based global weakness.
&gt; * The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) daily put/call ratio surged to its highest level since late December yesterday, suggesting a good deal of fear is coming into the market – a necessary recipe for a bottom to form.
&gt; * Only 31% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average. This is nearing washout levels, but could need to go down to 20% before the ultimate low can form. Still, we are getting closer.
&gt; * The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey has more than 40% bears, the highest since the start of 2019. That’s another sign fear is spiking, and pessimism could be a bullish contrarian signal.

# DJIA Six Week Losing Streaks

&gt; Barring a 700+ point rally into the close (hey, anything is possible), the DJIA is on pace for its first six-week losing streak since June 2011 and the 32nd such streak going back to 1900. As of this writing, the DJIA is down 6.46% over the course of this current losing streak, which would go down as the mildest six-week losing streak for the index since June 1976 and the fifth 'mildest' six-week losing streak on record. The chart below highlights each of the DJIA's prior six-week losing streaks since 1900 and shows how much the index declined during each one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Six-Week-losing-Streaks-1.png))**

&gt; While there have been quite a few six-week losing streaks for the DJIA in its history, it is not common for them to go on into a seventh week. As shown in the chart below, just seven of the DJIA's 32 prior six-week losing streaks have last seven or more weeks, and a 7-week losing streak stretching to an eighth week is practically unheard of with just one way back in 1923.

# DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Up Six Straight on June’s First Trading Day

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998. Over the past 24 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 70.8% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 66.7% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 58.3% as has the Russell 2000 at 62.5%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Looking at the chart above, shaded areas highlight areas of strength during the month. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap. This June could turn out better than average as a result of a strong start to the year and weakness in May.

# Strong Starts Weak Mays Boon for June

&gt; Our previous analysis of big gains the first four months indicated weakness was in store for the merry month of May. Now that the market has indeed suffered this May the outlook for June is a boon at least historically speaking.

&gt; The table below shows the top 20 first four month gains for the for the S&amp;P 500 with the subsequent changes for May, June, Rest of the Year, “Worst Six Months” May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

&gt; May is weakest and May 2019 has delivered market declines so far, down -4.9% for the S&amp;P 500 as of today’s close. However, after big starts, 7 of the 9 subsequent May declines were followed by big gains in June (highlighted in green). So, while we do not anticipate much upside over the next 5 months or so, June is set up for a boon.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/31/19

&gt; This week's economic data came in split down the middle with 12 releases coming in worse than the prior period or estimates and another 12 improving. A remaining 3 met expectations or were unchanged from the previous period. We noted this same pattern in our Matrix of Economic Indicators for April. The FHFA's House Price Purchase Index for the first quarter was the first release of a shortened week coming in unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.1%. Monthly FHFA and Case-Shiller prices also came out on Tuesday with both showing slower home price growth. Later that morning the Conference Board's readings on Consumer Confidence came in stronger than both forecasts and the April reading. The final release Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity, disappointed at -5.3 versus expectations of 6.2. On Wednesday, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also came in below expectations but was stronger than the April reading. The second release of Q1 GDP was revised lower but less than expected with growth for Q1 now sitting at 3.1% QoQ SAAR. While consumption growth was stronger, that came thanks in part to inflation measures falling below estimates. Retail and Inventories grew more than expected in April as seen in their Thursday release. Pending home sales were also notably weak. Friday data was better with Personal Income and Spending numbers both beating estimates. Michigan Sentiment was the final release of the week with a reading of 100.0 versus forecasts of 101.5, both below the 102.4 reported in preliminary data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-eco.png))**

&gt; With 34 releases, the data slate picks up next week. Monday we will get some important manufacturing data including the final data for May for the Markit PMI and ISM Manufacturing. Revisions for durable goods and the broader factory orders numbers for April will follow up on Tuesday. As next week is the first week of June, on Wednesday ADP will release their employment data for the month of May. This is expected to show fewer jobs created than April. The service portions of Markit PMIs and ISM will also come out Wednesday morning. In addition to the usual Thursday weekly releases, Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the first quarter are expected. The Employment Situation Report with its Nonfarm Payrolls number will round out the week in economic data on Friday morning.

personalfinance,"Chance to rent my house out and live mortgage free for a while, what should I look into?","So I am in a rare position where I can rent out my house and live with family rent free for a while.  The idea is I save up and buy another house, live in it for a year to keep the owner interest rate, then rent it out and find a third house.


If I do this the third house will be the one I live in.   With two houses and my normal job I hope to slowly expand out from there.   

Anyhow I am very early on in my research to see if this is a risk I want to take but figured I would ask what things that may not be obvious should I watch out for/look into?

I know my biggest concern is the cap for my price range for my current house was 150k which is where the vast majority of the country is so it's competitive and house prices have gone up.  Bought my house for 135k 3 years ago and current similar houses in my neighborhood are selling for 160k to 180k now.   Most of the houses here are renting out for around 1350 to 1400 right now.  Which would mean around a 400 dollar profit margin on top of my current mortgage.

What else should I be concerned about?

Anticipate I will have \~$140K in student loans, however given my parents' income, I qualified for what is called a Loan for Disadvantaged Students (LDS). This loan has a 5% fixed interest rate, and given I complete yearly paperwork, will not accrue interest until after I complete residency (for my specialty will be 3 additional years after medical school).  

&amp;#x200B;

From external scholarships I have about 30K in savings. I have the option of putting this amount towards my loans, but given that LDS does not accrue interest until after I finish training, are my savings better spent elsewhere? For example, should I invest this money to a CD?

&amp;#x200B;

what is greendot? I was trying to learn about Discover Cashback 1% checking account and came up to this site. One thing is that the cashback is nerfed at 100$ per year but thats still WAY TOO good i think when compared to even CCs!

to fill the 100 cashback amount, you need to spend at least 2000 a year. or 166 a month. having more than one CCs, most single people will be spending that much def along with Freedom and Discover 5% catagory taking other amounts.

Like we can def allocate 166 a month for this card and get 100 free cashbacks. like am I crazy here or what? discover debit does 1% with 3000 limit per month. meaning, you would need to spend 9,900 dollars in discover to get same 100 dollars as 2000 gets you in this card.

&amp;#x200B;

please if anyone can make me understand this. I currently put 300 in CITI per month and get 72 back. why would this not be better (plus as a debit this is useable on things that CC. being a loan, may not.) like if a allocate 166 from citi to this, i would get 100 and then added 2% on the extra 134 per month?",finance

personalfinance,Should I Refinance?,"Hey everyone! This is the situation. We bought our house about 3 years ago and we didn’t put 20% down so we had to pay mortgage insurance. After making payments and home values going up we were well above the 20% threshold so we decided to refinance to get rid of mortgage insurance.  We were trying to find the right time and interest rates were just going up and up so we decided to refinance with a relative high rate  at 4.99%, we just weren’t sure if it was going to continue to go up. They’ve since come down. We did a cash out as well to pay off a car loan we had, which also played a factor into the high rate. We also didn’t shop around as much as we should have.

That was about a year ago, and after that year we had some major expenses come up. We had a non covered flood in our basement , car accident, dishwasher went out, new baby, medical expenses, etc. In order to pay all of this, we burned through our emergency fund, most of our savings, and I took out a personal loan. The flood was a big part of this. This is the current debt we have:

$270k left on our house, house is worth $380ish.
$18k personal loan.
No cc debt.

I would like to get rid of that personal loan through another cash out refinance. I feel like it is hindering us from really building up our savings again. I’m just not sure if that’s the best financial move to make.  We have a lot of equity, I just hate to lose it, but I feel like it would put us in a good spot for saving in case some more unexpected expenses come up. I also think I can get a better interest rate and lower our monthly mortgage payment. I would hope to get a rate lower than 4%. We have strong credit scores above 740.

They'll pay for everything including the title, tag, dealer, and etc. I had a call back with his manager which she was nice, she told me since my credit isn't in good shape, suggested to me that I get a loan of 10,000 (Forgot to add that I applied for 20,000 loan) and find a car around there.

But I'm hesitant about the car loan and having doubts about it and not fully understanding what I'm getting myself into.

In which there's a chance that I'll get ripped off of the high interest rate and if being late on the payment the rate will go higher. So now I'm on the fence about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically understanding the process that'll happen?

Do I pay the car ship dealer anything else once the loan people take care of everything?

and once the loan people pay for everything, I just drive the car home?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about asking cuz I have no one else to go to seek the knowledge. Everyone make all loans are bad, but I see it as it depends on who the person is dealing with. I know it also helps the credit but like I said I'm on the fence about it.",finance

personalfinance,Will taking out private loans lower the amount of my grants and federal loans?,"Say my estimated school cost is $23,000 and I qualify for $21,000 in grants and federal loans. I want to use my federal up and use the rest that I owe on private loans. From what I understand I can at least get the remaining $2,000 in private loans with no issue,but if I go over that then it becomes an issue. 

My problem comes in because I have all of these other bills to pay that aren't falling under the cost of education. I will be working through school, but I'm getting no financial help from anyone and I want to try to focus on my school as much as possible and I've thought about just adding to the private loan so I can cut back my required hours of work. When I'm looking at the loan it's making it sound like if I go over that $2,000 in private loans then FAFSA will consider that ""outside"" funds and lower what I qualify for with federal. Does anyone have any experience with this? Obviously I would rather use up my federal loans first, but I also need the ability to  focus on my school rather than work.",finance

- 38 Astronergy panels at 305 watts per panel which bring me right in below the 10k kWh allowable in tier 1 for our power company

personalfinance,Cash Out Mortgage ReFi Questions,"Hello, I've searched the sub but seen some mixed answers so I'm hoping to get some answers specific to my situation.

I bought my house for $235k about 3 years ago at 4.25%. I currently pay $1,450/month because of PMI because I only put 5% down.

Current market values seem to be hovering a little over $315k according to Redfin and Coldwell Banker. I'm not entirely convinced my house is worth that much, but it's certainly worth significantly more than it was when I bought it because it's in a desirable neighborhood in a fast-growing city/state. Plus I made a couple of small upgrades to the home (e.g. central AC) that should've increased the value on top of that.

I recently took a lower paying job and while I can live comfortably with about $1,000 of disposable income per month, I'd like to do more to lower my cost of living.

Interest rates are at about 3.5% for people with good credit (my score is about 750) so I'm thinking it might be a good time to refinance to 1) lower my interest rate, and 2) dump the equity back into my home.

I'm content staying in my home for at least another 5-10 years, if not longer. I also have about $40k in other debts (student loans + car + a small amount of credit card debt) so I'm not sure if it would be most financially wise to put the equity back into the house or do a cash-out refi and use the equity toward that so my only debt is a mortgage. Or is it possible to take $40k out for my debts and use whatever equity is remaining to put toward the remaining mortgage? Will this refi make my 2019 tax refund fluctuate? Should I budget for owing anything if I do this? I usually get ~$300 back per year.

personalfinance,$30k cc debt that I need to figure out,"Hi All,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I love following along in everyone's advise, I'm hoping I can get some myself.

After poor budgeting and living beyond my means for years, I need to get ahead of my $30k of cc debt. 

I've done a lot of work in budgeting and have been successful in living/spending very frugally. I feel as though I have a good handle on that ( thanks to advice I've found here!).

My question is in regards to managing my debt. Fact of the matter is there isn't enough time or money that I'm bringing in to start to really pay down the debt. I'm doing minimal payments plus a small amount here and there. My debt is across 2 credit cards, interest rates are 19.99% 

What are my best options to pay down this debt? My credit as you can imagine isn't good, balance transfer isn't an option. I've been declined for loans in the past, so I'm assuming consolidation wouldn't be approved either.

personalfinance,"Paying into my own new 529 plan, to spend on college within the next few years. Suggestions/advice about my strategy?","Hi there! I've just opened my own 529 plan, and I'm returning to college for the first time in a decade (the logistics are all in order on the FAFSA, taxes, and attendance front). I have a decent grasp of how everything involved works -- I *think* \-- but I wanted to summarize my plan here and ask you guys if I'm doing this thing right.

I have a Colorado Stable Value Plus plan for my 529 (it's a low-risk low-interest sort of thing since I plan to use the funds sooner rather than later) and I can afford to put in $30/month right now, which is obviously measly, but the other main reason I've opened the plan is to use it as a vehicle for donations. Obviously, the amount that may end up donated over the next few years is a variable outside my control and which I can't usefully predict, so my goal in posting here is to make sure I'm clear on The Rules of Everything and all the general principles/timing, rather than looking for projections about specific numbers.

Here's what I think I know/would like to be corrected on if I'm wrong, organized by gradual mutation into things that are altogether questions:

* Federal student loans I take out to go to school right now won't require payment until six months after I'm no longer a full-time student.
* Federal student loans I have from several years ago (trade school degree) will stop requiring payment while I'm a full-time student. I also *think* interest pauses accruing on those loans while I'm in school, but I'm not sure.
* It seems like the smart thing to do is to leave all funds in the 529 for as long as possible so the bits of interest can have time to do some growing, and to go ahead and take out loans while I'm in school, but then as soon as they come due, use the 529 funds to pay them down as much as I can at once. Is that right? Are there reasons I should be looking at using some funds sooner than later once they're there, to reduce total loan amounts? Are there other considerations or angles on this that I'm totally unaware of?
* I should note that I'm rebuilding my credit from a pretty crappy place (I'm just getting footholds now after several years of mixed homelessness/housing insecurity), and I know that I can use 529 funds to pay toward the old loans from my trade school degree without penalty -- so hypothetically, if I were to get some decent donations and become able to leave a good chunk in the account and still use some toward old student loans sooner than later, would that help improve my credit? Does that credit improvement apply if I do that while those loan repayments are paused due to being in school? Is there some certain size of dent I'd have to be able to make in the old loan balance, for it to be worth bothering?
* Also, if anyone understands the timing/payment mechanics for how scholarship awards work, I'd appreciate any insights anyone can offer. I've done a lot of independent research on this but haven't found any clear answers about what awards look like in application, in terms of how they impact loan amounts taken out in a given semester, or how they affect my order of operations for making sure schools get paid correctly. I've never been eligible for a bunch of scholarships before but suddenly I am, so I'm doing all I can to take advantage of them, but I have no idea what I'm doing and would love any insights.

I was doing the math and I could technically drain my short-term savings that is not really getting much interest and pay off the loans 3 months earlier than I was anticipating. Or do I wait and let the loans mature as expected, continue to make my monthly payments, and pay it off in August as I was planning? Does the few months difference make any differences for taxes? The loans have a 3.4% interest rate so I would only be saving like $20 if I do it early.

Other things of note:

\- I have a long-term savings that would not be touched and is enough to sustain my safety net if needed for a few months.  I have a full-time job that is very stable so there is no risk of losing my job (or at least that I know of)

\- I get an additional paycheck in August, which is why I was planning on paying it off then anyways. So my short-term savings would be replenished at that time.

personalfinance,Is Avalanche method the best way to pay off debts?,"I have a decent amount of debt, primarily from student loans, but also including some credit card debt and an auto loan. I've put them all into a spreadsheet and sorted them by interest rate. I did a balance transfer of my credit card debt to a card with a 15-month zero-interest period, and I'm paying it off during that time. Next I'll turn to my student loans with the highest interest rates (higher than my car interest rate). The avalanche method is widely reported as the best method to pay off debts and reduce total interest paid. I'm struggling a bit to understand it though, and would appreciate feedback. I'll compare two of my loans: one has a large balance with a low interest rate, and the other has a low balance with a high interest rate. Loan A is $17,114 with a 6.21% fixed interest rate. Loan B is $1,987 with an 11.5% interest rate. Now, the avalanche method would have me pay off Loan B first. However, when I look at the total interest paid if I only made minimum payments for the life of the loans, I'd pay a total of $5,097 interest for Loan A and only $1,519 in interest for Loan B. I'm struggling to understand why it's more efficient to pay off Loan B first. In other words, is there a third method of paying off loans (not avalanche or snowball), where you would first pay off the loans that end up costing you the most total interest over the life of the loan, based on the interaction of loan balance/interest rate. I'm sure I'm missing some simple, vital insight, but please throw me your two cents if you understand these things well! Thank you.

Keynesian economics worked great for the first generation who used it, however it has an expiry date, and that expiry date is rapidly approaching. In my country (Australia), our economy will almost definitely tank in the next 2 years, as our central bank has no choice but lower interest rates and therefore inflate our currency, or otherwise risk a housing market catastrophe. They are stuck in between a rock and a hard place, and I believe many other countries are as well.

cybersecurity,"Prevent someone from spoofing some ""fake"" HTML post request to a server","So I just came up with a project idea, where I already have an application that is used to calculate some optimal output given lots of different input parameters. The downside here is this optimization process takes several hours to days to find the optimal output.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have come up with a nice little idea having just learnt about back-end development where the application first looks up an on-server database and checks if the input parameters have been used before (with some being more common than others) and if so, what was the optimal output to return to the user. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem comes with ""saving"" optimized outputs to the database when a calculation has finished, what is to stop someone going to the server ""here are the input parameters I used, and here is some fake output"". Verifying that it is indeed the best optimal is an NP problem (along with finding it), so not something I can easily validate. Ideally, i'd have to validate the post is from the application (but not from some spoofed post from a user).

The only solution I can think of here is to try some (say 100 or so) various random input arrangements on receiving a post, and check if the given output is better than all those arrangements (but even here there is no guarantee).

Is there a way for him to have zero federal taxes taken out of his new paycheck and we can just pay them at tax time?  I have the max taken out of my checks so it ends up being a wash at tax time and we have more income to use on a monthly basis.",finance

* It's a new month for Wall Street, but so far it appears it will begin the same way the old one ended — with losses. The Dow has now fallen for six consecutive weeks for the first time in eight years, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have posted four straight weekly declines, as ongoing tariff tensions with China and now Mexico as well as U.S. economic uncertainty loom. (CNBC)
* Market drop in May felt serious, but it is normal for stocks (CNBC)
* The Dow's Friday close was its lowest since Jan. 29, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at their lowest since March 8. And although the Nasdaq is still up more than 12% for the year, it is moving closer to correction with a nearly 9% decline from its May 3 record closing high. (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) sees increased risks of escalations of U.S. trade disputeswith China and Mexico. There is now a 60% chance of the U.S. placing a new 10% tariff on the final $300 billion of Chinese imports. There is now a 70% chance of Trump imposing 5% duties on Mexican goods and a 50% chance that goes to 10%. (CNBC)
* US-China trade deal isn't likely at the G-20 summit this month, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley say (CNBC)
* Morgan Stanley sees global recession 'in three quarters' if Trump escalates trade war (CNBC)
* Top officials from the U.S. and Mexico are set to begin talks today over tariffs and border safety. ""Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border,"" the president tweeted. ""Problem is, they've been 'talking' for 25 years. We want action, not talk."" (AP)
* On the economic calendar, at 10 a.m. ET, both the May ISM manufacturing index and April construction spending are out. Some of the nation's automakers issue May sales today, although Ford (F) and GM (GM) only report on a quarterly basis. There are no major earnings this morning. Box (BOX) releases its quarterly number after today's closing bell.
* President Donald Trump arrived for his first state visit to Britain today. Cracks are starting to appear in the transatlantic relationship, with political analysts concerned that his ""off-the-cuff"" and ""impulsive"" leadership style could make matters worse over the coming days. (CNBC)
* Trump calls London Mayor Sadiq Khan a 'stone cold loser' (CNBC)
* Everything you need to know about Trump's state visit (CNBC)

* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the White House's Mideast peace plan is possibly ""unexecutable"" and might not ""gain traction,"" according to an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by The Washington Post.

The agency plans to order airlines to remove and replace the parts if their aircraft are affected. (CNBC)
* Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit is the subject of an upcoming antitrust probeby the Justice Department, according to multiple reports. The probe will focus on Google's search and other businesses. (CNBC)
* Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch the latest version of iOS, its software for the iPhone and iPad, today at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.The company has launched a new version of its iPhone software at WWDC every year since 2009, and analysts and reports don't expect this year to be any different. (CNBC)
* Facebook (FB) has been in contact with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about rolling out a digital currency, according to the Financial Times.
* SoftBank's bid to raise a $100 billion fund is off to a rocky start, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some of the world's biggest money managers plan to make limited or no contributions to the Japanese technology giant.
* Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is discussing an improved bid for French carmaker Renault, according to Reuters, in order to win backing from the French government for a deal.

personalfinance,Should I be paying my loans or investing?,"So I’m making more money than expected this early in my career (yay!), and I’d like to do something with the money. I’d love some advice from finance savvy people! 

I’ve increased my 401k contribution to 10% of my check.  Sadly I have no employer match.  I have both a Roth and traditional IRA.  I plan on maxing out my traditional this year since I’ll now be making too much to contribute to a Roth.  I have the fidelity robots invest for me and have my risk tolerance set to aggressive growth (I’m 28 years old).  I have an emergency fund all squared away so I’m not worried about that. 

Right now I’m throwing $3,000/month at my student loans.  I have federal loans at 5.5% fixed interest with about $130,000 left to pay.  I have no other debts. 

After all my 401k/IRA contributions and my student loan payments, I find I’m still saving some leftover money, which is just sitting in my checking account.  I’m just wondering whether it would be smarter to pay down my student loan even faster or is it wiser to keep the pace I have and invest instead.

I’m a total financial novice so any advice is welcome!",finance
personalfinance,Graduate Student Loan Advise,"Hi,

I'm moving to a new city to start a PhD program this fall. Luckily I'm funded and have been awarded a stipend so I won't need to consistently take out loans. However, to help pay for moving costs, first last and security, summer living expenses, etc. I want to take out a small student loan of around $5K.

Is it possible to do this through the federal government or do I have to go through a private bank? I haven't done my FASFA or anything like that since I've assumed that I'm not eligible for federal funding since my tuition will be $0 and the university will in fact be paying me.

Any advise would be great. Thanks!",finance
devops,Azure; everyone's third cloud choice. The future and value in learning it.,"A group of friends that float as also being current, former, and hopefully future colleagues have decided to pick a cloud and go down the cert track for fun and profit.  We are all sysadmins or engineers with about 15 year experience and all gradually moving into more devops methodologies.  I'm really not trying to let this fork into a certs vs experience holy war here.  Certs are just a good way to take a structured deep dive and we are using them as such.  I currently work in a 80% GCP / 20% AWS shop.  I have significant Azure experience from a previous job, though I know a lot has changed since then.  Despite it seeming to be everyone's third choice in cloud provider, I'm really thinking about taking my deep dive into Azure.  My reasons are below and I'd like some constructive feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

* (Personal).  I really like the direction MS is going under Nadella.  The focus on gaming in Azure and the gaming partnerships they are making with other companies.  The contributions and support of Open Source.  The general overall positive feelings and reviews of employees.  The innovative takes on tech overall they are trying to accomplish even if a lot of it is in its infancy.
* I have a lot of connections in Fed and State governments that are going Azure in full or at least in part.  The federal presence is growing steadily and with long term gov projects such as jedi it will continue to grow.
* As the rapidly growing underdog I feel like a strong demonstrable skill set in Azure could be very profitable and harder to find vs AWS.
* (Personal) GCP is a great cloud product, as are some Google home grown projects such as Kubernetes and Helm, but I do not like or trust Google as a company.
* AWS and to a lesser degree Google do not apparel to companies that see them as competition.  One of the main reasons my current place uses GCP is eCommerce companies not wanting to do business with AWS.  Simply put, one Microsoft sales line is accurate, ""We are not your competitor.  We are a tech company and just a tech company.""

&amp;#x200B;

I realize a good bit of that is personal, but I see a real potential in Azure adoption skyrocketing over the next year or two; especially in gov and eCommerce.  I would like some feedback anyone would like to offer.

personalfinance,First time purchasing car and in need of advice About loans!!,"a little background I’m 24 with a fair credit score 
In the 600-620 region. My mother several years ago put money down on a very used car for me and wanted me to pay off the rest. Long story shorts I did not have the finances at the time and the car was repossessed and taken to collections.

personalfinance,Quarterly taxes questions,"Hi,

I had to pay tax (as opposed to getting a refund) for the first time in my life last year. 

My federal tax owed was \~$3400. I got a \~$1600 refund from my state taxes.

It appears to me that I need to pay quarterly taxes since my tax owed was so high. Also, I am above the income threshold where the 110% requirement applies. 

I just want to verify that, by the time I file my 2019 taxes next year, I need to have paid 3400 \* 1.1 in taxes. Is that correct? My assumption is that the state taxes don't factor into this equation, but I want to verify.

investing,LYNAS - Rare earth mineral play,"So the company is LYNAS. Symbol LYSCF

**TL:DR I think LYSCF could be a 5 bagger!**

It's an Australian company that mines the raw ore in Australia, and ships the raw ore to Malaysia for processing into usable minerals. Lynas currently has plans to build a processing facility in Texas.

But the minerals would still come from Australia. They mine minerals from the Mt Weld in Austrailia

Lynas is the only company to produce rare earth minerals outside of china that I'm aware of. I've read the minerals are not really that rare, but the processing facilities to extract them from soil can take years to build, and create toxic waste. Probably why china likes to do it right?

Threats from China on rare earths are getting more common:

This could cause rare earth mineral prices to skyrocket outside of China, and lynas to profit.

The last time China cut off rare earth minerals to japan in 2011.. well i'll let lynas chart speak for itself.

I currently work as a host/busboy, and occasionally a dishwasher whenever the kitchen needs the help. (I can’t be a server, because I’m not 18 years old, and it’s a brewery) and I’ve kept nearly every check stub, and punchcard receipt for every time I’ve worked over the past few weeks, and I’ve taken it upon myself to manually calculate my next paycheck and see if they’re underpaying me. 

However, there are a few things I don’t really understand, mostly about federal and the state of Michigan withholding tax, minimum wages and how most of that works, and government websites don’t do a very good job of explaining it to someone whose never done taxes in their lifetime. 

Can anybody explain to me how the federal government and the state of Michigan withholds money from my paycheck, and what would be minimum wage for a non-tipped and tipped worker under 18 in the state of Michigan? I can’t seem to find info anywhere.

I'm a 45 yo single parent with a single income. I make about 45-50K a year in CA in a HCOL area (I wait tables). I purchased a condo for a great price in 2012 which has almost doubled in value. I have payed off all credit card debt, car is paid for, and I even made a lump-sum payment towards my mortgage so my mortgage insurance was canceled almost 3 years early. I have no debt except for my mortgage. Interest rate is 3.375%, about 21 years to go if I pay just the minimum. I do have an HOA fee of $274.00 that also covers water and trash. My credit score is excellent.

VERY late to the party as far as saving for retirement. I am currently saving 15% of pre-tax income in my 401K-about 22K invested in VFIAX. About 4K in a Roth IRA invested in VFORX. About 3K in a traditional IRA invested in BND. (I opened this account in order to lower my AGI).

My daughter will be a HS freshman this year, I have about 3K saved in a 529 (NY's 529, Vanguard Moderate Growth Portfolio) with intention to contribute $100.00 per month

My main concern right now is to build savings/pay off mortgage so I can retire at a reasonable age. My job is very physically and mentally draining and I dream every day of quitting but I have no other skills that would pay as much as I make now without 4 years of school.

My ""what should I do?"" questions going forward -

Pay off mortgage faster or put more money in retirement? Open taxable brokerage account to save money I would have put towards mortgage in hopes I get a better return? Sell home and move to a LCOL area in 5-10 years and have no mortgage payment but would have to start over? Go to school to try to get a better job to make more money (I'm a HS drop-out)? Rent my condo after kid moves out and live in an RV (seriously)? Try to buy investment property?

personalfinance,Refinance to payoff 401k loan?,"I am looking for some advice and I hope this fine group of people may have some input to help make me make a decision.

I am currently debating whether or not to refinance my current mortgage in order to consolidate some monthly expenses and hopefully improve cash flow.

My wife and I purchased our first home a little over 3 years ago. We decided it made the most sense at the time to borrow from my 401k for part of the down payment. Now a few years later, the interest rates are as low if not lower than they were when we bought the house but the value has increased by about $50000. Again my goal is to lower my overall monthly payment preferably in one monthly payment.

I am aware that adding time to the loan will add quite a bit of interest over the life of the loan. Presuming that we intend to stay in the home for another 10 years or so should this increase in interest factor into this decision? I have tried several refi calculators online, but none I’ve found allow for “2nd mortgages” (which the 401k loan is, in essence)

Current mortgage principle: $214,500 Interest Rate: 3.75% Fixed/30. Originated 3/2016 Estimated house value between $320,000-$345,000 Principle and interest Monthly payment: $1055.90

401k Loan Principle: $36000 401k loan interest rate 4.5% 10 year. All loan interest goes back into 401k retirement account with $25 per year fee. Bi-weekly payment: 238.98, averages to 517.79/ month.

My wife and I have no interest or desire to stay in this house long term. I bought it before we were married so she has no financial interest in it except her contribution to the overall budget. With falling interest rates, I've been considering refinancing, but it's hard to justify since my mortgage/HELOC rates are 3.375/4.0 respectively.

Considering that we plan to get into something better within 5-7 years, would it be reasonable or even smart to consider doing a 5/1 or 7/1 ARM due to their lower-than-conventional interest rates, and consolidate the mortgage and HELOC while also maintaining total monthly expenses (more impact on principal), assuming I can get at/below 3.375%?",finance

So long story short, I was a broke college student overseas and I have some credit card debt that is in collections/charge off. 
I pulled some credit reports to look at it. I've been paying off the smaller cards first but not touching or dealing with the larger debts. They're *just* credit card debt. I don't have any mortgages or bankruptcies or major defaults. My student loans are in good standing, etc.

I'm trying to get a federal job that requires a credit check, and the one major thing that might make me fail the credit check for the job is if I have a high delinquency amount.

I am thinking that if I establish a payment plan with these credit card companies (through a major bank actually) or the debt collectors that are managing the debt, I might be able to remove the delinquencies so long as I am making payments and have the companies report the payment arrangements to the 3 major credit bureaus ASAP.

I've just spoken with some non profit credit/debt educators over the phone but they ultimately said the reporting decision lies with the people who own or manage the debt (whether it's the bank/credit card company or it's the debt collectors).

So at my work, employees are required to put 1% into our 401(a), and the employer matches that 1%.  On top of that, we are able to voluntarily put up to 4% as well, and the employer matches partially up through that 4%.

Obviously, I contribute the maximum allowed percentage based to take full advantage of that.

What I'm wondering is how to calculate my additional contributions in the interests of reaching $19k.  As far as I can see, I can only do so through payroll deductions (aka not a lump sum, or more than 100% of my takehome pay for a given period - every 2 weeks).  

Should I be putting in $792 per paycheck (19k/24) or should I be doing less, aka $792 - the 5% I already contribute through payroll?  

Also - if I happen to over-contribute nearing the end of the year, will it just not go into the 401 and count as normal salary?  Are there any penalties for attempting to put too much in?  Would I then have to adjust that as salary goes up and/or federal limits (hopefully) rise?

This debt was all incurred from law school. I attended one of the best law schools in the United States, one of the top ten schools. On average, students leave making 160k, and even out of my gifted peers, I knew I could rise to the top. I dreamed my entire life of being accepted at the school and when I got my admission phone call, I cried under my desk at work. 


A week before law school started my boyfriend died in our apartment and I found him. I was a shell of a person. I went to ahead with school to avoid the pain and the shock. Binge drinking in law school is the norm, for me it became all consuming. I left law school with the dean's permission to go to inpatient to treat my drinking problem.

However, when I went back to law school to finish my education, any chances of landing a six figure job had went out the window.

I don't think they were poor choices at the time, and I'm proud of where I'm at today, but I need constructive advice on what to do with my paychecks and any savings. 

I spend about $1,500 in rent and utilities; $300 per month in doggy day care (my dog keeps me accountable in sobriety and I accredit a lot of my happiness to her presence so getting rid of her isn't an option); $500 per month in student loans (which is half of the interest that accrues each month because of the PAYE program); $200 per month in food; $200 per month in gas; I contribute 1% of my paycheck to my matched 401k; I'm 28 years old now.

I can scrape by some savings. Since starting my job in September last year, I've saved up $6,000. I don't know what I should be saving for? Should I contribute every last penny to my student loans? Should I save up for a down payment on a house mortgage? Are there are investing options? I just don't know what to do now.... this loan won't stop growing for the next 20 years and I'm lost.

Banking,Best Traveling Bank Products,"So the below is from my subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/Just\_Enjoy\_It/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Just_Enjoy_It/). But I talked about the banking products I am going to use during my travels so I thought I might share it with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you guys think there are better products out there for traveling please share!

Date: June 3rd, 2019

Days Left - 57 Days

Being in banking for such a long amount of time you understand the average person’s spending habits. One thing I have noticed was that a lot of my clients were spending money on international transaction fees when they shouldn’t be. Clients would come into the bank exchange US dollars for Euros, Yen, Pesos, all different types of currencies. First of all, when you do this you are paying the bank a fee. Second of all, I don’t find it that safe to be traveling overseas with a whole bunch of cash on you.

So I have decided to take the step forward in becoming an international traveler by getting my international credit card and checking account.

&amp;#x200B;

^(\*Disclaimer: I am not sponsored by Chase Bank of Charles Schwab Bank. I just think that these two products are highly advised for different reasons. However, if Chase Bank of Charles Schwab Bank want to do a partnership with me I am more than open to discussion.\*)

# THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT CARD

In my opinion, it is the **Chase Saphire Reserved Credit Card.** I have done a whole bunch of research and have asked many friends that have gone to travel internationally. The card gives many benefits.

**Benefits:**

* 50,000 bonus points if you spend $4000 in the first 3 months of account opening.
   * That’s $750 towards traveling using chase ultimate rewards.
* Get $300 in travel credit at the end of every year.
* 3 points for every dollar you spend on traveling &amp; dining
* 1 point on everything else.
* You get 50% more value when you redeem your points through the ultimate rewards.
* Receive $100 reimbursement for TSA precheck or Global Entry application.
* Complimentary airport lounge access
* No foreign transaction fees
* Luxury hotel &amp; resort collection
* Trip cancellation insurance
* Auto rental collision damage reimbursement
* Lost luggage reimbursement
* Trip delay reimbursement
* Purchase protection

**Here are the shitty parts:**

* $450 annual fee
* Interest rates are high (19.24% to 26.24%)
* No introductory 0% interest

Now even though there is an annual fee of $450 the card pretty much pays for itself with all of the other perks. Also, even though there isn't a 0% intro fee doesn't mean you can't open a balance transfer credit card that would let you transfer over the balance for 12-15 months at 0% APR. Maybe even loner.

# CHECKING ACCOUNT FOR TRAVELING

I have been in banking for a while and when I came across the **Charles Schwab High-Yield checking account** I was shocked. Here is what you get.

**Benefits:**

* Unlimited ATM transactions - no fee
* No monthly fee
* Free checks
* Physical Locations
* No minimum balances
* 0.40% APY
* $100 promo if referred

If I told anyone at my bank about this they would probably freak out because this is just unheard of.

**Disadvantage**

* Just the fact that you need to open a brokerage account. Which really is not that big of a deal.

I hope this gave you some valuable information. I got to go sign up for that credit card now.

Cheers!

I'm want to buy a house ideally within 2 years. As such, I want to pay off my student loan debt prior to buying a house, but I am fearful that it would drop my credit score below 760 due to my student loan being my oldest account. Would it make sense to pay off my student loans? If not, what would be the best course of action?",finance
investing,"FFR has been over IEOR for a hot second, balance sheet expansion incoming?","https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF

Went over in March, so they made a technical adjust and cut IOER which counterintuitively would lower FFR, it did but not to a level below IOER....

Is this should never happen and it suggest the fed is losing its ability to control the price of money, which is a no no. So i can see some kind of balance sheet expansion of some sort coming in the near future.

What does it mean that IOER &gt; FFR.

It means the US is creating a dollar liquidity shortage within its own domestic banks. Now previously we’ve been experiencing it globally but now rooster is coming home.

Also i don’t think it’s Powell’s fault, i think it had to do with private liquidity getting pumped into US bonds to fund our massive fucking deficit.

So how does it make us money, well ceteris paribus it creates a bull for the dollar and bearish for risk assets........But the fed ain’t going to allow this to run for too long IE lose control of the price of money, so funnily enough to indirectly fund our massive government deficits and not cause a bull run in the dollar (which hurts exports) it’ll have to inject liquidity somehow into the market, which....would cause a bearish dollar and bullish risk assets.

stocks,"Any options trader looking at FB, GOOGL and SPY?","First two antitrust and SPY starting to have a melt down. I personally think, based on TA, FB and GOOGL would possibly have a slight recovery but ultimately drop for the next couple days. Currently I see the price levels being oversold; though it can produce false signals. SPY would decline because trade deal isn't looking so good, esp. China becoming more aggressive. My speculation is IF another correction is due, I wouldn't expect SPY to drop further than 250; I would consider this level to be the maximum. I don't think the trade deal is big of an issue that's going to be the reason for greater correction (where people target SP500 to drop insane amount like 15%, 25%, even 40%). In economic standpoint, trade deal has the potential for massive drop, but I just don't see that the deal with China is gonna be SO BAD that it'll cause a massive selloff. If fed raise another rate, on top of this deal going completely shit (which it might) then that would ideally be it. I would appreciate any opinions and outlook. Thanks in advance!!!",finance

Anyway I’ve worked three jobs the past 2 months and I’ve yet to be paid. I’ve called thier payroll girl several times and only just got in contact with her yesterday. She fed me the BS excuse that they misspelled my town name But the zip was correct. According to my family it shouldn’t matter how they spelled the town cause the zip code is what the post office goes by. Now my dilemma is as follows,
1. My friend is looking for a new job but still is stuck there. Should I still go to the labor board?
2. This women said the checks were cut 2 weeks ago, is there anyway to see if the post office has a record of it?
3. The amount I’m supposed to be paid is 415, way too little for small claims court, should I be prepared to not get my money?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

dogecoin,The Biggest Scams In The Crypto History,"The cryptocurrency market is often compared to the Wild West. Digital gold, lawlessness, and unlimited Internet space attract not only honest people but also rascals. Today we will show you the loudest scam projects and cyber-attacks that seriously shattered the crypto society.

**PayCoin**

A mix of cloud mining and Ponzi scheme, which was promoted by *Geniuses at Work Corporation Miners (GAW)* in 2014. These guys make the first move by renting and selling virtual HashSet miners, which helped them form a loyal audience. Seeing that this project began to go down, the team decided to invent their own coin — *PayCoin*. People were promised a breakthrough technology, support from banks and other organizations, huge profits, free and fast transactions all around the world. As a result, the project started just awesome, which attracted the attention of a large number of miners and users. As you can guess all creators’ promises didn’t come true — Paycoin started to fall and users filed a lot of court complaint.

In the fall of 2018, the creator of PayCoin, *Joshua Garza*, was sentenced to 21 months in prison, obliging investors to pay damages of $9.2 million, although the total amount of financial investments was over $54 million.

**BitConnect**

Do you know how to tell that you’re participating in a scam? Just start with *“Wasa Wasa Wasup BitConnect”* as *Carlos Matos* did. BitConnect platform appeared in 2016 and immediately announced its intention to join the elite of the digital economy, bringing super-profits to all project participants without exception. The essence of the criminal scheme was simple: *“Invest and get 100% and more.”* The organizers promised investors an income of 365% per year! After the enormous excitement of the crypto market, the cost of the BitConnect token was equal to $463. This attracted the attention of reputable persons like *Mike Novogratz, Charlie Lee,* and *Vitalik Buterin*. For example, the creator of Litecoin — *Charlie Lee* — twitted the following:

&gt;*“From the surface, BitConnect seems like a classic Ponzi scheme. I wouldn’t invest in it and wouldn’t recommend anyone else to.”*

But even after such concerns, many people continued to invest in BitConnect. However, in early January 2018, the project unexpectedly turned down all of the activities and closed its platform. Investors were left with nothing. According to general estimates, the investors were deceived for more than $2.5 billion! In the summer of 2018, the head of Bitconnect India *Divyesh Darji* was arrested.

Beware that on July 1, 2019, a project Bitconnect 2.0 can be launched according to [the news posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bitconnect_2_0)by the same-named user.

**Ifan and Pincoin**

Start-ups *Ifan* and *Pincoin*, owned by the Vietnamese company *Modern Tech*, raised a whopping $660 million from approximately 32.000 people. The majority of the victims were the citizens of Vietnam. This scam project was labeled the *“largest exit scam in recent memory”* by *TechCrunch*.Project’s marketing strategy was so perfect that it was impossible to resist. So Ifan was promoted as *“the most advanced social network”* for celebrities and their fans. On the other side, Pincoin attracted investors with a promised investment return of 40% per month. The creators of Pincoin wrote about the development of an online platform covering an advertising network, a service for auctions, an investment portal, and P2P platform based on the blockchain.

But in fact both ICOs used a Ponzi scheme: users invested money, received their interest, brought friends and received additional interest. After some time, Modern Tech stopped paying out dividends in fiat and invited users to switch to their own tokens. As a result, they just made a fool of the investors.

This provoked massive rallies in front of the Modern Tech office, during which investors demanded a refund. But the scammers just escaped into the night with a $660 million jackpot.

**Mt.Gox**

In 2014 Mt.Gox exchange platform was one of the most popular resources for Bitcoin trading: it accounted for more than 70% of all transactions with BTC. A real tidbit, isn’t it?

Unfortunately, Mt.Gox was slowly turning into chaos. In the fall of 2013, US federal agents collected $5 million from the company’s bank account, since Mt.Gox was not registered as a financial intermediary. At the same time, Coinlab, the company’s former partner, filed a lawsuit against Mt.Gox, demanding $75 million. The lawsuit stated that Mt.Gox violated the terms of the agreement with Coinlab and continued to trade in the United States and Canada.

These problems led to failures with the platform. For example, American users waited for months to withdraw funds. In February 2014, Mt.Gox stopped the withdrawal of coins at all and the CEO of Mt.Gox — *Mark Karpeles* — refused to give any comments. Around the same time, an internal company document became available to the press explaining the reason for the failures — over the past several years around BTC 745,000 were stolen from the service. The total amount worth around $450 million at the time! What’s more, this was approximately 7% of all Bitcoin existing at the time.

&gt;*“Even the sloppiest of audits should have shown that something had gone wrong, that money was flowing out of Gox accounts.” — The Verge.*

Later the 200,000 stolen Bitcoins was found on an old wallet of the company. However, approximately 650,000 remain lost forever. According to Mt.Gox version, hackers used a bug in the transaction system that existed from the first day and quietly transferred small amounts of coins to their wallets. For sure the Mt. Gox case is the biggest crypto heist in history.No doubts, scam projects, and hack attacks will continue to emerge in a crypto world. Unfortunately, there is no universal remedy from them, but here are a few tips on **how to reduce the risks of being scammed**:

* Distribute your investments between different coins. Even if you prefer BTC only, try to keep some of your funds in altcoins, because BTC is the most attractive object for robbery.
* Get several different wallets for your crypto.
* Be careful! If you see some attractive conditions of a project when organizers promise a crazy profit and world domination — do not be lazy to study the information about the team, read the reviews, dive into what the project really represents and first of all — use your grey matter!

personalfinance,Looking to build credit but...,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking to build my credit score in the US. Although as an American, I have been largely living abroad (Canada). However, I will be starting med school in the US this Fall and would like to get a US-based credit card and build my credit. I knew that I didn't have any credit score in the US so I looked for a secured credit card. I applied for Capital One's. Last year I worked as an intern as an undergrad student in Canada so I had some income. I also used my parents' income since the document Capital One sent to me states that if I was above 21 I could use someone else's income as mine. I faxed in the required info (ID, SSN, income letter) but the application was declined. Now I am waiting to see what the reasons for rejection were (they said they'll send a letter). 

My questions are:

1. Should I wait a period of time to apply for another secured credit card? I am looking at the Discover card but worried if I would be rejected again. I read that multiple application within a short period of time would hurt my credit score / scare the lenders away.
2. How much income should I put on my next application? Could this be the reason for rejection? Should I aim low and put down the 22k USD I earned last year or should I include my parents' income which is much higher or should I use the Federal loan amount for my med school (\~40k)?

I really don't want to get denied again.

This attracted the attention of reputable persons like *Mike Novogratz, Charlie Lee,* and *Vitalik Buterin*. For example, the creator of Litecoin — *Charlie Lee* — twitted the following:

&gt;*“From the surface, BitConnect seems like a classic Ponzi scheme. I wouldn’t invest in it and wouldn’t recommend anyone else to.”*

But even after such concerns, many people continued to invest in BitConnect. However, in early January 2018, the project unexpectedly turned down all of the activities and closed its platform. Investors were left with nothing. According to general estimates, the investors were deceived for more than $2.5 billion! In the summer of 2018, the head of Bitconnect India *Divyesh Darji* was arrested.

Beware that on July 1, 2019, a project Bitconnect 2.0 can be launched according to [the news posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bitconnect_2_0)by the same-named user.

**Ifan and Pincoin**

Start-ups *Ifan* and *Pincoin*, owned by the Vietnamese company *Modern Tech*, raised a whopping $660 million from approximately 32.000 people. The majority of the victims were the citizens of Vietnam. This scam project was labeled the *“largest exit scam in recent memory”* by *TechCrunch*.Project’s marketing strategy was so perfect that it was impossible to resist. So Ifan was promoted as *“the most advanced social network”* for celebrities and their fans. On the other side, Pincoin attracted investors with a promised investment return of 40% per month. The creators of Pincoin wrote about the development of an online platform covering an advertising network, a service for auctions, an investment portal, and P2P platform based on the blockchain.

But in fact both ICOs used a Ponzi scheme: users invested money, received their interest, brought friends and received additional interest. After some time, Modern Tech stopped paying out dividends in fiat and invited users to switch to their own tokens. As a result, they just made a fool of the investors.

This provoked massive rallies in front of the Modern Tech office, during which investors demanded a refund. But the scammers just escaped into the night with a $660 million jackpot.

**Mt.Gox**

In 2014 Mt.Gox exchange platform was one of the most popular resources for Bitcoin trading: it accounted for more than 70% of all transactions with BTC. A real tidbit, isn’t it?

Unfortunately, Mt.Gox was slowly turning into chaos. In the fall of 2013, US federal agents collected $5 million from the company’s bank account, since Mt.Gox was not registered as a financial intermediary. At the same time, Coinlab, the company’s former partner, filed a lawsuit against Mt.Gox, demanding $75 million. The lawsuit stated that Mt.Gox violated the terms of the agreement with Coinlab and continued to trade in the United States and Canada.

These problems led to failures with the platform. For example, American users waited for months to withdraw funds. In February 2014, Mt.Gox stopped the withdrawal of coins at all and the CEO of Mt.Gox — *Mark Karpeles* — refused to give any comments. Around the same time, an internal company document became available to the press explaining the reason for the failures — over the past several years around BTC 745,000 were stolen from the service. The total amount worth around $450 million at the time! What’s more, this was approximately 7% of all Bitcoin existing at the time.

&gt;*“Even the sloppiest of audits should have shown that something had gone wrong, that money was flowing out of Gox accounts.” — The Verge.*

Later the 200,000 stolen Bitcoins was found on an old wallet of the company. However, approximately 650,000 remain lost forever. According to Mt.Gox version, hackers used a bug in the transaction system that existed from the first day and quietly transferred small amounts of coins to their wallets. For sure the Mt. Gox case is the biggest crypto heist in history.No doubts, scam projects, and hack attacks will continue to emerge in a crypto world. Unfortunately, there is no universal remedy from them, but here are a few tips on **how to reduce the risks of being scammed**:

* Distribute your investments between different coins. Even if you prefer BTC only, try to keep some of your funds in altcoins, because BTC is the most attractive object for robbery.
* Get several different wallets for your crypto.
* Be careful! If you see some attractive conditions of a project when organizers promise a crazy profit and world domination — do not be lazy to study the information about the team, read the reviews, dive into what the project really represents and first of all — use your grey matter!

personalfinance,Cash out refinance to finish repairs? New homeowner.,"Long story short; a tree fell on our home last year during a tornado. After paying a public adjuster, we took home ~$80K from insurance for the repairs. Gave the work to my father-in-law (FIL) who took all of our insurance money, did some work but left us with ~$15K left of work remaining and ~$3K in credit card debt. I also owe a few grand in taxes this year. 

My FIL ghosted us so I'm not expecting him to come through anymore. Needless to say, I'm in a hole and currently living damn near paycheck to paycheck (depleted most of our savings trying to pay all the contractors that were not getting paid by my FIL). I have no idea what he did with this insurance money but I feel like a sucker for trusting him. 

Question is, is a cash out refinancing my best option to get out of this situation? Some more facts: we purchased our home two years ago for $210K. Currently owe $197K, and paying PMI with an interest rate of 3.6. We haven't had the house appraised yet but with a new roof, all new windows, new siding, a new deck and raised ceiling inside, I think we could ask for ~$300K on the market. 

Hoping someone out there much more fiscaly intelligent than myself can offer some guidance. Thanks in advance.",finance
retirement,"Pleasant surprise, pleasant surprise indeed.","I hired on as a full time employee at my present employer when I was 65. Did not pay much attention to some benefit options as they were either of no use or had no appeal to me. The 401 K was default enrollment which was fine figured with me, figured I would save a tad on taxes. 
   Fast forward, the company is having hard, hard, times. Multiple lay-off's already, evidently more to come. To be honest the main  reason I believe that I am still employed is my age. The company seems to be tip-toeing around getting rid of so-called ""protected class"" employees.. Minorities, woman, handicapped, and the elderly ( like ME ). In an attempt to do my due diligence, with some help from this and other subs, I have been able to detrimine what my unemployment benefit status will be as well as other information. The most pleasant surprise was that because of my age, there is NO vesting period for the 401K. I was fully vested on day one and will keep all corporate monies added to my account. I have NO idea if this is a federal and/or state law or if just a corporate policy. The company HR department was of NO help with this, they are horribly young and inexperienced and seemed overwhelmed with the layoffs and the specter of more terminations. Added to this HR's limited experience with elderly employees doubtful and understandable if  they have much experience with elderly front-line employees.. ( I am the only elderly front-line employee that I know of, all the other old are upper management mucky-mucks, that have different, so different, so hugely different compensation packages)
        So,bottom line to this saga, do your due diligence, work to find out benefit rules for yourself. HR's are meant for the company's good, which can  be either good or bad for individual employees. Good luck and long enjoyable retirements to you all.",finance

I thought basically that i would accrue the  2.30% interest on $5000 after the maturity period (four weeks) but apparently that isn't the case. I just got them for a ""discount"" initially and they say I earned $9.29 in interest over the four weeks. That isn't close to the 2.3% interest I was expecting. It even told me my yield % was 2.39%.

personalfinance,I think I’ve been overcharged on my auto loan for the last year. The numbers don’t seem to be adding up.,"As the title state, I’m suspicious that I’ve been overcharged for my auto loan for the past year. 

I want to be upfront and admit that I didn’t check to make sure my interest rate and loan amount came out to the amount per month I was told I would be charged, so that is fully on me for not digging into this when I got the car. Haven’t been great with my finances in the past, but I have made it a goal to work on that this year.

Now for the numbers.

My original loan was for $30.689.65 with an interest rate of 4.74% for 84 months. This is after tax/title/etc. The full amount financed.

Loan was started in June 2018, and the last payment is supposed to be May of 2025.

I bought the car through a major brand dealership, and financed through a local credit union.

Currently my monthly payment is $448.69.

This is where I start getting suspicious. I used the auto loan calculator on [CalculateStuff.com](www.calculatestuff.com) and entered all the above information, this come out to about $430 a month. I cross checked this with pretty much every other auto loan calculator I could find and they all are the same within about a dollar. 

I upped the interest rate until I found something that matched was I was actually paying per month, that came out to an interest rate of 6.025%, significantly higher that 4.74%.

My question at this point is 
A. Am I being ripped off and paying a higher interest rate than stated on my account?
Or B. Am I missing some part of this system and this number actually checks out?

solar,8.19kW Tesla solar in Western MA,"I was hoping to get your take on my recent proposal from Tesla for a rooftop solar installation:

&amp;#x200B;

8.19kW

Estimated 7,550 kWh in first year's production

60% estimated energy offset

Average electric bill $236/mo. currently without solar

&amp;#x200B;

Solar Power System: $23,342

Other incentives/rebates -$6,357 (Projected Mass SMART program payments to me + $1000 state tax credit)

Federal Tax Credit: -$7,002

""Net system cost"": $9,982

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla breaks it down by month:

Current bill: $236

New electric bill with solar: $100

Monthly payment to Tesla: $122

Total monthly payments: $222

&amp;#x200B;

Interest rate 5.99% over 20 years

&amp;#x200B;

MA SMART Program calculations:

$0.263/kW generated x estimated 7,550 kWh generated in first year = $1,988.37 paid to me by electric company via check

&amp;#x200B;

This seems too good to be true. I read that my state has the best solar program at the moment in the entire country, but this looks to equate to essentially free energy (and paying for almost the entire system over time) with all the incentives and the value added to the property. Is my understanding correct?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Tesla says they'll be using Hanwha Q Cell 315 panels, ""black on black"". I read that these are pretty decent.

btc,The Biggest Scams In The Crypto History,"The cryptocurrency market is often compared to the Wild West. Digital gold, lawlessness, and unlimited Internet space attract not only honest people but also rascals. Today we will show you the loudest scam projects and cyber-attacks that seriously shattered the crypto society.

**PayCoin**

A mix of cloud mining and Ponzi scheme, which was promoted by *Geniuses at Work Corporation Miners (GAW)* in 2014. These guys make the first move by renting and selling virtual HashSet miners, which helped them form a loyal audience. Seeing that this project began to go down, the team decided to invent their own coin — *PayCoin*. People were promised a breakthrough technology, support from banks and other organizations, huge profits, free and fast transactions all around the world. As a result, the project started just awesome, which attracted the attention of a large number of miners and users. As you can guess all creators’ promises didn’t come true — Paycoin started to fall and users filed a lot of court complaint.

In the fall of 2018, the creator of PayCoin, *Joshua Garza*, was sentenced to 21 months in prison, obliging investors to pay damages of $9.2 million, although the total amount of financial investments was over $54 million.

**BitConnect**

Do you know how to tell that you’re participating in a scam? Just start with *“Wasa Wasa Wasup BitConnect”* as *Carlos Matos* did. BitConnect platform appeared in 2016 and immediately announced its intention to join the elite of the digital economy, bringing super-profits to all project participants without exception. The essence of the criminal scheme was simple: *“Invest and get 100% and more.”* The organizers promised investors an income of 365% per year! After the enormous excitement of the crypto market, the cost of the BitConnect token was equal to $463.

Medium: Discover online bank. Good interest rates. Friendly and somewhat informed customer service. Decent hold times. Bill pay. Does what its supposed to do. App functions well, user friendly, informed US based agents, etc. No hiccups. Management available upon request. Good, solid and user friendly.

Worst: Simple Online Bank. The positive: they are true to their ads that suggest the bank is for those who are TRYING to save for a ""bicycle"" or ""vacation"". Trying to get funds into the account is difficult.  Bank to bank xfers, and mobile check deposits do not work and are crash-y. Just bad technology all around. They win on having the longest deposit hold times of any bank. They advertise 9 biz days (lol!) but don't count on it.

For reference, home price range for mortgage would be around $275,000 while rents in the area range from $1500-1800/mo. It looks like real estate is appreciating at about 3% annually in the area, and we plan to stay for a long time.",finance

personalfinance,[US] Not sure what to do with this card now,"Obligatory first-time poster, long-time reader. If this is more appropriate for another sub please just let me know!

To make a long story short, I opened up an AAdvantage Mastercard about 5 years ago because I thought it would be a great way to get ""miles"" (I was young and reckless). I ended up falling into the CC trap and spent beyond my means, but am now close to finally paying it off. Along with paying off all charges in full and making additional payments of ~10% of my income I've also significantly reduced the interest rate on the card. They also continue to increase my limit almost every year.

Now that I've gotten my financial house in better order, I'm left looking at this card and not confident about what to do with it at this point. Some stats:

* **Limit**: $28,000
* **Statement Balance**: $2,880
* **Account Age**: 5 years
* **Interest Rate**: 9.5%
* **AA Miles**: ~120,000

I don't do much personal traveling, much less on AA or Oneworld airlines which is why I'm trying to figure out what to do with this thing. The obvious choice would be to get a 'stronger' rewards card, but I also don't want to lose all the miles I've banked so far, on top of all the considerations about what card to choose.

The pros for keeping it are the high limit, age of account and the low rate I've finagled. 

Cons are the annual fee (which I managed to get waived, but not sure how much longer they'll keep doing that) and the miles that I'm not even sure are worth that much at this point. 

Should I just keep it open and keep trying to get the fee waived, while using another card for rewards? Should I close it altogether and find another way to keep the miles for down the line?

Any advice from folks who have been in a similar spot or could provide some direction is greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for reading

Edit to add: I understand miles don't disappear when the card is closed, but after 18 months no activity on my AAdvantage account. Aside from taking an actual AA or partner flight this seems like the next most-convenient way to keep the account active.",finance

I will be taking the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan with an addition of Federal Direct Grad PLUS. Tuition costs about 20k per semester, and the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan only grants me 10k max per semester, so I will need to take an additional 10k from the Federal Direct Grad PLUS.

1. Is it possible for me to receive the loans in installments if I pay by an installment plan to reduce the amount of interest that builds up? Or is this not how it works? If not, my only option is to receive the full amount at the beginning of the semester and pay the tuition off in one payment?

personalfinance,"Student Loan Hack, or Terrible Idea?","Hello! I'm new to participating in this sub, but am excited about all of the great info here as I venture into the world of taking on significant debt!

I'm starting law school this fall and will be financing nearly all of it with loans. Depending on things like summer jobs and scholarship increases, I could be looking at up to $150k in total amount borrowed over three years (all fed loans), after which an additional ~$25k of interest will capitalize. **My question: Is it reasonable to consider a combination of 0% apr intro rate credit cards to soften the amount of interest that will capitalize on my fed loans?**

**I'm envisioning something like this:** A significant portion of that $150k total debt will be expenses that can potentially be paid with a credit card (general living expenses, school supplies, maybe even tuition payments, and if I'm really lucky rent). Federal loans will start to accrue interest as soon as they are disbursed, so there should be some savings if I can put off the disbursement of those loans. 

The federal loans are offered as a yearly amount; meaning I have to accept the awarded amount during the given academic year, or lose it. The typical scenario would be $25k disbursed in August for the fall semester, then another $25k in January for the spring semester. So by the end of my first year (May), that first $25k will have been accruing interest at ~7% for 10 months, and the second $25K for 5 months. 

If I could magically cover all these costs with zero interest credit cards, then I would wait until May of my second semester to disburse the full $50k in federal loans, which I would then use to pay off the credit cards before any interest is charged. In real life, I won’t be able to cover all the costs with the credit cards, but I have to imagine I could cover at least a portion significant enough where this could be worth it.

**Potential issues**

-I’m an older law student and have a decently long credit history and a very strong credit score. I feel financially disciplined enough where I’m not worried about allowing my spending getting out of hand or using the cards to live beyond my means. But I do know that credit cards are completely unforgiving, especially in comparison the fed loans.

-I’d be opening multiple new cards, and would likely have a ridiculously high credit utilization for a year or so. How hard would this hit my credit score?

-Are there even enough offers out there with 0% intro APR that this is possible? Is it worth considering transferring balances to new cards (with balance transfer intro specials) after the intro periods run out to take this beyond just my first year of borrowing?

-I will need my debt, by the end of each academic year, to be consolidated into fed loans, as I want to option of PAYE and PLSF, and all of the other benefits when I graduate.

**Is there anything I am missing here? Or is this actually something I should continue to look into?**

My next steps would be breaking down the actual numbers as best as I can estimate them to try and get an idea of potential savings. If you’ve made it this far and have some thoughts to add, thank you so much, this is probably the only place I can get some honest feedback on this.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] How to train for obtaining contextualized word embeddings,"I am a little confused about how the actual training of models like ELMo and BERT can be achieved. In ELMo, the model predicts a representation of a word given its backward and forward context, while in BERT the encoder of the transformer model uses the attention mechanism over other words in the input to determine the representation for the masked word(s). In both models the representation is fed to a softmax layer over the vocabulary, correct? So say we have the two sentences ""the bank of the river"" and ""the central bank of Germany"". The word ""bank"" should get different representations in the sentences because of the different contexts. However, if this representation is sent to the softmax layer, both would like the output to have the highest probability for the index of the word ""bank"" in the vocabulary. How is this achieved if the two representations are different? How can we condition to learn to create different contextual representation if we, in the end, still want to end up with the same word in the vocabulary from the softmax output? Should this not result in all representations being conditioned on the same thing regardless of context, i.e. the softmax output having the highest probability for the true target word?",technology

personalfinance,"There’s no such thing as a “1099 employee.” If your employer controls where and how you work and how you get paid, you’re probably a W-2 employee and NOT an independent contractor.","I see quite a few threads on this sub asking about taxes and pay as an “independent contractor” or “1099 employee” where the OP goes on to say they have a set schedule, set work assignments, and get paid at regular intervals. This IS NOT what an independent contractor is, and there’s a good chance the worker in question is being misclassified as a contractor when they’re in fact an employee.

Employers misclassify employees as contractors in order to avoid paying payroll taxes like unemployment insurance premiums and the employer’s share of FICA (Social Security and Medicare) withholdings. The misclassified workers also don’t get the protection of worker’s compensation or other employment laws. It’s a rampant problem (especially in recent years), and any “independent contractor” should take a careful look at their business relationship.

There are laws in most states that distinguish a true contractor from an employee, and the IRS has its own set of standards (see [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee)). In a nutshell, being a contractor or employee comes down to how much control the business paying you has over your work and finances.

* If the business you’re working for can tell you when, where, and how to work or has set methods/procedures, you’re probably NOT an independent contractor.
* If your job performance is measured against the business’s standards, you’re probably NOT an independent contractor.
* If the business you’re working for reimburses your expenses, gives you tools/equipment and materials to do your work, or pays you by the hour, week, month, etc., you’re probably NOT an independent contractor.
* If you only work for one company, provide services to them full-time, and do so continuously (i.e. not project-based work), you’re probably NOT an independent contractor.
* If you can quit or be fired at any time without cause/notice or financial repercussions (i.e. working at-will), you’re probably NOT an independent contractor.

If you think you might actually be an employee based on factors like these, but are getting a 1099-MISC instead of a W-2 and are being treated as a “contractor,” **Please Report It** to your state’s revenue agency, unemployment agency, and/or labor department. You can also file Form SS-8 with the IRS, but the IRS is very underfunded/understaffed right now, so you may want to reach out to your state’s agencies first. Your state can probably do an audit and then refer the findings to the IRS on its own.

Worker misclassification is a HUGE problem that needs more attention. Businesses might save on payroll taxes by passing off employees as “contractors,” but the misclassified worker gets all of the tax liability and none of the protections.

tl;dr – Employees get misclassified as “independent contractors” all the time. Know the factors and report it if you think something’s amiss.",finance

personalfinance,First-time home-buyer in Hawai'i: Sooner or Later?,"Using a throwaway for privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi friendly folks, I was hoping you might be able to help with a home buying budgeting/timing conundrum my wife and I have found ourselves in.

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve been living in Hawai’i for a few years now, and earlier this year I was promoted (hooray!) to a position in the city. Right now we are renting a house on a less populated part of the island, as I was working on the opposite side of the coast last year. Right now, we’re both commuting 40-60 minutes by car to get to work (she works about fifteen minutes from me). We were thinking about trying to buy a place closer to the city with her parents who are also trying to buy their first home (mutli-generational homes are more common here because of the cost of land), but the home search has revealed a disparity in what the four of us each want in a home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that my wife and I are exploring what buying a home would look like for the two of us, I need some help figuring out what timing would be the smartest, given that it would roughly come down to a choice between suffering a rough commute for several more years and watching housing prices go up or suffering a PMI payment for several years.

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers are as follows:

Kids: None yet, 1-2 likely in the next 5 years

Income: $12.5k/month, all together

Debt: $250/month for a little under 3 more years); 2nd car fully owned

Savings: $64k cash, $11k in her 401k, $10k in mine

Best estimate of a desirable single family in 2019: $730k (yes housing prices are nuts here)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the above, I’m estimating that we can get to a 10% down-payment ($73k) within a year. Right now, the interest rates look to be around 3.5% for less than a 20% down, and most PMI calculators I’ve used have the monthly payment at $209-275 per month (around 0.3% of home cost divided monthly).

I’m looking at a 30 year fixed, Conventional for the sake of this exploration (feel free to let me know if I should be looking into something else.

I threw this info into NerdWallet, and it gave me the following monthly payment after closing costs, homeowners insurance, mortgage, PMI, and taxes = $4,015

&amp;#x200B;

This looks like it’s doable, but I’m still nervous about taking on a PMI after reading through this sub.

For comparison, I found an article in our local news that said house prices rose 3% last year (I realize this is NOT going to be fully accurate going forward, but it’s the best guess right now for the sake of the argument). Extrapolating that, along with how long it would take us to get to a 20% down-payment, I came up with this intersection:

It will take \~5 years for us to make up the now $167k down-payment ($730k x 1.03 each year for five years = $834k, 20% of which is $167k)

So if housing prices rise at 3% while we save up for 20% of a desirable house, then we throw THOSE numbers into NerdWallet, we get the following monthly payment (after insurances, costs, taxes): $4,029

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Should we pay $4,015/m within a year or (maybe, possibly, who knows?) $4,029/m in 5 years?

Am I missing something? What do you guys think of these guesses? Is there a better way to try and make this decision? Should we just suffer through the commute, wait, and then move in with her parents to avoid making this decision (mostly joking… mostly)?

personalfinance,"If you're already deep in student debt, is law school the right move?","Asking for someone who isn't me. It's about general advice about whether to go to law school or not.

They graduated from undergrad college 65k in total debt (5k credit cards, 60k student debt) from undergrad.

They used to work for a paralegal job and had accumulated about 5k in savings. They then quit their job to prep for law school. They used up all their savings on law school applications and living expenses.

They now have $30 in savings. They have $5 in their debit account. Still 65k in debt. Their only source of disposable income is the 5k that they can borrow further on credit cards.

Now they work part-time for a lower paying job and have just enough to pay for food and their bills (e.g., debt payments). They have already put down a deposit at a law school.

The average amount of net tuition they will pay is about 170k to 180k at law school. However, this could be greatly diminished if they perform well (e.g., top 40% or better in the class). It is unclear whether they will accomplish this in the more competitive field with other law school students. The law schools are low tier.

I know they definitely want to be a lawyer and the paralegal position gave them a good sense of what it entails, and they want to help people via law. They showed very strong aptitude as a paralegal. I think they also view a job as a lawyer as a way out of debt. I'm just worried that even after becoming a lawyer their salary won't be high enough to escape the debt cycle (i.e., payments on bills will be too high). And their hope of being able to move past their debts will never come to fruition. Although in their perspective, it's just another bill to pay and they can just do income-based debt payments (i.e., they don't have to pay more on their debt until they are making more).

Edit: The undergrad loans are private, the law school loans are all federal.

tl;dr: If you're deep in student debt, how do you determine if you should still go to law school? Or if you should just try to make the best without higher education?",finance

personalfinance,How do I amend my taxes?,"Hello people of r/personalfinance and thanks in advance for reading my post! I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while but this is my first actual post. I’m making this post because I need advice on amending my federal and possibly state taxes for 2018. I filed my taxes in February of this year and I received my refund between 2 weeks to a month after that. 

The problem is, at the time my parents told me to file as a dependent since I live at home and don’t currently pay any bills. For context, I’m 23 and I make roughly 50k per year at the moment. I’ve been paying off my student loans and I’m almost finished at this point but my parents let me know that they realized I should have filed as independent when they filed their taxes due to my individual income. 

Now that I’ve gotten all of that out of the way, can anyone give me advice on how exactly I go about filing an amendment for my most recent tax return? The only thing I need to change is switching from a dependent individual to a dependent individual. I missed out on some refund money for the student loan interest I paid in 2018 due to my dependent status when I filed my loans. Will I now get this money when I amend my taxes or is that gone already?

personalfinance,Paying off elderly father's Credit Card debt?,"My elderly father (62) has accrued a fairly substantial amount of credit card debt (\~$35,000). I just got involved in his finances a few weeks ago, he's given me Power of Attorney, and I'm trying to figure out the best way we should go about to take care of this debt (because I hate debt and it's costing him $100s each month in interest).

&amp;#x200B;

• He has roughly $170,000 in assets spread across bank and investment accounts (not counting house &amp; car)

• Income from Navy retirement and Soc Security is around $3000/month (SS is supposed to kick in this month)

• Mortgage is $98000 with a $1300 payment each month (at a 3.75% interest rate)  
• House is worth about $200,000 (at least according to zillow, no idea how reliable that is)

• CC debt is $35000 (APR 13.49%)

• Health Insurance is $750/month (this too I'd like to reduce, but not sure how it would affect his prescription costs each month, he has a heart condition and has had a stroke and doesn't take care of himself as well as he should)

• Utilities, memberships, prescription pills, and other regular costs in excess of about $500/month

&amp;#x200B;

When I got involved, he had been in the process of getting a HELOC in order to pay off the CC debt, which, in my mind, is definitely not what he wants to do and just compounds the problem, since it puts the house on the line for the CC debt now. However, I'm not quite sure what next steps we should take to pay off all that CC debt.

We're still considering a HELOAN or a refinance, but even these I'm not sure about, since they're similar to the HELOC in that they're just transferring the CC debt to the house BUT the interest rate wouldn't be nearly as high. Also, I doubt he'd be able to get nearly as good an interest rate on a refi as what he already has now.

He could also just pull money from the investment accounts and pay off all the CC debt and the mortgage in one fell swoop (leaving about $40,000 left for his retirement, which doesn't seem good either), but apart from the Navy retirement and SS, that's all the money he'd have. I'm just worried if we pay off the house and CC debt like that, that wouldn't leave anything for any potential medical costs down the road that likely will come up.

personalfinance,Where to put excess money - paying off loans vs investing,"I'm really just looking to know if my math checks out on this. For the first time in our lives, my wife and I have substantial excess cash coming in every month. So we have to decide what to do with it now.

&amp;#x200B;

We've just got a house with a 4.25% interest rate,and our student loans fall around 2-4% last time I checked. That's all the debt we have.

&amp;#x200B;

So am I correct in saying that, if we have an extra $1000 per month, we should put it into something that returns more than, say, 5%, and we're better off than having paid down the house or student loans a little more? In other words, if we put money into the stock market, as long as we're getting at least 5% return on it, it was a better idea than putting the money towards the house, right? My math says yes, but it's hard to see that we're paying $450 in interest every month and not want to put the money to pay down the house principle.",finance
personalfinance,Best way to tackle existing debt?,"Hi guys, I’m hoping you all can chime in with your thoughts on how to best tackle me and my spouse’s debt. I think I’m on the right path but would appreciate any input. I recently refinanced 80k of private loans which were co-signed with my dad at a ridiculous interest rate of 10.5% to 5.87%, so that was a really great step in the right direction. Additionally, I have 73k in federal loans at an average interest rate of 5.11%, and those are on the REPAYE 20 year plan. My monthly minimum payment for the private loan is 600 a month, and my monthly minimum for the federal is only 90 a month. I have a car loan at 1.82% with 6.3k remaining, and after learning about the snowball method I have been putting an extra 250 a month (282 minimum payment) toward this which will have me pay it off by June of next year. I ran the numbers on this vs avalanche method and not too much of a difference because I’ll have finished the car relatively soon. 

Retirement wise, with a company that matches 100% of first 3, and 50% of second 3, I’m currently contributing 7800 a year (with company match) to it. I’m 30 years old and have about 11.3k currently saved for it, 6% going into pre-tax, and 3% into Roth 401k. My spouse contributes 3% to hers currently. I have no other debts such as credit card, etc. My current salary is 47k gross, with lots of growth potential as I’m in IT and on-track to finish a cert and considerably raise my income with a new position. I plan to really slam my private loans when I get more money to throw at them, but at the moment I can only afford the extra 250 I’ve been putting on my car. I have a spouse who’s current salary is 33k gross, with 65k in federal loans, also on the REPAYE plan, and with 3.3k remaining on a car loan which we plan on selling once it reaches the 2k price it is currently priced at (no other debt). After we sell her car we won’t get another one for a year or so, and when we do it’ll be used at 5-10k max. My credit is currently very good, at 770, her’s however we are building up with a secured credit card which she just received. 

At the end of the month after bills we have an extra 400 a month, however we are using that extra amount for saving for a small vacation and then alternate to putting it towards our debt each year. (I’m fine with this and realize it will prolong things, but it’s the way we want to do it and ultimately some will go towards debt, it’ll just be alternated with saving some for trips) My plan is to hopefully finish the private within 5 years, and then have us both save for the REPAYE tax bomb, as well as a house, and then contribute more towards retirement for us both. Emergency fund wise I have 2.5k, which I do plan on further padding when I can. Does the current path I’m going on seem pretty good? Is the plan to save for the tax bomb okay? I haven’t run the numbers on the math of paying it off earlier vs saving for the tax bomb, but with the other financial goals I have, paying any future extra amount I have towards it is not appealing and seems okay to me as they’re federal.",finance

personalfinance,Investment Vehicles While in Physician Residency,"I (27F) just graduated from medical school and will be entering anesthesiology residency for the next four years. I have an obscene amount of medical/undergrad loans (420k) that I recently consolidated into one loan. I’m doing REPAYE for the next four years and the plan to privately refinance to a lower interest rate upon graduating residency/fellowship.

Over the next four years, I will make 55k-65k/year and my fiancé (27F) should be pulling in 80-90k/year for a household income of 135k-155k. Upon completing residency and perhaps an extra year of fellowship, I should be pulling in 350-400k/year plus my fiancé’s salary, so our household income should be 400-500k/year. I plan to be ultra-aggressive upon residency completion and put ~150k/year towards loan repayment to have the whole thing paid off 5 years after residency. 

As you may know, under REPAYE, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover interest accrued, the government will subsidize half of that accrued interest. For instance, in my first year of REPAYE with $0/monthly payments (income is 0 based off no income as a medical student last year), I should accrue about $27,000 in interest of which the government will subsidize $13,500. 

With my and my fiancé’s income, I should be able to put another 5-10k/year over and beyond my REPAYE amount each of the next four years. I was told that paying more than your REPAYE amount, as any extraneous amount paid goes directly towards the interest, effectively cutting government subsidy. As an example, let’s say I accrue $10k interest next year and my REPAYE monthly payment is $0. If I don’t pay anything beyond REPAYE, the government would subsidize $5k. If however, I put an extra $2k towards repayement over and beyond REPAYE, that cuts my interest to $8k and cuts the government subsidy to $4k. 

Because Of this, my school’s financial advisor instead recommended that I save any extra amount I would pay beyond this and then make a lump sum payment upon graduating residency and before I refinance.

My question to you is what is the best way to save this extra 5-10k I can pay on top of my REPAYE amount over the next four years? Should I just put it into a savings account and let it sit? Invest somewhere else?",finance
personalfinance,[Question] Student Loans &amp; Apartment Hunting - How does this all affect my credit score?,"I'm going back to school (grad school - MBA) and I could use some guidance here.

I'm not entirely sure if these types of questions are allowed or encouraged here but I'm 24 and don't have any parents, I've just kind of been figuring this all out on my own and if this isn't the appropriate place I would very much appreciate it if someone might be able to steer me in the right direction. Thank you to anyone who happens to respond. I copied and pasted this from r/whatcarshouldibuy they suggested I might ask here.

Edit: My car payment is $400 a month and my credit is sitting around 530 due to some financial strains and failing to make a couple minimum payments on my credit card, but that is easily remedied over a few months of on-time payments, my score was about 600 around a month ago)",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off student loans early if employer offers monthly repayment?,"My employer offers a student loan repayment incentive that is added to my paycheck at $500 per month to a maximum of $70,000. When I started receiving the incentive in October of 2016 I had a total of 5 loans that totaled **$77,462.76**. I have paid off two of the smaller loans and will soon pay off another. I will be left with one variable interest rate loan currently at 9.74% interest with a balance of $19,216 that is expected to pay off 3/2030 if making minimum payments and one fixed rate loan at 4.66% interest with a balance of $39,770 that should be paid off 6/2026 with minimum payments. I am wondering if it is worth it to only make minimum payments on these remaining loans in order to receive the maximum pay out of $70,000 from my employer or attempt to pay them off sooner and cut my loses with the remaining incentive.

solar,How to get the 30% federal tax credit before it goes down to 26%,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a system designer for an installation company and I'd like some validation in my interpretation of the amendments made to the Federal Investment Tax credit for installing solar. According to section 5 - Five Percent Safe Harbor of this notice from the IRS,  Beginning of Construction for the Investment Tax Credit under Section 48,  [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-59.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-59.pdf) , it's my interpretation that one can put a 5% deposit down and that will meet the requirements for having started construction on the project. Section 3 says that there are two methods for establishing that construction has begun, one of them being the 5% safe harbor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning that, if a residential homeowner is to put a deposit down on December 31st, 2019, they'll qualify for the 30% federal tax credit when they file their taxes the following April.

&amp;#x200B;

The chart on page 3 shows that if construction begins before 1/1/2020, the homeowner will get 30%.

Section 3 says there are two ways to establish beginning of construction, a physical work test or ""meeting a safe harbor based on having paid or incurred five percent or more of the total cost of the energy property as set forth in section 5 of this notice.

Section 5 says that:

 "".01 In general. Construction of energy property will be considered as having begun if: 

(1) a taxpayer pays or incurs (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.461-1(a)(1) and (2)) five percent or more of the total cost of the energy property, 

**and** 

(2) thereafter, the taxpayer makes continuous efforts to advance towards completion of the energy property (as determined under section 6.02 of this notice).

&amp;#x200B;

The chart on page 3 also says that anything after 1/1/2022 will receive a 10% tax credit. It's my understanding that the residential tax credit will go down to 0% while the commercial credit will stay at 10%, making me think this could be for commercial and not residential. How can we know if this form is for residential or commercial?

&amp;#x200B;

Any tax professionals out there able to verify my interpretation of this amendment?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

personalfinance,"Currently $50,000+ in debt for a degree I never finished, is there any hope?","Right out of high school I made the very poor choice of going straight to a private university to work towards an engineering degree instead of getting my gen eds taken care of in community college. To make a long story a little shorter, I dropped out after a year and a half (two in the eyes of my lender) and no longer wanted anything to do with engineering (primarily due to the school). 


I have since gone and earned a technical degree and mediocre-to-decent paying office job. I would be well-equipped to pay off my debt quickly if I only had to worry about the degree I finished, but as it stands I’m looking at about a 67% debt-to-income ratio.


I am not opposed to finishing my engineering degree somewhere else (and possibly in a different discipline.) But, will I be able to consolidate any new loans with the ones I’ve already got in this case? The interest rates on both of my previous private loans are higher than my will to live and are the main reason for my insane DTI ratio. 


If I am completely wrong about how any of this works, don’t be gentle. I just want to be able to own a house some time before Mars is colonized.

personalfinance,Legal/tax implications of parents loaning $30k to a child?,"Hi PF, I have about $30K in credit card debt, and recently some of the cards changed the banks who own them and the rates have gone up. I have an offer from my parents to give me a loan to pay off the cards with a loan at a much more favorable rate. Here's the pertinent details:

Parents have the money sitting as cash (they confirmed with their finance person that it is available as cash). 

They intend to loan $30K with a fixed percentage of interest (not compounding), to be repaid within a set period of time. 

We probably will have them directly pay off the cards, not move the money to my account.

personalfinance,Trying to understand the stock market on a conceptual basis.,"With the help of a financial advisor, I feel comfortable with my investment/retirement portfolio.  Low fee investments, diversified, heavy in index funds, etc.  My questions are not because I want to start day trading, but because I genuinely want to be more educated as to how the stock market works.  I think I understand how a recession or interest rate announcement or merger/bankruptcy/earnings report can effect volume and stock prices.  But what I struggle with conceptually is what causes stock market fluctuation when there doesn’t appear to be a notable event. Is it primarily a factor of volume (supply and demand)?  Can it happen because of large institutional investors making big trades?  Can they manipulate the system (sell a significant number of shares in a company....see the price go down....and buy them back at the lower price).  Is that illegal?  When the market goes down for what I am calling these “ not notable events”, why does it seem like all stocks go down, even the strong growing companies?  Is it because these companies are part of mutual funds that get sold off?   In general,  do that many investors get on the bandwagon or panic when things start to move?  I thought a lot of the market was institutional investors vs individuals that would be more reactionary.

personalfinance,House or apartment? We need to move next year!,"Hello PF! 

I would like some advice/commentary on our current situation. 

My fiancé and I need to get our own place. We make 80k combined. We are getting married next year and are also paying for that wedding mostly on our own (not extravagant by any means). Currently, we live with his family (my folks are around, getting themselves back together financially so they aren’t an option) and while I can never say enough how appreciative I am to have stayed, ITS TIME TO MOVE ON. I don’t feel completely comfortable and at home because it’s not my own. He’s starting to feel it too, To me, your home is your sanctuary. 


Financially, we don’t have much debt. His credit cards are around 3k, mine are almost paid off. Student loans are less than 10k each. He owes 22k on his car, I don’t have one. I have one baddie on my report. Scores are 620ish. I have 15k in my 401k and the ability to take a loan and do a hardship withdrawal for a first home. He has about 5k. Savings is 1k each, hoping to add more now that card balances are getting lower. 


House wise, our max is 190k. That will get you a cute condo in an established area that needs cosmetic work. A nice one bedroom apartment will run you $1600. My thinking is, take a loan from my 401k and use it to help move into an apartment (coming with just our personal belongings), put a little to the wedding, and have extra cash on hand to add to what we are already saving. The interest rate is 6% and it comes out of each check over two years. He’s thinking, why not just put the whole loan on a down payment and not throw rent money away. I get it, I do. I’m just worried that the upfront costs might be too much for everything that we have on our plate. 


Also, please understand that it was my idea to use my 401k, not his, nor is he ok with it but at this point, time is ticking. We need to move on and I feel like us being here is not helping us really prioritize things. In a backwards way, I think if we got out, our habits would change with our new situation. We often find ourselves going out to dinner or hanging with friends, just to get out of the house. Surprisingly, we minimize spending during the work week. 

Second quarter of 2020 is the deadline to have either scenario rolling. I know, you’re thinking, just stay and save more. I REFUSE to come back to his parents house after we’re married. No honeymoon is fine, but I’m going to OUR place.

We’ve been together for 5 years, just engaged last summer. A combination of living freely money wise (I know, I know) and me helping my folks (which is coming to an end) is how we are in this position now. We are 100% in need of change and more concrete direction.

personalfinance,Friend's startup gig not going as planned. Need an exit strategy.,"(This is being written under a throwaway Reddit handle as others who know of my situation know my main handle)

&amp;#x200B;

So to give a bit of background, I was working as a remote customer service rep for an HR payroll services company out in California. It was a decent job for a few years, but management became stuffy and they increased in their micromanagement of employees. It was stifling enough that I had to leave. Around the time I was considering jumping ship, one of my friends from back in the day reached out to me with a grand opportunity to work for his cloud software company back East where I used to live.

The gig did indeed sound promising. I was told I'd be on the fast track towards a COO position in time, as well as starting off as a project manager. At the time, my job was paying roughly $65k, plus an insanely well featured benefits package. My friend said they couldn't quite match that base, considering they were more of a scrappy outfit, but they could offer $44k/yr for base with $1000 per client activation bonuses, which would have put me close to $62k/yr based on the numbers of new prospects they deal with in a year. I looked over their annual recurring revenue projections as well as their client base, to ensure everything was above board.

I took the offer after much debate and thought. I figured it would be OK to take a hit on my overall pay, as I was going into this expecting the bonus to be in the cards for awhile. Unfortunately, this is where trouble begins to surface for me. Shortly after I joined the new company, the business model had since changed to one where we no longer manage projects in-house and deal with consultants who sell our cloud offering on our behalf in exchange for their cut of the activation fee. Naturally, I was quite disappointed by this development, and had a chat with my boss a few months later. I suggested that we find a way to replace the bonus structure I formerly was under with something else to supplement the loss of the bonus. Unfortunately, my boss rebuffed this, stating I needed to ""provide more value to the organization before they could even consider a pay bump"" (which seems like a cop out excuse to me since I feel like I had provided great value up to that point). I threatened to leave if the situation didn't improve, but I was asked to stick around because they wanted to make it up to me after they raised their financial round. I ended up staying on board, despite my initial reservations.

In short, I'm still making $44k/yr over a year and a half later with absolutely no bonus opportunity, my workloads have increased in a trickle fashion, and I have not been offered a raise once... not even after my otherwise excellent performance review. I'm beginning to suspect I've been taken for a ride and I've decided it's time to leave this behind. I honestly feel like an idiot for not taking action sooner, as I've been struggling to make ends meet up to this point.

In short... how do I find a job quickly as possible, without coming off as desperate? I'm hoping to make a move within the next few weeks.

Additionally, is there a way I can end this without damaging my friendship I have with the co-owner? I'm considering the standard two weeks notice once I have something lined up, but he might take this news poorly if it means he no longer has a dependable resource he can count on. I'm afraid to ice things over and would like to assess my options here.

TL;DR: Joined a friend's company for a pay cut after buying into grandiose promises of fast track to C level management, only to find myself losing my bonus and working more than ever. Thinking of leaving for another opportunity in tech and need to do so fast without causing a rift in my friendship.",finance

Rimworld: The only consequence for doing things like, say, replacing a prisoner's legs with peg-legs for surgery practice, then harvesting their organs, then having your colonists eating their fresh corpse raw, is that your colonists become very upset. Only commit minor infrequent warcrimes like peg-legging and only harvesting a single lung/kidney before letting your prisoners stumble home, and you can get away with it so long as your colonists are entertained and well-fed. Make the most easily attachable part of your settlement(and therefor the part the raiders will go after) a long dimly lit corridor where they have bear the unthinkable stench and sight of their dead friends and families hung up by their entrails in a long winding tunnel that never goes anywhere, until they give into their insanity and turn on each other? If your colonists don't see it go down and don't have to look at the bodies, they don't care.

personalfinance,over 200K in federal student loans pray or pay?,"**Hello Reddit family,**

**I am sharing my student loan story with you all. Let me know if it makes sense.** 

**Step 1:** Determine the route to go...Pay as much as possible to get rid of it all or pray that the system doesn't lie about the 20-year and 25-year forgiveness?

1. **Pay:** I have read many places that say.....TACKLE THOSE LOANS...PAY THAT INTEREST!!! But here's the real. over 200k in debt as a single individual.
   1. 40 years of 249k at 5.76% = 1,328.61 a month and total interest paid of 388k on top... that's 40 years.
   2. 10 years= 2,734.50 a month
   3. Please tell me how on earth can I make those payments? 
   4. For those folks that got a total that you can hit the principle. GREAT FOR YOU! My interest right now per month is $1,172.42.  
2. **Pray** that they aren't lying about 20-25 year forgiveness (do not select graduated payments as they are not eligible for forgiveness)
   1. I have IBR (25-year forgiveness) and PAYE (20-year forgiveness) for all my loans. 
   2. The ones on IBR are small and I will hit those first in the principle paying nothing to the interest so all my loans will end at 20 years.
   3. I was told via the federal loan servicing agent that 0$ payments are qualifying payments under IBR and PAYE. So I will have 12 payments qualified under each after one year. Leaving 19 years of payments. If you have no job for many years. that means 0$ qualifying payments until you don't qualify for 0 $ anymore, but the 20-year clock started.
   4. Bring on the interest... I won't ever pay it and furthermore, I won't end up paying more than my IBR or PAYE requires. I know I have no chance in deleting these loans in less than the amount paid over 20 years on these programs. **(unless someone in finance can explain the math and strategy)**
   5. The pray method seems to be for you if... your income is low but your loans are high. 
      1. Ex: my threshold is 249k ... if under IBR/PAYE combined monthly payment is less than 1,037 (1,037\*12 months\*20 years) =248,880 total paid in that time, then I don't ever pay more to ""chip away at it"".  I advise you to call the fed advisors and have them run IBR calculations per different salaries.

**My plan:** I will be going 0$ for my first year based on last years taxes. I will recalculate when I need to recertify and have this year's income estimated. I will then calculate for 3- 4.5% raise each year and ask how IBR gets calculated. If it is directly proportional then I can expect to pay 3-4.5% more each month for a 12 month cycle. If the total I pay over 20 years is less than tackling the whole thing plus interest I will just pay the amount calculated never paying any more than I have to until 20 years is up and then LET THAT LOAN DISAPPEAR.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of my phone call, the agent was like "" but your interest accrues like crazy! you want to tackle that!"" to which I responded ""So the loan goes away but then the interest I will continue to pay."" to which the federal loan officer replied, ""no that disappears too"". to which I replied "" then why on earth would I worry about the interest if it will disappear too is there any chance this program will be canceled and my loan won't actually just disappear in 20-25 years?"" to which she replied "" you should pay it because otherwise it builds up and its a lot of money and no there is no chance this program will be canceled on people.""  At this point, I didn't want to sound foolish but... I know interest accrues like crazy.... but if I never can actually pay the loan off because of that and the loan disappears and the interest disappears with it... why pay the interest? I think she was just trying to get me to pay more just for the sake of the debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

**But seriously Reddit family:** why would I pay more? Is there any chance in hell that I just don't see how I can pay less and pay it all? I don't think that's possible. I think you can only end up paying less if you don't pay it all and have payments based on IBR/PAYE rather than based on the principle. 

**Unless:** your loans are low and IBR is so high you will pay it all off before 20 years then... go ahead and pay more because you will pay less in the long run and you pay the full amount regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Also:** the 10-year PSLF is failing people because there is the actual filing of paperwork and the difficulty of assuring nonprofit or 501 c3 status and all that jazz. There is not any special paperwork to file for IBR or PAYE your loans just must simply qualify. You just start the plan and the clock ticks. I don't think the same issues apply because there are no stipulations. You just qualify with your type of loan or you don't... then the clock ticks for 20 and...poof...gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question:** Am I missing something Reddit fam? Essentially, If I can't pay enough to pay it off entirely by 40 years out (unless I am missing math finance knowledge)... why would I dump all my money into it for 20 years...just to flush extra money when it disappears?

&amp;#x200B;

Please send your insight. If this helped someone better understand the federal loan servicing then great. Sound off below

personalfinance,Student Loan/PSLF Advice,"My fiance has roughly $90k in student loans and will be graduating in december with her master's in library and information science(required to be a librarian) and she's looking at a starting salary of around $35k(terrible for someone with a master's, I know). The interest rate on the loans ranges from 3-6.6% and averages around 5% which I believe results in around a $110k payoff under standard repayment. I'm currently making roughly $70k per year. The calculator on student loans.gov recommends PAYE or IBR along with PSLF for a $22k total payoff after 10 years. I assume we would have to file taxes separetly to do income based repayment.

Expenses 
Cars     $300 per month for gas/insurance, vehicles are old beaters that are paid for
Rent.    $1035 per month
Utilities $200 per month
Food/extra expenses $400 per month

All of her loans are unsubsidized/subsidized direct loans and should qualify for PSLF.

My question: Is PSLF the right option? I know that none of the current proposals have removed people already in PSLF but I'm wary based on the number of people that were rejected when the first set of people went thru it? If something happens while we were in the middle of PSLF I assume we would still be on the hook for any interest that accumulated, is that correct? Does anyone have any advice or recommendations on how to proceed? 

Thanks for everyone's help!",finance
personalfinance,Tax Question - Selling Mineral Rights,"Even though it's not tax season, I've have a couple questions I that hope the wonderful folks of Reddit can help me out with.

Background:

Through inheritance  my mother and I have come into a small amount of mineral rights that we are going to sell.  The minerals rights are in Oklahoma and we are not.  As part of the transaction, we'll be filling out w-9s with the buyer.   We will have owned these mineral rights for less than a year -- more like six or seven months.

Questions:

1) Is money form selling mineral rights considered income or capital gains?

2) My proceeds from selling the mineral rights is going to be less than $10,000.  As the mineral rights are in in OK, but I'm not... would I need to pay OK state income tax on this or I just report it as income in the state that I live in?

3) My mom's situation is a little trickier than mine.  She's currently in a dementia nursing home and I have Power of Attorney for her.  Her portion of the proceeds will be under $15,000, which will basically 'double' her net worth.  Given the cost of nursing homes, she'll be considered indigent before the end of 2019 and on state Medicaid.   Her sources of income are Social Security and a small annuity that both add up to be about $2,100 a month or $25,000 a year.  So this sale will bump her income up to about $40,000 and, I imagine she'll need to pay some state and federal tax... but by the time tax season roles around the nursing home costs will have consumed all of her funds -- save the ongoing SS/Annuity that trickles in each month.   As the person who will prepare her taxes, do I need to somehow set aside some money (which I don't know that I can do given the asset restrictions for Medicaid and  long-term care) or... is there a way/process when filing taxes to say:  She may owe $x, but she's totally broke.... so, can't pay?",finance

personalfinance,Negotiating an out of cycle Raise after doing it 1.5 years ago. Advice Request.,"Some background,  
Ive been at the same company for several(4) years and have received steady annual raises(\~7%), though I came in low. I have always received praise from my leadership and peers about my performance causing my responsibilities to grow.  


At the start of last year due to some information being released within the company it came to my attention that I was on the lower end of the compensation guidelines for my level at the time (mid-level). Considering I was constantly being told I was a top performer, this did not sit well.  


At this point I requested an additional raise (\~16%) out of cycle weeks after the annual raise took affect. I was granted this raise however it was split between then (January) and July.  


Fast forward to January of this year I was promoted again to a senior level, received a 2% merit and 5% promotion bump. My workload has increased tremendously and we are incredibly short staffed. I continue to receive praise/awards for my performance and feel undervalued. For example, a buddy of mine joined the company at the level below me, yet he makes 3k more than me doing the same role for another contract.  


So I have requested another out of cycle raise (\~16%), on initially bringing it up my leadership reiterated that I was doing fantastic and that they wanted to look into it. Now I have a meeting next week about how to justify so many increases in a 1.5 year span.   


If I leave, they would be in bad shape. I happen to like my work a lot and would prefer not to cause i work remote 100%.

Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"SO being moved from salary to hourly, question about taxes.","Hey folks,

So my SO is a teacher (small private school) and is being moved from salary (which she technically shouldn't have been due to her title) to hourly. They are going to increase her hourly rate so she still makes the same per year, but won't be paid out during the summer, on breaks, etc.

My question is about her employer-withholding for federal/state(NM) taxes:

Will the withholding be calculated on a perceived yearly pay (paycheck x 52) or on the known ""salary"" (ex: 40,000 gross income/#paychecks)? Is this dependent on the employer or can she select exactly how much to withhold (looking at her taxes from last year)?

I know that, keeping her actual yearly income the same, she would owe the same amount, but with going to a higher hourly/biweekly pay made me think about how taxes would be withheld.

We are trying to figure out how to budget for next year and it would be super helpful if a significant chunk of her check wasn't a loan to the government for a year.

personalfinance,Deciding between paying off 0% credit card debt or 12-13% Private Student Loans,"Hi everyone, I was running some numbers this morning and realized that my wife and I will not be able to deduct the full $2500 this year from our Student Loan interest and it got me thinking about my current financial situation. I am expecting a bonus this month of about $9000-$10000. My credit card debt is almost all at 0% right now save for about $1000. I was expecting to fully pay off one credit card and put the rest towards one of our high interest private student loans. I know the Prime Directive mentions paying down debts with interest rates above 10% first but do people count their 0% interest credit card debt in this because the potential interest is higher? Or in this case should I be putting more money towards the high interest student loans rather than more towards the credit cards?

personalfinance,Looking for advice for overwhelming debt,"Hello, 

My husband and I have gotten a little over our heads when it comes to debt and could really use some advice as we are feeling pretty disheartened and unsure what to do.

We have tried doing the Dave Ramsey approach since the beginning of this year where we first saved a $1K emergency fund and started paying off our debts lowest to highest where we have successfully paid off a few debts. However, we keep running into circumstances where we have to dip in to the $1K, replenish, and repeat. 

Here is our current financial situation: 
$3800 total take home pay
$2415 utilities + debt minimum payments
$700 gas + spending money (both my husband and I commute about one hour everyday so this mostly goes towards gas and anything leftover goes towards ANY wants including hobbies, eating out, clothes, etc.) 
$400 groceries + pet supplies + home supplies 
$285 savings/leftover 

What is killing us is that $1050 of the $2415 monthly bills are debt payments (not including our mortgage + escrow payment which is an extra $625.) 

Here is our current debt situation:
-18K credit card debt
-20K husbands student debt (20 year private loan set to mature in approximately 9 years) 
-10K my student debt (10 year federal loan currently paid ahead until August set to mature in approximately 8 years) 
-2K car (5 year loan that will be paid off in April with great rate under 2%) 
-80K house (30 year loan bought under rural development at 3.75% in 2017) 
Total $130K ($50 not including house) 

Here is some other factors/issues: 
-Have older farmhouse that needs tons of repairs/remodeling in the near future 
-I am driving a 20 year old car with almost 200K miles on it and no air in bad condition
-We really would like to start a family in the next few years as my husband is in his 30s and I am in my late 20s 

I just wish we could just erase our credit card debt clean and start over now that we are both a lot smarter and have good jobs. (A lot of the debt is from when my husband was unexpectedly laid off, unemployed for 6 months, and then when he finally found a job it was $4/less an hour than his previous job.) I’ve looked into consolidation loans but last year we were denied for one (unsure why as both our credit scores are around 680) and I’m not actually sure how beneficial they’d be..

Anyway, this is probably way more information than was needed but wanted to give the whole picture in hopes of someone having some good advice as we are so frustrated at the moment. 

TL:DR Husband and I are about $50K in debt (18K credit cards, 20K private student loans, 10K federal student loans, and 2K car loan) not including our house from past misfortunes and stupidity which is leaving us feeling hopeless and looking for any advice on how we can make it out on the other side of this.

The check came in today, and it is more than we agreed upon. When I asked her why she said that the extra money is for the mover, and she asked me to use that money to purchase Walmart gift cards so that the mover can load the cards onto their Walmart account to avoid any delay in funds transfer. I told her I was uncomfortable with that and that I could instead write a personal check to give to the mover directly, but she then asked if I could get a money order and send it to the mover overnight via Fedex.

&amp;#x200B;

A summary

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Federal Reserve officials are beginning preparations for a June policy meeting with difficult choices to deliberate.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;One month ago, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell played down speculation of a rate cut this summer.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now officials face a darker economic outlook, making a rate cut possible-if not at their meeting on June 18-19, then possibly in July or later.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed is set to begin their customary pre-meeting quiet period at the end of this week.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Traders in futures markets have placed about a 25% chance of a rate cut at theJune 18-19 meeting, and a 75% chance of at least one cut by the meeting after hat, on July 30-31, according to CME Group.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, Fed officials, who gathered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago this week for a research conference, signaled in broadcast interviews and speeches that they are attentive to the risks of a sharper-than-expected slowdown ingrowth, a sign that an interest-rate cut could be on the table at coming meetings.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S.economic outlook and, as always, will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."" Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Governor Lael Brainard made similar statements in recent days without indicating when any action might be needed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Just two weeks ago, Fed leaders indicated they didn't see a strong reason to move rates up or down.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;New York Fed President John Williams, a top ally of Mr. Powell, is set to speakThursday afternoon in New York.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;On May 5, just days after the Fed concluded its most recent policy meeting, President Trump announced he would increase tariffs on China.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials face the following tension: On one hand, they don't want to react prematurely to events that could quickly change.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent weeks, some Fed officials have approvingly cited examples from 1995and 1998 in which the central bank took out ""Insurance"" against looming economic weakness by cutting rates, extending the economic expansion.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials preparing for the June 18-19 meeting will be closely watching the freshest economic data and the state of trade talks.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Markets didn't think the Fed was acknowledging the risks to the outlook and tumbled in the weeks after the meeting, leading Mr. Powell to signal a pause in early January.",finance

I would appreciate any help or insight here in helping me understand what I should look for, what questions I should probably ask the prospective employer, or even objectively - which of the two scenarios below sound the ""best"".

&amp;#x200B;

Been at my current job for 6 years almost to the day and purposely pursuing change is much more difficult and anxiety inducing for me than having to deal with it thrust upon me with no choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Current job: Commute 2 1/2 hours (appx 110 miles) round trip. Wage is $23/hour ($47,840 /  year). Current 2-week paycheck looks like (deductions rounded up to nearest dollar):

* Gross Pay: $1840
* Tax Deductions Total (Fed, SS, Medicare, State): $262
* Health Insurance (Family): $175
   * Employer pays $664 per pay period
   * This is an HSA $2700 deductible PER PERSON in my family plan
* Dental: $14
   * Employer pays $25 per pay period
* Dependent Care FSA: $193
   * I have opted in to the max $5000 a year for this benefit as it's helped us with budgeting and gives us a little pool of cash around the holidays
* HSA: $39
   * Employer pays $100 per pay period
* Vision: $9
* Roth 401k: $111 (50% employer match)
* Various Life Insurance Addons: $20
* I hit the 5 year employment mark and my PTO increased from 80 hours to 120 this year plus major holidays, rollover as a rule is not allowed and exception is up to 40 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

New job offer: Local in town, no commute. Base offered salary is $35,276 / year (I put my salary expectation at $45,000 / year - I know I should negotiate, but unsure if I should or at least get it in writing that at end of X period, I will get $X increase). Breakdown of benefits below:

* 6.2% of salary is not deducted as Social Security credits are not earned with this position
* 100% employer paid retirement (12.5% SEP-IRA, day 1 vested) or I could self-fund through my 401k increasing my take home pay
* Deferred compensation, 100% employee paid, voluntary withheld pre-tax available up to $18,500 per year
* FICA tax is withheld at 1.45% vs 7.65%
* Premium Health Insurance with employer ranging from $19-$89 per pay period with $1500-3000 deductibles (the BCBS plan they offer is what my current employer used to have and I know this is by far a huge benefit to me and my family.
* Dental and vision are employer paid

personalfinance,Father passed away. What should I do with the life insurance?,"My father passed away 2 months ago and listed my siblings and I as his beneficiaries. I now have a large sum of money that I am not use to having. I've already vowed off of spending it on frivolous things such as eating out, or impulse buys. 

My dad's friend, who works at a bank, recommend me someone they know who is a financial advisor, I have yet to call but do plan on it. 

It is currently in a savings account through the life insurance company collecting 0.50% interest and 0.50% APY. My personal savings account has a 2.08% interest rate and a 2.10% APY. Should I move it, or part of it to my current savings account? 

I am a 21 year old college student who will be graduating in the next year to year and a half, with about $20K in subsidized loans with most having an interest rate of less than 5% and a few having an interest rate of 5.50%. I was also planning on paying off my student loans in full the last month before interest starts to collect (typically 6 months after graduation). Would that be a wise decision? Any advice is appreciated. 

This is a repost of a post I made late last night as it didn't have much traction so hoping there'll be more during the day.

EDIT: The large sum is currently $70K with $13K or so being held by the insurance company as they finalize things.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans and filing as an independent for first time,"First off, for my first few set of loans I was listed as dependent which meant I was tied to my parents finances. When I started college my parents owned multiple residences but not necessarily ones where money was being made off of property or lavishly bought. We were doing a rent to own for some friends in our previous home, and we were also moving across states so my parents had between 2-3 homes listed on the taxes. Once things settled and time passed I then started qualifying for subsidized loans once there was only one house. I'm still in college and after having to scale back credit hours to work more, graduating is going to take a little longer than expected.

 Would it be smarter to take out a larger amount of the subsidized loans as they come to pay off both the current classes and my unsubsidized loans since these are already accruing interest until I'm out of the grace period? What if the subsidized ones will have a higher interest rate once it does take affect?

Second, I'm considering filing as an independent on my taxes to hopefully qualify for more/better financial aid and because simply I am becoming independent. The dilemma now is that my parents are moving back to the original state that we came from. However, I am wanting to stay behind in our current state and possibly current residence if I can find roommates to cover the mortgage payment. So my questions here are: Can I still qualify as independent while living at home if I don't move out of the house; how do I go about things if I move out and stay in the state I'm currently in as dependent or independent; and would it be smarter to file as an independent once my parents do move?

Any help is well appreciated, wanted to do my homework well ahead of time as the move isn't happening for a few months.",finance
personalfinance,Which Student Loans to Pay Off First?,"Good day to all folx. I am looking for some loans savvy budget people to help me out and give me a little advice.

Long story short, I took out loans for college many years ago when I didn't really understand what I was getting myself in to. I have eight loans total, six which are federal and two which are private. In September, my partner and I will officially be moving in together, chopping my rent in half and giving me way more money to play with to pay back my loans (until now I've been making the minimum payments). So here is my quandary for the more financially savvy folx than I:

Would you focus on paying extra (and therefore taking down the principle amount on):

a) the (six federal) loans with lower principles and lower interest rates, therefore wiping them out quicker and getting rid of those completely OR

b) paying down the principle amount on the (two private) loans with the higher interest rates with the higher principle payment to make a bigger dent in those principle amounts?

Any other suggestions are also super welcome. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Trying to make the case to my SO that we should let our only car go in our upcoming ch 7 bankruptcy,"I want to keep personal identifying details out of this so sorry if I am vague.



I would have told you a few years ago that we were in an OK position. We weren't swimming in cash, but we had very little debt. One things we didn't have is any sort of savings or emergency cushion. I now understand how important that is. You never know when disaster will strike. Now 4 years later my SO and youngest son are permanently disabled, we're in our eyeballs in debt, only one of us can work. We're declaring chapter 7 and have a lawyer.

We don't have a house or savings or retirement. The only thing we ""have"" is a car. Our loan is 5k more then the KBB price. Between the car payment and insurance it comes out to 15% of our total income. $520 The interest rate on our loan is a low 3.9%. Our lawyer left it up to us. He knows we need a car to transport our son, but the payment is a heck of a lot for us.  If we sacked away the car payment we’d complete Ramsey’s step 1 in just 3 months.


We're moving from an area where we travel 1 hour each way for work to a smaller city with more pay. Total new commute is 3 miles round trip. I'm going to get a bike to commute to work and my SO would use the car for transportation to the kid's school, Dr appointments, and the grocery store. The whole city is only 10 square miles. I think we should let it our car go, take the money we would pay our credit cards/loans/medical bills/car payment/ after we file chapter 7 and buy a lien car from a tow yard. 


Our current vehicle can't hold a wheelchair and we might need one very soon for our 4 year old. I thought we could search the tow yards an old friend told us about until we found a suburban that was reliable, put some elbow grease in it and use that for a long time. I’ve read David Ramsey  and have been playing with his budgeting software and having a car payment that’s almost as much as what we’re supposed to be putting into savings seems insane. I also have 20k in student loans that will stay put after the chapter 7. 


Our car was an achievement when we bought it. It was our 1st new car. I know seeing it go is hard, but I want to think of the bigger picture. We’re going to be living on one income for the rest of our lives; taking care of our son for the rest of our lives. In a few years we’ll be in a great position. I have a new job that has a great retirement, fully  funds my healthcare plan for myself and my family, our prescriptions are free and our co-pays are low, our commute is short and we have the financial knowledge to avoid this happening  again. 
My SO isn't keen on the idea. They will be the one who is driving around the kids and taking care of our son. Neither of us are ‘car people’ and if we get ripped off we’ll be stuck without a car for months. What if all our research and saving will be for nothing?  


Sorry this is so long, but this is one last hurdle that I want to get over. Letting go of our car is a big choice. I want to do everything right this time -3-6 months of savings in the bank, living within our means, retirement…- and we should not have a car loan that’s 1/3 of our yearly income. I also want to make sure that my SO doesn’t feel like I’m leaving them stranded in the middle of nowhere.",finance
personalfinance,is debt consolidation worth it?,"\[from Canada\] hello, just a quick post hopefully to ease some worries.

personalfinance,Input on paying off student loans asap or investing,"-28 yoa
-$177k in student loans, just refinanced to 3.5%
-$130k gross salary + $1000 net income/month from woodworking side hustle and anticipate that going up with the new market ill be in. No other debt. $10k cash in the bank. Total monthly expenses: $1580...$600 - rent + utilities, $60 - car insurance, $70 - phone, $150 - gas, $200 - food (doing OMAD and cooking all my meals), $500 - fun.

Just finished grad school and moving for my first job.  I found a cheap place to live that will allow me to woodwork.  My plan was to live off my side hustle and savings, and throw 100% of my other income towards my student loans (about $7500/month) and have them paid off in 24 months or so. I want to live a simple life and live off almost entirely passive income + woodworking within 10 years.  I'd like to get into rentals to accomplish this.  Ill have the income to afford them and the skills to fix most things myself.  

Do you guys think I should pay off my student loans ASAP or set aside enough cash that I could buy a house if one came up and start getting into rentals asap? Obviously i'd do my homework on each individual home as they came up to make sure they would cash flow positively.  I would ideally like to do one home a year or so until i get to 5 or 6, all depending on which homes come up.  With my new low interest rate of my student loans, this is more appetizing than before.  

Summary: attack my student loans as hard as possible, or attack my loans pretty aggressively but also start in real estate now and let time work for me sooner?

personalfinance,Car Loans through Bank of America,"I recently started shopping around for a certified pre-owned car and was wondering if anyone had experience with loans from different financial institutions?    

I first applied to local credit unions and was approved before going through the dealership. After finding the car I then applied through the dealership and was able to get a better rate from Bank of America. I was hesitant to go with BoA as I had read some not so good things about them. However with the reduction in interest rate BoA is sounding like a better option.    

I have all of the other details that I can think of figured out: down payment, trade in value, pre-purchase inspection, and the vehicle I'm looking to buy.    

My situation is as follows:    

Local credit union: 3.74% for 60 months    
Bank of America: Initially 3.49% and reduced to 2.99% for 66 months    

My fiance and I plan on paying extra on the loan to pay it off early and as long as there is no penalty for paying off the loan early BoA sounds better all around.     

I've also emailed the credit union to see if they will match BoA's rate.    

Is there something that I'm missing or a reason I shouldn't go with BoA?     

Thanks everyone for the insight.    
    
Edit: After looking at the paperwork for the loan there is a line which says that there isn't a penalty for paying off the loan early but should I do so there is no refund on the finance charge. It sounds like I won't be able to save money on interest by making additional payments to the principal. I don't fully understand so any help is welcome.",finance

personalfinance,A quick lesson in balance transfer promotions...,"I have a credit card with a $2486 balance and my goal is to pay it off in 8 months from now.  The APR is 14.1%.  I got an offer from another card I have (currently 0 balance) to transfer a balance and get 1 whole year of 0.99% interest.  **There is a 5% fee for the balance transfer.** 

At first, it seemed like a no-brainer, but I wanted to see if it would actually save me any money.  I plugged my balance and rates into the [Bankrate Credit Card Payoff Calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-cards/credit-card-payoff-calculator.aspx).

___

**Current Card**:

Balance: $2486.86

Rate: 14.1%

Months to Payoff: 8

**Result**: $327 monthly payment. ($133 paid in interest)

**Balance Transfer offer**:

Balance (+ fee): $2611.21

Rate: 1% (wouldn't let me enter 0.99%)

Months to Payoff: 8

**Result**: $327 monthly payment ($9 in interest, $124.35 fee)

___

Now if my card had a higher interest rate, it might save me a few dollars.  This wouldn't necessarily do any harm, but don't neglect to include the fee if you consider a balance transfer!  I got this card in the first place to transfer balances from high rate cards and it was that action that finally motivated to do something about my debt.

Additionally, after the offer expires, the rate goes to my standard purchase rate on the card, 22.4%.  If my plan goes to shit, it might cost me more in the end.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking advice on student debt forgiveness vs. snowballing,"Hello all,

I'm at a loss for what is best for my long-term future regarding my student debt, and would really appreciate some advice, as I'm getting very down and overwhelmed. I am also looking into (low cost) financial planners, but appreciate any advice you can offer.

Here is my current financial situation:

I'm taking home $4,750 post-taxes. My rent and must-pay bills come to near $1,800, my wants (gym/subscriptions/shopping) float between $200-$400 a month, my debt payments are $400 a month (my monthly minimum) and $600 a month (paid directly to parents for loans in their name), I try to stick to $300 a month for restaurants and bars. The remainder is getting put to my emergency fund (currently at $2,000), short-term savings goals (big items, vacations), and to debt. I have 5% automatic payment by my employer into a 403b, and have an old 403b from a previous job.

Debt is all federal student -- $55,266.75 in my name with an average interest rate of 4.99% (from 3.5 to 6.9). The expected pay-off dates on my loans varies from 2025 to 2028, based on my current income-based repayment plan. 

I have recently transferred my loans to the public service loan forgiveness program and found that for a variety of clusterfuck reasons, many of my payments are not qualifying. I may have about 2 years max. (if lucky) of qualifying payments. While these are under review, they may not get approved, and also Congress may dismantle this program before then.....

So.... I feel I have two paths and I don't know which is best, or if there's a middle road.

Should I:

* Pay monthly minimums only. Hope for 10 year forgiveness of all debt (and have to stay in non-profit industry) by 2027 or earlier if payments under review are approved. Put extra money into building an emergency fund of $10,000 and extra savings into IRA or investment for future down payment.
* Pay as much as I reasonably can to snowball my debt. Start now with $800/month in payments and increase as I get more earning power. Keep emergency fund at $2,000 and do not build any additional savings. This would mean being debt-free earlier, but having no ability to save. I could also potentially switch to CSR/B corp and hope for an increase in wages.

I don't know what makes the most sense for my future.

Thank you for any and all advice.",finance

When I first left the military, I purchased some land, and a small single wide trailer that was in bad condition from my grandmother. We lived in that mobile home until last year, when I purchased a house, and spent all of my relevant money on said purchase. 

My in-laws are on SS and have 3 adopted children, and were living in Hawaii (they're from Samoa), and felt that they could not afford that lifestyle any longer, so I invited them to move to Florida and stay with us, or live in the trailer that I still owned in another town, 40 minutes away. 

Now, a year later I have some small savings, $7k, and want to get them into more live-able housing arrangement. The trailer they're living in is not going to last much longer, and we found a buyer that will give us $2k for it. My credit is a 614 (I've been quite irresponsible this year) and I was considering buying a mobile home for them to live in, and make payments. The gov. checks that they get for the kids are going to make the payments. I don't care about the return on investment, because I intend to sign it over to the children after they're mature enough to handle a house. 

But I am not 100% sold on the doublewide trailer, nor the lending company that the mobile home dealer wants to use. 
What would be the best path to take, and the fastest way to get there. The in-laws, and my wife have really bad credit, and the land is in my name, so I want to make the purchase, and put the house in my name, so that when in-laws pass, the house goes to the adopted kids, and not my wife or her siblings. 

Would selling the land, and the trailer, and buying a cheap house nearby work? 
Also, when I bought  the house that I am living in, I found that double-wides have a fast turn-around rate in my area, and usually increase in value, as long as it sells with the land within 10 or so years. 

So, any advice would be great. Any info on a good Mobile Home Lender, any info on what I would need to qualify for another mortgage to buy a house, and how the bank would feel about that (I use Navy Federal) or anything, I really am lost.

Today, I found out that they owe the IRS in back taxes, dad has a $5,000 credit debt to a furniture company, their utilities are about to be turned off because they haven't been paid, mom has credit card debt of $5k with a 36% interest rate, and dad has a line of credit for the business that is maxed out at $6k.  Additionally, their current house is costing about $6200 a month with utilities (which obviously aren't being paid) and now my dad also has an apartment that is $2200 a month. Business is down, mom doesn't work because she's taking care of my grandma with Alzheimers (she does get $1500 a month from that).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,My latest paycheck is way too much,"Hello all, weird predicament at the moment. I work for insight global under an IT contract for a local business. I usually get paid roughly 800$ a week for 40 hours no OT.

This week I got paid 930$ without attending any OT. All my timesheets were approved and the only thing I can think of is the federal holiday that came up, I noticed it had me down for 8 hours even though I did not work.

The time sheets were approved by both my boss, and my account manager with the contractors.

What do I do? I haven't touched the money and I'm considering emailing my contact about the issue since they have policies on ""falsifying time cards"" even though mine was auto generated.

Am I allowed to just keep it due to their error?

*Update* they let me keep it due to a clerical error on their part. It's a busy season and they said they can't devote manpower away.",finance

personalfinance,If I dont care about my credit score could this work.,"I am tired of swimming in this see of debit. My monthly take home pay is approx. $7628.00 a month. My total secured and unsecured loan payments are $5,929.75 a month. My monthly bills such as insurance, utilities, and food is $1,420.00. Which leave $278 extra a month. With so little left to pay extra a month to the debit down I feel like it will take forever to eliminate all of this debt. I have run the numbers and no that’s not the case.

So here is the crazy thought. If I don’t care about my credit score, I start paying down one each month with the $5929.75 I have available each month until I have $1,000.00 a month extra to pay debit down or just keep it going?

personalfinance,How to Improve Credit Rating?,"For most of my life I've had a credit rating in the 800's.

&amp;#x200B;

I had some very major medical issues about over a seven year span starting 12 years ago, and ended up with six figures of medical debt, mostly on credit cards. Managed to keep the credit rating up because I was also working my ass off paying those cards off. I also had a $70K mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, my medical condition worsened, I nearly lost my life, and I filed bankruptcy because it appeared I would never work again and was looking at living on SSDI the rest of my life. Bankruptcy was finalized four years ago. Lost the house in it because I figured I wouldn't even be able to afford a $500 a month mortgage on SSDI and I was having difficulty selling it. (It was worth about exactly what I owed.)

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to the present: I'm cured. It's a long story with a misdiagnosis and several lost years of my life, but I'm all better.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working full time, have been for three years, and am trying to put my life back together.  I know how credit works and have always been financially responsible (my only debt was medical related, because I was trying not to die) . My credit score hovers around 650 despite everything I've done to rebuild it. Here's my financial picture:

&amp;#x200B;

\-- One credit card, four years old, with a $6000 limit. Cannot get them to raise the limit. Zero balance.

\-- One 23 year old checking account that I managed to hold onto through the financial mess and bankruptcy. Current balance is around $3500.

\-- One savings acct, with a credit union, current balance $700. This is a business account. I own an LLC for an eBay business.

\-- $450 in Paypal, for business reasons.

\-- One of those annoying paycheck cards that a former employer insisted on using until I managed to switch over to direct deposit to my checking account -- they required we be employed with them for six weeks before you could use a bank account of your choice.  Haven't closed it because I'm afraid doing so might ding my credit. (I have gotten varying answers on this, but I suppose its not hurting anything sitting there with a zero balance.)

\-- 2017 jeep with a 20K loan, that I have paid enough extra on to be paying off a year early. I'd actually like to refi the jeep loan because the interest rate is crappy (7%, all I could qualify for -- two years ago my credit rating was 620) but when I tried six months ago I was turned down for a five year refi due to credit history. I am not upside down on the jeep.

\-- $10K in 401K

\-- $4400 in an IRA (pension got cashed out; that's what they gave me.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am always on time or early on all bills.

&amp;#x200B;

I rent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm single.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so frustrated by this. Yeah, the bankruptcy is still on my record, but will I have to wait until it entirely drops off to have decent credit again?  I'm doing everything right that I can think of. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to buy a house -- I'm saving several hundred a month towards this goal.

I want to refi the jeep and I can't.

I want to get an IRA with a company that doesn't charge $50 in fees a month. My former employer (that cashed out my pension for such a pittance -- I would have had $100 a month starting at age 55) opened an account with a company that charges fees \*\*\*greater than the interest they pay\*\*\*. I've tried opening an IRA with the same credit union that has my savings account and they declined me, and the credit check hurt my credit worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I make $40K a year. I'm in line for a promotion that may double that income, but that's not going to happen in the near future, for reasons.",finance

personalfinance,Sub vs UnSub Federal Loans. Which One Should I Do and More?,"Hello! I am kind of new to this subreddit. I've lingered and read a few of y'alls posts and figured that you guys would be able to help me out in some capacity so apologizes for if some things also seem nooby or been posted before.

Obligatory on mobile so formatting may be weird warning.. Also apologizes if this is a bit lengthy but I figured more info to look at helps people answer questions I have but my questions are at the bottom in case you don't want to read any of this.


I'll be going to a military college so work is not an option for me unfortunately. I plan to try for a commission into the Air Force and if that doesn't work out then try either with the Army or seek help from the National Guard. If I earn one then I won't have to worry but I can't try for one until I have to report to campus as I missed the deadline while enrolled as a high school student. Unfortunately the process takes a while and I need to make sure I can pay for the rest of the Fall semester. I am confident that I will earn a commission but I do not want to risk it because of my eyesight being terrible.

Also, In my student account under aid status I have the option to accept a Federal Direct Sub Loan ($1,750)  and a Federal Direct Unsub Loan ($1,000) per semester.  (I also do not understand the difference in all honesty. The more I research the more confused I get.) I have until August 1st to accept one, both or none. I do not know if I should accept them?? My mom seems confused on it too but understands more than me.

Speaking of parents they have offered to help me as best they can but I am hesitant as they just finished paying off my moms student debt and her car about 1-3 years or so ago. I don't want to throw them back into the rabbit hole like that. They already are buying me the required uniform and room items and a laptop.. I do not know if I should accept them helping as they already are throwing money at me as described above because they are super excited for me going to this particular college. It does not help my 2nd sister will graduate and go to college next year which is soooo close and my youngest sister graduates in 3 years and plans to go to college currently. Sister 2 is choosing to apply to only out of state schools and will allow her to study abroad though her dream school is in the UK while sister 3 wants to stay local. 
 
I do have a $2,500 scholarship that renews every semester if I keep my grades up in college as well and I have $23,000ish left to pay off for tuition, room and board and meals. If I need to I can comment a breakdown of how much everything costs for you guys, just ask! :)

I also have applied for multiple scholarships that I am waiting to hear back from them. I mostly been using my school and fastweb to find and apply for them. Most that I have applied for so far are supposed to be sending out results late June and Early August but I am not confident at all in getting any of them. Finally, The school will be sending out one last round of aid within the next week as well. I am definitely going to wait till I hear from the school about financial aid before I accept anything though just in case.

So final questions:
-Should I wait to accept these loans?

We've been paying $200/mo extra toward debt, that will immediately go into our needs.  Family of four, I haven't worked a serious job in years (I have done some gig work and will be doing more).  We also have a child with autism, so getting rid of the car/house would be a last resort without moving to another area for work.

I don't have access to our finances right now, but I do know that our house payment is about $1300/mo. I also don't know what severance my husband was given - he mentioned it and left for the library to get some space.  I'm hoping unemployment will cover or about cover that (I'm not sure what we'll end up with, as it's a new state for this for us).  We have a loan on my vehicle, which I am willing to give up if we need to, but it would be devastating to my autistic son.  Tabling that for a month or two out, if we don't have something lined up by then.

Current plan:

* get ahold of our finance spreadsheet with DH and figure out what we can drop (it won't be much, maybe a$25 phone line) + the $200/mo debt payment + our $50/mo spending
* ~~drop piano lessons~~, OT down to once a month again
* decide how worth it COBRA is vs. staying housed and fed
* job hunt (this, at least, I'm an expert at)
* raid the pantry and freezer and decide how to stretch those supplies.  They will probably last at least a month if I'm careful about it (adding some fresh veggies)
* pick up all the gig hours I can (which won't be much, but food money is food money) - which will leave us flexible for him to interview
* ~~see if our Y membership was paid for a year or subsidized monthly by work~~  edit: subsidized monthly
* ~~turn the air conditioner thermostat up (I'm a baby, there's plenty of room to work with when it's set at 72)~~
* continue simplifying the house/selling things (not much there either, but it'll help and get us ready if we need to move)

I have paid down almost half my principal from about 150k to 75k within a 2 year time span. My interest rates were 5-6%. I have two interest rates left with federal loans of 5% and 5.2% both basically half of the remaining principal. I looked into student loan refinancing and have gotten 4% and 3.95% approved.

My parents have been so kind to as provide me with a loan for graduate school and related expenses (like rent) since they don't want me working while I take classes or having to pay the bank back at crazy interest rates. Tuition for my program will cost about $50,000, but entry level jobs I'll be able to get afterwards will at the very least be $80,000/annually (and that's the low end of things... but I'd rather underestimate than over). Once I have graduated I'll move back, and I've estimated that I'll need $45,000 at the absolute minimum to live with some cushion and squirrel anything away for savings, but that's subject to change as housing changes.

I tend to run a higher food bill than I'd like to admit given dietary choices (I avoid processed food, eat lots of veggies. I've been trying to learn more rice-and-beans types of meals that provide me nutrients I need without feeling like I'm a self-denying monk, but there's a learning curve). I'm also gluten sensitive. Thankfully, my alcohol habits are not anything I have to budget for and I don't have to spend money on new clothes, etc. I sometimes find myself wanting to splurge on something small, like an $8 candle (this happened a lot in undergrad) or a $3 nail polish because I'm a victim of the mindset that buying something will bring me joy. I've really been working on this and r/minimalism has helped me change the mindset of these impulsive and pointless purchases.

On to the main point of my question: I would like to not work for the 13 months I'll be pursuing my masters degree. I also don't want to rack up $20,000 more in debt to my parents trying to pay rent and eat 3x a day. I won't have a car, so I won't be spending on gas and my ability to spend money on frivolous purchases will be reduced as I'll have to bike home with whatever I purchase. I want to keep my rent costs low (but I'm finding $850 to be the average in the city I am moving to), as well as food and other costs necessary to exist.

personalfinance,"Car debt: lump-sum principal payment, refinance to shorter term, or hold off?","*EDIT: Thanks for the help everyone! I learned a lot about how this stuff works and how to best apply money toward loans to minimize interest payments.*

Hi all, I have a question about how to reduce interest payments in my car loan. 

Original loan (May 2018): $15,700; 5.9% APR; 60 mo.

Current loan status: $13,200; 5.9% APR; 47 mo.

My financial condition has improved a lot since the original loan. Steady, fairly high income, rental history established, stronger credit, etc. I also have about $17,000 dormant savings. When I first got the loan, I was fresh out of college, single, and had no income or rental history (busy year!)

I know I can get a better interest rate if I refinance because of my improved conditions. I want to maximize the percentage of my dollar that goes toward principal. 

Should I: 
- Pay a few thousand (2,000-4,000) toward principal in a lump-sum
* AND/OR
- Refinance for a better rate, staying at 47 mo.
- Refinance to a shorter term (i.e. 36 mo.)

The goal is to minimize the dollars paid toward interest in the next couple of years. I don’t invest my money so opportunity cost isn’t a huge consideration (like I said, the savings are just sitting dormant in my account).

This monster is sitting at a 7.900% Fixed Interest Rate with a total balance of $33,000.00. I'm currently making payments of $223 on 20-year term. I shopped around for better rates and I found that SoFi will let me refinance the loan into my name on a 7-year term at a 5.649% interest rate for monthly payments of $480. I currently pay $480 per month for all of my loans. Once I enroll in classes, my other two loans will be deferred, since they are subsidized. My current salary after taxes is roughly the same as what I'll take home from my stipend after taxes. From my perspective, being able to write-off the interest on my taxes will be a nice bonus, I should be able to afford those payments, and, over the life of the loan, I'll save something in the ballpark of $25,000.

personalfinance,Does this sound like a sound plan for escaping 13k of credit card debt?,"Hey Everybody,

I am looking for a credit card to open up to transfer a portion or all of my credit card balance too as I naively opened one with my bank, Fifth Third which was approved for 11,000 and is currently around 10k in use. This card also ended up only having an introductory period on balance transfers only and not purchases and by the time I realized my stupidity, it was too late and I was getting hit with 18.24% APR. I have a separate credit card with them with 0% APR until May 2020 with about 3k on it (7.5k limit) but I can't do a balance transfer using this card, unfortunately. So I met with the branch head for my bank and asked him what I should do and he and I came up with the plan of:

1. Opening a credit card at an alternative institution other than 5/3 (they don't allow balance transfers WITHIN bank) and transfer as much as the credit card debt with APR over to the new card.
2. Use a loan with 5/3 and pay a principal rate (10% cheaper than CC APR rate) which goes down once it gets paid off more to pay the rest of the debt and have it at a significantly lower APR interest rate.
3. Pay off the credit card with the introductory period in play.
4. ALL DEBT- Credit Card: 10k Used, 11k Limit, 18.24% Interest- Credit Card: 3k Used, 7.5k Limit, 0% Interest until May 2020

**UPDATE:** I tried both Citi (2000 balance transfer limit) and Amex (750 in balance transfer).. Should I try the reconsideration line?

Which credit cards should I look at, considering I don't want multiple institutions zinging my credit? I was looking at Chase, Citi, Discover, and a few others but would like to hear from experts / more financially stable persons who know what they are talking about and whether or not this is a good strategy.

Is this a sound plan for approaching the situation with the known circumstances? I would really like to take care of it so I can finally relax and pay off this monstrous debt without getting hit with huge interest takeouts (currently takes $160 out of a min. payment).

I currently bring in 2-3k a month and expecting more in the next couple of months from multiple sources of income:Insurance: $640 / month - Web Design Business: 1-2k / month - Music Gigs: $350 / month

I recently started a new job and my pay increased by ~65-70%. After all expenses, I anticipate that I’ll have about $2,400 a month that I can put towards the above debt. I’d like to save a few hundred a month to bolster emergency fund, so I was thinking I’d use $2,000 a month towards balances. Looking for advice on how to allocate accordingly. 

I’m also planning to sell off a car (paid in full already) in the next 3-4 months. I’m hoping for $10-12k from that sale, which I would use a portion of to pay off debt as well. 

Sorry for the ramble and appreciate any tips!

personalfinance,Comparing my current job (greater LA area) to a job offer I got (in SF),"I am a single 23 year old college grad (graduated for a year now) currently working for DoD as a contract specialist (1102) and I recently received an offer from a consulting firm as a Technology Analyst. 

My position in government right now is on a ladder, so I get guaranteed raises every year. Right now I make 48k, but in September I'll get a raise to 58k, 71k in Sept. 2020, and 85k in Sept. 2021 as a GS-12. The consulting firm offered me 73k in SF, which probably isn't much after adjusting for COL (I'm currently in the greater LA area). 

I know that I'll probably be taking home a lot less if I take the position, but I can't imagine myself being a contract specialist long term as I think the job is incredibly dull. The duties at the consulting firm aligns better with my future career goals, which is to break into consulting or data analytics. 

I know that the analyst job is a better fit for me, but I feel like giving up guaranteed raises is a little foolish. I have no loans and no debt, and I have around 6k saved in an emergency fund. I save around 40% of my salary (half towards Roth IRA, half towards emergency fund), put 30% towards rent, and 30% to do what I please. I contribute to the full 6% of TSP (govt's version of 401k) every paycheck.

Is it possible to save on 73k living in SF or is staying with federal government a better decision financially?

personalfinance,Looks like I may have missed FICA taxes payment...,"Hi all,

I started working on 07/16/2018 and I filed my taxes (for the 2018 year) in this April 2019 - filed them with TurboTax. I also successfully received a refund for federal and state taxes. TurboTax never showed any issues that I may have (I am not even sure if it is supposed to do so) and I have never been contacted by IRS. However, I just realized that I did not pay even a cent for Social Security and Medicare taxes for 2018, and I am kind of worried right now.

I would think IRS should have contacted me by now (also considering that they issued a refund for me) but I may be wrong.

The guy on the right disagrees and starts talking about how consumers should prefer a stronger dollar than a weaker one.  He then gets shut off at 8:09 and they cut to new segment with him diverting to something else and strokes the viewers ego

""its not great for multinationals but its great for the folks at home""

1. A majority of users used MakerDAO, Compound and dYdX in descending order
2. Most users heard of DeFi apps through Reddit and Twitter.
3. **47%** of users classified themselves as lenders, 33% as borrowers and 33% as both
4. People chose to trust apps based on the following facts: Trustless(72%), Smart contract audits(63%), Social proof(45%), Aligns with the ethos of crypto(36%)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What attracted you to DeFi?

This was one of the most interesting questions, given it was free response. Overall, here were some of the facts mentioned:

* Monetary policy not controlled by a central bank
* Lowers the barrier to create new products vs. traditional banking system
* Serves as a release valve for overaggressive government regulations
* Transparency
* Can be audited
* Fairness
* Eliminates rent seeking middlemen
* Open 24 hours a day
* No credit checks
* I don't have to ask permission from a financial intermediary

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this was an insightful survey and I'd love to hear more from the community about what you think. I'd love to spark a productive debate where we debunk DeFi together. Its an amazing time, we're so early in the space and it'd be great to quantitatively understand DeFi.",cryptocurrency

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 10th, 2019.

# **The market week ahead: Mexico tariffs and more data that may clear the way for a rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/weekahead-domm-190607-ec.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have been rallying hard on the idea the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon, but at some point the market needs to see progress on the trade wars and economic weakness that are bothering the Fed.
*****
&gt; Friday’s surprisingly soft May jobs report showed just 75,000 jobs created, 100,000 less than expected. That immediately raised expectations that the Fed could cut rates as early as July because the long resilient labor market is now seeing the impact of what has already been showing up in manufacturing data.
*****
&gt; The stumble in the labor market raises concerns that trade-related weakness in manufacturing will creep into other sectors of the economy. For that reason, economic data, particularly CPI inflation data Wednesday, could be a key market factor in the week ahead, as investors attempt to game when the Fed could cut rates. There are also retail sales and industrial production on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think investors will be nervous around trade and tariffs. Those will continue to drive sentiment next week. I think it’s interesting that you have this idea that the ‘Powell put,’ the central banks, come in to save the day,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “It may feel good for investors, and it may extend the cycle longer, but I do think it compounds the longer term problems...Eventually this is going to catch up with the market in some way or other.”
*****
&gt; **Mexico tariffs**
&gt; Investors are awaiting any developments in China, U.S. trade relations, and they are also closely watching developments with Mexico. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs of 25% on all Mexican goods, starting with a 5% tariff on Monday, if Mexico does not show that it is making progress in stopping migrants from reaching the U.S. On Friday, Trump said in a tweet there’s a good chance a deal will be made with Mexico.
*****
&gt; “The market was shrugging it off this week. It’s been a strong week for the market, so [investors] seems to be taking it in stride,” said Arone, noting investors were looking past the Mexican tariffs for now and focused on the Fed rate cuts. “The market seems to be applauding [rate cuts] right now, but I’m not sure accommodative monetary policy in itself is enough of a catalyst for better economic growth and better earnings. We need more than that. This could be a bit of a quick hit or a sugar high.”
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied after the jobs report, with Friday’s gains capping what was already setting up to be the strongest week for stocks since November. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4.4% for the week, ending Friday at 2,873. Treasury yields fell to the lowest levels since December, 2017 in the past week, with the 10-year touching 2.05% on Friday. Fed funds futures also moved sharply, and were forecasting a 95% chance for a quarter point rate cut in July.
*****
&gt; Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO, said the markets are now focused on the timing of a possible Fed rate cut and whether the Fed would cut by a quarter point or a half point initially. That makes economic data especially important, as investors watch to see if weakness has spread to consumers, in the upcoming retail sales report Friday, or whether inflation is weakening. Core CPI has been running above the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
&gt; “You would think the [fed funds futures] market is gravitating toward one cut in July, one cut in September and another in December. We have 2.9, 25 basis rate cuts priced in for 2019. This really raises the stakes for next week’s CPI, given core year over year CPI is over 2%, and also now because we’re in the Fed blackout period. There won’t be any additional guidance coming out of the Fed this week.,” said Hill. Fed officials do not speak publicly just ahead of meetings, and they are scheduled to meet June 18.
*****
&gt; Strategists have said the market is also holding up on the idea that President Donald Trump would not allow the trade conflicts to get so out of hand that they will cause a stock market collapse, since he views the market as a reflection of his success. That’s the so-called ‘Trump put.’
*****
&gt; Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, J.P. Morgan equity strategist, said if Trump proceeds with his threat to put tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that could spark a major sell-off in stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 could go as low as 2,500. But he also expects that sell-off would result in both a ‘Trump’ put and a Fed ‘put,’ meaning Trump would take some action and the Fed could cut rates to ease financial conditions and help the economy. The strategist said he is maintaining his 3,000 target on the S&amp;P for the year.
*****
&gt; “We believe the next round of tariffs that the Trump administration is threatening—Mexico 5% and China Phase III—could substantially increase the risk of pushing the U.S. business and profit cycle into an outright contraction,” he wrote. Lakos-Bujas said he still expects trade agreements to be reached, in part because the Trump administration will not want to risk a market collapse or recession, ahead of an election.
*****
&gt; Lakos-Bujas said there are a wide range of possible outcomes, including a positive scenario where trade peace is achieved, earnings improve and the S&amp;P shoots higher to 3,200.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investors will also be keeping an eye on China’s data. On Monday, China reports balance of trade, imports and exports, first quarter GDP, current account and foreign exchange reserves. Chinese inflation data is released on Wednesday.

# Not a Triple Top Yet – Support Has Held

&gt; There has been a lot of chatter recently about an imminent “triple top’ for the market across the January 2018, September 2018 and recent April 30, 2019 highs. It’s not a triple top until it breaks support levels. Traders do need to be watching for support levels to be broken - which we have recently held.

&gt; Holding support was bullish technical action. But remember this is the Worst Six Months and we expect more volatility, more testing of support and more sideways action – backing and filling – over the weaker summer months.

&gt; We talked about these support levels on the blog a month ago as well. Here’s an update to the chart from that May 7 blog post. I added some additional support levels. S&amp;P 500 level of 2580 at February/April 2018lows is critical support – a 12.4% correction.

&gt; Breaking that level would bring the December 2018 lows into play, which would be bear market territory of -20% – and likely the low and a great buying opportunity. Good thing we are already in Worst Six Months Defense Mode since we shifted to market neutral after our official Best Six Months MACD Seasonal Sell signal for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 on May 1.

# Seasonally, Bonds Have Plenty of Room Left to Run

&gt; Barring some rather abrupt reversal in the current trend in trade, tariffs, tariffs and even higher tariffs, bonds could have even more upside in their near-term futures. Back in the beginning of April we noted the 30-year treasury bond had a seasonal tendency to dip in April and early May (around the time stocks like to make a seasonal high) before moving higher from sometime in May through the end of August. Thus far this year this trade has been a perfect textbook setup. 

&gt; In the following chart weekly bars of the 30-year Treasury bond future appear on top with their seasonal trend since August 26, 1977. The 30-year Treasury bond did dip in April and as trade war concerns grew in May, as stocks slipped, bonds ripped higher. The recent rise has been brisk but considering the retreat in tech stocks further gains are not out of the question.

# The Bespoke Report -- Negative Void Coefficient

&gt; Equity markets surged despite short term interest rate markets pricing near-certainty of multiple Fed rate cuts this year. How can an economy so bad that the Fed needs to cut mean stocks go up? We take a look around for some answers. We also review just how dovish the Fed has been relative to what markets have been pricing of late. While the domestic economy has definitely slowed down from the torrid pace of 2018, even the disappointing nonfarm payrolls number today paints a different picture than assumptions of multiple cuts from the front end. The global economy is less constructive, but there's a difference between weakness and a recession panic, as we show. Finally, we present an argument for why Fed rate cuts may not be necessary for the economy to stabilize and start to pick up again thanks to negative feedback loops.

personalfinance,"About 5K in debt, terrible with money, considering consolidation","I have two credit cards, two very high interest loans (INSANE interest rates), and some medical bills. All told it's about 5 grand. Because of the two loans (biweekly payments that take about $600 out of my pay each month), we've got behind on everything. I have been approved for debt consolidation, which will make my monthly payment $272, which is substantially easier. The company that approved me (Family Credit) also develops a budget for you and asks that you save at least $25 each week. I still have some questions for the consolidation company, but it seems to be something that will help me not be in such financial free fall. What are some of your experiences with debt consolidation? Was it worth it? I feel like I don't have any other options. As for saving, I've heard good things about credit unions, how do they compare to banks? I'm scared and don't want to make any more financial mistakes.",finance

personalfinance,Pay down student loan debt or start investing/open brokerage,"After plans fell through for a relocation that I was saving up for, I have approximately five grand that I can use smart (the rest of the savings will be put into a higher yield savings account for emergency use). 

I’ve been reading some on here and also financial books (eg Dave Ramsey and Rich Dad Poor Dad) and thinking that I need to make my money work harder for me than just sitting in your traditional banks savings account. 

Also looking at refinancing the bulk of my (unfortunately high) student loan debt to a lower interest rate. Here are the options I’m considering:

1) refinancing at a fixed rate with higher amount to pay off loans in an aggressive manner (still will take 5+ years) [more Dave Ramsey debt snowball like]

2) refinancing at a lower variable rate with a less aggressive approach and opening a brokerage account and putting more into investments [more Rich Dad, Poor Dad like] 

3) man the f* up and see a fiduciary like a grown ass adult (should prolly do this anyway) 

Any advise on these options would be great. Thanks for all the input.

personalfinance,$0 balance on a Perkins student loan showing open on my TransUnion credit report. Is this a problem?,"I recently ran a TransUnion credit report that showed I had 2 open accounts, which was odd since I only knew of 1 (my credit card). Turns out the second ""open"" account was a Perkins student loan with a $0 balance. I'm positive that I paid it in full over a year ago, so I know I'm not on the hook for anything.

Is this something negatively impacting my credit that I should try to get removed from my report? I have many other closed federal student loans (including other Perkins), so I'm not sure why this one in particular is hanging on.

If so, who should I start with? TransUnion? My loan servicer? My college?

personalfinance,How I Came to Personal Finance,"Hi All,

I wanted to share my story of how I came to this sub and my circumstances. If you are reading this, please take the concepts from this sub and start applying them to your finances. If you ever manage to get to a good job like I do, you will need the knowledge to make use of the large salary you get. Not all debt problems are solved by having a larger salary, although it definitely doesn't hurt. 

Here is my story:

I've always been good at making enough money to cover any bills or debt I had, but terrible at keeping it. When I was in high school I was making $15 an hour at a time when most of the people I knew were making $7-8. I had a nice Audi and I never missed a payment for it or the large insurance I had to pay to keep it. I always managed to rack up credit card debt, but never to the point that I could not pay it. After college I would take a second job to pay my bills if I needed to. I made around 40k per year after college with a few jobs. I increased my credit card debt. I kept managing to keep my monthly bills paid, but I never really manged to pay any of the cards off altogether. I rationalized that I would do it some day when I had a higher paying salary.

Years later I finally hit my big break at work and negotiated what I considered at the time to be a huge salary. I had to relocate across the country with my family, but we all decided to give it a shot. My wife and I bought a huge house, she had brand new cars and we shared everything. Then, my father passed away suddenly and I inherited a large lump sum life insurance payment. I had no debt except for the house and car payments. Life was great.

About a year into my new life my wife and I divorced, and it was an ugly one. My 401k was drained out and by the time I managed to get the house sold, I was in debt for around $50,000. The divorce put me in a terrible position and I did what I had always done to make sure my bills were paid on time each month, and they were. My credit had no late payments. In the end I managed to pay down about half the debt I had built up from the divorce and started to rebuild my life.

A few years later I was picked up by a new company and my salary was now over the six figure range. I had to relocate again, but I was single and had a huge salary. What could go wrong? It was an easy decision. 

When I arrived in my new job and city, I found the cost of living was about 30% higher than where I lived before. I had done some basic math and could cover the expenses no problem. I stopped really paying my debt down and went back to my old ways of buying what I wanted under the idea that I always pay my bills, and I can just pay down the debt later when the next big break comes. I never budgeted anything beyond my next pay check. 

A year later I was pondering my life. I had all these bills and it felt like I had no money. I couldn't understand it. My debt had been about the same from when I relocated, $25,000, my salary was huge and I lived in a small 1-bedroom apartment. How could it possibly be that I felt like I was not earning much more than when I was in high school paying for my expensive car? I didn't have a nice car, I didn't have nice clothes, so what gives?

I started really looking at my situation. I found this sub, I read everything, and I started using a budget program (YNAB). I found that I was eating out nearly every day, multiple times. I had a fancy computer and was spending a lot of money on games that half the time I didn't even play much. I was spending tons of money on expensive alcohol. I had 3 credit cards, and a truck loan to pay off. Two of those credit cards had 25% interest rates (more or less). I couldn't believe it. I had these 3 cards for probably 10 years and I never once bothered to look at the interest rate. It's been about 4 months since then and I've nearly paid off one of the 25% interest cards, my truck will be paid this month and then I'll tackle the next 25% card.

I then started looking at my high salary and after reading through a lot of the posts and wiki here and other similar subs  I realized how much of my salary is being fruitlessly wasted to taxes. My company has a 401k that I can only put in 5% to right now because of my debt. My company also has an HSA plan that I'm only contributing a little bit to. I have no IRAs, nothing. 

My ""huge"" salary is going to credit card interest, loan interest and Federal/state tax withholdings. It's insane. I had no idea how much I have been losing over the years. I don't even want to know how much money in my lifetime I've just given away to interest or taxes. Money I could have been using towards savings or retiring early. 

I've learned my lesson and I plan to pay off the remainder of my debt, save up about 6 months of essential bills and then really start investing my money into 401k, IRAs, HSA and go from there. 

Thanks for reading my story.

personalfinance,"25 years old considering national debt relief and afraid of the consequences, I just don't feel like I have another option.","I little bit of background for my situation.  I am a Licensed Massage Therapist of 5+ years and have had my share of ups and downs.  When I initial started Massage things went decently, pay was consistent and via car payments and some light credit card use my credit actually got pretty respectable.  A few years ago I ended up with a DUI and did not have the money to handle the situation (I certainly learned my lesson pretty quickly).  I had to use my credit cards to pay for everything and now I am 8,800 in debt to my creditors. Additionally I have back-taxes I owe the IRS and heavily unpaid student loans.   Ya.... I know I'm fucked and I probably sound like a financial dunce, I just need help.

I lost my private contractor job in October and was out of work about 5 months where my mother was able to assist me.  I am working again at new jobs with super high earning potential, Yet I haven't gotten a paycheck in 3 weeks because things are slow and I am not getting clients.  I've never missed a payment but this is the first week ever where might actually happen.  My interest rate is roughly 24% and it's really killing me, so I reluctantly inquired about national Debt Relief and wonder if it may be right for me.  

I care about my credit so I'm obviously hesitant about letting my credit drop due to this program.  Currently my monthly CC payments run me about 275 bucks and about 170 of that seem to be interest.  What was offered to me was a 2.5 year plan @ 228/month (saving me roughly 50 bucks a month) and saving me roughly 2000 by the end.  I understand the repercussions of defaulting on my cards,  and that I could be sued, However was assured that my debt is not large enough for that to be a valuable option for my creditors.   Right now I'm drowning in credit debt because of one dumb night 2 years ago and I'm desperate for help. I'm trying to work and make more money but right now it's just not coming my way.  At the moment if I don't take this plan I will have to skip my payments this month anyway because I have 15 dollars to my name.  I'm looking for a third job outside of massage therapy because I'm dying without a properly consistent paycheck.

What should I do? Is this plan reasonable based on what I owe?  Is there a better solution?",finance
CryptoMarkets,Difference between bourses and speculative stocks,"Physical diamond exchanges are called bourses. This is where the producers sell the diamonds to the cutters and dealers. Some bourses like the Antwerp’s four specialize on raw diamond, other exchanges trade both rough and polished stones. But diamonds is not the only asset traded there. The other asset is information and rumours on pricing and financial situation of the companies. The rumours are pretty common on diamond exchanges since the whole industry greatly lacks transparence. 

World Federation of Diamond Bourses, created in 1947, controls the 29 existing bourses in such cities as New York, Los Angeles, Miami, London, Johannesburg, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Paris, Milan, Bongkok, Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow, among others. It also sets the prices for rough, polished, colored or colorless diamonds.

Every company that considers itself professional strives to get access to the bourses as only there they can find supply from the manufacturers. Bourses are different from speculative stocks and cryptocurrency exchanges as they are the places of calm and respectful negotiations. Traders are allowed to examine diamonds with high-tech equipment, calculate risks and hold a discussion. However, there are certain strict rules dictating on how to do the business.  

Four Antwerp’s bourses - the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Bourse du Diamant, Vryes Diamant Handel, and Diamant Kring - make up 80% of the world rough diamonds trading. Diamond Club of Antwerp, opened almost 130 years ago, is the oldest and the strictest one. The entrance to any of the bourses is restricted for those who are not official members. The bourses also implemented their own judicial system, operating outside of any government court system. A person expelled from any bourse is automatically expelled from all the others with a photo posted in every diamond exchange in the world! 

This form of organization interfere with progress and allow diamond market to be completely controlled. That is why Diamond Open Market is building a platform implementing a decentralized approach and still maintaining all the high standards of the diamond industry.",cryptocurrency

I  was hoping (and definitely due) for a raise but my calculations aren't  showing me that monetarily - the best advantage with the salary I see so  far is the better health care plan and working towards the 3% 401K  match (I currently contribute to a SEP IRA, a nominal $100/mo though).

personalfinance,Need to either repair or buy a new car with bad credit and I have no idea what steps to take.,"Honestly not sure if this is a good place for this, so I'm really sorry if I'm causing trouble and would really appreciate being redirected to find help. A couple of days ago my engine blew out and now it's entirely inoperable; the only real repair would be to replace the entire engine block. The car's fully paid off and has remained in the family for its entire 17 years, but KBB rates its value (assuming the engine is fine) at around $1600. The lowest quote I've heard for the engine is around $3500.  

Most of the used cars I can look at for around the same price as the engine repair seem to be in a comparable condition to mine when operable, or nicer condition with an ambiguous ownership history. I just finished moving to a different state, so while money's tight my parent was gracious enough to offer to assist with covering the down payment or the engine cost, but the catch to it is that they get to be choosy about how it's spent. In other words, there's been an adamant refusal to look at used cars that are at risk of requiring repair over the next few years. I've tried to reason and explain that in many cases it would still remain cheaper than the engine, but it's been an immovable position. 

The biggest problem with this situation is that I've got bad credit because of some issues with student loans. At the moment it's sitting at 450, and after calling some dealerships today I'm ineligible for a lease and any purchase I could make would basically require $3500 down payment and then ~400/mo, nearly double the monthly cost of their standard finance plans for vehicles priced around $16-18k. Essentially over 6 years I'd be paying nearly twice the value of the car. Getting the loans completely taken care of is being negotiated at the moment, as I was left a trust to handle education costs that covers it, but I have no idea how much of a positive impact getting them paid off will have on my credit score, and likewise how much that would affect potential car financing or eligibility for a lease in the near future.

I do have a pretty comfortable job at the given moment, and while I could feasibly pay the higher finance rates and still be okay it would basically mean I'm completely incapable of saving for retirement for the near future. So to round it out I'm really lost, as honestly I've never dealt with credit before. I don't know what the best option is between repairing the car or getting fleeced by the interest rates offered by the dealerships. Common sense and nearly every expert tells me repairing the car is silly, but is it more reasonable to do that and keep the car going for a few years while I build my credit to get a more manageable finance for a new car? I have a temporary solution for the coming week, but being absolved of the outstanding loan balance could take until the end of the month. 

I'm totally clueless how to handle about 90% of the factors of the situation I'm finding myself in, and would really appreciate any sort of opinions or advice.",finance

personalfinance,How to transfer banks efficiently?,"I’m in the process of trying to switch from Bank of America to Navy Federal, but I’m hitting some hiccups. I have a credit card with BofA, at this point close to maxed out at almost $2000 in debt. It’s not a huge deal to me right now, I can have it paid off in 2 months easy. But the only way to pay it is through transfer from my BofA checking account. I would really like to be able to close the bank account and cancel the credit card as soon as that card is paid off. However, I just ended a car lease and my credit score dropped 50 points. I’m now very worried about closing that account. It’s my second oldest credit card, so my average credit history would drop. And apparently you can lose credit points just for closing an account? It’s VERY important to me to have my score over 700 by February next year. It was at 700 before it dropped when I closed my lease. I need to get another car lease in February and I’m worried I won’t get good options if my credit is under 700. 

I’m considering opening a new credit card through Navy Federal, with a 0% intro APR. transfer the credit, close the accounts and be done with it sooner rather than later to give my credit enough time to bounce back before I really need it again. Even if I can’t get a $2000 limit, I can transfer the max amount and pay the rest off. I just don’t want to hit my credit if I’m not going to qualify for it at all, or if this is a really stupid idea. Also, I really hate the idea of switching banks in general, and having to go through and update my payment information for everything, but I hate BofA at this point more than almost anything.

personalfinance,I finalized the purchase of my first home and 4 hours later I was fired from my job - budgeting help!,"Sorry for the ""give me finance advice for my very specific situation"" post but I've read a lot of these threads and am still curious about some things.

&amp;#x200B;

My stats:

* My Mortgage is $2650/mo
* I have a roommate who pays $1250/mo in rent
* My income is about $120k this year (I'm freelance so it fluctuates a lot)
* My house is my only debt @ interest rate of 4.125%
* I owe $410,000 on the house
* Looking to take at least a couple months off of work to collect myself / re-align.
* Already have a maxed out Roth IRA
* I have a $40k emergency fund + $40k in a money market

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is I'm still receiving about $200k from back pay and miscellaneous things. So I'm trying to figure out what to do with that while giving myself enough breathing room to take a much needed break from work.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea was to recast my mortgage, I think my lender told me if I recast for $200k my mortgage drops about $1000/mo, so basically my monthly bill for housing would reduce to $400/mo.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the right way to go, though? Should I be investing some of this new money? I'm very risk adverse. And while taking time off work it seems very appealing to only have to pay $400/mo for housing.

personalfinance,Throw me a bone.... please. I don't know how to invest.,"So this is going to be long and I am going to try to summarize all my assets. All the questions are at the end. I feel like I have enough money, but now it seems like it is all over the place and I get anxiety about it. I currently have the following:

Vanguard (recently moved from Franklin Templeton):

$8134 - Franklin Growth Opportunities FGRAX - regular brokerage

$2443 - Franklin Mutual Global discovery TEDIX - regular brokerage

$8691 - Franklin Growth Opportunities FGRAX - ROTH IRA Brokerage 

$2777 - Franklin Strategic Income FRSTX - ROTH IRA Brokerage

$5119 - Franklin Mutual Global Discovery TEDIX - ROTH IRA Brokerage

Navy Federal:

$2858 - Current Checking

$6000 - Money Market (emergency fund)

$3000 - Easy Start Cert. 12 month

$7000 - Certificate 10 month

$3000 - Certificate 6 month

$4000 - Certificate 9 month

Thrift Savings Plan:

$8248 - Traditional

$63653 - Roth

Credit card Debt: on 1 card, and I have 2 backups

\~$2000 (ebbs and flows, I don't always carry a balance but pay about $2000 a month. I charge almost everything here. I don't chase points, but it good to accumulate them.)

\~$2000/month expenses

&amp;#x200B;

So to start off, I started the TSP accounts and originally started traditional, but now my contributions are Roth. I believe this is classified as a 401k thing and doesn't count to my $6 Roth IRA allowance. The funds are in the riskiest currently allowed with the thought that I am far from retirement. They are 4.33% over the last 12 months. Next came Franklin Templeton. I started there from 1st Command a few years ago as I was linked up with a broker/adjuster from a friend. I started putting money away there too until I learned about how much they were charging. I thought it was a lot at the time, but maybe I was wrong. Then I was stagnant for a while. Within the lat 12 months I have opened a Vanguard account and simply held the Franklin funds there. That's basically the story. My car is paid off and I rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are the questions. I am about to be 34 with no wife no dependents. Am I doing okay were I am at? I just recently bought all the certificates at NavyFed because a friend brought it to my attention that $20k+ hanging out in my checking account isn't doing anything for me. I might as well make more than that 0.05%. Now I am looking at Vanguard. I would like to get rid of the Franklin holdings and move to something else. Is there any good advice on what to buy in Vanguard? I would like to just give a good stab at it with the \~$27k there. Of course I understand to deversify between low-med-high risk funds, but I am having a hard time determining this. Then after some time I wiii do some small picking and choosing. I will be roughly putting in $1k every month and waiting until accrual of 5k to pick something new. Every time I expand the info for any fund on Vanguard, I get overwhelmed. Are there some training videos that explain all the minutia or are there only a few things a beginner needs to pay attention to? If my TSP is a Roth 401k-ish fund, that means I am missing out on the Roth IRA $6000 yearly limit right? It is always better to drop this in your Roth as fast as possible vice monthly deposits, right? More investment time type of thing. 

Don't hold back if I am being a twat, because I really don't know what I am doing :/

As always, thanks for the help! This community is great.",finance

personalfinance,PLEASE take some time to understand your benefits at work,"I'm a federal employee and you wouldn't believe how often I encounter people who have no idea how any of our benefits work. The most common I see are:

* People find out they (or their federal employee spouse) are pregnant and want to know how much maternity leave we get (answer: NONE)
* They think FMLA is 12 weeks of PAID leave - this is disturbingly common
* Then they want to know how they can get short-term disability after the baby is born (answer: that's not a benefit the government gives you - you would have had to enroll before now)
* They want to know how the leave bank works (many agencies have this) and are shocked when they find out they would have had to already be contributing to it in order to draw from it
* They have no idea how our retirement savings (TSP) work - have either not been contributing since they started employment, or are contributing a little but have never adjusted the allocation beyond the government bond fund that all new enrollees are in

Most people are pretty good at researching all the ins and outs of health insurance, but beyond that they make a lot of assumptions about our benefits and never bother to dig into the details. This leaves you woefully unprepared for an event like a medical emergency or pregnancy.",finance
personalfinance,Should I cancel my Guardian Whole Life at 95 Account?,"As the title says, thinking about closing this account. I opened this account back in late 2011 - I honestly didn’t know much about this or finances in general at the time. My daughter had been born in early 2011 so really my thinking was I would get life insurance and be able to start saving for college. My premium on this has been $500 a month since the start.

At that point in my life I was very naive about finances / investing and most things money related and although I am still not an expert I think I have improved pretty significantly.

Over the years I have taken about $10000 out of the cash value for various reasons - not really understanding how interest works on this account. As I’m sure some of you know the interest on this is pretty significant. My loan balance at this point is about $19000.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the values in the account at this point  are as follows:

* Death Benefit: $600000
* Cash Value: $31000
* Loan Balance: $19000

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told by some people that if I were to work to pay off the loan balance than the cash value would rise significantly. I have also read some posts on reddit that say whole life is a bad investment - so I’m trying to figure out what I should do here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think my options are: 

* continue paying the premiums and work to pay off the loan balance. If I do this, should I basically be paying this premium for the rest of my life? Or does it make sense to stop at some point when I’m older and my cash value is high enough?
* Cut and run - close the account - get the $12000 balance (cash value - loan) and invest it elsewhere. I would forfeit the death benefit and ultimately this will be a significant loss - I have put in about $45000 into this and will have gotten back the $10k and $12k so my loss is about $23000 - it sucks but I don’t want to keep paying it just because I’m at a loss I would rather cut my losses than keep feeding a bad investment. I would want to get some other life insurance maybe a term life policy since I have kids. This would also free up the $500 a month I was putting here and I can put that elsewhere (suggestions welcome)
* Maybe you guys have some other suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Other personal info if needed: 

* 30 year old
* Two kids 
* I have a separate 100k life insurance policy through work 
* Own home - $134k left on mortgage at 3.65% interest rate - this is my only debt at this time besides this loan balance 
* $160k annual income 
* I have been maxing out a 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA for 3 years and will continue to do so hopefully until I retire. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any suggestions. Sorry if the post is long. Thank you

EDIT: thank you guys for the advice and for not flat out calling me an idiot even though you all probably think I am lol .. so pretty much we are all in agreement this was a bad investment so I’m gonna take the loss and get out of it 

So these will be the steps I take: 

I will get term life first before canceling 
Then I will cancel and cash out the $12k
I will put the 12k into 529s for my kids and start funding those monthly

Thank you all for the advice here and thanks to this sub for helping me get more financially literate",finance
personalfinance,A few self-employed/contractor tax questions,"Hi,

I'm looking for just some general guidance, as this year is the first time I've worked both a FT job as an employee and as a contractor on the side.  I currently work a FT job where I am an employee of a company, my taxes are withheld and I receive a 1099 annually.  Traditionally, I've used TurboTax to file my taxes on an annual basis.

In March of this year I started doing some very limited contract work outside of my normal job, where my taxes are not withheld.  I've been using Quicken-books self-employed to keep track of expenses and taxes owed.

I'm a little confused about the process by which I would file my taxes:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - I believe I am supposed to file quarterly for my contract work, but still annually for my normal FT job?  Quicken-books tells me the next quarterly filing is June 17th.  So will I just file a return for the income I've made as a contractor and not worry about my FT job until annual filing begins?  

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Does quicken calculate both federal and state taxes?

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Assuming I pay quarterly taxes on my contract work throughout the year, will my normal annual filing for my FT earnings be much more complicated if I continue to use TurboTax?

personalfinance,Question about Personal Loans,"So, I'm using a throwaway account because a lot of friends and family know my real one, and I don't want to deal with explaining if they find this post out. Having said that, here's my question:

&amp;#x200B;

Through the last 7-8 years, I have accumulated a substantial Credit Card debt (around $15k), this was done mostly because I had difficulty getting jobs that could support me. I ended up having to use the CC to pay a few months of rent, then about 2-3 moves. I know this sounds crazy, but honestly, had I not used the CC, I would not be where I am today (stable job, ready to pay down this debt). 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am using a budget and sticking to it. Already paid off two of my smaller credit cards (limits of $700 on both) and have the two big baddies left. One has about $1k and the other has the remaining $14k. Following the budget I set for myself and not having any crazy events happening, I should pay them off by 2021. They are high interest rate at 21% I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would it be worth it exploring a personal loan, at a 5-13% rate for the entire amount and pay it that way? As crazy as this might sound, my Credit is quite good if we are to believe the FICO scores these cards offer. It has been bouncing between 720 and 740. So, should I apply for a personal loan, pay off the credits cards, and go with that or should I stick to my budget the way I have been going?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off student loans or save for retirement and home?,"I currently have around $15,000 in student loans (all federal) with rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.86%, which is down many thousands from what I've paid in college and what I've been paying so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have a $1500 emergency fund and close $5,000 in a Roth IRA. My monthly expenses are around $2,500 and fairly inflexible, leaving me around $1300 in extra take-home pay each month. My partner and I are pretty good with money and follow a modest lifestyle with just occasional treats.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my late twenties now and my partner and I want to get married soon, buy a house in the next 5 to 7 years, and save for retirement.  We plan to have kids, but not for another 6 to 8 years. We don't know where we'll be physically living in the next few years,  but I would reckon we would want a home no higher than $200,000 (and that's really pushing it -- we'd probably go much lower). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a new full-time job earning close to $60,000 a year. Once I got the new job my plan was to put around $1500 per month on the loans so that I could get rid of them in around a year, but I'm reconsidering that given how comparatively low the interest rates are compared to what other posters in this forum have.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does it make more sense to just get rid of those loans as fast and possible and the sock away lots for my retirement and buying a house, or should I pay the minimum (around $275) payment and save up for a retirement and home?

&amp;#x200B;

My gut and what I've read on this sub makes me feel like it makes the most sense to pay the minimum, maybe a little extra, but put most of my disposable income in boosting up my emergency fund then splitting money between retirement and a home.

The first has a 5% interest rate and ~$1,000 (and growing) in interest which will capitalize in six months, and the other has a 6% interest rate which has already entered repayment (and thus has minimal uncapitalized interest at any given time). I have ~$1,000 to put towards loan repayment in general, so which loan should I put my money towards to minimize my total loan expenses?

In general, I understand that, once minimum payments are made to all loans, the most efficient way to put extra money towards loan repayment is to put it to the HIGHEST-interest loan first. However, in a recent message sent to me by the lower-interest loan servicer, I was told (paraphrased): ""You have ~$1,000 in currently-uncapitalized interest. If you pay off this interest before the grace period ends, you'll save ~$600 over the lifetime of the loan, and your monthly payments will be $15 smaller than they otherwise will be if you decide to let the interest capitalize."".

As this lower-interest loan is managed federally, its servicer often sends me statements including advice, in which the phrase ""Pay off your highest-interest loans first"" features prominently. But this older advice isn't mentioned here, and this suggests to me that they're trying to say that I could save more money by preventing this interest from capitalizing rather than paying off whatever loan (federal or otherwise) has the highest interest rate.

I currently believe that the most efficient move would be to put all my available money towards the loan with the higher interest rate. It's really just that little omission of previous advice that's making me second-guess myself and think I'm missing something. It's entirely possible that I'm overly cautious with finances and that I'm needlessly reading into nothing.

Nonetheless, I think it would be wise to get a second opinion so I can be certain my current plan of action is actually the best for me. Should I put my money towards the higher-interest loan, or prevent a bunch of uncapitalized interest on a lower-interest loan from capitalizing?

personalfinance,Paying for roof from savings vs financing,"As the title suggests I am debating whether to pay for the roof using my savings which would wipe out everything I have vs financing through the roofing company.  

I already have a few roth IRA accounts setup which I contribute to monthly.

I have no other debts other than my monthly mortgage, electricity, gas, food, etc.

The fixed interest rate is fairly low between 5 to 7% depending on the length of the loan.  There is a 30 dollar activation fee and a 25% fee if the balance isn't paid by loan end.

The 3rd option is 18 months interest free provided the amount is paid off in full within 18 months.

 I plan on having it paid off within 2 years one way or another.  We have overtime coming up in a few months which should help pay it down faster.",finance

personalfinance,Should I abandon Capital One?,"I'm going to try to keep this brief-   


I have been with Capital One since 2010. My checking account and emergency fund are in Capital One, and I have a credit card with them as well. Savings account with Ally, which I really do like, except it's a bit inconvenient because you know, it takes upwards of 5 business days to transfer $$.   


Up until a few years ago, despite having a credit card, I always stuck to my debit card to buy things so I didn't really mind that my credit card sucked ( high interest rate, low credit line, no rewards). One of the reasons I never used the card was because the credit limit is $500, which is the limit they gave me when I was in college back in 2014. Recently, I switched to their quicksilver card and have been using the card as my primary way to spend to get cash back and have been paying it off weekly.   


The thing is, seriously, for the past 2 years, I have been trying to get a credit line increase and every single time they deny the request. I fly internationally at least twice a year and with a $500 credit line it's not like I'll be able to purchase tickets with the card. I have the Discover IT card now with a way more practical credit limit that I'm considering making my primary card rather than the Capital One. I have called Capital One a handful of times in the past year or so about a credit line increase and they say no every time. This evening I called again and told the woman my situation and how I want a card to put airline tickets on, and the woman at Capital One basically told me to go ahead and use the Discover card because ""Capital One's cards aren't right for everyone"" LOL direct quote. Gotta love that customer service.   


I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. All of my CapOne accounts are in good standing, I have a 720 credit score and make $60k a year. Why is Capital One not trying to keep me as a customer? Additionally, the idea of using a card that isn't Visa or Mastercard seems a bit precarious. For those of you who use Discover, do you find that it is just as widely accepted as the other two? I am so annoyed with Capital One I just want to take my money out and put it in another bank. Does anybody have any suggestions? Where should I go from here? Should  I make the switch to Ally for all of my accounts? Where do y'all keep your emergency funds?",finance
personalfinance,Best way forward,"Hey people of r/personalfinance! I am at a point with credit card debt at which I should definitely start to do something different, but I am not quite sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background—I am currently a student studying Industrial Engineering, about two quarters away from graduating (will finish in winter 2020). I have zero student loan debt and work two part time jobs to cover rent and food. My hours are super inconsistent, but I make enough to pay for $835 in rent and roughly $250 in food (I try and eat really healthy and have boiled it down to this at the lowest.)

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have two credit cards, and with some unforeseen expenses and a trip to Europe I thought I would be able to pay off, I am sitting at roughly $2200 on one (22.84% variable APR) and $3000 on another (25.53% variable APR).

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so this summer I am going to be working on my startup venture out of an accelerator program. Who knows if we will be successful, or how successful we will be, but things are looking pretty promising. I'll be working on this full time, probably up to 50 hours a week, for the duration of the summer. I am given $10,000 in funding for the accelerator, I am planning on using a portion of this to pay for my rent and food, as I will not be able to work any other full time job. I am also thinking of getting a different part time job (one is too inconsistent, one is only during the school year) but I worry that this will detract from the time and energy that I can devote to my startup.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like get rid of this debt somehow, stop accruing interest, and stop my credit score from declining like it is  (was at 770, now down to 630 and still declining). If my startup is successful, when I start paying myself a full salary or when I sell it I should have more than enough money to pay this debt off completely, but this is  some unknown time into the future. I am currently able to make my minimum payments no problem, but hate to see my score declining like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if I missed any crucial information. Just help me out here as to my best options. Some that I see are:

\-Take out student loan, use to pay off cc debt. Smaller interest rates here, but longer term.

\-Take out personal loan to consolidate debt.

\-Just keep chipping away at it with slightly-above minimum payments until I can pay them off in full.

**Update:**

So far these are the places I have applied too and what I learned:

* **Lightstream** \- So far seems like the best bet. Got the lowest rate at 5.56% for 60 months, no prepayment penalties and I can use the loan to buy a car anywhere
* [**sofi.com**](https://sofi.com) \- They didn't approve my application. No option for a used car loan only a personal loan. Requires at least 3 lines of open credit to even apply.
* **Credit Union** ***(Bethpage Federal Credit Union***) - Gave me the highest rate so far at 7.76% for 60 months
* **Capital One** \- Got approved however the loan only works towards participating car dealers. Can not use the loan to buy from private dealers or private sales. Won't give you the rates until you have chosen a dealer from their network that has the car you want.
* **Credit Union** ***(Justice Federal Credit Union)*** \- **WINNER!** They gave me a rate of 4.09% for 60 months. Took the longest of all options to go through the approval process *(about 2 weeks)*. If curious, anyone can join this credit union with $5 in a savings account however, to open an account you must be directly related to someone with an account *(in my case is was my Dad)* OR work for some position in the American Federal Government to open an account.  At that point you can then apply for a loan.

personalfinance,Student Loans Help,"Hi r/personalfinance! Asking y’all this question bc I don’t trust anyone in my family’s financial decisions and forgot everything from high school economics! ha

I’m about to be a junior in college and so far have $7,561 in federal student loans with an interest rate of 5.1%. I’m about to take out another $7,500 in federal student loans this year, and probably again next year, with hopefully somewhere near the same interest rate. With financial aid and loans, the rest of my school and rent comes out to $13,000 per year, which my dad wants me to get a loan for. This comes out to about $48,500 in loans (3 years of $7,500 in government loans, and two years with private loans of $13,000). The private loan I have been approved for with no co-signer from Discover (Sallie Mae did not approve me without a co-signer) has me at a variable interest rate of about 11%, or a fixed interest rate of about 12%, meaning my $13,000 would become $37,323 by the time I pay it all off. 

I guess I’m just wondering if this is not as bad as it seems in my mind and I should take the loan, or if there’s a better alternative, or if this is just straight up a bad idea. Is it better to do a fixed or variable interest rate? Does anyone else have Discover student loans, and if so, how do you feel about them?

Bitcoin,BitCoin is Not Threatened by GlobalCoin (TheFaceBook's Coin),"As you likely know, the Zuck is at it again. He wants your data, he wants you to watch sketchy ads, he's creeping on your Insta and WhatsApp, and he wants you to send him pictures of your IP-enis (so he can protect your IP, I.E. intellectual property. Yes, [really](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/07/facebook-revenge-porn-nude-photos)).

&amp;#x200B;

The Zuck's  latest project is a new cryptocurrency, ""GlobalCoin"". FaceBook is a juggernaut, and I've seen some ripples of FUD in the BTC community regarding GlobalCoin. However, GlobalCoin isn't a threat to BTC, because it doesn't solve any of the problems that BTC solves. Let's look at each of these aspects in turn:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Vehicle for Investment:** We can argue about what proportion of BTC holding is speculative, what proportion is for use in transactions, and what proportion is held for political or ideological reasons. At the end of the day, however, BitCoin is used by many as an investment vehicle. You may cringe at price-talk, and you may think that the media's focus on the price is a distraction from the potential of blockchain, but the fact is, some people get involved in BTC to make money. GlobalCoin is going to be tied to the value of one or more national currencies (likely either fixed to the USD, or else based on a basket of currencies, including USD, Euros, and Yen). This means that GlobalCoin is useless as an investment; if you want to buy dollars (or Yen, or Euros, or whatever) - just buy dollars (or Yen, or Euros, or cowrie shells, for all I care). By definition, GlobalCoin can't appreciate against major currencies. It's like Tether: best-case scenario is that your StableCoins are simply equivalent to dollars. Worst-case scenario is that they're worthless because the issuing entity is full of shit and minted coins out of nowhere while stealing all your money and going to live in Bermuda. The best-case scenario is no better than holding fiat currency, and the worst-case scenario is much worse. *BTC: 1. GlobalCoin: 0.*
2. **Transacting in Regions with Weak Local Currencies (The Venezuela Problem):** In areas with weak and/or unstable official currencies, locals are using BTC (and also paper fiat currencies from other countries, often USD or Euros) to store value and conduct their day-to-day transactions. The governments of these countries hate this, and the practice is always illegal - often severely so. There's absolutely no way that the government of Venezuela is going to allow a currency other than its own official currency to be used - whether that currency is paper USD, or Euros, or BTC, or gold, or GlobalCoin. Hence, these sorts of countries are not going to be any more friendly to Zuck's currency than they are to BTC - which is to say, not friendly at all. If the Zuck doesn't cave to pressure from the Venezuelan government to block GlobalCoin in that country (and he certainly will cave), then Venezuelan ISPs will simply be ordered to block TheFaceBook entirely. The contest isn't ""which currency will Venezuela allow?"" (it won't allow either), but ""which currency can survive and thrive even under government opposition?"" (answer: BTC). There are two ways to block GlobalCoin: either pressure Zuck to do it, or block one single IP address. Neither of these work against BTC. *BTC: 2. GlobalCoin: 0.*
3. **Circumventing Capital Controls (The China Problem):** We move on from Venezuela to visit China, where people aren't so often struggling to survive (in fact, plenty are middle-class, and quite a few are rich). The Yuan is reasonably stable as currencies go, and so crypto users in this market are more interested in evading capital controls. Simply put, they use BTC (and USD, Euros, gold, etc.) to store value and ship it out of the country - typically when they're planning on shipping themselves out of the country. Their governments don't like this, and prohibit it, even searching outgoing passengers for cash and gold at airports and train stations. FaceBook is completely blocked in China, and will remain so for the foreseeable future (I heard on FaceBook that something no so wonderful happened in Tienanmen Square). This makes GlobalCoin a non-starter. Even if FB did somehow arrive in China, you can bet that the Chinese government will insist that Zuck implement capital controls as a condition of passage through the Great (fire)Wall. BTC circumvents these issues, and is excellent for evading capital controls. *BTC: 3. GlobalCoin: 0.*
4. **Libertarianism, Crypto-Anarchism, Anarcho-Capitalism, Cypher-Punkism, And Other Words That End In ''-ism'' And/Or Come Out Of John McAfee's Mouth:** The purpose of this post isn't to debate libertarianism or any other philosophy. I don't want to comment on what economic system, tax policy, scheme of tariffs, etc. I think we should have. These are immensely complex issues, and I want to stay on-topic. That said, a significant number of BTC owners and users enter the crypto space because they object to the economic *status quo*, to quantitative easing, to tax law, etc. GlobalCoin is of no interest to these people; in a sense it's even worse than fiat currencies, because with a Fiat-linked GlobalCoin, you now have all the problems of USD *and* all the problems of corporate corruption and bias. Imagine if Ben Bernanke and Mark Zuckerberg teamed up. Not a pleasant thought to most libertarians. Whether you're worried about censorship or privacy or the power of big business, there's plenty to hate about FaceBook, and there's no question that people who use crypto for ideological reasons will avoid GlobalCoin like the plague. *BTC: 4. GlobalCoin: 0.*
5. **Buying...things...and stuff...online:** Sometimes, we want to buy things online. Special things. Sometimes, we want to buy things like catnip, except not for cats. Or, we might want to buy Alpaca-wool socks, but we live in a country where that particular fabric is forbidden, and the DEA (**D**enim **E**nforcement **A**gency) is on the lookout for anyone who is in possession of controlled fabrics. Similarly, we might want to send money to support people who are unpopular (or, at least, unpopular with the technology and financial giants in the places we live). Governments try to eliminate undesirable goods and try to silence undesirable people in the same way: by cutting off the flow of money. You can bet that GlobalCoin is going to require registration to send or receive money in excess of some token amount; you can also bet that anyone controversial, and any controversial marketplace, is not going to be eligible for a license. Remember: FaceBook is *not* a regulated service, and so they'll have *more* freedom to ban controversial figures than payment processors like Visa and MasterCard. BTC is extensively used to conduct transactions and support people when The Man frowns upon such transactions and support. GlobalCoin is useless in this regard. As with the discussion of libertarianism, I'm not taking a stand on whether these transactions are acceptable or not--I'm simply pointing out that they occur, and are a driver for BTC adoption. *BTC: 5. GlobalCoin: 0.*

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, GlobalCoin combines ""all the problems of a currency that can be manipulated by the Federal Reserve"" with ""all the problems of a currency that can be manipulated by Mark Zuckerberg"". It has none of the major, and transformative, advantages of BitCoin.

personalfinance,Customizing withholding on W4,"Every so often on here, somebody asks whether they can put down an absurd number of withholding allowances on their W4 to make their federal withholding zero and then just pay when they file their return. Inevitably, someone will chime in saying that you can, but you will pay penalties for under-withholding. Additionally, the IRS can request copies of employee's W4s from the company and investigate if somebody puts down a large number of allowances.

My situation is the following. I had uneven amounts of income for the first 6 months of the year but will be starting a salaried job with income well in excess of what I've earned in the past. I want to follow the prime directive and would like to build my emergency fund, then max 401k (good fund options in the plan), then max a Roth. I want to do this in order.

So my plan was to not contribute to 401k until efund was built, then divide 19k by the remaining number of paychecks and contribute that amount thereafter. This will make my tax withholding fluctuate. Moreover, if I just do 1 or 2 withholding allowances, I will be way over-withheld because I made so little the first half of the year.

My question is, can I just compute my year-end tax liability, and pay an unchanging amount toward it each paycheck by putting down a huge number of withholdings but then adding that amount in the space for ""additional withholding""? If I do this correctly, I won't have under-withheld so I can't be penalized for that. But if the IRS asks for my W4, I imagine they may think it's odd and investigate. Can they penalize me for a large number of allowances if I've added a reasonable non-under-withholding amount in the space for ""additional withholding""?",finance

investing,Investing in solar projects 🤷🏼‍♂️,"I’m considering investing in a solar project where roofs are rented out for 20 year periods (with 5 year options to extend after that) and solar panels are installed.

There is a 30% federal tax credit for solar panels installed this year and Massachusetts offers additional tax credits plus incentives under a program called the SMART program which offers these incentives for 20 years after install. The numbers are fixed based on the energy produced and the panels themselves have 25 year warranties with 90% production guarantees after 20 years so the assumptions for production and smart incentives should be fairly safe.

Here are the numbers for this particular project:

100,000 kWh project
$175,000 build cost

+60,000 tax credit (one time)
+160,000 incentive (over 20 yrs) 
+29,000 behind meter annual

Annual numbers:
-10,000 rent annual
-2,000 management fee 1.5%
-2,500 insurance
-3,500 replacement / loss cost

So you’re looking at at about an $11k return (~6.3% of the original investment) year over year on top of the ~$220k return you get back over 20 years from all the incentives.

Over the past 10 years  in Massachusetts energy prices have increased 4% on average. The $29k is based on current energy prices so there is plenty of potential upside on that 6.3%.

Even if energy somehow became free it would still be pretty safe to say you’re looking at getting about ~126% back after 20 years. To put that into perspective $100k 20 years ago is worth ~$153k today so you’re not keeping up with inflation, but that seems like it would be considered fairly low risk. If energy prices continue to remain constant or rise you’re looking at at least a 6.3%+ ROI year over year if you consider you’ll be getting back your initial costs through the incentive programs.

Would it be crazy to invest 30% of my investment money in this project? I’m not rich, but I am comfortable. This “investment money” is outside of my retirement money and I’d be fine if I were to lose it all. 

I haven’t heard of many folks investing in solar so curious if anyone else has had experience with similar clean energy investments. Beyond fusion reactors what are some other threats to energy prices? Granted if we solved the world’s energy problems that wouldn’t be so bad.",finance
personalfinance,"If you haven't filed your US Federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by June 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.","Taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. Ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (FTF), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. This penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

If a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the April due date -- or more than 60 days after the October due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. This means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. If the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. The late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

The FTF penalty does not apply to the Taxpayers who met this year’s April 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. It also won’t apply to the Taxpayers who asked the IRS for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by Oct. 15, 2019.

In addition, the IRS urges Taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. The late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (FTP), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. Interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original April 15 deadline.

After a return is filed, the IRS will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. Normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

If you are *claiming a refund* on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

Furthermore, we both have student loans to pay as well (IBR plan already). Realistically, due to our professions it would be difficult to get a steady second job as well. Our vehicle is underwater by about 5k, so we can't sell or trade it in without losing a ton. We still have a contract with our cell phone provider, so we can't drop that any time soon. We also have a habit of eating out all of the time, so we don't have a food budget it just seems to be a free-for-all at times.

Our budget is the following:

**Income (combined/after taxes&amp;deductions):** $4,876/month (not including the two extra paychecks per year each)

**Monthly Debt:** 

Rent - $1114/month

Gas/Electric -  $175-200/month-ish give or take

Vehicle - $392/month

Insurance - $150/month

Gas - $120-150/month avg

Cats - $30-50/month avg for food/litter

Student Loans (combined) - $455/month

Cell Phone Plan - $160/month

Cable/Internet - $160/month

Netflix - $11/month

iTunes Music (Fiance INSISTS) - $11/month

Gym - $22/month

Food - $400-500/month????

Misc/Entertainment - $100/month?

Credit Card #1 - 9.9%, $19,750 total, $394 min payment

Credit Card #2 - 13.24%, $8,200 total, $180 min payment

Credit Card #3 - 13.24%, $2,000 total, $50 min payment

Credit Card #4 - 22% (OUCH) $1,675 total, $50 min payment


I can see some improvements as I can cancel cable and cut that bill in half, and cut our food budget down, but otherwise I just see these large debt numbers and I become paralyzed and don't know where to start. I suppose start paying off the highest interest rate first which would be Credit Card #4. I was offered a Flex Pay option on Card #2 which I would be able to roll the balance of #3 and #4 into it at a 9.9% APR, but 3 year term and it'll add $130/month to our expenses. With the APR it is a no brainer, but I don't feel comfortable adding a $130/month expense. I tried applying for a loan consolidation/lower interest, but was turned down as they would only consider my income and not both of ours. Otherwise, I feel like we have more than enough money to live but with so much debt we are **not thriving** as I think we should be. It doesn't help that my fiance and I are currently living apart. I accepted a role in a new part of town about an hour away and I am living with my father temporarily until my fiance can find a new job here (she has a contract and is stuck there for about 4 more months). My dad does not charge me rent/utilities, but we are still on the hook for the other apartment obviously. In the mean time, we commute every weekend to see each other--I see her one weekend, and the other she comes to me. The expense for these trips add to our gas monthly average by about $100/month but since it is temporary I haven't considered it in the budget at this time. Can anyone offer some advice? Comments? Constructive Criticism?

personalfinance,"Getting out of debt, negotiating debt.","Ok backstory I got out of prison 10 months ago after doing 4 years and 4 months. I have a job that I have been at for 9.5 months. I currently make about $82,000 a year. Side note I am about to get another promotion that will bring me up to 95,000 a year. I have $15,000 in cash $15,000 in 401k and IRA. My rent is 450 a month and I spend around 250 a month on food. I have no other bills. My credit score is 480 it was 800 before I got locked up.

 I went to look up how much debt I owed from before I was locked up and I owe $30,000 from credit cards and personal loans that went into collections. I owe another $69,000 in Federal student loans that were originally $48,000 but have gone up due to fees and interest they said. I have a few questions.

I got a lawyer for the student loans but that was 3 months ago and I haven't heard anything from him except for he was waiting to hear back an offer. Does it normally take so long to negotiate student debt? I don't want to ask the lawyer because even though he hasn't charged me anything when he does any conversation that we have will be part of billable hours.

As a matter of fact what do lawyers normally charge for negotiating federal student loan debt? This all seems very opaque to me.

What should I do about the credit card debt that I owe? It's from 5 years ago and most of that stuff I can pay off with the money I make. Some people would say wait til the Statute of limitations is over but I feel morally obligated to pay it back. I guess my question is who do I talk to? The banks or the collections agencies that now own the debt. 

How long will it take to get my credit back to above 750?

I know this is a lot of questions any advice will be much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,I need help. should I use bank or credit union if I'm using the account for temporary ( or maybe long term I don't know)?,"I need somewhere to put my money fast because I recently got a job and they only do direct deposit (also manager sounded like they really wanted me to open an account since a check is coming in for me soon) and I don't know if I should put my money in a bank or credit union. I'm debating about these two options. if you can help me decide that would be great. When I read through the websites the features sound about the same.  (Background I'm 17 years old (probably can't open a bank/credit union account, but I'm going to try and tell them my background story like I am now) and my mom is out of town now and I recently got a job for the summer. She told me to get a temporary checking to account bank account (anywhere else, but chase) until she gets back because her bank (chase) is offering her $350 if she refers someone in if I get a checkings and savings account through them. However, I might keep that temporary bank/credit union account ( I keep on hearing that big banks are bad and I should go with a smaller bank/credit union)

Option one:

 [https://www.houstonfcu.org/checking-savings/rates--fees/fee-schedule/checking-account-fees](https://www.houstonfcu.org/checking-savings/rates--fees/fee-schedule/checking-account-fees) 

 [https://www.houstonfcu.org/checking-savings/rates--fees/current-rates/share-rates](https://www.houstonfcu.org/checking-savings/rates--fees/current-rates/share-rates) 

Option two (kind of a big bank, but all the features and interest rates seem nice and ratings are good compared to the chase I think):

 [https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/online-checking-account/](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/online-checking-account/)

option there (hell):

go to one other the ""big banks"" such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc. I heard these companies are bad.

personalfinance,Advice on 401k allocations,"Hello,
&amp;nbsp;

I am a 31 year old whose company just switched over from MassMutual to Fidelity as a 401k manager, which has caused me to review my 401k allocations and just my 401k setup in general. I am wanting to be pretty aggressive with my investments, so I’ve been doing a lot of research lately into how to set up my allocations in order to maximize my returns. I created another post, and another user helped me to select my current mix, but I am curious as to just how important super low ER is and if a slightly higher ER but with better historical return may be a better option. I have approximately 18.5k in my 401k; 18k in my Roth IRA; 35k in some mutual funds (which actually feed my Roth IRA). I make 63,500/yr; I contribute 8% of my salary to my 401k (via Roth deferral) and my company matches 8% (pre-tax).

&amp;nbsp;

I want to get some opinions on the best mix that I can get given the investments that I am offered, and I was hoping you guys could provide some input. I’m trying to become a more informed investor, but I’m just getting my feet wet.

&amp;nbsp;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am providing a few mixes that I came up with below. One of which, I came up with (trying to) using the 401k investment allocation advice I found using a ""Step-by-Step Guide to 401(k) Fund Selection"" post here on r/personalfinance

&amp;nbsp;

[Current Mix]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is my current mix, suggested by a user in the first thread that I created. The overall ER is 0.0252.

&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) – Large Blend – 45%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index (FSPSX) – Foreign Large Blend – 35%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX) – Immediate Core Bond – 10%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index (FSMAX) – Mid-Cap Blend – 6%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) – Small Blend – 4%
&amp;nbsp;

(1 yr = -0.1677%; 3yr = 8.6682%; 5yr = 5.8109% and 10yr = 10.1541%)

&amp;nbsp;

[Financial Advisor Recommendation]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is what my financial advisor recommended, but I’m not really convinced this is the best option. Not sure what the total ER is (because I’m not sure what the ER of the funds within the BlackRock LifePath Target Date 2050 fund are).

&amp;nbsp;

-BlackRock Life Path 2050 Target Date Fund A (LIPAX) – Target Date 2050 – 95% (ER = 0.4; not sure what ER the funds within the target date fund have)
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) – Small Blend – 5% (ER = 0.025)
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = -0.154%; 3yr = 8.7225%; 5yr = 5.9795%; 10yr = ?)

&amp;nbsp;

[Fidelity “Very Aggressive” Model]
&amp;nbsp;

This model is terrible. It’s 1/3 in bonds, but I included it anyway because maybe the Fidelity people know what they are doing? The overall ER is 0.31225.

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Equity-Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) – Large Value – 23%
&amp;nbsp;

-Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund Class M (MWTRX) – Intermediate Core-Plus – 17%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund (FXNAX) – 16%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index Fund (FSPSX) – 14%
&amp;nbsp;

-JP Morgan Large Cap Growth I (SEEGX) – 13%
&amp;nbsp;

-Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Y (ODVYX) – 5%
&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor (VMFXX) – Money Market – 5%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund (FSMAX) – Small Blend – 4%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund – Mid-Cap Blend – 3%
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = 2.4429%; 3yr = 7.6635%; 5yr = 5.3447; 10yr = 9.0044%)

&amp;nbsp;

[My Attempt to follow the 401k Allocations Advice from this Subreddit]
&amp;nbsp;

So, in my likely poor attempt to follow advice that I’ve read here on Reddit, I have come up with a mix of investments that I think best follows what I’ve read on here. The first thing that I did was take my age and subtract it from 120 to get 89 (rounded it up to 90) as my percentage of investments that I would invest in the stock market. The remaining 10% would be invested in bonds. The bond I selected was the Fidelity U.S. Bond Index, for no other reason than it has the best ER (0.025%) and it has pretty comparable returns compared to the other bonds.

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that 70% of my stock allocation should be in US stocks and 30% should be in international stocks. So 70% of 90% is 63%; 30% of 90% is 27%. Therefore, 63% of my total profile allocation should be to US stocks and 27% should be to International stocks. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that one of the best techniques to select US stocks is to attempt to mimic the composition of the stock market. Something to the effect of 24% Large Value; 24% Large Blend; 28% Large Growth; Mid-Cap Value = 6%; Mid-Cap Growth = 6%; Mid-Cap Blend = 6%; Small-Cap Value = 2%; Small-Cap Growth = 2% and Small-Cap Value = 2%.

&amp;nbsp;

Since I am only offered 1 Large Value investment option, I chose Vanguard Equity Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall). Similarly, I chose Fidelity 500 Index Fund as my Large Blend investment option, as it was my only choice at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall) and JP Morgan Large Cap Growth as my Large Growth investment option (again, my only option) at 28% of my overall 63% US stock investment (17.64% overall).

&amp;nbsp;

I did not have a Mid-Cap Value option, so I simply split the allotted 6% for this option evenly between my choices for Mid-Cap Growth and Mid-Cap Blend – 9% of the 63% US stock investment (5.67% overall) into Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund Class I (it was my only Mid Cap Growth option) and 9% of the 63% US Stock investment (5.67% overall) into the Fidelity Extended Market Index (it had a much better ER and performed better in most cases than the JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund Class I), respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

The only small-cap option I had was the Fidelity Small Cap Index, so I took the 2% that I would have put into Small-Cap Value and the 2% I would have put into Small-Cap Growth and put all 6% into this Small Cap Blend investment.

&amp;nbsp;

For the Foreign investments, I had read that it is advisable to put 81% into developed markets and 19% into emerging markets. I had no idea what “developed markets” meant, so I put 81% of the 30% allotted (21.87% overall) to International investments into Fidelity International Index (because its ER was way better than the American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund Class R-4, and the returns were similar). For the emerging markets allotment, I put 19% of the 30% allotted (5.13% overall) into my only “diversified emerging” option, Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets.

&amp;nbsp;

The total mix of investments are listed below; the overall ER is 0.259189:

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Equity Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) – Large Value – 15.12%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) – Large Blend – 15.12%
&amp;nbsp;

-JP Morgan Large Cap Growth (SEEGX) – Large Growth – 17.64%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index (FSMAX) – Mid-Cap Blend – 5.67%
&amp;nbsp;

-Carillon Eagle Mid Cap (HAGIX) – Mid-Cap Growth – 5.67%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) –Small-Cap Blend – 3.78%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index (FSPSX) – Foreign Large Blend – 21.87%
&amp;nbsp;

-Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets (ODVYX) – Diversified Emerging – 5.13%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX) – 10%
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = 1.092746%; 3yr = 10.572184%; 5yr = 7.110807%; 10yr = 11.37870%)

The AK pary’s ascension to power 2002 at first seemed to mark a major transformation of Turkey. However, over time Turkey fell into old patterns of boom and bust and non-democratic government. It is clear that if the new elections in Istanbul are free and fair, Ekrem İmamoğlu will by an even larger margin. Erdogan’s government, even when far from democratic, has always relied upon broad public support and a veneer of democratic legitimacy. Cancelling Istanbul’s election erases this veneer, even though the mayor of Istanbul isn’t in a real position to challenge the president. The latest decision making has made Erdogan’s erratic behavior more clear, and senior members of the AK Party are [threatening ](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/06/turkeys-president-erdogan-may-face-a-mutiny-in-his-own-party)to leave and form their own party. Ironically, it seems Erdogan’s attempts to centralize power in his hands has had only the opposite effect.

personalfinance,Just got $43k paycheck. Have debts - next steps? Need a strategy.,"I am 24 going on 25 years old. I am working in commercial real estate finance and just got a $43,000 paycheck. 

I graduated from grad school last September and have some debts as followed:

Income Taxes (2017) - $17,000 (not including penalties)

Credit Card - $11,000 (this is since gone to collections as I failed to make payments during grad school - I have received letters asking for a $5,000 settlement)

Federal Student Loans - $32,000 @ 7.0% 

Car Lease Penalty - $2,500

I’m an trying to figure out where to go from here. I was living in another country for grad school all of last year and pretty much ignored all my financial obligations as I no longer had an income to support the debt service. 

I live at my parents place on a couch and I am eager to move out. But I am cautious to proceed down that road for obvious reasons. 

Where do I go from here? I could conservatively anticipate making another ~$50,000 before the years end. Just need help rounding out my thinking on what to prioritize paying off and how much to keep to live off.",finance
personalfinance,Options for getting a loan?,"Interested in purchasing a plot of land. 13 acres of undeveloped land. 

Called the realtor there and she said it was listed at about $150K 

I’m in the navy, so I tried using navy federal and asked about getting a loan from them. I talked to the teller so idk how accurate it is. She said they don’t do “property” loans. And since there’s no house or anything really built on it, I can’t apply for a house loan. I’d have to do a personal loan which maxes out at $50K. 

How would other banks compare to NFCU and what would be my best option?",finance
personalfinance,How long should I take to pay $33000 in student loan debt?,"My take home pay is $3600 and my monthly expenses are around $2000.  I have a $9000 emergency fund. This is my only debt.  I put around $400 a month into my job's pension plan. 

So that means I have $1600 extra per month available. Should I put it all every month toward my loans? In a year I can pay off $19000 but I would be a strict budget.

Update: I have $19,070.02 loan balance that has a 4.2%-6.55% interest rate. The other $14,237.36 has interest rates of 3.15%-3.55%",finance

politics,Supreme Court Decisions 6/10/19 Discussion Thread,"There are many cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Gamble v. United States**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule the “separate sovereigns” exception to the double jeopardy clause.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court conducted a proper “holistic” analysis of the majority-minority Virginia House of Delegates districts under the prior decision in this case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, even though it ignored a host of evidence, including the overwhelming majority of district lines, which were carried over unchanged from the prior map; the geographic location of population disparities, which imposed severe redistricting constraints and directly impacted which voters were moved into and out of the majority-minority districts; and the degree of constraint the House’s Voting Rights Act compliance goals imposed in implementation, which was minimal; (2) whether the Bethune-Hill “predominance” test is satisfied merely by a lengthy description of ordinary Voting Rights Act compliance measures; (3) whether the district court erred in relying on expert analysis it previously rejected as unreliable and irrelevant and expert analysis that lacked any objective or coherent methodology; (4) whether the district court committed clear error in ignoring the entirety of the house’s evidentiary presentation under the guise of credibility determinations unsupported by the record and predicated on expert testimony that should not have been credited or even admitted; (5) whether Virginia’s choice to draw 11 “safe” majority-minority districts of around or above 55 percent black voting-age population (“BVAP”) was narrowly tailored in light of the discretion the Voting Rights Act afforded covered jurisdictions to “choose to create a certain number of ‘safe’ districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice,” under Georgia v. Ashcroft, or the requirement the Voting Rights Act, as amended, imposed on covered jurisdictions “to prove the absence of racially polarized voting” to justify BVAP reductions towards or below 50 percent BVAP; (6) whether the district court erred in ignoring the district-specific evidence before the house in 2011 justifying safe districts at or above 55 percent BVAP; and (7) whether appellants have standing to bring this appeal.

**Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in rejecting the Supreme Court’s state actor tests and instead creating a per se rule that private operators of public access channels are state actors subject to constitutional liability; and (2) whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in holding—contrary to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 6th and District of Columbia Circuits—that private entities operating public access television stations are state actors for constitutional purposes where the state has no control over the private entity’s board or operations.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act’s prohibition on the federal registration of “immoral” or “scandalous” marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

Would buying a car with a loan, even if I don’t need it, help solidify my score and yield a lower interest rate on a mortgage?","I’m in my mid twenties and starting to plan for buying a house in the next few years. I have excellent credit, but that is based solely on paying my credit card bills in full and on time. I was told that this doesn’t carry a lot of “weight”, for lack of a better term, and lenders could still view me as a credit risk despite having a good credit score. How valid is this statement? 

I was also told that buying a car with a loan and paying this off will help solidify my credit score. While this makes sense, is it actually necessary? Let’s say I have a score of 800: does how I got that score have any impact on what kind of mortgage interest rates I could get?

personalfinance,Beginner looking for help with retirement savings / IRA accounts,"Very new to savings and investments and looking for some advice regarding saving for the future. I (24) opened a Roth  IRA with my bank (Citizens bank) a number of years ago to get my foot in the door of retirement savings. Currently I have approx. $5,000 invested in this account. I recently started to work full time as a contractor for a company at $17 per hour which could transition into full time at a slightly higher pay rate with benefits including a 401k match. 

My issue is that the rate on my IRA is incredibly low (.75%). I have done retirement calculators that say even if I max this account out every year until I’m 70 I still will not see any sort of significant return. Are there IRA accounts out there that have higher interest rates I should be investing in? Also, would I be able to roll the money currently invested in this account over to another account without a penalty? I am apprehensive to get into investing because I have very little knowledge of trading. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,I want to continue school but I'm not sure I can afford it,"So, a little about myself: I did fairly well in high school, averaging a 3.7 GPA along with a few dual-enrollment classes (totalling around 12-15 hours of credit) and got a 30 on my ACT. Now, this allowed me to (quite easily I might say) get into the college that I was looking at. I got offered some decent scholarships, along with a federal grant as my EFC was fairly low (at the time of applying, my dad was working and bringing in around $50k and my mom making a few K for a family of 6). That has changed, recently, but more about that later.

So, I started off university by studying business. I thought I wanted to be a business owner/entrepreneur, so I took some business classes. I did very poorly. It was a mix of boredom, lack of self-discipline, and just an utter mess. I have no excuses except for laziness. This led to me getting below a 2.0 GPA (very shit, yea yea) and put on Academic Probation at my university. Going into second semester, I was going to try harder, but again my laziness got the best of me and I did very poorly... again. This landed me on my last chance of Academic Probation with the university.

I decided to switch majors as I realized business wasn't for me. I'm currently dipping my toe into Pre-Med (quite the switch, I know haha). To catch up, I'm taking a summer class. It just started today as of posting this thread. But as I was perusing my university's informational site, I noticed I owed $1200, due in 2 days. I obviously can't pay that (I have about $2 in my checkings and savings. I never learned to budget and manage my money...) With my school performance being absolute ass the last year too, I had a few of my scholarships revoked, obviously. But I really want to continue with school, despite my poor performance last year. Over the last few weeks and summer in general, I've been focusing on becoming a better person; managing my time, money (or lack thereof), and being more disciplined, and I'm really excited to tackle this school year. My mother also got a new job, so now my family makes a lot more money and it's harder to get federal grants and such as my family is seen as ""less poor.""

tl;dr - almost failing out of school, lost my scholarships and can't really afford to take classes but I really want to.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question(s) is pretty simple: how can I continue school? What can I do to be able to afford classes and continuing with my education?",finance

I’m 24.5 years old. My current income is 40K a year but I plan on working my way up to a role that pays 80k a year within the next 5 years.

By the end of this year, I plan on paying off my student loans (12K). I heard that once that line of credit is closed (my longest term credit line) my credit score may drop by a significant amount. I’m currently at 750. Should I pay it off ASAP or pay it slowly? My interest rate is 3.5 person.

personalfinance,Should we refinance our mortgage if we bought one year ago? (US),"Hi!

Our mortgage broker is pressuring us to refinance. I'm not sure if it's a great idea. 

We bought in April of 2018. We paid 375,000 for a 2 bed/2.5 bath townhouse with a 1 car garage. We're in Northern CA. 

We put 5% down with a 4.625% interest rate. Our Payment is $2659.58 including our HOA

&amp;#x200B;

Our broker gave us an analysis to refinance at 3.875% interest.  This would bring our payment down to $2381.34 including our HOA. So a savings of $278 per month. Half of this savings comes from a lower PMI. We don't have the money for the closing costs, he is saying we could roll the closing costs into the loan if we get a high enough appraisal.. 

Our property may or may not have gone up in value. (A similar home in our complex without a garage just sat on the market for 6+ months and finally sold for $335,000) 

My husband was not expecting to refinance so soon and has a problem with spending.  He just took out a $18,000 loan to pay off his credit cards.  We keep separate finances and each pay half of our bills, so I had no idea he had racked up so much debt. I assumed he was paying for things with the overtime he was working. (I'm going to be taking over his finances from now on to try to help him get this under control).

Our debt to income ratio is not great. He has a $400 loan payment, a $300 car payment. I just have a $150 car payment. We made $110K last year combined. I'm not sure we would qualify for a lower rate at this point. 

We just had a baby 5 months ago and this seems very overwhelming. 

I'm not sure if this is enough info but do you have any advice?

Edit: he let us know closing would be less than 4k! We would pay $600 for the appraisal and the rest would be financed. If the estimated savings is accurate we would recoup the closing costs in a little over a year. We plan on keeping this home as a rental of we ever decide to move",finance

solar,x-post from /r/electricians: Line side tap or derate panel for solar install?,"Hi all,

I'm a homeowner trying to understand my future solar install as much as possible.

I'm going to be installing solar while at the same time making some changes to the service at my home to power a new detached shop. My plan is to upgrade my 200a service to 400a. The house already has a 200a panel and the shop will get a new 200a panel.

My thought was to put a new load center between the house and the meter/load center combo, as a place to connect the solar inverters, as well as a future connection location for backup batteries. This would be a 400a load center being fed by a 200a breaker from the meter/load center combo.

My solar designer is recommending a line side tap to connect the inverters into the system, as it's ""easier"" and they don't need to worry about de-rating for NEC code.

My question is: wouldn't a 400a main lug load center, fed by a 200a breaker be ""de-rated"" enough to handle the load of two 60a input breakers from the solar inverters, a 200a branch breaker that will feed my house's current main panel (to have the ground debonded to make it a sub panel) and three future 30a breakers for PowerWalls (or similar).

I'll likely have 2x SolarEdge 11.4 kw inverters.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a visio diagram that I've created with my proposed design. Again, the solar designer is recommending a line side tap instead.

Diagram: [https://imgur.com/CEBHkOZ](https://imgur.com/CEBHkOZ)

Thanks everyone!

\*\*\*quick addition: As the solar inverters I'm getting are grid tied, they require power to be coming from upstream to generate electricity. As such, if I do backup batteries in the future, the inverters would need to be downstream of the Powerwall gateway (or automatic transfer switch) to actually be used during an outage from my power company. Wouldn't this alone negate the possibility of using a line side tap?",energy

personalfinance,Employer sent me sketchy tax paperwork for filing. Unsure if I should dig more or if I actually got off light.,"After years of filing extensions and doing my taxes at the very last minute, this year I was proud to be able to turn them in on time. However, when my main employer from last year (I do a lot of freelancing) sent me my papers, I discovered that there was something amiss. 

I worked doing polling for this company ahead of the election for two different 4 month periods. I could've sworn I'd been forced to sign on as an independent contractor but when tax season came, they sent me a W2 with a notice of only ~$250 paid in Fed taxes and showing that I only made ~$3000 across those 8 months. That's totally absurd. Now I knew in the second period that the main project manager was fired for falsifying/not submitting pretty much any employee paperwork from the beginning of the year, but was never informed if this affected our checks.

I'm wondering what the next best thing to do is. If I was registered as an IC I obviously would prefer to not owe anything, but if instead I was an employee I damn sure want a full refund of everything taken from my checks. But I don't know how to go about solving this mystery. It could even be that I did a 1099 for the first period then did a W4 the second time around (my memory's not the best, but lesson learned: photograph everything). Or it could be that I was W4'd from the beginning and the company either pocketed the taxes from my paycheck or whathaveyou, but I would still be eligible for a full refund.

personalfinance,"How much should I keep in savings, and what to do with the rest?","I'm in my early 30s, and am trying to get my shit together and make smart choices with my money. I have a great job which has let me coast by on not paying much attention to anything, and house ownership is sort of out of the question in my city, so I've never really put much thought into the future.

Right now, I take home about $4000 per month after Rent, Bills, etc have been paid. I have no loans or debt, and I've been keeping about $10,000 in checking, and putting anything over that into savings every month. My savings is sitting at around $80,000, and has a 2.1% interest rate so I'm getting about $120/month from that.

I'm wondering though, how much should actually be kept in savings, and what a good way to handle the rest is? I've been making out my Roth IRA every year for the past few years, and I've got some money in the stock market but I don't really know what I'm doing. Mostly buying and holding SPY which I'm at like a 2% gain over the last year.

What do I do with the rest? For those of you in similar situations, did you go to a money manager of some sort to handle investing? Any suggestions on banks/companies to look at?

personalfinance,What is more important. Credit Score or Interest?,"I have been having an internal battle and not sure how to answer this question.

If you had 4 maxed out cards at 15% interest and only making minimum payments with no end in sight, would it make sense to take a personal loan out at 18% to pay them off in 36 months?

According to credit calculators my score would be in 800s if I paid off all my cards.

My logic is after paying cards, and credit goes up, I can get a better interest rate elsewhere and pay off the first loan.

gaming,Any Hitman-Fans who don't like the new Hitman 1 &amp; 2 ?,"Everyone is entitled to his opinion.

This is mine:

I don't think the ""new"" Hollywood-Hitmans 1 &amp; 2 are even real Hitman-Games.

The play and feel like a Hollywood-Production to me, with more focus on puzzles and stealth, and less the freedom to approach your target with the weapon of my choice.

Gunplay is heavily discouraged since 47 dies much faster and ammo for the Silverballers especially is more scarse then in the previous Hitman-games.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing that fed me up the most was the lack of weapon-costumization and money-reward-system that let me upgrade my arsenal faster, depending on how good I played the previous missions!

&amp;#x200B;

No more gun-porn and upgrading weapons.

Not even dual-wielding your silenced Silverballers! (wtf!).

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if I'm maybe burned out.

Maybe the Story wasn't that bad, maybe a Hitman Game doesn't need a fully blown Rambo-Arsenal to have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I replayed Hitman Contracts and Blood Money after many years again.

And it clicked instantly!

&amp;#x200B;

There I saw what I have been missing: The great score-system Blood-Money had (with he newspaper-articles, scoring your ""work""!), buying and planning your gear for the next mission.

And the missions itself: A great way of total freedom.

You want to mow down really any and everyone with a silenced MP5? Go for it! You can survive if you play clever.

Tried the same in the later Hitmans and you die faster than you can say ""where was my Healthbar?"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I need to talk about the atrocious and annoying hand-holding for idiots in Hollywood-Hitman 1 and 2 ? X-Ray-Vision, state of enemies, target-info IN YOUR FACE the whole time.

I never felt ONCE I am in the belly of the beast, surrounded by danger, while carefully planning to shoot eyewitnesses as quick as possible in the head with my silenced Silverballer.

I felt more like a Sam Fisher who plays Dress-Up.

The missing atmospheric and masterful musical score from the first Hitman games did the rest: It felt empty, despite beeing filled to the brim with NPCs and things to see.

Just listen to this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ckHG4tNrOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ckHG4tNrOE)

and tell me any arse-trumped track in Hollywood-Hitman 1 and 2 comes even close to this!

&amp;#x200B;

And don't start with the ""Story"".

Demystifying Agent 47 and giving him a ""good guy""-Status destroyed the franchise imho. You don't need to justify him!

You can give him one missiona fter another, but giving him a ""reason"" or even a Story written by a 12yearold (Amnesia-Anti-Serum?! Rly?) is needlessly too much!

&amp;#x200B;

How can it be, that while Hollywood-Hitman 1 &amp; 2 have much more crowded places, they felt way more empty and lifeless to me, than the catacombs in Hitman Codename 47s Lee Hong Assasination ?

The better Freedom?

The better gore-system?

-35k of student debt, and have brought it down by $30k since graduating with $65k last year
-I currently have $10k in savings
-I put $2,500 a month towards students loans, with the expectation to be done this year.
-I live at home, and essentially have no living expenses. My mother is a saint, and is covering my overhead so that I can pay off my loans. She will 150% be receiving a trip to an island once I’m debt free.

For the past several years, I’ve shared an old hand-me-down car with my brother. He’s younger, goes to school across the country, and is taking the car back to school with him this summer. Therefore, I am in need of a car. I don’t drive to work, I take the train. But I drive around a lot: to the gym, to my girlfriends across the state (weekly), to my friends, and my girlfriend and I do a lot of weekend trips to visit friends in bordering states. In other words, I need a car. We’ve been together for 7 years, and intend on moving in with each other (into Boston) once she’s done with Vet school next spring. With that being said she already has a car, and we would therefore have two in the city.

I know this is a little all over the place, but I really have nowhere ideal to turn, as I am being fed different advice by everyone in my life.

How much should I spend on a car? What kind of car? should I plan on leasing? If I buy, should I trade it in next year, or should we plan on having two cars? Do I take money out of saving, I’m nervous to do that because we will be engaged within the next few years and the cost of moving in somewhere will be expensive. And regardless, I should have some sort of emergency fund. 

At the core of this issue, I’m so bummed I can’t keep putting $2,500 towards loans. I was so excited to have paid it off by the end of next year. What’s a good plan so that I can still pay this loan off in a reasonable amount of time? Lastly, I’m nervous about buying a car with high mileage and something that’s old and will need a ton of repairs. 

I think I just need some help with overall clarity, as I keep looking for the downsides of every scenario.

personalfinance,What should I do with +$1600 Graduation presents,"I just graduated high school and I have received over $1600 from friends and family. Prior to this I had only $1100 in the bank so this is a chunk of change for me.

I have no idea what to do with this money. I'm not moving out anytime soon. I am going to community college in the fall but that is already paid for.

I work about 40 hours a week making $10.50 (only since I graduated, before I worked 16-20 a week at $9). I drive a 1996 Subaru Legacy but I'd like to get a different vehicle eventually. This car is well worn (203,000 miles) and has required maintenance from time to time.

I was thinking about opening a new savings account with a better interest rate? The credit union I bank at offers a ""five for five"" savings account where you get 5% APR on the first $500. I already have $500 in savings and the return once you're above that threshold is very low. I think I have read on here that Ally offers savings accounts with 2.5-3% rates.

personalfinance,Help deciding refinance amount + cash out,"burner account here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have va mortgage on a home worth \~600k with 360k remaining.

Some unfortunate events have occurred. 

We have 120k in 0 apr credit card / personal loan debt now.

After the 0 apr period.  It would take about 1-2 years to pay off the debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are thinking about taking advantage of the low interest rates and refinancing our va mortgage to a 450 - 480k mortgage.

The interest rate would be at a 0.25% less than our current rate.

Refinancing would cost about 10k.

 

Our question is

Should refinance the maximum amount (480k) and have some wiggle room with cash or should we refinance the lower amount (450k) but things will be really tight to pay off the rest of the debt for about 6-10 months?",finance
personalfinance,"Was lied to by a sales associate at a T-Mobile store about a $20 upgrade fee, can I dispute this with my credit card company?","I’m not sure if this belongs here but didn’t know where else to post:

Apparently this is a common complaint received by T-Mobile customer service. I went in to the T-Mobile store near my home to buy my husband a new Google 3a XL for his upcoming birthday. The phone was advertised for $479 (same price as amazon), so we decided to buy it at the store so that he can start using it today. At this point we are not made aware of any service fees nor did we ask. As the sales associate is ringing us up I noticed briefly the monitor show a sub total of $499 and then it disappeared. When I asked the associate what the discrepancy is, (the phone was advertised as $479 why is it saying $499), he shows me his tablet showing that the phone is in fact ringing up for $479.

I was too lazy to do the math and realize that 7% of $479 should have only totaled to $512.  He then proceeds to tell me that my total is $535 with tax (a $20+tax discrepancy for an upgrade fee that he obviously did not want me to know about). I hand over my credit card and he prints up my receipt and proceeds to FOLD IT UP while telling me about their return policy of 14 days and their restocking fee. 

A couple of hours later I get home, unfold the receipt and noticed a $20 service charge on the itemized receipt. Furious, I called the store and speak to another employee only to find out that the person who sold us the phone and the Manager are both gone for the day and there is nothing he can do for us. I also file a formal complaint with T-Mobile only to be told that there is nothing more they can do for us right now. Can I dispute this with my credit card company? Or is there anything else I should be doing right now?

$20 is not going to break my bank but I am just so upset that this guy lied to my face when I asked him about the $499 subtotal. I was planning on switching to TMobile from my parents family plan to my husbands family plan, but after seeing what they consider customer service, this is no longer an option.


Update: Went back to store and informed the store manager what occurred. Was told there was no way to be refunded the $20 service fee, but was offered a full refund for the phone including the service fee, and they waived the $50 restocking fee. The manager fed me what seemed like a line, that they have been having issues with this particular employee checking out clients “too quickly.” Def confirms the theory that store managers are encouraging this type of behavior with their employees. He also asked me not to fill out the customer service survey that i would receive in my email in return for waiving the $50 restocking fee. 😒 I prob won’t receive the survey since they never asked me for my email, and its my husbands account not mine. 

Ordered a new phone on amazon, no $20 fee.

personalfinance,Buying a house sooner or later... we hate where we live currently and rather than spend a years worth of rent we’re thinking about buying this summer with a smaller % down payment. Good idea or bad/ impatient?,"Hello all. Me (29m) and my fiancé (27f) hate where we live (philly). We both grew up in this city and despite having plenty of fond memories, were at an age where were done with this city... too much parking, neighbors up your ass, no privacy, cramped spaces, crazy randos all over the neighborhood, etc, etc... we aren’t city people and want to get out ASAP.

I make 135k and own a property I turned into a rental a few years ago. She makes 45k. We are currently renting because we wanted to save up a traditional 20% down payment and our plan was to buy at this time next year... but we are seriously desiring the surrounding suburb counties more and more each day and want to be done with all the bullshit that comes with living in Philly. Our rent is $1,500 a month (full house with backyard) and we currently have 23k saved up... 

I was daydreaming and thought about going to the bank to get pre-approved and then beginning our house hunt this summer with a smaller % downpayment. Our ideal home price is 400k-475k.

Rental property mortgage: 170k
My student loans: 10k
Her student loans: 17k
Car loan: 9k
Commuter vehicle lease: $250 a month with 1.5 years left on the lease

personalfinance,Question about a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer Loan in Navient,"My student loans are currently being serviced by Navient. I’ve called them and they confirmed over the phone that all of my loans are in good standing (I’ve been overpaying them for months after I went through a rehabilitation program). I have also contacted the National Student Loan Database and had them confirm the same on the phone, including the loan details that I can verify on the Navient portal. Currently I have a consolidated subsidized loan at 6.875% interest rate with $20k remaining, and a consolidated unsubsidized loan also at 6.875% interest rate with around $28k remaining.

However, in my Navient portal, there is an additional loan, called “Steven’s Tuition Answer.” This is a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer loan that my father took out (not me). The original principal was $6,417 and now the current balance is over $17,327, as I’m assuming he never paid anything towards it and it’s been over ten years. I didn’t even know this loan existed until it showed up in my Navient portal.

I have called Navient numerous times to get more info about this loan but nobody has been able to help me, as they consider the loan a “charge-off,” which gets handled by a third party vendor. Since I didn’t take the loan out, it makes it even more challenging. I am looking for (written) confirmation that I am not responsible for this loan and that it will not impact my credit score (I do not see it on my Credit Karma account). How should I proceed to get assurances this loan that he took out won’t impact my credit score or that I will not be liable to pay it back?

personalfinance,Best options for a car refinance?,"I bought a car last year as my first major purchase, and even though I maintain a 700-750 credit score I didn't have any major loan history. As a result I was given an 8% interest rate on the car for an 84 month finance. The dealership recommended that I make payments for around a year and then seek refinance. Skip ahead to one year later with no missed payments and every lender I speak with say I should easily qualify for 3% interest rates given quick checks of my credit but after a full credit report I keep getting denied with the issue being unapid medical bills on my report from a couple years ago that are tied up in an insurance dispute.

&amp;#x200B;

At the current interest rate the value of the car is going to quickly go under what is owed and I can't really afford to make more than the regular monthly payments. I was hoping to get the lower interest rate in order to make the payments better and pay off the car faster. So what are my options to help in getting the car refinanced, are there some lenders more forgiving than others or perhaps going into a bank in person to explain my history would make a difference on loan acceptance?",finance
personalfinance,31M fed worker. Worth leaving a job I love for a significant grade increase but no raise?,"I'm currently a grade 11 federal employee, happy with my job, and receive a significant bonus on top of my regular salary.

I was recently offered a grade 13 position in my field at another agency. However, the lack of bonus at the new position would mean take-home wise it's essentially a wash. The upside is that the higher base salary would count towards things like TSP matching. Furthermore, there's the potential that I could then move to another position after attaining that higher grade, maybe even back into my old agency.

Am I looking a gift horse in the mouth here by trying to leave a job I enjoy and not even getting a raise just to get what amounts to a better job title?

I am trying to make some big changes in my life, and am a little overwhelmed with what steps I need to take moving forward with my Debt. I did read the FAQ, and the approach seems to be in general, pay interest rates above 4% as soon as possible. Right now I have $23,000 available to me. I am trying to decide what should be refinanced from my loans, if I should pay my highest interest loan now or refinance, and how much money I should invest. I have, and always will match my 401K because my employer matches. To me, it makes sense to refinance some of my loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $2k in interest, also wondering if I should pay that off, or because I am thinking about refinancing it does not matter right now. I am pretty disappointed in how much of my payment goes towards interest right now.

In hindsight, this was a bad idea, as I would've come out WAY cheaper just paying the late fees on my rent. Anyways, I signed up for a payday loan through Speedy Cash for $425. I didn't read the contract before signing (I know, major facepalm) and I've just come to realize that not only will I be paying back $1,309 due to interest, but also an additional one-time payment of $564.26 in principal and CAB fees. $1873.26 for a $425 loan, $119 out of every check I receive for the next 6 months. Is there any way I can lower this? Is there anything I can do at all to avoid repaying such an egregious amount? I know I really messed up by not simply *reading the contract before signing* but surely there's something I can do, right?

EDIT: I want to add that I looked in to refinancing the loan, but the Speedy Cash website is extremely ambiguous.

$13,000 in credit card debt at 25%

$12,500 in auto loans (2 cars) at 7% and 13%

$6,500 in personal loans at 40%

I know its bad, especially the personal loans, but I did what I had to do to get through college. My credit score would be in the upper 700s if not for my credit card debt but is currently in the low 600s.

The best idea I have right now is to take the following steps:

1. Pay off $6-7k in credit card debt to improve credit score
2. Get a personal loan at a lower rate to pay off high interest personal loans
3. Refinance higher interest auto loan or both
4. Open 1-2 new credit cards that offer 0% interest for first 12+ months and use those for buying while paying off other cards
5. Pay off loans starting with highest interest rate

During all this I'll be making the minimum possible payments on my student loans, setting aside a few hundred per month for emergencies, and starting to save up for a house. My first priority though is to improve my credit score so I can move my debt to lower interest accounts.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

This was a part of a larger getting-to-know-you conversation, and we haven’t spoken about it since. 

Today, out of the blue, she called me into her office to inform me that she had looked at the salaries, and that I was being underpaid for my work. She gave me a letter informing me that I would be getting a raise effective next pay period in the amount of an additional $3,000 annually. 

I’ve worked for this organization for almost two years, so that amounts to ~$5,000 that I’ve been underpaid over that time. How do I go about asking for that in backpay? I was too surprised at the impromptu 3 minute-long meeting today to initiate this conversation at the time. Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,"Questions about auto loans, buying another car when you still owe on a loan, and refinancing","I bought a used car a year and a half ago. Since then, my credit score has improved significantly. It's not perfect, but it is much better. According to KBB, I owe more on my car than what I could reasonably get for it, even with a private sale.  It's about 25% more owed than what it's worth. My loan's interest rate is currently 10.29%. I'd like to upgrade to a newer car in the next 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Is my best avenue to go through my credit uniion and refinance this car first at a lower rate, pay it down more, and THEN go through the credit union again to see what kind of a loan they can help with? I'm hoping to take advantage of the end-of-year auto buying. This was my thought, just wondered if it would be smarter just to try to pay down the loan as it is instead of hitting my credit again to refinance.",finance

personalfinance,"I really need some debt advice, my debt has become a huge mess after a medical leave and I don't know where to start","Long post ahead

So back story, I've been in debt for a few years but had it handled in a sense. There was a lot of it but I always paid on time and had a great credit score. The years I was building up to debt was due to having some pretty rough depression and I was using debt/spending as a coping mechanism. Back in October my depression got really out of hand and I was making a plan to commit suicide. Had a note written, a plan, everything. I decided instead of taking my life to take a leave from work and get help so I checked myself into an outpatient mental health center for 3 months which basically saved my life.

Fast forward to today and I'm doing absolutely great!! I'm happy for once in my life, working at an absolute dream job building race cars I landed a few months ago, I'm in great shape, I smile a lot now, and I haven't had a suicidal thought in 4 months. However during my time there I wasn't getting paid, still had bills, and was living off whatever credit I had left on my cards to get by but for the sake of my health I had to convince myself to not focus on my debt since it was a triggering stressor. Stupid I know but it's what I needed to do at the time.

Going back to work and getting on my feet after the leave was pretty rough but eventually, things started working out. I was mechanic at a shop with an abusive boss who made me feel terrible about myself regularly and the pay was shitty but I had awesome health insurance and a 401k and all that jazz. A few months ago I got sick of the bullshit and took a day off to job hunt and found the current job I'm at now.

Its a dream job, I spend all day working with race cars and talking with the coolest customers and making so many connections in the high performance car and racing world. It's childhood dream stuff and it's been incredible for my mental health. I get paid decently, 600-700 à week depending on hours I'm here however it's split half cash half check.

I have about 50k in debt including my car payment which is the only bill I've been on top of since my car is how I get to work along with being a big part of my social life and my hobby. My car insurance payments are 300/250 respectively and I spend about 40-50 à week on gas since I have a long commute though I get about 27-30 mpg on Premium gas(car can only take premium.) 

Now my other debt is the real mess. I have 15k between two cards plus 19k for a debt consolidation loan that's 1500 over due along with my 2 card being paid well below the min the past few months. I have some medical debt I don't even know how much it is yet but I'm going to guess around 5-8k, I haven't paid my federal or state taxes yet which are $1200, I probably have some other debts too. 

So where the hell do I start? What the hell do I do? I feel like I have a fresh start on life and I feel like I'm where I want to be but this is just a huge dark cloud I'm facing and just am lost. I put no blame on anything or anyone but myself for getting myself into this mess and I want to work to get myself out it.

Ive thought about a second job by my main job schedule is way too hectic to fit it in however I have access to an insurance payout from my leave I haven't cashed in on yet which I will do tomorrow, think it's about $2000 and I also have my tools I bought for my last job which I can sell for $1500 since I don't really need them at my new gig.

So yeah, just a good ground place to start would be amazing.",finance

personalfinance,Is this house too much of a dream for us? Financial objectivity needed,"Hello all, 

I need some financial clarity from objective sources. 

Over the past 8-9 years,  I’ve worked very hard to get rid of the debt my now husband and I had when we got together.  All in all, around 28k worth of debt at that time. 

Since then we have bought a house, outgrown it and have been looking at others. 
We also have increased our credit scores to around the 800 mark— up from bankruptcy caused low 600s for my husband and 620ish for me (starting out no real history) 
I have received two promotions and am in negotiations for another job that will bump me to the 100k per year salary.  It’s a done deal, minus the paperwork. I will have upward potential so I am sure in the next 2-3 years I’ll be making more. 

My current financial situation is as follows: 

Myself at 100k per year
Husband at roughly 50k 
5k in an emergency fund (planning to expand this out to a larger once we aren’t putting so much into a down payment fund) 
20k in a downpayment fund 
We sit at around 6-8k in our checking monthly
We are contributing but not maxing our 401k contributions, something that we will be changing in the future (new company will do match current company does not, husband works for current company with no match) 
My husband is going to be getting an inheritance of 30k this year, once legal has cleared it.  We plan on putting most of that (minus a vacation) in savings. 
We live in a part of the US where the average salary is 48k. 

No debt other than our mortgage.  I’ve paid that mortgage down 20k in the past 5 years.  Roughly 65k owned currently.  House should appraise for 110-120k range. 

Paid off my husbands truck
Paid off my car 
An everyday driver car for gas mileage that has no payment either. 

1200 a month is going back to our down payment savings per month 
I had been paying 1600 a month on our house to test how it would feel to make that large of payment — it’s fine thus far. So that’s 1k extra on the house per month. 

Now  we have found a house that checks off every one of our dream items.  It truly is a dream home for us. 

It is on the market for 345,000. We made an offer of 320k and got countered at 330k.  My husband and I walked away at that point because we had set the 320k as our max at that point. 

Now we are talking about possibly going back in a few weeks if the house is still on the market and I want to go to 330 to buy this house. My husband thinks that we might have looked at this house and went into dreamer mentality instead of reality. So he’s afraid to spend the 300+ on the house. Because he says it may not be financially responsible. 

So I’m here, hoping I can get objective opinions on if we are indeed dreaming of having something we shouldn’t go after. 

The breakdown of finances below: 

We are pre-approved for up to 450k via our mortgage lender. 

Looking at a payment of around 1800-2000 per month depending on the final sale price and using points for lower interest rate.  Already discussed with our mortgage lender. 

Utilities at the new house (verified with sources within the utility company) 
Water -50 per month 
Internet -40 per month 
Electric - average is 220, highest is 320 in the past year 
Trash- 15 per month
Insurance and taxes would be part of the mortgage per month

All the above is average to what we are spending at our current house minus the electric which would be a jump of 50-80 dollars for average/high. Of course the jump in mortgage per month. 

So my breakdown of everything: 

I clear 4746  per month
He clears on average - 2386 
Total: 7132 

Current situation bill total: 2,675 
Current going to downpayment savings: 1200
Current going to extra on the house:930 

Total: 4805 
Thus why our checking is growing monthly— we have shopped and spent more in the past few months than ever before, getting things we wanted etc since we had “extra” money so it could be larger than what it is if we hadn’t done that. 

New house factored at high end costs:
Mortgage: 2000
All other spending: 2,014 
Savings: 600 

Total: 4614 

Some costs go down, like storage unit not needed or internet costs reducing per month at the new house. 

If we had to carry the mortgage at our current until it sells- adding in the 670, 25 for water, 100 for electric. 
Total: 5409 


I need opinions. Is this house within our responsible reach or am I dreaming too large and going to overextend us? 

TLDR — looking at dream house. Need objectivity on finances so I don’t overextend is to accomplish a dream home.",finance
personalfinance,Is it a dumb idea to get a loan with a lower interest rate to pay an existing loan with a relatively high interest rate?,"Long story short, I took out a loan for an exact amount of $8,833.54 CDN to purchase a car with an interest rate of 11.450% (pretty high, I know). I haven't missed a single payment, and I have $5,739.27 remaining to pay off.  The length of the term for my existing loan is 36 months, and it was started on April 5th, 2018. My monthly payment is $291.14. Over 3 years, I would have paid $10,481.04 (291.14 x 36). Currently, I have no problem at all paying it off until the term is over, but I would like to save some money, like we all do, if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I check my credit score regularly with Borrowell, and it is in pretty good shape. I'm 22 and I make $40,000 per year. Apart from this car debt, I have no other debt and I have a couple grand saved up for emergencies. Borowell also offers personal loans, and I see that I am pre-approved for a loan of $6,000 (roughly the amount I have remaining, before interest I assume). This loan is offered with an interest rate of 9.14, which isn't much lower than 11.45. The monthly payments on this new loan would be $191.71 and term is 3 years...

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a viable option in any possible situation? What if I were to look at other options where I could borrow less with a lower interest rate , and end up paying less net interest on my original loan with 11.45%? Like I said I’m pretty comfortable right now and I would be able to pay it off with no issues over 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Go ahead and flame me for getting a loan with an interest rate of 11.45%. I was 21 at the time and I had no other real expenses as I still live with my parents. The car was my dream car when I was younger so in my mind it was worth it. Plus it was in mint condition with low mileage. I could also recuperate some of my losses by selling it later on as I rarely drive it.

personalfinance,What my next move?,"Hey everyone. Currently I owe:
$6610.98 in total credit card debt - $3700 was closed by Bank of America because of late payments. I'm working on a plan for this debt 

($2400 is deferred interest that'll be paid off before interest accrues fully)

$12,000 car loan

70,000 student loans

I make 60k/year and I've been using YNAB to budget for my bills each month and putting the rest toward debt. I've paid off nearly 3k in the last couple months after setting up a plan. 

I went on an income based repayment since all of my loans are federal. 

I have about $700 a month I can put toward debt after budgeting everything for my expenses, dining out, etc. 

Here's what I've got going on personally:

I just got out of a 3-4 year stint to where I was living paycheck to paycheck with barely enough money to buy groceries. I was swiping my card hoping I had enough for $30 in groceries. I'm now in a much better spot and my life has improved tremendously in the last 6 months. I've begun the process of paying down all of my debt and becoming financially secure. 

I need to get cavities filled and a root canal. Need to get eyes fixed up with a new prescription. I need a check up and a couple other things.

I'm trying to figure out what my next move is. I'm about to pay off a card in full this month which will leave me with the deferred interest card and the BofA card. 

Should I try to apply for a balance transfer card to transfer the BofA balance to stop accruing interest? If I don't get approved for the balance transfer card should I get a personal loan from a local CU with lower interest and pay that down that way?

For those of you that are financially literate and secure, what would you do? 

I'm following a debt snowball which would have me debt free very soon. 

Thanks for your advice and help!

so...I am 18 and going off to college at Drexel University for a five-year program for Architectural Engineering. Drexel really seems like a good fit for me but I need to pay 68,000 a year to go there, and that is with financial aid and scholarships. Regular tuition is nearing $100k a year. I called the school and they told me I have received the maximum amount of aid for my program but that seems ridiculous since both my parents are disabled and I have managed a 4.0 GPA all through high school. I didn't expect a full-ride but I also didn't expect this. I should also note that I have no money saved up due to job hopping for years, my parents have no money saved up, only $600 to help cover living costs and books and are now moving in with my grandparents as they could no longer afford living on their own.

I have confirmed my enrollment but I am considering withdrawing. I want to leave town like every high school senior but I just have this gut feeling that maybe I should go to community college since I am already enrolled. 

After five years at Drexel I would be $250k in debt if I didn't apply for scholarships. Drexel does have a good co-op program that can pay roughly $15k per year (for three years) to help chip away at the loans. I am also pretty confident I can get a job afterward. But with a starting salary around $50k, I am not confident I can pay off those loans. Maybe If I was making $80k a year but I can't assume that I'll be making that much.

But if I don't go, I feel like I would be wasting time and my potential(?). I have thrown around the idea of waiting a year to go to university but my family is super-against that option and I was told it is harder to go to a school that I would like. I have also considered ROTC but that only looks like it will help with federal loans, with which I only have $5k per year of, and living costs. 

So does anybody have advice on what I should do. I guess I am asking whether or not I should I take my chances with being $250k in debt or just try to keep applying to other schools even though there are not many with my degree? Can I even get a loan for that much (70k) with zero credit history and my parents having bad credit? Is it reasonable to assume I can work hard to pay off those loans?

cybersecurity,Could This Be A Data Breach Issue?,"Hello all,

I started a job about a year ago at a credit union and I really really enjoy it. We're fairly small, but operate nationwide. I work in our primary call center and the past 6 months have been interesting to say the least.

I began noticing a lot of people calling in because their account had been locked out due to too many unsuccessful attempts. That's easy to fix... Reset the password that's it, right?

It would happen to the same people repeatedly. ""I've been locked out 4 times this week and I've only tried to login once, how many tries do I get? ""...they get 3 password attempts before the online access is locked and they have to call us to reset it. They'd get locked out. Call in. Have their access reset. Then it would happen again and again. 

During these calls, I noticed that a lot of the usernames effected by this were usually really simple usernames. For example their first and last name... Yes our system would allow it. 

But then I had people call in that this would happen to and they had very unique usernames. So it wasn't just simplistic usernames anymore that were being effected.

At this point, as a personal decision. I'd instruct people to also change their usernames. This has fixed the issue for these individuals it seems. 

Skip ahead to a few weeks ago. We contacted hundreds, if not thousands of our clients. In the email/letter it stated that there were attempts to login to their account and they would need to call in to perform an account number change to protect their account. 


I'm not accusing of my company of covering up a data breach or anything. Possibly one of our partners did or maybe a very large company got breached and somehow that fed information about their accounts here. Who knows.... 

I just want some input from the cyber security community about this.",technology
stocks,Tesla Annual Shareholder Meeting live streaming is starting soon.,"Hi r/stocks! Brace yourself for a new shareholder meeting starring Elon Musk.  


Tesla's annual shareholder meeting [live streaming](https://mpcapital.ai/events/TSLA/shareholder-meeting-2019-06-11) is starting in about 2 hours (2:30 p.m. Pacific).  


According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the bears still outnumber the bulls: Tesla’s stock has **12 Buy ratings, 9 Holds and 15 Sells**.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shareholders will convene for the company's annual investor meeting in California, amid one of the company's most challenging months yet.

Since they last assembled in 2018, Tesla's market value has declined by more than 30% thanks to a failed bid to take the company private by CEO Elon Musk, which resulted in $20 million fines for himself and the company as part of a settlement with federal regulators.

In April, shortly after Tesla and the SEC agreed on new terms regarding Musk's social media usage to end the months-long legal battle, Tesla announced that four members of its board of directors will leave their posts after their tenures are up.

Some analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic on the demand picture for Tesla's cars after those same fears drove shares lower by 46% this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Elon Musk is expected to lay out the challenges facing his company and investors will be voting to re-elect two board members, as well as on proposals relating to supermajority voting and a public policy committee.**

personalfinance,What should I do next to secure a credit card?,"So after some disastrous life circumstances that led me to get into a lot of debt that went to collections, I finally paid it all off after 2 years of dedication.  All I have left is my student loans, which I have never missed a payment on.  My credit score went from the 400's to 670.  Still not great, but I figured maybe I could get a credit card.  

In those 2 years, I had gotten turned down every time due to good reason, so the only one I was able to get was a secured card from a local credit union because I could plead my case in person with somebody I knew.  

Now my credit score is 100 points higher than that, I have started applying for the worst of the credit cards.  Yearly fees, secured cards, high interest rate, super low limits.  I figured I would have a chance, but I don't.  All said I had too low of income (I make 50k per year so that was odd) or that I had too many collections (most don't go off my record until about 2023).

stocks,Deep Value - Qudian QD:NYSE,"Given the most recent volatility in the Chinese markets, I decided to not squander a wonderful crash and went bargain hunting, and will continue to do so for some time.

Recently, I initiated a long position on QD:NYSE (Qudian). In the past year, QD have repurchased &gt;25% of their entire market cap in shares. They're also growing at around a 20 - 25% clip, but have been priced for failure - despite all evidence to the contrary, sentiment is unbelievably bearish. Should the stock price drop (which it most likely will given the negative China sentiment), I have 2 more bullets ready to fire.

After listing at $30 in 2017, Qudian's value declined by more than 50% in one year, but this does not match their revenue or earnings trajectory. In 2014, they only had revenues of RMB 24,133; in 2018, their revenues grew to 7,692,343. During this time, they've maintained an EBIT margin &gt; 60% and have also gone from (169%) Net Margin to \~32% net margin. For 2019, they've forecasted Net profit of &gt;RMB 3,500,000.

**The two main reasons for selling off are:**

1. Fear of regulatory crackdowns by the Chinese government of the micro-lending sector
2. Loss of Alipay/Ant Financial relationship

The irony in all of this is that Qudian froze their own direct lending licenses back in 2017, and have been providing off-balance sheet lending via referral to licensed institutional partners for some time. Furthermore, the number of micro-lenders in China decreased from &gt;10,000 to around 1000 today - in other words, the crackdown helps not hurts Qudian, and this is evident with their registered user base growing to &gt;71mm with approved borrowers at almost 26mm.

Moreover, the majority of their institutional funding relationships are with major institutions and banks. They don't provide evergreen loans, and any defaults are reported directly to the PBOC, giving an incentive for borrowers not to default.

The loss of the Alipay relationship didn't phase Qudian much either, as whilst it drove a large majority of their traffic, it only contributed \~3% of their total revenues. What's also interesting was that after the loss of their Alipay relationship, the S &amp; M expenses decreased to 5% of total revenues vs. \~35% of total revenues, yet their Q1 numbers exceeded analyst expectations by &gt;40% (with their loan book growing 91%).

**Risks:**

Qudian is in a young industry where regulatory reforms are frequent. Furthermore, whilst they've maintained delinquency rates at \~3 - 5%, it's important to note that they guarantee in part or in full, any defaults incurred by their institutional lending partners (despite &gt;50% of their transactions being off balance sheet).

As of today, the PBOC has capped interest rates at 36% max. There don't appear to be any intention to lower this further, but if there are further cuts, this could hurt QD's profits.

**Conclusion:**

Qudian trades at a PE of \~4 today, and a forward PE of \~3. The combination of wrongly assumed regulatory fears and trade war/Chinese recession has beaten the stock down to its current lows. Having said this, if you have a stomach for volatility, I believe this provides an interesting opportunity for \~80 - 110% upside.",finance
personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to put down payment money into the market?,"A little bit of background: I have gone through the flow chart and have built up my 6 months savings and contribute about 10% to my 401k/Roth 401k. The only debt I have is for student loans, but the interest rate is 4% on one and 3.7% on the other. My contributions to my retirement plan don't max it out, and we also have a profit sharing plan, so whether I put money into it or not, I get the company contribution. I make decent money for being how young I am, but I do live in a very HCOL area. I am 23 and will be looking to buy a house in the semi-near future (7-10 years). I can put away between $500-$1000 every month (I am in sales, so it fluctuates) and am wondering where it would be best to put this.

My first question is, is it better to put money aside outside of my retirement for short-to-mid term goals or put more money into my retirement? If the case is putting into retirement, how does one save up for a house? If I put money aside outside of the retirement for a house (and a car in case mine breaks down, however it will be a very inexpensive one), is it safe to put it in the market to earn the presumed 7%, given my time horizon is 7-10 years?

Chase Freedom: 2K interest rate 25% 

Discover: 8K interest rate 25%

American express: 5k 25%

I got this discover personal loan offer for 18% for 25000 dollars for 48months

but Ive also seen balance transfer card offers that is around 18months

What would be the best way to deal with this? Should i just accept the personal loan from Discover and pay it monthly? 

Or apply for 2-3 balance transfer cards to pay them? 

What is also the best way for my credit in general?

personalfinance,How will deferring payments on my high interest loan affect the total cost of the loan?,"My wife just switched jobs, so we're losing about half of our income for June. Because of this, I deferred the next two bi-weekly payments on one of my loans.

The outstanding amount on the loan is about $5,000 (that's the buyout price), and my bi-weekly payments are about $200. The interest rate is something like 29% (Yeah, I know).

In the confirmation email I received from the lender, they state:

""The original terms and conditions of your Personal Loan Agreement as indicated by your Personal Loan Account Number above continue to remain in force. Making changes to your scheduled payments, including deferring any payments that are due, will impact the date of your last payment as stated on your original loan agreement.

The amount of the missed payment being deferred will be added to the balance of your loan and will become immediately due on your next payment due date.  Please note that this will reduce the amount that is applied toward your principal balance on your next payment, and potentially subsequent payments, which will impact your cost of borrowing.""

I'm not sure exactly how much longer I have left on the loan, but I think it's about 2 years. For safety's sake, let's say it's 30 months.

How severely will these two deferred payments effect the already outrageous total I have to pay back?

personalfinance,Expensive medical bill for minimal help.,"I'll try to make this short but to the point.

Essentially, I had severe tooth pain back in February that later needed a root canal procedure. However I had to wait around a week before they would take me due to scheduling. I've tried to cope with the pain, however I've lost almost all nights of sleep and its affected my work at a new job as well. One day a snow storm hit my area, and as luck would have it, a patient cancelled their appointment and my dentist was able to do my procedure that day.

However the main issue is from the night before. The pain was multiplied insanely that night for an odd reason and it was driving me crazy, to the point I asked my brother to take me to the hospital at around 3 AM in desperate hopes they'd at least put me on something to dull the pain. It was to the point I was shivering and almost hysterical with how much this pulsing pain was affecting me, coupled with very few hours of sleep, it was difficult to give them my information. They eventually take me to the ER to which I'm there for around 40 minutes before told to leave.

The ""procedure"" was apparently a dental block, however the physician barely injected me with the chemical, merely spraying it in my mouth, around 3/4ths of the syringe, so now I'm subjected to an awful taste in my mouth that will do absolutely nothing, before finally injecting me with it. The numbness lasted around 40 minutes, while short, I was in bliss the pain was finally gone. And then extremely miffed it had returned half way home.

However receiving the bill today marks me at $721.70, with none deducted. I'm certain my insurance plan should have covered **something**. Not to mention being asked to pay this extreme amount for next to nothing in terms of help, is there anyway I can dispute this? Or at most pay less?",finance

personalfinance,Finding the right liquidity mix?,"For some context; I'm 28, Male, single, I bought a house about a year ago, make $200k+.


I currently have roughly $70k in a high yield savings account earning 2% a year. Last year CPI was 2.1%, so at best my money is stale. 


Looking for advice as to the best way to have plenty of cash available, but not be losing money to inflation? What % should I funnel off to investments? Should I just do vanguard index funds and call it a day? Do I need to hold my investments for over a year to avoid short term capital gains? I'm extremely risk averse and liquidity is king in my mind. 


An additional consideration: I am likely taking advantage of the low interest rates and refinancing my mortgage, as well as plunking down the other $20k or so to knock off PMI. I also owe about $18k on my truck and toy with the idea of paying it off, but the interest rate is low enough that it really doesn't matter. 


Just looking to be a better steward of my money, because right now I feel I've more or less stuffed it in a mattress.",finance

personalfinance,Rolled over my Vanguard IRA to my employer's 401k but received 2 confirmations on Vanguard for it?,"So I sold all the funds in the Vanguard IRA (pretax money) so the money went into Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund) then initiated a rollover into my 401k. I received a confirmation for moving the entire money market fund as a check to the 401k company which is good. I received a confirmation for the check being made out and the amount subtracted from my funds. My funds have $0 at this point.

personalfinance,Best 3yr moderate risk investment?,"Hi!

I have some cash ($50K) that I’d like to keep around for a potential 3 year time horizon to help with downpayment on purchasing real estate. 

I am NOT committed to buying property, it’s just an idea that I’d like to be ready for if the stars align within my timeframe (real estate prices correct somewhat, I have free cash flow to support an affordable mortgage, qualitative considerations, etc). 

I know I can get ~2.5% from a high yield savings account or CD... and I know that long game returns from a stock index fund might be 7%. Since I might need the $ in less than 10 years, a stock index fund is out. 

My question is - how can I invest for a better return than 2.5% but less than 7%?  I’m not interested in a bond fund because as interest rates rise, the value of bonds will fall.  Should I consider individual bonds?  If I buy a portfolio of medium-high credit quality bonds (say, 5 companies at $10K each), I can probably eek out a yield of ~4%/years over 3 years... and by holding to maturity, I remove the risk of capital loss (but not default!). 

REITs are another option, but I think they will be even more volatile on the capital loss front. Are there any other ideas I’m not considering?  Worst case is I sock the $ in a savings account but growth at inflation seems under optimized.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my loans with my parents' Parent PLUS loan?,"Graduated with Bachelor's this past spring and am starting work as a biomedical engineer. Annual income projected around 62K, but it is a year long contract, chances are fairly high that I would be hired back full-time after the year. My Student debt situation is as follows: ~27.5K in subsidized/unsubsidized federal loans with interest rates varying between 3.76-5.05%. The standard repayment plan monthly payment would be 288 a month. ~10.5K in Insitutional loans from my University with 5% interest rate, monthly payment would be $111 a month. The tricky part is that my parents took out a hefty (105K) Parent PLUS loan. That interest rate is around 7-8% and the monthly payment would be 1600 a month. I want to help pay the Parent PLUS as it would burden my parents too much, however, the monthly payments for all of these loans would be a lot to handle. Is it possible to transfer the Parent PLUS to my name without consolidating through a company such as SoFi, or should I be looking into consolidating all of these? I know the risk of consolidating federal loans is losing out on the flexibility of repayment plans, just not sure how to best tackle the Parent PLUS loan.",finance

I was wanting to move to a bigger city about 45 minutes away. I’m 22 and I have a good paying job  that brings in about $800 a week. I have been working a little over a year and actually got a promotion within the company so my pay will go up to about $1000 a week in July. I’m about 3k in debt (which is at a 0% interest rate so that’s why I haven’t rushed to pay it off) which I plan to pay off before doing anything else. I have around 20k saved since I started. My question is should I finance a house or try to save up for 2 or 3 years and pay it off in cash. Once I’m out of training which will be a year and a half from July my pay will go up again to about $1600 a week. My job offers a decent 401k plan, a pension plan, and I get a huge bonus every year (around 15k or so). I live in Georgia which is not expensive to live in at all. The only thing with waiting that sucks is having to live where I live now for another possible 2 to 3 years.

personalfinance,First time contributing to 401k/Roth IRA,"Hello r/personalfinance, this is my first time posting here, please let me know if I'm not doin' it right!

I want to present some confusion I've been having about retirement savings.

I was reading the 401k FAQ from my the company I work for. I wanted to post the language used in the FAQ and confirm that I'm understanding ""maximum contribution"" correctly. Part of the FAQ in question:


(Replacing company name for privacy and possible legal reasons?)

-----‐--------------

""How Do I Contribute To The Plan?

If you are a new employee, you will be automatically enrolled in the Plan on the Plan entry   date. This means that elective deferrals in the amount of 3% of compensation will    automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you elect not to participate in the Plan or change or stop your contributions. Your Plan allows you to make elective deferrals up to 100% of your compensation. An annually adjusted Internal Revenue Service (IRS) dollar limit also applies. The dollar limit is $18,000 for 2017.

If you are a current participant and you are contributing less than 3% of compensation, then elective deferrals in the amount of 3% of compensation will automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you change or stop your contributions. If you are a current   employee and you are not making elective deferrals to the Plan, then 3% of compensation will automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you elect not to participate in the Plan or change or stop your contributions.

Your Plan also provides for automatic deferral increases of 1% annually, up to a maximum deferral of 6% of pay. See your Benefits Administrator for more information.

You can also designate your salary deferrals to a Plan account that accepts Roth after-tax contributions. In 2017, you may contribute as much as $18,000, in total, to all accounts (Roth after-tax contributions and pre-tax deferrals). Roth contributions will be included as taxable income to the employee. Earnings on the Roth contribution will accumulate tax free, and retirement withdrawals may be exempt from federal income tax.

If you have an existing qualified retirement plan (pre-tax), Roth account or 403(b) tax deferred arrangement with a prior employer, you may transfer or roll over that account into the Plan anytime.

How Does COMPANY Contribute To The Plan?

The Plan also provides for COMPANY to make contributions.

COMPANY will make safe harbor matching contributions of 100% of your contributions that do not exceed 1% of compensation, plus 50% of your contributions that exceed 1% of compensation, but do not exceed 6% of compensation. The safe harbor contribution will be made each payroll period. Other limitations may apply.""

END FAQ!





First of all, I'm not understanding if ""The Plan"" is some kind of unique saving program used by the company, or if they're referring to a regular 401k, seems like each company has their own unique 401k? I don't recall opting in our out of ""The Plan."" I assume they're referring to my 401k since I'm in the PDF for the 401k FAQ.

The main part I'm curious about, as it seems to be the part most beneficial to me, and the part that pertains to my main question here is ""How does COMPANY contribute to the plan?"" (my 401k)

This is a sales job, so it fluctuates, but I'm currently netting 2700 a month on average, so 32k/year. 100% of 1% of compensation is just 1% of my yearly gross correct? So 1% of 32k is $320 dollars, which is what they will match me annually, plus 50% of my annual contribution up to 6% of my annual salary, so $960 annually. If I am understanding this correctly, they will match me up to $1,280 annually at a maximum. Divide that by 12 months, ($106) and divide that by 2 ($53) since I'm paid semi monthly, and my maximum contribution per paycheck to my 401k should be $53 to receive the maximum match from my company. Doesn't seem like much, 1280 from me, 1280 from them, is 2560 per year. After 20 years if I retire that early, (I'm 24 so that's probably not realistic, not at this rate at least!) that's only 51k I've put back for retirement, if I'm even understanding this correctly! lol.

I can include other parts of the FAQ if all the necessary information isn't present.
Would really appreciate any clarification on this subject for my understanding. I asked my HR person directly what my contribution should be so as to receive the maximum match from our company, but she referred me to their FAQ on paycom, for legal reasons, I assume she's not allowed to counsel me on this subject, or she just didn't feel like it lol. Please let me know if I can provide more information from somewhere on my company's documents page if need be.

Btw, I currently have $40 per check going into my 401k, and $40 into a Roth IRA. I really had no understanding when setting this up, and still don't really. Just figured I shouldn't put all my eggs in one basked lol. Hopefully that was an effective, if simple solution, to a complex problem I don't fully understand.

Would gladly appreciate any input!

Edit: After checking the PF FAQ, I see that 10% is typically recommended, I have heard that before. Just wanting to make sure I am reaping the maximum match from my company, and just curious if based on the language in the FAQ, it is a good company to work for long term or not. 1% of 100% sounds like, but 50% of 6% doesn't sound so bad I guess. Maybe I'll go from $40 to $100 if they match that much? But then maybe drop the Roth IRA? Or double up and put $100 in both per check?! My draw at the end of the month will be pretty thin! lol. Lots of moving parts here! Too many for my understanding anyways. Thanks again in advance for any responses.

Post PF FAQ Edit: After reading the rest of the FAQ, it sounds like I can put as much as I want into a 401K/Roth, up to 19k for the 401k at least and 6k for the Roth, disregarding contributions. It's up to each person, where they see themselves in the future, and how much they ready want to save. My main question still stands though:

How much exactly will my company match me based on the language used in their FAQ?

As I understand it, it's 1% of my salary, and half of 6% percent... Or 3% after that 1% is maxed. So $53 per check, assuming I make 32k/year. This would be 2560 per year. Leaving me with only 64k for retirement after 25 years of work. I can save with the Roth too, but they won't match me, they only defer taxes up to 6% of salary. Which is still free money I guess, just savings from Uncle Sam instead of free money from the company. I don't know how toncslculate how much savings in taxes over time that would be, but it's better than nothing I suppose! Additionally, I understand that this shouldn't be the only savings for retirement that someone accumulates over times. Regular deposits into a savings account is probably a good idea, hopefully one that appreciates with interest?",finance

stocks,Stock Rally Stalls as Treasuries Climb; But Oil Drops,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/asia-stocks-to-start-mixed-treasuries-steady-markets-wrap

Stocks slipped globally on Wednesday alongside U.S. index futures amid signs the June revival in risk appetite may have overshot, with trade concerns still lingering. An escalating protest in Hong Kong compounded the negative sentiment, and Treasuries gained.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index headed for its first drop in four sessions, after shares declined across Asian markets, where Hong Kong led losses as police used tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse protesters who have closed roads in the city’s financial district.


U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said he’s personally delaying a trade deal with China and won’t complete the accord unless Beijing returns to terms negotiated earlier this year. Futures on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes all edged lower. The dollar drifted, while Treasuries advanced across the yield curve. Gold and the yen rose as appetite grew for havens. Crude oil headed below $52 a barrel.

Just as investor concern over protectionism and global growth seemed to ease, Trump’s latest salvos at China and the Federal Reserve introduced fresh uncertainty. With the president scowling at the central bank’s “way too high” interest rates in a tweet on Tuesday, traders will next focus on U.S. consumer-price data for clues on the Fed’s policy path.


“With no assurance that China will meet with the U.S. on the sidelines of the G-20 later this month, trade tensions continue to fuel market uncertainty,” said Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, an economist at FirstRand Bank Ltd. in Johannesburg. “Yet, the growing probability of Fed cuts is counterbalancing trade concerns. The matter is crucial to global growth.”

Elsewhere, WTI-grade oil futures slumped in New York after an industry report showed U.S. oil inventories swelling further. Hong Kong’s dollar climbed to the strongest level since December amid signs of tightening funding costs. Turkey’s lira weakened as traders pondered whether an interest-rate cut will come later Wednesday.",finance

personalfinance,PSLF and Loan Consolidation Question,"I have 9 DIRECT student loans, distributed between 2013 and 2018, totaling 130K. My first payment is due on July 1st. I’ve been working for a qualifying government agency for 6 months now and want to use the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to handle my debt. I make $51,000/year. I’m planning on applying to have my loans certified under the PAYE repayment option.

I’ve had numerous conversations with the folks at FedLoan Servicing and they seem to give me different information each time I talk to them, so I want to make sure that I’m taking the correct steps moving forward to ensure that I handle this debt in the most optimal way.

Here’re the questions I have:

1. Should I consolidate or not? – I understand that consolidation utilizes a weighted average for interest and erases past PSLF payments. I haven’t made any payments yet, so it seems that if I were to consolidate, I should do it now, rather than later to avoid lost qualifying payments. 
2. I’ve been told that I don’t *need* to consolidate since all of my loans are Direct Federal Loans. Are there any other downsides of consolidation aside from what I’ve mentioned that I should be aware of at the outset of my repayment period? It seems that I should because it’ll simplify things for me in the long run by only having one bill instead of 9, especially if I plan on remaining in the public sector for the next 10 years.
3. If I don’t consolidate will I be required to make separate payments on all 9 of the loans each month, or will it just be 1 monthly payment? Under PAYE my monthly payment should be around $300 – will this be distributed proportionally among the various loans? Can I control where my payments go to if my loans aren’t consolidated (to pay off the loans with the highest interest first, in case I move away from PSLF for some reason)?
4. I haven’t filled out the PSLF paperwork yet – should I wait until I have my loans moved to a PAYE plan and my loans are consolidated (assuming I go this route) before submitting this paperwork, or should I do it immediately? 
5. Is an approved PSLF form retroactive? – for instance, if I make 3 consecutive payments this year *before* the PSLF plan is approved, will those 3 payments count towards my overall 120 payments, or not? 

Thank you for your help! I know I've presented a lot of questions above; this is a highly stressful, confusing thing for me and I really appreciate any guidance that's offered.",finance

personalfinance,HELOC for funding a car hobby?,"YES, I already know this isn't the best financial decision, please actually read the whole post before you just scream no at me. I'm open to other options that don't involve taking $75k out of my emergency fund to pay cash.

Apologies in advance for the long post...  wanted to run this by everyone and see if my line-of-thought is missing some key factor or red flag.

I opened a $170,000 HELOC a couple years ago at 4.6%, it has a 20 year draw period and only requires interest payments during the draw period. We used it to replace our roof and do a couple other home projects and that's already paid off. So now I have it sitting there with near zero balance.   So......buying/flipping a non-depreciating car (desirable older sports cars), with a HELOC and paying interest only on it. Horrible idea? Anyone else do it?  

For reference, my wife and I are doing well enough financially, combined we make about $170,000/yr gross but we do live in a high cost area (Seattle) so it doesn't go as far as some places. We've got healthy emergency fund (18 months of expenses) and investment accounts, both have 401k's, and I am eligible for pension, kids college funds are fully funded, our house is worth about 2x what we actually owe on it, and we've got great credit. So we're doing pretty well financially IMO.

Now I want to be ""a little"" financially irresponsible but minimize the damage done while still being able to enjoy a hobby I'm very passionate about.

I have a problem that many car guys have, I like to change cars about once a year or so. Fortunately I don't need the newest/greatest cars, I don't mind (and actually prefer) older cars. So most cars I'm looking at are fully depreciated or even appreciating (964 911, 996 Turbo, E46 M3, E30 M3, early NSX, etc)  So, if I buy an immaculate condition fully serviced desirable optioned early 2000's BMW M3 6-spd for $17,000, I'm paying $840 in interest over a year period and about $1500 in tax. I'll drive it sparingly, maybe put 3-4k miles on it and then turn around and sell it in a year. If all goes well, no major maintenance, and I can probably sell it for the same, or more. At worst I lose a few thousand bucks, and I get to enjoy a great car for a year and then move on to the next. 

At the extreme end of the spectrum, I find a fully serviced great condition Ferrari 360 6-spd for $100k or so and do the same. That's just under $5k in interest for a year, and $9k in taxes, and *fingers crossed* no major maintenance required, and I sell it for roughly the same price. At best, I might even be able to make a couple thousand bucks since these are appreciating cars.  Note, most likely I won't buy a $100k car, I'll stay more in the $60-70k or less range.

Is this the absolute most financially smart proposal? Of course not! But neither is buying a new depreciating car which many of us do. I don't have $100,000 to spend on a 360 without depleting our emergency fund. On any traditional exotic car loan I'll be paying a higher interest rate and have to pay interest plus principal. I can easily afford to buy it with my HELOC and pay ~$450/mo on it for a year and then flip it for hopefully around the same price or more (make back that tax money). If it doesn't go well and I have to spend $20k in maintenance, I can afford to take that bath and not be any financially worse off than I am right now.  

I'm considering this an expense, NOT an investment. much like traveling, we never get any of our airplane ticket or lodging money back, but we still have a great time. But at least with this I've got a chance at getting most (or all) of my money back.  

What am I missing? Where's the catch? Which huge red flag am I not seeing?

My mind is NOT already made up on doing this, I'm considering it among other options to finance my car hobby with minimal expense. I'd appreciate any thoughts! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a new auto loan? (And also... how?),"I got my car in 2017 for ~$15k with a $1k down payment and now have ~$10k left to pay on it. 

When I got my car I was moving across the country &amp; about to start a job making about 35% less than I’m making now, with a worse credit score. As a result, my loan interest rate is around 7% from Bank of America.

I’m considering getting a new loan with a lower interest rate to pay off my auto loan, then paying down that new loan. Over time I would save on interest, but is there anything else I should be considering? Are there fees that would eat up the money I’d be saving? Is there a better way to improve my interest rate on my car?

* TSP 10% of my base pay which is about $480/mo right now. ~$10K total

* Emergency Fund $1.5k - I don't keep much because there isn't much that I could conceivably have to pay for. Unless I do something egregiously stupid, medical expenses are paid for.

Income:

* ~$5000/mo after taxes and TSP contribution which is ~$60,000/yr. My *taxable income* is $53,000/yr. I get a promotion in September, so my taxable income goes up to $62,500 in September. Not sure what that will work out to for after tax. I'm in a state with no income taxes.

EDIT: Didn't have my morning coffee yet, I wrote the wrong after tax income. Updated now.

Expenses:

* Rent $800/mo

* Utilities will change shortly but lets say $200/mo

* Food &amp; gas lets say $350/mo

I also have a few moves in the coming year which I will make a few grans off of. Next month I should make about $3k extra. My plan is to just dump shitloads of cash into this loan to get rid of it and then divert about $4000/mo of my takehome into various investments to catch up a bit. I am behind on retirement savings because I went to college at 24, graduated at 28, and I've either not been earning much or paying down debt since that time.

I can open a IRA account, but not sure if I should do Roth or Traditional. Also not sure what sort of funds I should invest those in. I have shares in FZROX which is an S&amp;P500 index fund from Fidelity. Not sure if an IRA should be invested in a fund like that because then how is that different from investing it in the mutual fund directly?

I don't abuse it too much and it hasn't given me much major problems, but I just want to position myself for an upgrade when it does start getting expensive and problematic.

I am out of college for a year. I graduated with a BA in Theatre performance and ended up with both private and federal loans.

I am currently over 100,000 in private loan debt paying $751.91 a month in student loans and it is crippling me.

As for my federal loan I have about 27,000 in debt there but I am doing the federal forgiveness program and because I don’t make enough in salary a year I’m not paying anything at the moment. 

My question is how do I refinance my private loan. None of my friends or anyone I’ve come across pays that much a month and I am nearly depressed and feel crippled because of it. I know my choice of major isn’t the most lucrative in regards of salary but still. I’m told I can’t do anything until my credit it better but I just can’t take that as an answer. It also doesn’t help that I’m living paycheck to paycheck saving barely anything. Most of the time I get the money to make a payment I pay more in interest than the principal. 

This private loan is through Laurel Road by the way.

Like I said I’m not really quite sure what exactly I’m doing and just need someone to break down everything about loans as if I’m a dummy because I really feel like I am. My parents didn’t go to college and their no help in this matter.

Is there anything I can do?

I am a first year graduate student (planned graduation in May 2023 with a PhD in biomedical engineering and MS in computational statistics) with a 30,000$ stipend (tuition is covered throughout the duration of the program), with no credit card debt (785 credit score, line open since 2014), an undergraduate student loan at a principal of 51,500$ (currently at 58,062$ including interest) and a rate of 8.625% through SallieMae. I'm currently able to save \~1,000$ per month after taxes and expenses. My University does not have a 401K plan for graduate students (that I am aware of), so I have been looking into setting up a Roth IRA through Charles Schwab. I've also started thinking about putting money into a mutual fund for investing (no clue which mutual fund to start with).   


My current plan of action is to try and re-negotiate the interest rate on the student loan to lower it to at least 4%, start making payments on it to at least stop bleeding money on the interest accrual (\~200$/month payments). Then use what's left of monthly savings towards the Roth IRA and mutual fund (\~800$/month invested for the future). Some of the calculators I found online gave me 7% returns on the IRA and 3% returns on the mutual fund in the long run (I'm not sure if these numbers are accurate), so I'd like to make maximum contributions to the Roth IRA before putting into the mutual fund. After graduation I should be able to have a well-paying job, but I'd like for my money to not just sit around in a checking account when I could be using it for the future.

stocks,The Boeing 737 Max grounding: No end in sight,"[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/11/business/boeing-737-grounding/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/11/business/boeing-737-grounding/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Boeing insists it is making progress on getting its fix for the troubled jet approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration, which it needs to put the Max back in the air. But the company has stopped giving any public estimates about when that approval might come.

The fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that prompted the grounding happened three months ago this week. At the time, Boeing extended condolences to the family members of the victims and said it expected a fix ""in the coming weeks."" That software fix is designed to address the plane's automatic safety feature, which is the focus of the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash and another crash involving a Max flown by Lion Air in Indonesia last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Those weeks came and went. After the FAA said in early April that additional work would be needed, Boeing again suggested it would be only a short delay and said the fix would be ""completed in the coming weeks.""

Months later, it's clear the initial time frame proved far too optimistic.

Asked Tuesday for the latest estimate for a return to service for the 737 Max, neither Boeing nor the FAA could give a time frame.

Boeing said it is now providing additional information to address FAA requests that include detail on how pilots interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios. Once that process is complete, it will work with the FAA to schedule a certification test flight and complete certification paperwork.

What's more, even after the FAA does approve a fix, Boeing will face the challenge of getting approval from more than 30 other airline regulators around the world. Those international regulators will have to be convinced that both Boeing and the FAA got it right this time.

""The technical fix is relatively simple compared to the political difficulties,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with The Teal Group. ""The need and difficulty is to get everyone on same page, and to assure international regulators.""

Airlines that have the 737 Max in their fleet now aren't expecting the planes back until August at the earliest. On Sunday American Airlines (AAL) canceled flights on its schedule through Labor Day. United (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) have canceled flights through early August.",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford a 400k house without being house poor,"Hello everyone,

Here is my situation, I've done some calculations and I believe I can afford a house (condo) somewhere around 400k (looking for something downtown Montreal), but my family seem to think it might be a little too much for me as a first house. I'm looking for advices in order not to be house poor after this major step in my life. Below is my financial situation in details.

&amp;#x200B;

Age:29

Current income: 79000$ + 15% bonus at the end of each year (can be more and can be less depending on how well the company  financial results are). I'm near the bottom of my salary bracket so I can be expecting decent raises in the next few years.

Debt: None (Though I currently do not own a car, I move mainly by public transportation)

Loan interest rate I could get: 2,69% fixed for 5 years (I work in the financial field, we have an employee rate)

Cashdown: I plan on putting 105k as cashdown

Extra savings: 70k (40k in stocks, 20k in my retirement fund, 10k that I lended to my mother to help with her mortgage, I'll get it back eventually but not within atleast a few years).

I'll most likely have to sell 50% of my stocks (20k) to pay for the closing costs and house furniture.

&amp;#x200B;

From my calculations, the monthly costs would be somewhere around this:

Mortgage+interest: 1350$

Property taxes: 300$ (3600$ yearly)

Condo fees: 210$ (2520$ yearly)

Electricity: 85$ (1020$ yearly)

By rounding up, the total monthly cost would be around 2000$

&amp;#x200B;

My current take home monthly pay is around 3200$ (+460 that goes into savings + 240 in my retirement funds). This means I would have 1160$ left after paying everything house related and putting money into my savings which seems more than reasonnable to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing any other important costs in my calculations? Any other tips I could benefit from?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit#1: This is a throwaway account because I did not want my financial details to be retracable to me.

Edit#2:  I've skipped a few details. I'm buying alone, but my life partner is moving in with me. I'm planning for the worse case scenario (we break up and I end up with the house alone). She will pay me a symbolic rent to be determined (300$/month most likely).

Also, this budget only includes housing costs. I'm currently spending around 850$/month for my current lifestyle other than on housing expenses (food, cellphone, internet, public transportation, gym subscription, going out, etc.) which would still leave me with around 300$ spare per month.",finance
personalfinance,Money still owing on car loan but repair costs keep adding up,"Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've gotten myself into a real shit situation that has been seriously effecting my mental health. I purchased a used car worth $14000 (Subaru Forrester 2011 165k kms on the clock at the time of purchase) on a personal loan from the bank (11.99% interest rate over 5 years - I know this was a dumb move but I'm locked into it now and trying to pay it back over a shorter time period). I required this car for my job and had no savings at the time, hence the stupid loan.

&amp;#x200B;

with this loan I originally was paying $86/week repayments with a $10 monthly fee over 5 years but I have since increased this to $160/week with a $10/month fee to try to get it paid off sooner. At this rate I will have it paid off in 17 months.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue at the moment is that the car I purchased has been an absolute lemon. Here's the past 12 months of repairs and service costs:

&amp;#x200B;

June 2018: 175k service: $630 - requried a DPF burn off which was an extra $200

July: Oil diluation error - new oil required - $120

July 2018: DPF dash light turn off (can only be done at Subaru Service centre and costs $115 each time): $115

August: Trip into subaru for DPF light turn off $115

September: New clutch - $2500

Januray: 185k service $490 (was completed at Subaru to turn off DPF light to attempt to save money)

March: DPF required clearing - $500

June: front wheel required new hub, studs and front wheel after shearing off going around a corner $800

&amp;#x200B;

So this has added up to $5270 in 15 months since purchasing the car on top of fuel and car repayments.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been stung with an unexpected $2000 tax bill from 2015 that required paying.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have $0 in my accessible savings due to having to pay the tax bill and all of these service costs but have $14500 worth of stocks which I are inheritance from my grandparents. My financial plan at the start of the year was to have $4000 in savings by the end of the year as well as $20k in stocks to go towards buying a house.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it is I have 4 options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pay off the car in 17 months and trade it in after that for a new/demo/near new car which I can get a warranty on. I would have to finance $25000 roughly for a new car which I think would put me under even more added stress but at least I will have the peace of mind to be able to drive my car comfortably.

Repayments would be $160/week over 4 years roughly

&amp;#x200B;

2) sell my current car (approximate value is $10000) and buy another used car and run the risk of it being as much trouble as my current car

&amp;#x200B;

3)Sell my current car ($10000 value) and buy a new/demo car and pay off 2 loans. the old loan would be paid off over approx 4 months and the new loan would be over approx 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

4) hold onto current car and hope that there are no further issues with it that will cost me money

&amp;#x200B;

See below current other financial stats:

&amp;#x200B;

Salary: $75000 before tax

Rent: $100/week

Car insurance: $105/month

Fuel: $90/week

Phone bill: $100/month

Gym/sport membership: $150/month

So I had been considering doing a refinance to get out of the PMI, but with the slight rise in interest rates(we originally got 3.5%) the difference between the extra interest and loss of PMI didn't seem that advantageous given the other fact that we hope to sell and move into something a little bigger in the next 12-18 months.

&amp;#x200B;

To add to the story I have quite a bit of credit card debt. Probably $15k but a chunk is 0% for roughly the time it will take to pay it off. Rough estimate of $7k is accruing interest, maybe a little more on the wifes side too, under 10k total. . I am currently quite capable of paying more than the minimum payments, but still not high enough payments to have it all paid off in say 6 months. Looking more like 12 months at this point. So I just saw an advertisement on facebook for a cash out refinance. Never even considered this before, even though I probably knew it was a thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

One last detail in case it is important, my credit is good 728-744 depending on who you ask.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that covers the details, now for the questions.

1. Refinancing would get rid of my PMI based on the loan to value ratio correct? 47%/54% normal refinance/cash out refinance.
2. A cash out refinance would allow me to pay off my high interest debt at which point I can either start making more payments towards the mortgage, build up an emergency fund, insert other better use for the money here.
3. Would it be dumb to refinance now if I plan to sell and buy a new house in the coming 12-18 months? Could be longer, but we'd like to move before my youngest starts/gets too far into school.
4. Not so much a question I guess, but I know I will have to pay closing costs, so i also need to do the research and math on how much I will save in credit card interest/PMI savings vs higher interest on the loan and the amount of the closing costs.

But ultimately I guess my biggest question is number 3, if its dumb to refinance if I plan to sell in 12 months. I assume the answer to that mostly depends on the amount of money I would save. Anything else I need to consider on that.",finance
personalfinance,Are there any sort of compensation options for a severely delayed domestic USA flight?,"Not entirely sure if this is the right sub or not, but not sure where else to go. My wife, 10 month old son, and sister in law had a scheduled flight with Allegiant out of a small airport in Florida, initially supposed to leave at 7:00am. Right before the plane was supposed to begin boarding, it was suddenly delayed until 5:30pm due to ""paperwork issues"". I drove back with all of our things because we obviously had an excessive amount of baggage due to taking a 10 month old on a week long vacation, but they flew so he could avoid the 13 hour drive. The only thing my wife has with her is a diaper bag with the bare necessities, and they were now expected to leave 9.5hrs later. 

The only thing Allegiant offered was a $50 voucher on her next plane ticket and a ""complimentary carseat"" since my wife opted to get a rental car rather than attempt to spend the entire day at a very small airport. She pushed them for more and they flat out refused, both in person as well as in the support line provided. 

As 5:30pm approached, the flight was delayed for an additional 2 hours. A flight that was supposed to be leaving at 7:00am is now not leaving until 7:30pm. She is potentially going to have to get a hotel for the night and get a different flight because there's no way our son can handle that late of a flight (by the time they would be home it would be around 10:30-11:00pm, and they initially got to the airport at 6:00am). To make matters worse, I go back to work tomorrow and wouldn't be able to pick them up from the airport if that is the case. Allegiant refuses to provide any form of compensation or reimbursement for costs incurred. 

From what I've researched, there are no federal regulations for reimbursement of delayed flights if it is domestic within the USA, but do we have any ground to stand on whatsoever? This is absolutely despicable customer service on their part, and I feel we are at the very least entitled to reimbursement of the additional costs incurred by the delay (rental car, food, etc.) nevermind the horrible inconvenience caused.",finance

personalfinance,Is a personal loan a good way to pay off credit card debt?,"I'm currently looking for ways to pay off some credit card debt, the current total being around $7,500. I've looked into getting a personal loan with a lower interest rate of the credit cards I currently have. The highest being at 22.74% at a variable rate and the other two at 18.24% fixed rate. So, would a personal loan be the best option? 

My credit score is pretty solid at 773, so I think I'd be good getting a personal loan. 

Another option I've considered is using an app like Tally or other credit card apps that consolidate the credit, under a one payment and a new credit line. The thing is, I currently have no problem making payments on time, or ahead of schedule. So, would these apps even help? Just seems there'd be a better way to pay this debt off quicker.

personalfinance,Using emergency fund vs taking a loan,"In general, if you have an expense that requires dipping into your emergency fund (appliance, sudden car replacement need, etc) -- wouldn't it be better to finance the expense instead of depleting your fund?

My thinking is, if you spend your e-fund, then have an employment hiccup, you are pretty much screwed.  Whereas if you make sure that any loans you take out don't exceed what you can pay of with your e-fund, then you are only out the interest for the loans.

I would look at that ""wasted"" interest similar to the cost of having insurance in this case.  That is, using an e-fund only for covering your bills during an interruption in employment, and making sure that any ""bad"" debt can be covered by your savings.  This assumes that you get a decent interest rate (0% for store card purchases, or 3% for auto, etc).",finance
personalfinance,Lower APR or Balance?,"Hello, personal finance. 

As of this Friday, I will pay off one of my credit cards, which I've been working toward for a very long time. When reassessing the rest of my debt, I am looking for advice on what I should be focused on more. I have student loans and my mortgage, which I'm saving for after the smaller debts get paid off. What I have remaining is this:

Personal loan - $3500, 8% interest rate

Credit card - $6000, 0% interest rate until August 2020

Auto loan - $7000, 3% interest rate. 

I know my debt is not as significant as some of the posts I've seen here before but I really want to know what's the best way to tackle this. Do I kill it by balances or interest? Worth noting - paying off the 0% temp balance by August of 2020 is not going to be an issue, even if that's the last thing I pay off. 

Once I get these smaller debts knocked out, I'm splitting money relatively equally between savings and student loans. Once student loans are gone, I'll be splitting between savings and the mortgage. Is this the best thing to or should I put less in savings and more toward debt?

personalfinance,US Income Tax Help Needed,"I’m trying to estimate post tax income as I’m moving back to the US and am trying to estimate my tax obligations. I had the following questions:

1. I own two homes, both of which I pay interest and property tax on. Can I deduct interest/tax on both homes?

2. Would the deductions be in addition to the standard married, filing jointly deduction of 24.4K?

3. Are state income taxes taken from your gross income or from income after all deductions (401k, hsa, insurance, etc)

4. Any calculators or spreadsheets that you recommend to estimate post tax?

I have been attempting to create a spreadsheet to help me with my estimates as this will assist in salary negotiations. Is the following approach correct:

&amp;#x200B;

· **Gross income**: $110,000 

· **State Income Tax**: 5%

· **Social Security**: 6.2% = $6,820

· **Medicare Tax**: 1.45% = $1,595

· **401K contribution**: 10% ($11,000)

· **HSA Contribution**: $7100

· **Student Load Interest Deduction**: $2500

· **House 1 Tax and Interest**: $6500 and $5000

· **House 2 Tax and Interest**: $5500 and $6000

· **Health/Dental/Vision Insurance**: $350/month

· **Standard Deduction**: $24,400 (Married, Joint)

&amp;#x200B;

**Taxable Income** = 110,000 – 6,820 – 1,595 – 11,000 – 7100 – (350x12) = $79,285

**Federal Income Tax**: \[19,400 x 0.1\] + \[(78,950-19,400) x 0.12\] + \[(79,285-78,950) x 0.22\]=  1,940 + 7,146 + 73.70 = $9,159.7

**State Income Tax**: 79,825 x 0.05 = $3,991.25

**Total annual take home** = 79,825 – 9,159.70 – 3,991.25 = $66,674.05

&amp;#x200B;

Is the above calculation accurate? Are the following assumptions correct:

· The house interest/tax and student load and standard deductions would be considered at tax filing time.

· When I do file my taxes, would the actual taxable income come out to be:

79,825 – 2,500 – 6,500 – 5,000 – 5,500 – 6,000 – 24,400 = $29,925, which would result in a tax return for the taxes I paid on salary greater than $29,925?

personalfinance,how to ask for a raise in retail?,"Hi, so long story short: i’ve worked since I was 16 (21 now) with almost all my experience in retail, particularly the customer service aspect of it. My first job with another retailer got me 2 years of supervisory + customer service experience and now although I’m at a “better” retailer, I still feel underpaid. My particular store is understaffed at my department, the customer service desk, and often I am asked to do a lot more than my original job description posted especially after I got hired permanently after starting as a seasonal. i’m a college student heading into my 4th year so right now I’m just working to have stability but recently i’ve have a major change of heart. With my experience I started off making 67 cents more per hour than the reg. starting pay with 0 experience. Once the store manager and my department manager decided to hire me permanently 3 months later, I got an additional 20 cents. I would go 9 months w/o any indication of a raise until 3 weeks ago when I got a mere 16 cents.

This agitates me because as I found out, the store’s starting pay has jumped up 52 cents just in the past year alone! my close friend whom i helped get a seasonal position there told me (I communicated everything with her privately) and I realized how close all these new employees are to my wages, if they haven’t passed me already. I have no warnings, great customer service reviews, no complaints and while I bust my @$$ for the store, they offer my same close friend (also a college student) a nice full-time position that needed to be filled. don’t get me wrong i’m glad it was her but now she makes exactly $2 more per hour than me and I feel underpaid and appreciated. I don’t want to leave the store because the proximity to my home makes it extremely convenient plus I don’t want to deal with new employees elsewhere if I don’t have to, but something has to give. 

I want to ask my manager for a raise and even though he seems to be nice I feel as if I will get screwed over if he says no, because common sense tells you if someone’s asking for a raise they’re not happy with their pay and are likely to leave, at least that’s how I see it. with my state and the employer being an “at-will” state I’m definitely not protected from termination either.

Based on the information we entered last night, it’s showing based on his income (around $21000/year), he would qualify for a $0 monthly payment. The loan is around $12,000 and has somewhere between a 4-5% interest rate. Current payments are $170/month and was manageable before we got married last month, but adding my car insurance to our combined funds added a little additional stress to our financial situation. 

I currently have no substantial income of my own (I’m finishing up a Master’s degree and will graduate next May) and am not paying on my own student loans. We have a savings account set up as backup but I would personally like that to be a savings more for a down payment on a house in the next couple of years. If we do the income based repayment, we’ll have just enough to pay bills and food and gas. Our monthly budget is around $1300 and we use $800 of that in rent/phone/car insurance. Electric is the only utility we pay for, all the remaining is included in rent, but we live in Ohio and the weather is too variable to have a reasonable estimate as to what the bill would average out to be. Winter is significantly higher, though. So taking away the $800 we use for the “necessary”, we have $500 to split between electric, food, and gas. My gas bill tends to be high because I drive 20 minutes each way to my internship site four days a week plus to class (around $75-100/month). His is minimal because he works 3 miles from our home. We’ve managed about $200/month for food but have cut back some this month. 

We only intend on having it in IBR for a year until I graduate and we both have jobs lined up for after I graduate, so we will make significantly more money come next year. We’ve talked about doubling payments to make up for the difference once we both can start working and making money. Based on our financial situation, would a IBR be good for us? Are there any negative effects on our credit for doing this? I know we’d essentially be deferring it, but shouldn’t IBR be considered a repayment plan and not a deference/forbearance?",finance

personalfinance,Home buying dilemma,"Hi everyone,

I posted a while back about selling our home and buying a new one and I'm here for more advice.

We got a buyer and are under contract. We expect to net maybe 22k from our sale.

Homes where we are moving are 135k, so max we can put down is 15% and we'll have to pay PMI.

Our credit scores are lower than we thought. SO's is 685, mine is 699. Our loan officer is offering interest rates of 4.0% for an FHA loan and 4.75% for a conventional loan. SO is trying to shop around for better rates.

FHA has a PMI of $84/month for 11 years if we put 10% down.
Conventional loan has a PMI of $71/month.
(This was with 10% down for a loan of 142k so it might reduce slightly with 15% down on a smaller loan)

Questions:

Should we wait till we have saved up 20% to avoid PMI, and maybe have better credit scores? The downside of this is interest rates might rise too and eliminate any savings. We'd also have to pay rent and possibly pay to break a lease in January/February. Not to mention moving costs and a baby on the way in December.

FHA vs conventional loan? We want to make additional payments and have the PMI drop, which wouldn't happen with an FHA loan. We would be stuck paying PMI for 11 years but with an ultimately lower monthly payment. ($40 less because of lower rates) It's also a seller's market with homes flying off the market and sellers may be reluctant to accept an offer with FHA rules tied to it. 

Any and all advice is welcome. We're 26, and the homes where we're moving can only appreciate since it's a college town.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Credit card scam involving FedEx and their lack of consumer protections.,"TLDR; Credit Card info was stolen and $999 item was purchased and shipped to my address.    The thief then set-up a FedEx delivery manager account and rerouted the package to a different (maybe theirs?) address.

About a week ago, I received a notice from Chase about a $999 charge to my credit card for a Chief Steam Cleaner (that I definitely did not order). After reporting it as fraudulent, they removed it from my transactions. Yesterday, I received a call from Chase stating that they had reviewed the paperwork with the company the product was purchased from and I would be liable since it was shipped to me. I had the burden to prove I didn’t receive the product. Thankfully, the Case manager gave me the FedEx tracking number.

After looking up the tracking, it didn’t show an address, just my city. I was very bewildered because I never received a product. And when I got home I found a mailer from FedEx thanking me for signing up for their “Delivery Manager” program. 

After 3 hours on the phone with FedEx, I came away armed with new information. 
1. The scammer had rerouted the package to a different address after it was shipped by creating a fraudulent Delivery Manager Account (this was key because it make it look legit to the bank, as well as the vendor).
2. FedEx would not give me the proof of delivery with that address because I could not prove ownership of the fraudulent account and “privacy” concerns...
3. ANYONE CAN SET UP A DELIVERY MANAGER ACCOUNT FOR ANY ADDRESS WITHOUT PROOF OF IDENTITY (just email approval).

In the end, I called the company the steam cleaner was purchased from and the owner Kevin (shout out to my hero) was able to dig into the transaction using his shipper ID and get the proof of delivery (showing a different address) so I could provide it to Chase and get off the hook for $999.

How could I avoided this? Not sure. Keep an eye on all transactions and be diligent about fighting back?

All in all, I give the following rankings.
- Chase: 4/5
- Kevin in New Jersey: 5/5
- FedEx: 8====D 

I plan on filing a police report, and maybe mail some dog shit to the other address.",finance
personalfinance,"Paying off Car Loan and Student Loan, worried about credit score.","Hello All,

I am on the verge of a personal finance breakthrough. I just paid off remaining  $3,000 of my car loan (woot woot!), and now looking to attack my student loan of about a $9,000 (final boss level). This these are/were my only debts. 

Currently I have three credit cards I pay the full balance on each billing cycle, and never use more than 10% of utilization. 

At last check, my credit score was at 730. How much of a dip can I expect, and how long will it take my to rebuild. Once the student loan is paid off, I will be more aggressively in saving for retirement and for a down payment on a home. I'm  hoping to start shopping around 3-4 years from now, and just a little concerned about the hill I'll have to climb up to rebuild credit score.

personalfinance,Previously unemployed for about 6 months. I was unable to pay CC bills and my credit is now shot.,"As the title states, I lost my job due to a merger between two very large engineering firms. I was a contractor on the IT team of the purchased company so my team was quick made redundant. All of the contractors on my team were basically fired on our way out of the office one night. 

It took me about 6 months to find another position and I was unable to pay my credit cards during this time. My credit score is now hanging around 450 and I don’t know what to do. I have been pouring every penny that does not feed or house me into my CCs, but at this point I’m worried that paying my balances off won’t improve my score all that much. 

My balances are as follows:
Card 1: $3500 ~15% 
Card 2: $500 ~20%
Card 3: $500 ~25%
Card 4: $250 ~25%

I also have some private and federal student loans:

Private loan: $8,000 ~10%
Federal loan: $4,300 ~4%

Rent and other bills come out to about $700/month

What are my best options in regards to raising my score? I am driving a 15 year old car with about 175k miles on it that I will need to replace in about 6 months (I live in snowy climate and my car does not handle the winter months well).

EDIT: All but card #3 have had the accounts closed due to non payment. I do not think they were sent to collections as I have not been contacted by debt collectors",finance

My question is should I pay more towards my student loans now over a shorter period of time or pay less now (with the pro being able to save more and pay off my credit card) but in the long run pay more over the course of the loan? Should I refinance my student loans for a longer payment plan with a higher interest rate or is it better to keep the current lower rate I have with the shorter term?

personalfinance,Debt Negotiation,"Hey guys, I’ve been struggling with paying down debt. Currently have ~$9,000 in CC debt, and a personal loan for ~5,000. I own a house, have a car, and am securely employed. I’m barely making my bills and looking for options. 

I contacted a company looking to consolidate the debt into one account with lower interest rate. I have decent credit, somewhere around 650. They are offering me a repayment plan at $298 per month for 3.5 years, I’m currently paying about $500 in principal and interest a month. Basically I pay the consolidation company and they disperse the funds every month to the lenders. My concern is that I’m being told that part of the process is for me to stop paying on the debt while they negotiate terms with the lenders. Is this common practice? I do not like the idea of just not paying bills. Is my failure to pay a negotiation tool they will use when they go to my lenders? They claim to have a long standing history and standard negotiations to proceed on.

politics,Megathread: US Special Counsel recommends firing Kellyanne Conway over alleged Hatch Act violations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal watchdog agency recommended Thursday that President Donald Trump fire one of his most ardent defenders, counselor Kellyanne Conway , for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity by government workers.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which is unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller’s office, said in a letter to Trump that Conway has been a 'repeat offender' of the Hatch Act by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are exempt from the Hatch Act, but there are no exceptions for White House employees.

The agency does not have authority to fire Conway, who was appointed counselor by Trump, so it would up to the president to follow its recommendation and dismiss one of his most unwavering defenders.

personalfinance,When should I replace my car with an electric one?,"Hey all,

Long time reader, and I live my life very much according to the principles set out here.  I've got my eye on a new car, and I know that I _can_ afford it, but the question is whether I _should_.  I've been thinking about getting an electric car for a couple years, but I haven't found one that I like until this month.  

Here's what I want:  2019 Nissan Leaf SV Plus, with a couple upgrade packages.  It has a MSRP of $43k, and I have a quote from a dealer for $39k.  I would also qualify for the $7.5k federal and $2.5k CA rebate, so I would pay $29k (plus taxes, fees, installation of a home charging port, etc).  

Here are my financial details:

* Married
* $290k income (joint)
* $500k in retirement savings (401k and Roth IRA)
* $550k in taxable investments
* $80 in cash and CDs
* $600k mortgage at 3%

Currently my partner and I drive a 2012 Prius and a 2001 Corolla.  The Corolla is fine, but it only gets about 25 mpg and it's not fun to drive.  I figure I can probably sell it for $3k.  

I guess my question is that I know I _can_ afford it, but I always get stuck because financially it's not wise to buy such an expensive new car.  It is cheaper to keep the Corolla.  But there's also the safety issue.  The Corolla doesn't have curtain airbags, or really any safety features.  The Leaf would come with emergency braking, lane assist, dynamic cruise control, etc etc etc. 

How do y'all justify when it's time to buy a new car (knowing that the old one still works)?",finance

personalfinance,5 Reasons Why You Should Use a Credit Card Over a Debit Card ALL THE TIME,"#**1. You get cash back on EVERYTHING**

Whenever you make a purchase, depending on your credit card, you can get anywhere between 1%-5% cash back in the form of points. This may not seem like a lot but it really adds up. The average return of the stock market is 10% so if you invested the 1% you save by using your credit card, and you let it compound, you will make a lot more money than by doing nothing. So why not take the free money?

#**2. You increase your credit score which saves you TONS**

Your credit score is EXTREMELY important. A good credit score will allow you to get the lowest interest rates whenever you want to borrow money (mortgage, loan etc).

A credit score between 760-850 will get you an interest rate of 3.64% while a credit score between 620-639 will get you an interest rate of 5.23% That is almost a 1.5% difference! This saves you so much money over the long term especially when you are ready to buy your first home.

#**3. You are using someone else's money**

It is almost impossible to become very wealthy by only using your own money and never other people's money unless you are born into a rich family. You need to use the leverage of other people's money to be able to grow your own money.

For example, if a small business didn't have cash to buy inventory, they would go out of business. However, with a credit card they can borrow the money to buy the inventory, sell the inventory, pay off the credit card and be left over with a nice profit. This is extremely important and this is how rich people get rich in almost all situations, **BY USING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.**

#**4. Fraud Protection**

If your credit card is stolen or if somebody makes a fraudulent purchase on it, you don't lose any money. The bank does. Your money is still sitting untouched in your checking account. Why does this matter? The bank will be a lot more interested in getting the money back when it is their money. It becomes a higher priority for them.

If somebody makes a purchase using your debit card, your cash is gone, at least for a while if not forever. Your money is very important and you want to lose as little as possible over your lifetime.

#**5. No foreign transaction fees**

This one speaks for itself. Nothing is worse than having to pay a fee to make a purchase while you are on holiday or a business trip. Why pay a 1% fee when you can earn 1% cash back by using your credit card? That's a 2% difference! Investors can only dream about making another easy 2% every year.

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I would love any feedback and if you disagree with ANYTHING I've said please feel free to leave a comment and I'd be more than happy to discuss my opinion with you.",finance

personalfinance,Question about mortgage cashback offer,"My bank advisor has suggested an mortgage interesting option and I'm wondering if there's any catch or if anyone has experience with this. He has presented me with 2 scenarios:

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1:

500k mortgage, 5 year fixed @ 3.02%. Monthly payment of $2371.36

&amp;#x200B;

or

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2:

&amp;#x200B;

500k mortgage, 5 year fixed @ 4.02% PLUS $25,000 cashback deposited to my chequing account on funding. Monthly payment of $2635.52

&amp;#x200B;

At funding, the $25,000 gets reapplied to my mortgage as a prepayment

&amp;#x200B;

For scenario 1, at term end, the balance outstanding is $427,537.24.

&amp;#x200B;

For scenario 2, at term end, the balance outstanding is $404,893.46.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we were to bump up the payments on scenario 1 to match scenario 2 ($2371--&gt;$2635), the end of term balance is $410,459.61, still more than the balance oustanding for scenario 2.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The caveat: cashback is clawed back if the term is broken/interest rate differential (penalty) would be higher if broken.

Is there any downside to this cashback and prepayment approach that I'm missing? If I'm not going to be breaking the mortgage for sure, is scenario 2 a no brainer? At the end of both scenarios, I'm open to renewing the term at any rate/term I'd like.

personalfinance,Advice for paying off debt and increasing credit score?,"Basically what the title says. 
What are some ways I can improve my credit score? I don't have any credit card debt because I don't have a credit card in the first place. I tried applying for the Discover It card awhile back but was declined due to delinquencies. Since then I've worked on getting my loans caught up and paying them on time (it was just one that was delinquent). Hopefully I can get approved for a card soon because I think that would help. 

My second question is how should I be paying off my debt? Are there certain ones I should target and pay off more at a time if possible? Basically I have three forms of debt; student loans (federal and third party), car payment, and hospital bills. My federal student lenders have worked with me allowing me to pay a pretty low income driven amount while my third party lenders are gouging me our of whatever they can get. My car loan is through my credit union and is automatically taken out of my account so never missed or had a late payment. I have a decent amount of hospital bills, some of which are in collections, but I have $1,200 in an HSA to go towards them. 

I can provide more details such as interest rates and exact amounts for each loan/debt if necessary. 

Any advice is appreciated, please and thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Advice Needed,"I would like know if it's a good idea to refinance my current mortgage. I am a first time home-owner and only had my property about 1.5years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current FHA Loan**

Original loan amount $560,000

Current loan balance: $520,470

Interest rate 4.5%

Monthly payment: $3726 ($2695 to principal and interest, $1030 to Escrow)

&amp;#x200B;

**Refinance option to a Conventional Loan**

New loan balance $530,000 (broker says to cover closing costs/ fund the new escrow)

Interest rate 4.875% (broker says conventional loans generally are higher than FHA loans)

New Monthly payment $3680 ($46 less per month)

Benefit: unused escrow funds ($2685) to be refunded. No mortgage payments for 2 months ($7452).

&amp;#x200B;

So looks like if we refinance we would get around $10k extra we could use for some home renovations and have a slightly lower monthly payment but interest rate goes up .375% and loan balance goes up $10k.  Is there any benefits of switching from FHA loan to conventional loan?

personalfinance,PSLF hedging strategy,"Greetings, my wife is a physician with 400k in student loans with interest rates averaging around 6%. She is about half way through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and I’m looking for feedback on my hedging strategy. 

For those who are unaware the PSLF program has come under fire because of the staggeringly low success rates. However, based on my research and our current standing in the program I am more confident than not that she will be eligible for forgiveness in 5 years. 

Background: 
Wife income - 180k base with 30-50k yearly bonus
My income - 120k base with 80-150k bonus

I’m not worried about the budget, I’ve worked that out and have our monthly budget built off our base salaries. 

We are maxing all relevant retirement accounts. 

The only other debt is her car around 25k worth and a house we just bought - 550k mortgage purchased just under 700k. 

My preparation plan in case PSLF fails us is as follows:
Pay substantially ahead on the mortgage - roughly 3500 extra a month to gain equity on the house while also getting a modest return on investment - mortgage rate is 4.25%. 

Save excess cash from yearly bonuses with a plan to have roughly 200k of cash in a HYSA in five years. 

When the time comes, take the cash and combine it with a mortgage refinance to extract 250k of equity and pay off the debt. 

I know we can afford to pay the loan off in a traditional manner but it’s worth it to me to try to save the 400k. But I won’t know if this all works perfectly for five years. How would you handle this?

TLDR: Wife owes 400k in student loans. What strategy would you use to offset the chance of PSLF disappearing within 5 years.",finance
personalfinance,"New job and didn’t negotiate, am I f-ed?","I’m a long-time lurker, but posting from a throwaway account in case my employer sees this. 

I recently started a new job (which I love), and realized that I’m likely significantly underpaid (I’m guessing about 10k/year under). I had originally applied for a different job at this company, and gave a salary request for that position when asked by HR. Months later, I didn’t get that job but was asked if I wanted to apply for a different (similar) job, which I ended up getting. When HR gave me the offer, they said that the budget for this second position was less than what I had asked for (for the first position), but they had “convinced” the hiring manager to honor my original salary request. 

Here’s where I made the mistake—I didn’t negotiate after I heard that. I realize now that it was a very clever move on HR’s part, and I should have still negotiated. But I was just so relieved to have been offered the job (was soon to be jobless after my master’s graduation), and I was (still am) really excited about the job itself. 

But now after having started the role, having a better idea of what the job will entail (including significant and somewhat frequent unpaid overtime, up to 70-80 hours per week), and speaking with coworkers, I’ve come to the realization that I was an idiot for not negotiating when HR gave me the offer. 

Is there anything I can do now? This company is not known for giving significant pay raises at annual review—usually a minimal percentage (2%ish) of current salary, so I’m not optimistic that I’ll ever make that up. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

I have been accepted to a private university that has a tuition of 36k/year for a 2 year nursing program.

THE CATCH IS:Because it is my SECOND bachelors degree, I am still considered undergrad and therefore I am not eligible for grad plus loans and thus also am limited in how much federal loans I get. I filled out a FAFSA and was only given 14k out of a 36k tuition leaving me with roughly 22k left to pay not including housing fees (will be living off campus).

Unfortunately for me, the ONLY person I know who could possibly cosign is my boyfriends mom who is a nurse with a credit score of 720.

I hope to receieve some wisdom I have missed/overlooked! My goal is to kill my debt quickly while starting (even if its a little) saving for retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

The job pays **$51,000** and the pension plan for my city pulls a required **7%** with a **2:1** match; I hear this is unheard of and a big reason why people work in government to retire. If we take this given out, my pre-tax income becomes **$47,430**. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some research on health care, I ultimately will be opting for a high deductible plan with an HSA. The city contributes **$1,000** **a year** to the HSA and I currently am putting **$50** **a month** into it (was unsure of how much to put in at the moment).

&amp;#x200B;

Since that amount is pre-tax, my new pre-tax income should now be **$46,230**. Bi-weekly being a bit under **$1,500.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have some school loans and credit card balances (The **0%** option for x months type) and I have calculated that I will need to put **$947.92 a month** into my credit card balances (I keep this up for however long my terms are, and once a balance is payed off I will put that extra cash into something (retirement or school loans)). This leaves me roughly **$2,000**, I pay about **$200** for bills and I plan to give my Mom about **$300 a month**. The **Final take home pay will be $1500** to leave for loans, retirement, and wants.

&amp;#x200B;

School loans total to about **$13,777.15** with only **1** loan accruing interest (**Balance of $479.15**) at the moment and the repayment start in **November**. The interest rates for these range from 3.76% to 5.05%. I will most likely do the **avalanche method** so I pay the least interest over time.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I am thinking about retirement as I hear this everywhere I go online and from coworkers twice my age, this cannot be overlooked! (According to everyone) 

&amp;#x200B;

I also heard people using their **HSA as a retirement account**, but I hear that can only be pulled for medical expenses when you're older (Obviously that will be more common with age). I am just trying to hit my out of pocket limit but also treating it as a ""retirement"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if I should open a 457 and contribute pre-tax income there or open a Roth IRA and contribute post-tax income there. Hell, or even do both? Put a little in each? I am not sure if I plan to stay in government my whole life, but people tell me here if I can tough it out for 30 or so years (Ill be 53) that it will be worth it.

[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-13/bob-hawke-boyer/11207418](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-13/bob-hawke-boyer/11207418)  
  Thanks well-deserved to the #ABCAustralia for firstly organizing and holding the #Boyer's, still happening, but as much for someone within posting this Lecture on Facebook, 40 years from it's first being broadcast.   
  Maybe that 'someone' or Committee, saw the need to try restore ABC's bruised reputation from last weeks AFP raid. And what better a 'tape' but this one, of one of Australia's two Best Prime Ministers? The other being, of course, Gough Whitlam. (In my humble opinion.)   
  I actually wept a few tears during the ABC's intro to Bob Hawke's Lecture, because I'd not known until now, that Bob Hawke was also educated at the same college my Surrogate Father, Allan Cook (born Allan Meredith), went to and graduated from. ""Perth Modern"", in Perth Western Australia.   
  Myself being 'produced' in Victoria, almost the cultural and political opposite of Western Australia, and having known enough about the raw and 'rooral' ways of most peeps from WA, I've long held that 'Dad' was the only redeeming product to come out of 'Sand-Groper' country.   
  But alas! I also gave Credit to Perth Modern for it having educated Dad, as Dad did too. Dad, was, and will always be, to myself ""The Greatest Man"" I ever associated with. I say 'associated', because not until some 6 years after he passed, did I find the facts about who my actual  genetic parents are. Two elites from England, whom I've never met, and have no recognition from them that I am their genetic progeny. Everyone I've associated with have been bought in to the conspiracy to build me, so none have ever admitted to me what they all know, about my genetics, and, maybe the hardest fact for me to process, that 'Dad', was in fact not my genetic father.   
  Therefore, the brutal truth is, that I've never actually ""known"" anyone, and so did not ever really ""know"" Allan Cook-Meredith, my 'Dad'. (More tears.)   
  Altho, for the record, I've long accredited Allan Cook-Meredith as my True Intellectual (and thus) Spiritual Father. Even while, best I discerned, he too was an Atheist.   
  Sorry for straying to my own tragedy there. Just filling the gaps.   
  So nevermind me, listen to the Man, Bob Hawke, in this linked #Boyer Lecture from 1979, speak about some still current if not more important needs for Reform in Australia's evermore laughable political structure and system.   
  ""Dissolve the 2nd tier of Australian government."" Plus his other profound explanations and insights into how weak the Australian political arena is.   
  As I've hammered online about of the last few years, all of humanity needs urgently to #DECENTRALIZE government to as Local as logistically practical.   
  Bob Hawke, in this lecture and thru his involvement in Australian politics maintained something of the opposite, of a stronger central, national government. But with improved authorities given down the pyramid to local governments.   
  So He and I are 'on the same page' in regard to what Australia needs to correct, or as he discuses, 'change'.   
  I've rarely bothered to go into the vital logical needs of such central government, focusing on the lower, closer to the People, Democratic issues, where Local people, where, I contend True Democracy works best, and only really can be maintained (with minimal corruption, basically).   
  But we all know that for every Local patch and such as Local Councils to be let to do everything government, themselves, without a body which specializes in coordinating all Local councils etc, begs chaos, and evolving differences in issues where everyone needs most of all to be in full agreement.   
  Hawke uses the 'war-time' notion to support, correctly, the need for a central government for such as our hundreds of Local Councils etc.   
  In this half-hour lecture, he mentions issues which are enormously more troubled today, 40 years later, on economic and (I think) environmental concerns, showing that he, but his cohort and probably many across such as his Perth college fraternities (and worldwide in most tertiary institutions), were then aware of the impending economic and ecological crises we are being sent paranoid about today, like the '6th great mass-extinction of the planet's species'.   
  As I listened, I thought about the crazy outcomes of Australia's May 18 2019 federal election, in which 'His' Labor party lost one of those ""unlosable elections"", basically to Aussies who voted for the 'extreme right wing' politicians and parties, the centrist Liberal-National parties which were returned very much leading that general 'betrayal' of all sane and intellectual policies and ideals.   
  And, I felt as I listened, that those who voted against Labor, for innumerable reasons, one being the catholic, that-is 'Rome's', control of the ALP, another being macho Aussies voting against the rise of the feminists in both the ALP and Greens, but maybe as much those who not so much voted for the nutjob marketing experts in the new government, but against what they perceived as threatening a lot of their ways, I felt that May 18th should not and would not have happened, if those who voted as they did, and returned the right wingers to government, had even a small amount of intelligence enough to     
1, sit thru a mere half-hour of this special Bob Hawke's Lecture,     
2, the intellect enough to understand but one-half of the issues he so eruditely spoke on, and    
3, the basic down-home rudimentary understanding that what Bob Hawke always held as Primary, the welfare of all of us, 'Impartial Politics"" if-I-might, is the only true way for voters to think and therefore to vote.   
  But no. :( One more of today's (modern western 'Harry magic underpants Potter' ""everyone's a witch!"") plague of banishing sane intelligent concepts from the pub's bar rooms, in favor of tickling the genitals with thrilling egomaniacal garbage, and of more stupor with ""MORE BEER!""     
  And more sugar....   
  The 'me-generations', mainly of the post-world-war-two western hemisphere, most all 'seduced' (hypnotized to be either insatiably avaricious, and or paranoid of not having too much material wealth, but certainly paranoid of speaking the facts and PROTESTING for them!) to being no more than 'free market' waged-slaves.   
  These aggressive assertive, essentially brain-dead me-me-me-generations; are peaking this 21C decade-2.   
  And so no sane credible, factual, provable let alone 'Wise' policies or even thinking, gets credit, air or contemplation-time in the minds of the fasscinated and anti-intelligence mammon-worshipers.   
  Encouraged as they are by the USA's 'civilian invaders', and their masters in nutjob cults.   
  Cults all, it must be said, out of 'OVER THERE!' in Europe ('Rome'), Britain (freemasons) and the USA, the Untied (typo) States of '#Slumerica's ongoing and incurably brutal gun culture.     
  ""Shoot first! Nah! Don't ever bother even asking!""     
  Because even 'asking' threatens having to listen to reason, to facts, to sensible non-violent Intelligent and IMPARTIAL Alternatives to being vicious genocidal idiots, who happen to also own and run the police forces.    
   
  So bitching to or about them usually only makes you plight worse, once the pigs round you up and condemn you to the courts.     
  Courts' judiciaries run by either the catholics, masons or illuminutjobs!     
  The Verdict? ""NO CHANCE!""   
  So, to remind Australians of how much they went badly wrong on May 18th, here's the link to one of Australia's two Greatest Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke (R.I.P.) The Immortal, 'spelling it out' plus more, on what Australia needs to have happen, politically, culturally, socially, but most of all, Intellectually.

Our goal is to get rid of PMI, lower our monthly bill and interest, and hopefully take out about 19k to pay off all of our credit card debt we've accumulated for renovations.

Over the last 2 years, our home value has gone up to around 545k according to Zillow but we are trying to be conservative with 505k as an appraisal value when working with the lender/bank.

    Title - Recording Service Fee: $20

    SB2 Recording: $225.00

**Total Closing Costs:**

**Monthly Housing Costs:**
    
    P &amp; I: $1,904.46
    Closing Costs Finance in Mortgage Loan: $1925.91/month

So the dilemma we are facing is:

1) If we refinance, we'd have to put the total closing costs into our mortgage because we don't have that money to pay up front

2) We hope our townhouse is much closer to what Zillow shows, that way we can actually take out $19,000.00 to pay off all the house debt we put on our credit cards.

Having said that, does this sound about right for a refinance? Do the numbers make sense and seem worth it? It's our first time doing this and I'm always so skeptical with banks and the quotes they send.",finance

* I cannot do the community college route. I lose out on mom’s offer. Not only that, but the ADN programs near me all have extremely long waiting lists and the school I’m looking at has already given me a conditional acceptance to their school of nursing.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Need help finding contact info for student loan being garnished from paycheck.,"I discovered today in my paystub from work that I have a student loan being garnished from my pay. This is the second check I have had money taken totaling just under $1000 so far. I’ve been working lots of overtime and typically have a pretty good idea of what I should be getting which is why I just now noticed something was off. Anyway, the person I have to speak with at work for getting more info is out of the office today and the earliest I would be able to speak to her is Tuesday.

I’m 31 and haven’t been in school for about 12 years. About 6-8 years ago I applied for student aid to go to school online and was declined  due to an outstanding loan balance. At the time, it was a loan issued through the university I had previously attended and the financial aid officer at the new school directed me to speak to the previous school about paying the loan back. I contacted them and was transferred to numerous individuals within their financial aid office. Each time no one could find my loan or determine who I should contact to establish payment arrangements. Being that I was young, dumb, and naive, I made attempts to figure everything out for several weeks eventually giving up and coming to the conclusion that eventually someone would try to contact me to pay it back if they really wanted the money. Fast forward to today where I’m now having about $500 a check withdrawn and never being contacted in any way to pay the loan.

Unfortunately I’m at a loss as to who I can call. From what I can tell there isn’t a collection for the loan listed on my credit report making it difficult to find a phone number. Ultimately I’d like to try and establish payment arrangements for the loan in lieu of the garnishments. I’m certain the loan is not private but from what I understood it was a federal loan issued by the school directly not necessarily the government which I didn’t understand and still don’t.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Company won’t let me transfer to another department without my spot being filled first,"Apologies in advance if this isn’t the right place for this - but I’m at my wits end and need some advice. 

I’ve been very burnt out at my job. I work long shifts, weekends, holidays and constantly receive texts and calls for help on my off days. It’s no secret my department is severely understaffed. It’s obvious why - it’s definitely a difficult area and already hard enough to hire for. 

Recently an opening in another department has become available. I really wasn’t planning to transfer at all - but timing seems right for me with life and stuff. I immediately went to our director to talk about the transfer. She told me that would be perfect- obviously an internal transfer would be significantly easier to train than a total new hire. I understood it wouldn’t happen right away - but I though 2 months might be a fair timeline. She agreed. 

I think spoke to my department manager and told her the plan. She laughed at me and said “yeah right - maybe in a year when I get this place fully staffed.”

This department has been chronically understaffed for decades (honestly again not the companies fault just the nature of the work). But I don’t feel it’s fair to keep me in a department that is sucking my soul away. I have clear seniority - I’ve been at the company for 7 years now. The other department really needs the replacement now. My current department is doing nothing at all to try and find more staff. 

It’s been about 5 weeks since my initial discussion with our director. I haven’t heard a single word about it since. 

My question is should I go bring it up again and be more forward? I don’t see how transferring departments is any different than me putting in my two weeks notice and leaving altogether. Seems like a better deal for everyone to just let me transfer.",finance

personalfinance,Paying Off Mortgage - Does Depositing Into HYS Instead Make Sense,"Thanks ahead of time for reading this. Here’s the deal. I have 6 months emergency savings in a savings account. No CC debt, no student loan debt. I max out my 401k contributions (like the federal max).  I put a little into a Roth 401k as well. And my wife and I have paid off car and we contribute to a 529 college plan for my 1 and 3 year old. 

So basically now the wife and I want to pay off the mortgage. I know that’s not the best thing to do with your money but we think we have everything else covered savings wise.  Here’s my thought. Instead of paying extra down every month or bi-weekly or whatever.  I am thinking about taking that same money and instead of sending it with the mortgage I will put it in a Discover online savings account that gets 2.1% interest or so.  I was thinking this would allow my “payments” to actually grow interest and we think we could pay it off in ~7 years. So I think I can pay off my house faster if I let the money grow (and not touch it obviously) in the online savings account and then once there’s enough in the account I would wipe out my mortgage in 1 massive payment. 

Is this a dumb idea?  My wife and I just put the first $5000 we would have sent to the bank in the online savings account yesterday but I just need confirmation that my math makes sense. From what I understand all the interest is amortized when you start a mortgage. So those payments you send to the bank early don’t affect the interest you pay in future payments. Doing it my way I am trying to kill the amortized interest payments as quick as possible. Thoughts?

Edit 1: my mortgage rate is 3.25%

Edit 2: after discussing with u/Werewolfdad and others I think I am totally wrong about how amortization works.  If anyone else comes across this post it is better to pay off the principal, they will apply more principal to your future payments according to this https://thefinancebuff.com/is-home-mortgage-simple-interest-or-compound-interest.html

Edit 3: Also u/Phillip_Jae_Fry provided a great link showing how he paid off his mortgage quicker and what happened to his monthly interest payments.  Thanks dude!

Edit 4:  After reading a little more about mortgages and loans I understand now.  A mortgage is amortized and the PRINCIPAL payments are fixed (not the INTEREST).  I always assumed the interest was fixed and couldn't be changed unless you pay it off early.  Thanks all, I hope my foolish question helps some other poor dumb soul in the future. 

Edit 5: maybe fixed is a bad word above ^.  I mean they create a schedule of payments that ensures at least $X amount monthly is applied towards the PRINCIPAL of the loan.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my loans or save for rent?,"I have a summer job and I'll be making about $4,000 from now till August. After current living expenses are considered, should I use the remaining to pay off some of my existing loans OR should I save it for next semester's rent? Key point is if I use this money to pay off some existing loans, I'll have to take out extra loans for the Fall to supplement next semester's rent. 

If I do take out extra loans for next semester's rent, it will likely be added to the balance of my current loans and the interest rate will stay the same. Because I'm a grad student they have been accruing interest since my first day in the program.

Im looking at going back to school and getting my commercial pilots license. The Cost of the course is 61,000 for tuition and training. I will be living in my own house during this time so no rent or mortgage, will be working a part time job on weekends so my other living expenses and gas is covered.

After school I have already been told I will have a somewhat difficult time finding a entry level job, but that I can take my instructor IV course and then work for the college training new pilots.

Cost of the instructor IV course is 10,000.

So total training costs would be around 71,000 which I would need a federal and provincial student loan.

I have looked up the salary of instructors in my area and it works out to about 20$ an hour. Once I build more flight hours I can then apply to work with other companies doing chartered work, or go to work for Air Ambulance, theses jobs pay 40-75$ per hour, but its never a guaranteed thing that I would land one of these jobs.

personalfinance,How to use a credit card correctly to maximize benefits,"1 - The first step is finding a credit card that is best for you and your situation. Do you travel all the time? Get a travels rewards card. Do you spend most of your income on eating out? Get a card that has only 1% cashback but gives you 3% cashback when you eat at restaurants. 

If you are a beginner getting a credit card then I would recommend getting a card with no annual fee. However if you spend a lot of money then it may be worthwhile to get a card with an annual fee since they have better benefits which can save you more money in the long run.

2 - Use a credit card like a debit card. What does that mean? NEVER buy ANYTHING that you can't afford to buy with your debit card aka you have enough money in your checking account. This will ensure that you never overspend and can always pay off your debt which leads me to point number 2

3 - Pay off your ENTIRE balance at the end of every month or even better at the end of every day. You NEVER want to be in the situation where you have to pay the 20% interest. That is insanely high and you won't beat that in any simple investment. If you have the time I recommend to pay off your card instantly every time you buy something to ensure you don't forget and accidentally be charged this massive interest rate not to mention damage your credit score.

4 - If you have a big purchase coming up, look into cards that have a cash bonus when you spend a certain amount in a certain time period after opening your account. For example if your phone broke and you needed to buy a new one as soon as possible, you could open a Chase Freedom card and after spending $500 dollars in the first 3 months you get $150 cash back. This is free money and you don't even have to use the card again. However NEVER buy something that you normally wouldn't just because you get ""free money"". At the end of the day you didn't make $150, you lost $350 so only buy what you would have bought anyway.

5 - NEVER close a credit card if you don't have to. It is much better to just lock it away and never use it. Closing cards lowers your credit score so leave it alone.",finance

Then I did my taxes and I was only allowed to deduct $4320.  The $1180 is still in my IRA inside of a fixed annuity.  Can I leave it there or do I need to take it out?  Is this considered an excess contribution or a non deductible contribution?   I believe on my tax return it says non deductible.  If I take it out will I only pay taxes on the interest the $1180 has accumulated or can I leave it there?  If I leave it there am I being hit with a 6% excess contribution penalty?   I have no plans to take any early distribution and don't plan to take anything from it till 70.5 for my RMD.  What will happen if I wait 30 years down the road.   Lesson learned as 2018 tax year and into the future I will make my contributions before the April deadline after I do my tax return to see if we are eligible to make the full contribution.  In 2018 I made a full $5500 contribution as it was allowed.  My wife works and contributes to her 401k so once we make over a certain amount you cannot deduct the full IRA contribution.   I spoke to the Annuity company we are surrender charge free if we request the withdrawal.  They are telling me to indicate it was an excess contribution ty 2017.  They will 1099 on the amount and they are telling me not to withhold federal or state (GA) income taxes.

I don't HAVE to move in 6-8 years if things aren't going right at the time, and having a paid off house would make life changes a lot less stressful.. but I feel like investing might put me out ahead where, in 3 or 4 years, I could take everything out of the investments, pay off the house, and potentially come out ahead due to any (hopeful) gains.

personalfinance,Need help deciding what to do with my upside down car.,"Hey guys,

First, a little backstory. I have a 2011 Chevy Cruze (sedan) with about 68k miles on it. I bought the car about 3 years ago out of desperation - I had no money, bad credit, an abusive partner at the time, and needed a vehicle to get to and from work (and just away). My previous car that was paid off had gotten totaled when I was rear ended, the insurance payout only covered my medical bills, and I was basically just in a shitty situation. I bought it for $16k at 8% APR with $500 down which was literally everything I had in my savings.

Well, I stayed poor and the car stayed expensive while depreciating in value FAST. I tried to pay a bit over the minimum, but it wasn’t always possible. I’ve also had multiple issues with the car, mechanical and electrical issues, and over the past 3 years I’ve spent about $2,500 on repairs alone. The car is now worth about $5k in its current condition and I owe $9k - putting me $4k underwater. It still has issues - some pump leak (estimated $800 repair), needs new breaks, needs some other little repairs not worth going into, but basically it needs about another $1,500 worth of repairs.

Well, a couple months ago I got a promotion that nearly doubled my salary, putting me in a MUCH better position to deal with this, and now I’m debating on what to do with this car. I’ve already paid off my outstanding credit card debt, and now my credit is almost at 800 (even being poor, I’ve thankfully been very careful to pay all of my bills on time). I’m tempted to trade it in for something new that doesn’t have issues, and just roll the $4k in negative equity onto the new loan and pay that down ASAP with a lower interest rate, however I’m aware this is probably not be the best solution. I’m just sick of dumping money into this car that has not been good to me, and honestly if a meteor were to crash land on it today while I’m at work I would do a happy dance. I’m open to refinancing it as well, I really just don’t want to have to spend any more money on repairs for a car that I owe so much on already. Also for what it’s worth, I have a 45 minute commute daily - about 70 miles round trip to work and home.

Please don’t judge me for my past situation, I’m a lot better off now than I’ve ever been, I’ve learned my lesson, worked really hard, and I want to deal with this the right way. Any advice is hugely appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on whether to refinance mortgage with current low interest rates or no,"A mortgage broker contact of mine from a professional networking group I am in mentioned that interest rates are super low currently.  I casually asked about refinancing and if it would be good for us.

Currently, I am 8 years in on a 30 yr mortgage at 4.375% $191k left to go.

He suspects I can get 3.875% on a new 30 yr or 3.375% on a 15 year.

Combined with my wife we have ~170k in retirement funds, 110k in taxable index funds, $15k in the bank, so we have cushion.  $40k debt in student loans and 10k in car loan.

We are likely to stay in the house for another 5-10 years.  I expect we will sell and not rent or keep the house after that.

At first, I was hot on the 15 year deal, as it was just another $220 per month which we can handle without problem moving forward unless there is a disaster regarding me or my wife's health or recession, etc.  However, this gives us less wiggle room for things like being safe if there's a new recession (I think my income would be pretty affected by this, though my wife may be more ok), would slow us down on some expensive updates the house needs/we want (new longish driveway, basement remodel), and slow down a tad repaying my wife's 6.5% student loans.

The 30 year is less than we are paying now, obviously, and I think I've calculated it so that if I just pay extra, making payments equivalent to what we pay monthly now, in 5 years we'd have paid a couple grand more into the principle than I would have on my current loan.  However, I'll have paid a few $k in closing costs so this is sort of a wash.

After 5 years, it seems it would be paying off more, and it also gives us a lot of flexibility and safety because if we hit hard times or decide to pay more into my wife's loans, we can pay less on the mortgage temporarily.  

I'm leaning towards the 30 yr for the flexibility. Am I considering things in the right way?  I haven't really thought much about mortgages since I bought the house (and I didn't really know much at that time either!)

Thanks for any feedback.

Edit: I guess a key question is, what should be priority - creating house equity effectively, or paying off wife's 6.5% student loans?",finance
personalfinance,I created a model to determine if putting 10% or 20% down is better on your mortgage.,"Edit: I found an error in the calculations see the bottom

My SO and I just got preapproved for a mortgage, 25 yr amortization (or less if we want), 4 year fixed at 2.79% for 10% down and 20% down.  When Putting 20% down there is no insurance requirements (works out to an extra 14k).  I created a spread sheet to determine what is better.  The assumptions are:

-We have 100k ready for a down payment and whatever we don't put down will go into tax advantaged investment accounts.

-We budgeted and determined we can afford 3k per month on mortgage payments and whatever isn't paid into mortgage payments will go into tax advantaged investment accounts until they are maxed out then move over to non registered taxable investment accounts.

-I assumed an average market return of 3.5%.

Here are the results:

https://imgur.com/a/aE3WLbj

The second photo with the colored areas on the spread sheet is what I want to focus on.  This column = Monthly Payment*number of payments(300 for 25 year monthly) + down payment - invested amount after 25 years(compounded annually) 

Is there something wrong with my analysis? It seems odd that you are saving approx. 54k after 25 years by putting 10% down and investing more right away even when you pay the extra 14k on insurance.  This gap only increases if market returns increase (128k difference if you get an average of 6% return). Again the gap only increases when you put less down as well because there is a larger lump sum increases at the beginning.  I thought that by having a lower monthly payment and investing the difference would have a larger effect on the total amount after 25 years but I guess the lump sum at the beginning makes the biggest difference.  The other strange thing is if you assume a 0% market return it is still 1k cheaper over 25 years to go with the 10% down even with the extra costs.  

For fun I put in an 11% interest rate and with 5.3% market returns both down payments will have the same colored column value (cross over point).

Edit:I found my error. This year amount=previous year amount(1+interest rate)+(3000-monthly mortgage) Should have been This year amount=previous year amount(1+interest rate)+(3000-monthly mortgage)*12

Now the results are if you can get an average rate of return of 7% or more it is better to put 10% down, otherwise it is better to put 20% down.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth paying off my mortgage early?,"I'm 38 and am starting to get down to brass tacks regarding my retirement.  I've got a couple hundred thousand in retirement funds and recently started to max out my Roth and my wife's Roth each year as well as contributing about 8k a year to my 401k.  I also am a co-owner of a couple of rental properties.  I have about 40k in liquid assets right now with the intention of buying more rental properties soon.  In the last year or so I have been aggressively paying down debt and wiped out my wife's student loans and my car note.  The only debt we have now is 9,500 on the wife's car at 1.7% and 112k at 3.5% on our house.  I'm excluding the mortgages and income from the rental properties, as I don't really touch any of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've wiped out most of our debt obligations, I want to aggressively pay down my mortgage and throw another $550 a month towards it so it'll be paid off by mid-2028.  My dad always told me it is dumb to pay down such a low interest rate when you could be earning a better return by investing that money, but doesn't the size of the principal matter?  There is also the fact that having no mortgage in 10 years opens up all sorts of other possibilities.  My plan is to aggressively pay down remaining car note and wipe that out by the end of next year.  After that, I'll up my 401k contribution by another 7k a year.  Even in doing all this, I should still be able to save about 15k year with that number growing with each rental property.  Am I being foolish by paying down my mortgage so quickly?  I know you can write off the interest and it's relatively easy to beat 3.5% with investing, but the psychological aspect of having a paid off house looms in my mind.",finance
personalfinance,Question on getting new credit card,"A little background: my boyfriend and I closed on a house last month and have 3-5 years left on our auto loans. Neither of us have any credit card debt. 

I currently have 2 credit cards which are always paid off in full before the end of the month on the occasions that I use the cards-

One with a $2,500 limit and a small amount of points rewards only able to be used at a large tack store (horseback riding equipment, riding clothes etc). I’ve had this card &lt; 1 year and hardly ever use it since it’s at a small company and only has a website that’s not super user friendly.
Second card has a $1,500 limit and higher interest rate. This was my first card and the one recommended to people who had no credit score as a way to build the credit score. I like using this card because it has a user friendly app and is a big company. 

I would like to get rid of card #1 and get a card with cash rewards to use on all daily purchases while paying the card off before the end of the month. I’m concerned that if I cancel card #1 my score will tank since I’ll lose $2500 of available credit. Also concerned about if I apply for a new card I will get denied since it may think I am trying to get more available credit than I can pay off.

Should I cancel card #1 then apply for a new card, or apply for a new card and then once it’s approved cancel card #1? I’m sure either way it’s going to bring my score down, but now would be the time to do it since we’ve already closed on our house I’m thinking?",finance

Ill try to fill whomever it concerns in as best as I can with what has been going on sat my place of work. I started working for a rental car agency (Enterprise) on May 15th, and I was hired on on May 5th. We get paid bi-weekly, so every other Friday. The first pay period came around and everyone received a check but me. I asked my manager why and she was not much help, she didn't know. She emailed someone at our admin office about why I wasn't getting paid, but that was about the extent of her help. She would do this every two days.

I continued to work for another week after that, emailing and calling everyone I could to figure out why I wasn't getting paid. I am a 20 year old college student (so I know very little about how to go about this) renting an apt for $400 a month, so I am very desperate for the money, as I do not want to be late on rent payment. 

fast forward 10 days from the initial pay period. I finally got in contact with someone at our admin office, and he had no idea why I wasn't getting paid either, he said he would call me back when he figured it out. (still have yet to receive a call).

So finally I had it, I told my manager I wasn't going into work until I had a check in my hand or proof I would get a check. This sparked the manager to do something (as we are understaffed). I was told the problem was taken care of, so returned after missing one day only to find that it was not taken care of. 

Next, I contacted the department of labor to submit a claim for my unpaid wages (I have followed up with them and was told I would be in contact with someone on Monday (6/17). Once I told my manager this, she gave me a date when my check should arrive (6/7). No check. she then told me Monday my check would arrive, giving me her word (6/9). No check. Finally, she told me my check would be in the mail today with the amount for the current pay period and last pay period. No check. 

I had to dip into my savings to pay rent for this month, which I am still uneasy about doing. My question would be, what can I do from here? I am owed just over $2000 before taxes, and I have been told by my parents that getting a lawyer involved would just cost me more money than I am owed. What should be my next move be?

I have a Direct Loan that I neglected for some time. I have the money to pay the amount $1,700 in full. The loan was taken in 2002 and reported delinquent in 2013.

My credit report lists this item as having been transferred to a collections agency in 2014.

My questions: As I understood it, there is no forgiving of Federal Student Loans, and as such, I thought that the only way to get this off my report was to pay the amount in full. However, the report states **""Estimated month and year this item will be removed: 08/2020""** I'm thinking this means that the item will fall off my report but that the SOL for collecting the debt may be indefinite.

Does that seem right?

If that's true, what should I do? Since paying this loan won't wipe the delinquency (and as I understand it, pay-for-delete requests rarely succeed), if I call and arrange payment, wouldn't that acknowledge the legitimacy of the debt and potentially reset the clock?

personalfinance,Working at a mortgage lender,"I work at a large mortgage lending company, as a licensed mortgage originator. My quandary is that people come to our website and submit information requesting that we contact them because they want to purchase a home in the near future, but they balk at certain personal information. 

In this case, it’s usually social security numbers. To be fair, our society is heavily inundated with “never give out your social security number”. But, you’re applying for a mortgage. You are literally asking me for a quarter to a half a million dollars to buy a home on credit (because it’s a loan)... but you don’t want me to run your credit. 

I wish I could show the statistics behind how many people I talk to on a daily basis that will give me access to everything I ask for, but the second I say I need to check your current debts/liabilities/credit scores then they act like that’s crazy. 

Honestly, what did you expect to happen? 

I get that maybe it’s because you are talking to me over the phone. But do your research ahead of time. My company only hires (because it’s a federal law) LICENSED mortgage officers. For clarity to people that maybe don’t know this, when you go to your local bank and shake hands with Joe who will talk to you about buying a home, he might not be licensed. Because the government doesn’t require that people working at depository lenders (banks and credit unions) be licensed. Odds are, Joe was trained by the locals at the bank but never took any formal training nor passed any federal tests to get that job. 

It just blows my mind that people will walk into a bank full of unlicensed officers and readily give out all of their personal information. But, when an actual licensed officer working for a large company (with an awesome reputation) asks for the same information then people think I might go open a credit line at game stop. Full disclosure, Joe is much more likely to screw up something with you’re credit or personal information than I am. 

If nothing else, I guess I hope that this post turns some heads. Yeah, the guy at the bank with the tie and fancy shoes might not be licensed at his job; because he’s not required to be.

Context:

I attended an investing event featuring Kevin O'Leary talking about his success in business ventures and investing money. Being that I am 20 Years old I was very interested in going as it was a free event to attend. Now at the event, there were 3 speakers who spoke about different areas where people have made their money. One from Real estate, one for Stocks and trading and Kevin himself. I was particularly interested in the stock marketing workshop through the Company Interactive Trader. Of course, its one of those things that you spend money up front, get it for a discount and so forth. I have always been interested in getting into the Stock market but have no experience in the area and wanted some direction. I figured, for the $300 (Normally $1000 from what I have read online), to get some idea of what I am getting into, the worst that can happen is that I wasted the money and know better for next time. You were also allowed to bring a guest for free and ended up going with my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

They structure it over the course of 3 days.

Day 1 - Get everyone very excited as they teach you about Options such as calls, puts, Futures ect.

Day 2 - You begin to break these things down into understanding how the above work and how to make money off them in good and bad markets. As well as Upselling the different ""class options"" with the Top class costing $25,000 (Yea... I know). They have you bring in some of your financial documents to assess where you are and ask to pull a soft credit score.

Day 3 - (Not taken yet) Tomorrow we will be learning some more in-depth information.

&amp;#x200B;

At this class, we were presented to my mother and I were hooked. The excitement of how much money could be made was great. I felt very informed about the information presented and I felt well taken care of. But I have my woes.

&amp;#x200B;

Research:

I've done a bit of digging on it finding many different things online and doing a bit more in depth on the company and if they are actually a legit company offering education. I found online that they are reviewed highly on a lot of iffy websites, one specifically Trust Plot where they have a direct link from their website and other blogs. Although they are quick to respond to bad reviews, they have all come from people who have only attended this 3 Day workshop. None that I can find are any testimonies from people who have actually gone through any other higher level courses. I also read that they contract out their one-on-one advisors, and that "" We do not hold ourselves out as a real estate broker, **registered investment advisor** or licensed securities broker, dealer or firm. We do not have any securities, insurance, or investment advisor licenses. We are not a licensed real estate broker; state **or federal registered investment advisor; licensed securities broker; dealer; agent or introducing broker; tax accountant;** or law firm. Some of the company’s hired presenters, trainers, and staff may hold various registration and licensing, but they do not operate in such capacity, as agents of the company. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

The reason, why I am asking, is that my mom, who has some money and nearing retirement, is very serious about going signing up for their top-level class **TOMORROW** costing $25,000 which is a LARGE number to swallow, but believes this would be the best way to become a well-rounded trader and good way to manage their money for the future.

Now, they Brand themselves as an education company and I do think they have something good to offer, but am afraid of letting my mom make such a risk to though that amount of money at something and at a company that I can not find enough legit information to confirm my suspicion. 

If you could help me diagnose this or help me find another community to help it would be IMMENSELY Helpful! Thanks in advance!

I apologize if this is not the optimal place to post this, but figured people here might have some insight into companies like Interactive Trader and help me to a guided decision if this is a good idea.

personalfinance,Should I buy out my loans with my side money or invest it somewhere else?,"(No 401k options, I am from France)

Hey guys, got pretty much the same dilemna that anyone with loans can have. Do I payback as soon as possible my loans or should use my money to make « babies » whilst my loans are getting paid monthly ?

Here is my situation : 

I got 900 EUR on a set account with basically no interest rates on it. It is just my side account in case shit goes wild (car, life…)

Finishing my masters and apprenticeship, I will go back to my moms for one or two months top with almost no charges and 2000 EUR at the end of my contract.  
 My future earnings (easy job market) should be around 1800 EUR a month after taxes without any bonuses (let’s say +100€ at least for meals and gas).

I got two student loans, both on monthly paiement : 

\- 2838.03€ left (end of loan 08/10/2021) with a monthly payment of 120.77 EUR

\- 1450.41€ left (end of loan 07/30/2012) with a monthly payment of 57.26 EUR

I was looking into buying long term stocks with my side money at the end of my contract or buying out my loans and getting this shit over with.",finance
personalfinance,What factors determine the interest rate for a home mortgage? Will a mortgage that is manually underwritten incur a higher interest rate than one that is assessed using a credit score?,As the title states.,finance
personalfinance,Can anyone explain how inflation works?,"So, I've been researching a lot about how inflation affects life and investments and what I find is usually confusing. I really hope this isn't a dumb question.

What I know right now is that (in the US), the inflation rate the Feds keep it at is around 2% and this results in thing being more expensive over time. (I hope I am correct in this) - so, by this definition, everything else that is being affected by inflation should also go up in value, right? I've heard a lot of people, including my econ teacher say that when counting for inflation on your investments, the money is worth less than before even while being the same amount still. 

From what I am getting out of all this is that if you do calculate for inflation on anything over however many years, the result you get it how much the initial amount you used is worth in that year. If that makes sense.

Lastly, how does one factor in inflation on investments or anything else. Like how do you calculate for inflation, over the past however many number of years or for the future, using a stable percent.

EDIT: I love all the answers, they are making me understand the concept better but how does inflation tie into investing? And how should someone factor it in? 

Maybe I could also provide a situation: Let's say I am investing $10,000 as my initial investment and leave it at that, in my savings for the next 10 years with a 5% annual return each year. It should grow to about $16,000 by the end of those 10 years. 

Once that's done for, how does inflation factor into this and what does it do to the money in my savings?",finance
personalfinance,Considering Credit Debt Consolidation,"Hi All,

I have approximately 40k in credit debt out of a maximum 60k limit. This is the result of the last two years of me getting hurt (medical bills) and losing a job. However, I am back on my feet and took a new position a few months ago and am bringing in roughly 130k/yr now.

I just paid bills and am $2,700 less in the hole than I was last month. I have a wife and a 3yr old daughter to consider so I have to keep some money on the side in case of emergencies. Now, my wife and I have gone over all of our spending and cut out just about everything non essential. Over the past couple of years I have been able to make at least the minimum payments on all cards and have never been late or missed a payment, thankfully! 

I took a tip from another thread about a year ago to apply the snowball approach to paying off cards and as of today I'm up to the larger balance cards. The next on the hit list currently holds a balance of about $4,000. I have read that it may be a good idea to contact a company for consolidation even though the interest rate might not be great at first. Wait until the credit score increases (currently 621 according to credit karma), then refinance that loan. 

Do you agree this is the best course of action? Any other tips that might help me out?

edit: To clarify, these balances are on the cards and none are in collections. I might be mistaken in saying ""debt"" as opposed to ""balance"".",finance
personalfinance,going back to school soon...should i save up $$ or pay down credit cards?,"i used to be 100% on top of my finances, 800+ credit score, til a brief unemployment devastated me. i still haven't fully recovered, mentally &amp; emotionally, but i've been looking forward to going back to professional school.

i got the best possible outcome for school: my tuition is fully funded, with an additional small stipend per semester. but now that it's so close, i'm just now realizing how overwhelmed i am, given the financial shape i'm in:

* i'm 23, parents likely will be unable to help me with anything besides a pizza here or there. i might potentially be able to have an aunt/uncle co-sign (but i currently have no idea if they'd even qualify)
* $10,000 debt - $5K student loans, $5K credit card debt 
* bad - fair credit (100% utilization, 1 derogatory mark that i just pulled my credit report to find out what it is) 
* $2,000 in checking, $0 savings, $10,000 in 401K 

for school i will need:

* an apartment (COL is very low where i'm going, i could save rent + deposit quickly, but worried about the credit check)
* car (i live in a city with great public transit, but will need a car unless i spend more on rent to live walking distance to campus. and with a car will come insurance + maintenance)
* COL loans - i qualified for $20K in stafford loans for the year, which i can't take since i've defaulted on a federal loan (after graduating college, my loan was sold, and since all correspondence was sent via mail and my permanent address was my parents' house 2K miles away, i never knew until i started applying to schools. that loan is now consolidated. i didn't know that didn't change my default status, or that i even had options that would get me out of default) 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Advice on best course for me to pay off a high interest cc while avoiding interest.,"I made standard poor choices in partners, used my first ever CC to cover moving and gaps in finance, got married, got divorced, ended up with 11k on a high interest card from Wells Fargo

It is my only debt.  My fico is a low 660.

I am in a place where I can really get this hammered out, but it is hard to make headway with the high interest each month. I need to get over the hump and I don’t want to pay 3k in interest between now and when I pay it off when that could go toward the balance!

I first thought to do a balance transfer and asked Wells Fargo to give me a new cc so I could capitalize on 0% interest for 18mos.

I was denied.  But I was offered a personal loan at a much better interest rate.  

Do I : keep applying for a balance transfer and apply for other zero interest cards in hopes that one says yes?

Do I: take the personal loan, lower my available credit on the WF card and then apply for other zero interest cards once I am not in ‘maxed out’
If I get a good zero interest card or two I can then use them to pay off the personal loan? 

Is there a better way?

# **The Fed is likely to drop ‘patient’ word next week, clearing way for July cut, economists say  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/fed-rate-cut-could-come-sooner-than-some-expect-but-not-yet.html)**
*****
&gt; Even with President Donald Trump and the markets calling for lower interest rates, the Fed is not likely to make a move when it meets next week, though it is expected to smooth the way for a rate cut later in the summer.
*****
&gt; The timing of a Fed rate cut, the first in more than a decade, is up for debate. But such a move has become more of a given in markets, after May’s weak jobs data and softer-than-expected consumer price inflation.
*****
&gt; A growing number of economists and investors are expecting a midsummer rate cut, at the July 30-31 meeting. There are also those who expect the Fed to wait until September, considering more data before cutting rates. Then there are a few, such as economists at Goldman Sachs, who expect no cut at all this year.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the Fed to tilt its message toward lower rates, with officials lowering their interest rate forecasts in the so-called “dot plot,” a chart that anonymously reflects each Fed official’s rate forecast. They are also expected to reduce their outlook for economic growth, and acknowledge weaker inflation.
*****
&gt; “Right now, they’ll just give a very dovish message that leans toward a July rate cut,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. “The market is worried enough about weakness in China, inflation undershooting and the possibility that tariffs disrupt the global supply chain that it’s hard for me not to think the Fed won’t be moving faster than people thought.”
*****
&gt; Trump again criticized the Fed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed’s interest rate policy this week, telling ABC News the Dow would be 10,000 points higher if the Fed didn’t raise interest rates. Economists say the president’s assault on the Fed is not likely to have an impact on its interest rate decisions.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s meeting is expected to be the biggest event for markets in the coming week. There is also some data, including manufacturing and services PMIs on Friday, as well as housing starts Tuesday and home sales on Friday.
*****
&gt; Barclays’ chief U.S. economist, Michael Gapen, moved forward his forecast for a first rate cut to July, from September, after last Friday’s weak May employment report of just 75,000 nonfarm payrolls. He expects the Fed to use more firepower than some economists do and expects it to start with a half percent rate cut, rather than a quarter point cut.
*****
&gt; Gapen expects the Fed to modify its statement and change its forecast, which will be released after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. “I’m looking for a modest downgrade of the outlook that could be in their projections, as well as their description of business spending. ... They have to acknowledge vulnerabilities have risen. I think they can highlight global growth and trade uncertainty, as two primary forces. I think they then get away from ‘patient’ and signal flexibility.”
*****
&gt; In the Fed’s dot plot, there are no rate moves expected in 2019, and that is expected to change. Fed officials may also tweak their GDP forecasts. The median central tendency is currently 2.1%. The median inflation forecast was 1.8%, but that could move lower, with PCE inflation readings running at 1.6%.
*****
&gt; Fed funds futures on Friday were signaling market expectations of about a 20% chance of a rate cut next week and about 80% for July. The Fed last raised interest rates in December, when it moved the range for fed funds futures to 2.25% to 2.50%.
*****
&gt; After that meeting, the Fed changed its stance and added that it would be “patient,” pausing policy as it watched economic developments. Economists now expect the Fed to drop that word, signaling a willingness to move forward with rate cuts.
*****
&gt; Chance for a cut next week?
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said she believes the Fed should make a move next week and not wait until July. She said she became convinced Fed officials were ready to move forward with rate cuts after she attended a Chicago Fed conference earlier in the month. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials made it clear the Fed would act to help the economy if it needed to.
*****
&gt; Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida told CNBC at that conference that the Fed would act as needed. “We will put in policies that need to be in place to keep the economy, which is in a very good place right now, and it’s our job to keep it there,” he said in an interview.
*****
&gt; “They were all pretty vocal about it. It was a major shift,” said Swonk. “Could they wait til July? Sure. My own view is if you’re going to do it, do it now because you can control the narrative. That’s important for the Fed to control the narrative.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed could be sending a confusing message next week, if it doesn’t cut. “The dots are going to go down. They’ve got to remove ‘patient,’ they have to acknowledge a weaker labor market, weaker growth, all those things, and the dot plots go down. To me, that’s more confusion than clarity when you’re going to do it in six weeks anyway,” she said.
*****
&gt; Jefferies economists are on the opposite end of the debate, and they do not have an interest rate cut in their forecast.
*****
&gt; “If trade talks completely fall apart and we have a permanent negative impact on our trade relations with China, then we’d get a rate cut, but we don’t expect one otherwise,” said Tom Simons, Jefferies money market economist.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/14/19

&gt; This week's economic data came out to a slow and disappointing start as the JOLTS report showed fewer job openings in April than expected and was below the March number. That was the only release on Monday, but activity picked up on Tuesday with a strong NFIB Small Business Optimism report, continuing the second longest streak of monthly gains for the indicator (discussed in Tuesday's Chart of the Day). Producer inflation also came out Tuesday, with a weaker headline print but improved core inflation. Wednesday's CPI also saw some weakness missing expectations on both headline and core measures. Fortunately, we rounded out the week with a heavy slate on Friday with beats nearly across the board. Retail Sales impressed in addition to the previous month being revised up. Industrial production was also stronger than expected while the University of Michigan consumer sentiment improved to 112.5.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/061419-Eco-This-Week.png))**

&gt; Next week quiets down with only 19 releases. June's Empire Manufacturing index from the NY Fed kicks things off followed by homebuilder sentiment. Further in housing data, starts and permits will be out Tuesday morning. While starts are expected to rise, permits are forecasting a small downtick. Later in the week on Friday, existing home sales are forecasted to rise to 5.27 mm SAAR homes. On Wednesday, all eyes will be on the FOMC rate decision. Over the past couple of months, markets have increasingly been betting on the FOMC deciding to cut rates at this meeting or (more likely) in the near future. This event should provide some clarity into this situation. We will finish next week with the Leading Index on Thursday and preliminary June Markit PMIs on Friday.

# What Do Stocks Do After The First Rate Cut?

&gt; It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will cut rates at the upcoming July meeting, with the potential for as many as three total rate cuts this year. This would be the first rate cut since the Fed started hiking rates in December 2015. Concerns over trade and the global economy have sparked much of this worry.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index up nearly 15% for the year, what could this potential first rate cut mean for stocks? After all, the Fed cut rates in January 2001 and September 2007 right ahead of recessions and massive stock market corrections. Could another bear market and recession be headed our way if the Fed cuts rates soon?

&gt; “The previous two times the Fed cut rates for the first time in 2001 and 2007, we saw stocks eventually get cut in half,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But the reality is if you go back further in time, you can also see explosive rallies after that first cut.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, “Not All Rate Cuts Are Created Equal”, shows, since 1984 there have been seven rate cuts that took place after at least one rate hike. The two most recent cuts were followed by poor performance over the next 12 months, but the other five cuts saw solid gains. In fact, the median return for the S&amp;P 500 one year out has been a very impressive 13.9%, which suggests a potential rate cut over the coming months might not be as worrisome as many make it out to be.

# B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales: Even Stronger Below the Surface

&gt; While it may not have looked like anything special based on the weaker than expected headline reading, there actually wasn’t much not to like about May’s Retail Sales report. In addition to being slightly better than expected after stripping out Autos and Gas, April’s report was revised significantly higher.

&gt; The table below shows monthly streaks of gains or losses for each of the sectors tracked in the Retail Sales report. Here we can see how broad and consistent the strength has been in Retail Sales after taking revisions into account. Five sectors have seen m/m growth for five straight months, and no group has seen more than one straight month of decline. Bars and Restaurants are one group that has seen sales growth for five consecutive months, and while it has yet to overtake Food and Beverage Stores in terms of its total share of sales, it’s getting close.

# June’s Boon – 5% DJIA Gain Already

&gt; Nearly two weeks ago we examined the history of June market performance after a down May following a strong January to April. That analysis suggested that this June could produce above average market gains. Thus far, the market has not disappointed. As of today’s close, DJIA is up 5.03% already this June. NASDAQ is second best, up 4.96%. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 are 4.89% higher. Russell 2000 is the laggard of the group, higher by a still respectable 3.96%. The true test for the market will arrive in the second half of the month as the end of the quarter nears. Historically, the second half of June has not been great for the market.

# NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Advance/Decline Lines Lagging

&gt; Typically at this time of the year, first half of June, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are often leading DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Historically, the month of June has been kinder to technology and small-cap stocks than others. Sure, June has been quite robust so far, but it has been DJIA and S&amp;P 500 leading the charge higher. Their strength is also confirmed by NYSE and S&amp;P 500 cumulative Advance/Decline lines at new highs already. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 cumulative Advance/Decline lines are weaker have not exceeded the highs reached last year. At the least, NASDAQ’s Advance/Decline line likely needs improvement for the market to make any meaningful headway.

# Has the Market Entered Its Summer Sideways Phase?

&gt; After bouncing rather solidly off support at 2725 the S&amp;P 500 has run in to some resistance at 2910. This looks like the beginning of the annual summertime sideways phase the market often experiences. Decent economic readings and a dovish Fed are likely to prop equities up some over the usually weaker summer months. While on the other had ongoing trade battles and other political and international skirmishes as well as lower oil, rates and growth are likely to keep a lid on stocks. This sets up the market for some range bound volatility between S&amp;P 2700 and 2900 give or take a few points. Critical support remains at the 2580 near the February/April 2018 lows. A resolution to the China trade deal or some firming in the data could push us higher and deterioration on all fronts would likely push us lower. For now expect backing and filling over the next several months.

# June Option Expiration Can Be Volatile

&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last sixteen years.

&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 25 of the last 29 years with an average decline of 1.09%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 29-year span, declining 0.73% and 0.23% respectively on average.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my federal student loans?,"Hey everyone,

I just graduated college last month and was wondering if I should refinance my federal student loans. I’ve heard its only good to do if you’re lowering the rate by more than 2%, which I think I’d be able to do. 

I start my job in a few weeks and will be making 60k/year. Currently living at home but may move out in a few months after I start getting paychecks. My parents have been paying the monthly amount while I’ve been in college, so now I’m going to take it over and try to pay it off as soon as I can. It was a co-sign.

My loans are as follows:
- $13,793 @ 6.31%
- $20,255 @ 7%
- $15,932 @ 7.6%

Total is about $49,981

I’ve heard good things about SoFi and Earnest, and I also have Navy Federal which is a credit union so I may get a good rate with them too. I’ll probably check all of them to get the lowest rate, and want to do a fixed rate since interest rates are pretty low right now.

I want to try to pay it off within the next 2 years, or as soon as possible. Do you think it’d be a good idea to refinance this? I’d probably try to contribute 1-2k a month to paying it off.

I have no other debts and never spend more than $30-$40 on each of my credit cards each month. My expenses are/will be pretty low too: owe $10 for my phone bill each month and will be paying car insurance. I also want to start investing some of my earned money and max out my Roth IRA this year.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice: I'm starting medical school in August and will need to get a more reliable vehicle.,"I'm going to apologize in advance for being long-winded, but I'm new to Reddit and want to give as much information as possible to help explain my situation. Also, thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

After finishing my undergraduate degree, I realized I wanted to pursue medicine, and for the past two years have been taking post-baccalaureate classes to fulfill my medical school prerequisites, along with working part-time as a nanny and tutor (overloading on course hours did not allow for any full-time work opportunities, and I was able to avoid paying rent by living with a family friend). While I have managed to save some money, much of that money went directly to post-baccalaureate tuition as well as to the high expenses of the actual medical school application process. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents paid for my undergraduate education and thankfully that means I have no debt from those four years. They were also generous enough to handle car payments for the now-paid-off vehicle I currently drive and have driven since high school. However, I have been financially independent from my parents  since graduating, and thus am responsible for all of my own bills, insurance, and expenses; I have been able to manage this decently well so far and took a personal finance course in college that has helped me to not feel completely clueless. While the car still drives okay, it was a hand-me-down vehicle used by my older siblings during their high school and college years, and was originally purchased used, and thus has almost 200,000 miles on it with several cosmetic and mechanical issues. Because I will be driving to school and to hospital rotations and must have reliable transportation, coupled with the fact that I have to drive a few states away to move for this school, I know that I need to somehow obtain more reliable transportation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the enormous expense that is medical school, I will be living off of a combination of scholarships and federal student loans, but will obviously be unable to work during the next fours years and thus have this fixed, limited income. I have worked with my school's financial aid office to develop a budget based on this funding. I originally planned on living alone, but was able to find other students from my school to live with and thus have been able to secure a rent price cheaper than originally anticipated. 

Looking at my budget, I should be able to allot $300 a month to a car payment, though obviously, anything below that would be even better. There are two other factors affecting my decision: 

1. Because I have been paying for school and will have to also pay moving expenses in a few months, and because my financial aid does not become available until school has started, I do not have the savings to make any large down payments or cover any large up-front costs. 

2. Because I am working with a pretty fixed budget, I want to avoid any unexpected maintenance costs as much as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is good, but not excellent, since I'm still young and have limited credit history. However, my parents have agreed to co-sign if this is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been moving forward assuming that leasing is the best option (though not a perfect option by any means) for my situation as it allows for the reliability of a newer vehicle without paying a large initial amount. However, I wanted to see if this is a correct line of thinking, or if other, better options may be available. I also wanted to seek advice on which cars to look into based on my needs.",finance
personalfinance,"Paying student loans, but still confused about interest payments","I think I’ve been doing a good job paying off my loans, using best practices, but am having a hard time fully grasping how payments work. I’ve been reading about student loans on this forum and understand that it’s faster to pay off the highest interest loan first so now throwing any extra funds I have to aggressively pay it off. Just learned today that payments first go toward interest and that interest balance (not percentage) decreases over the life of a loan, as your principal balance decreases (is that right?).

Here are my questions as I’m paying off student loans:

1. If I do a heavy overpayment, my lender tells me I can either advance my next payment or bill me the same the following month. Presumably, I want the option that bills me the same the following month as putting my overpayment toward the next month would mean I’m not decreasing my principal as quickly as I could be—right?

2. Does the balance amount shown on the website include interest already for payment over 10 years? Mine reads a remaining balance of about $1,500. The interest rate is 5%. Three scenarios: I pay off $1500 in one go, I make 3 monthly payments of $500, and I pay off the student loan over the course of 10 years. What are each of the scenarios costing me or saving me (financially) in the long run?

Thanks for any info you can share!",finance

personalfinance,33% raise and need some help planning for it,"I just accepted a new job where I will be making 50,000, I was previously making 38,000. This is a substantial increase and obviously I'm more than pleased, but I am worried about how it will impact some of the plans I had with regard to the benefits I received and taxes. 

Single, head of household with two children. I am currently receiving reduced lunch for the kids, EIC, Pell Grants, Sub/Unsubsidized Fed student loans, and in about a year I planned to go in IBR for my student loans in order to qualify for the PSLF (and also attend a graduate program w/loans to again PSLF assuming program is still around). 

**I guess what I am trying to figure out is if I should try lower my AGI, if that allow me to retain any of the programs/benefits I receive, or if it's not worth it. I'm also not clear on whether or not AGI is a factor, or if its simply earned income that matters for the EIC, free/reduced lunch, etc.  Also I am unsure whether or not this will impact my tax burden.** 

I have a state pension with a small portion of that going to 401K, I do not believe there is matching- just a small portion of this hybrid retirement plan is put int the 401K. I can add more to it, but I do not think it changes the employer contribution. I can also do a high deductible health plan and put $7,000 into a HSA. I don't do this right now as money has been so tight. And also there are the various IRAs which I don't know much about. 

I'll include what my tax refund looks like, but it's confusing because this new raise, and all the raised I have received, go into effect August, so more than half the year is lower. So 2019 will be based on 7 months @38K and 5 months@50K. 2018 my salary went from around 33K to 38K. so 7 months@33 and 5@38. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I finally got around to changing my withholding shortly into 2019. I now go exempt, not sure if I should continue this. Previous tax refund included over payment which I won't receive going forward since I reduced withholding. 

&amp;#x200B;

2018 

AGI was 29,000

EIC: $3,544

2 qualifying children for credit: $2,800 

2018 tax refund (including overpayment refund) $7,241.

With my current salary at $38,000 I gross $3,166 and net $2,602. Paid once a month.

personalfinance,"Investing versus student loans - 70k income, 87k debt.","25 years old, $70k income pre-tax. DC area. 760 Equifax (idk if this is relevant).

General budget:

- $1400 - rent/utilities/parking
- $300-$400 - food/booze
- $255 - car, financed through credit union at 2ish%
- $100 - gas, insurance, metro, etc 
- $150 - misc, clothes, experiences 

Debt:

- $60k in private student debt, just recently refinanced it all into one loan at 5.3%. Previous, I had $20k literally at 12.25%, rest 10%. Insane. Thank god I refinanced. Anyway:
- $27k in federal student debt, loans range 3-4%
- Owe 9k on my car, it's worth about that. May try to sell soon to save on parking, insurance, and car payment. I don't use it nearly enough to justify, recently moved to DC area - suggestions on this possibility definitely welcome. 

Savings/investments

- $10k savings account
- Maxed Roth IRA this year at $6k (I get 401k match after a year at my job, just 3 months in, so I do not have it yet)
- $800 in a Vanguard ETF (VOO)

I pay $1k/month or more typically on my student loans. My questions: at these interest rates, how much should I focus on investing versus paying them off? How can I diversify and where should I go now, after an IRA and some ETFs? Should I take some of that $10k and throw it at the loans now? Invest it? Any comments and advice welcome!",finance
personalfinance,About to fill out paperwork for inheritance; what next steps should I take?,"Hey PF! This is my first time posting, and I figured that I'd get some opinions from everyone. I want to apologize if this is scattered.

Last summer, my father passed away, and he's left me an inheritance that I'm trying to figure out what to do with. He had an IRA worth $150,000 last time I checked, and my half-brother and I are splitting it 70/30, with me getting the 70% (for context, he's 15 years older than I am, and is married and has an established life; I'm assuming my dad figured he would be okay). In addition to this, he also had a $20,000 life insurance policy, which I have complete access to and am currently using to pay for my phone bills and auto insurance. In addition to this, my father left me an E-Trade account with about $6,000 in it, which I have not touched since I learned of it, and am saving for an emergency.

My grandmother set up a saving account which I am not allowed to touch until I turn 25 (I'm currently 21). As of March 31, it currently has $12,015.56 in it, and gained almost $2,000 from January 1 to March 31.

I currently have around $44,000 in loans for school from Sallie Mae (I know, I was desperate). My current plan is to fill out the IRA paperwork to take control of the money (I'll do that sometime this week), and then use money from the IRA to pay for my final two semesters at school (which will cost around $14,000 total). I then plan to pay off the Sallie Mae loans all at once to avoid the high interest rates. As for any government loans, I plan to pay those off normally to try and build some credit.

With the remaining money, I plan to put 3/4th of it in the investment account my grandmother set up for me, and then put the other 1/4th in the E-Trade account to be used as an emergency fund/investment. Is there anything else you guys think I should do? Anything I should do differently? I'm open to suggestions!",finance

I took out unsubsidized FAFSA loans for all 4 years ($48k).  This didnt cover all of tuition, so my father took out parent plus loans for the $2000/year difference ($8k total).  

Or are these posts referring to qualifying for federal grants?",finance
personalfinance,ETF vs Mutual Fund for Taxable Investments,"I recently had the amazing fortune to land a job that allows me to max out my tax advantaged accounts (401K, mega back door Roth, backdoor Roth) with money left over to invest in some 'plain old' accounts. I've had some money sitting around in Vanguard VTSAX, so my first thought was to continue with that, but I was curious if there are advantages (tax or otherwise) to putting my money in an ETF like Vanguard's VTI instead. Some googling turned up conflicting advice, and most of the advice seemed to focus on 401Ks and IRAs and such. For a taxable account and being at the 35% US Federal bracket, should I be investing in passive low fee ETFs or in passive low fee mutual funds? Is there anything key I should read up on around this topic (tax lost harvesting seems come up a lot)? Thanks for the advice, y'all!",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth paying off my condo?,"**I am 29 years old, I have lived in my current home for about 1.5 years and I am trying to determine a long term plan for the repayment schedule of my mortgage.**

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the Seattle area and I bought my 2 bed, 2 bath condo for about $230,000 in February 2018. I am a single man with no children with no debt other than my mortgage. I make $72,000 a year and contribute 15% of my pre tax income into an employer sponsored 401(k) where the account balance currently stands at about $91,000. I have $27,000 in equity in my condo and my outstanding balance on the mortgage sits at around $203,000. My monthly mortgage payment is $1,275 and my monthly HOA dues are around $298 making my monthly housing expense around $1,573. My mortgage is a 30 year with a 4.625% interest rate. Once all my bills are paid for the month, I am left with around $1,200 which I have been using to get my emergency fund to 6 months which I am still working on.

I like my current home as it lies 5 minutes away from the neighborhood I grew up in. I have lots of family and friends in the area and I have a reasonable commute to work. I don’t love certain aspects of where I currently live though, such as the busy state highway that my condo complex is off of which is prone to many traffic accidents and my first floor neighbors who chain smoke on the patio of their unit which exposes me to secondhand smoke many times a day and limits my options for opening windows during the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is, in the context of my overall financial situation, if it is worth using a portion or all of my monthly budgetary surplus to put extra money down on my outstanding mortgage debt?**

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t intend on living in this condo past the point in my life where I get married and start a family which I currently don’t have a timetable on being a single man in my late 20’s. I live in a decent area for the city I live in, but I don’t know if I could ever seriously envision my home becoming an investment property in terms of rental income. In any case, I have no desire in being a landlord at any point in the future. My main concern is that the return on investment for paying off my condo sooner than the 30 year term would be less than, say, investing in an index fund or some other investment vehicle that offers greater return on investment. Personally, I find condos to be a less than ideal real estate investment given how much lies outside one’s control such as the HOA fees and the types of neighbors within the association which can either positively or negatively affect the value of the condo.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any input on this.

gaming,Reflect Studios: The most underrated horror game developer ever.,"I always hear FNaF or Outlast whenever one mentions “scary games”. FNaF was indeed a highly original idea but it just wasn’t scary, it was just merely startling. And the storyline/lore was really stupid. Outlast was just jump scares this and darkness that. Scary quite so but original not really. 

However, Reflect Studios made games that both are original and are indeed terrifying. Welcome to the Game? Browsing the dark web, and oh my god I cannot even describe it. Some of the fictional websites are extremely disturbing. And what’s even worse about it is that all of it is extremely realistic. Coming from someone who has doofed around on Tor himself. The types of websites you’ll find on WTTG are indeed what you can find in real life. Drug sites? Yes. Scam hitman sites? Yes. Virus distribution? Yes. Firearm trade? Yes. And the *darkest* of things you can find in game, I assure you that you can find it in real life if you look hard enough. Some people truthfully are horribly depraved people. But *the Doll Maker* earns the cake for worst fucking human being in the game. If I met that dude I would want to blow his head off with a grenade launcher. And it gets even spookier. Stalkers who manage to track your activity will come into your house and kidnap/kill you shall you unsuccessfully convince them you’re not home. 


Then there’s the spinoff called The Waiting Room. You’re kidnapped by a snuff filmer and must escape. I imagine that is what it would feel like to be actually kidnapped by a snuff filmer and then sentenced to death. Gotta convince him you’re asleep. Gotta use a computer. Gotta go through vents.


Then a beta game called Rides With Strangers. Also terrifying. There’s apparently going to be sexual predators, robbers, kidnappers, among other horrible people giving you rides when you hitchhike. But so far, it’s only a perverted religious minister. And he acts exactly like how I imagine one would actually act. Gotta decide whether to stay or to jump out of the car if he’s too sketchy. 

So yeah, play one of their games instead if you want a realistic horror game",technology

personalfinance,"Is there a way to set up a payoff schedule for myself, spread out amongst several creditors?","I'm about $25k in debt spread out amongst credit cards, bank loans, and paying off back taxes. I was out of full-time work between 2009-2014, living off whatever freelance gigs I could scrape together, and didn't file taxes that entire time (couldn't afford to pay them anyway). Started fixing it almost five years ago when I finally started working full-time again. 

My take-home now is about $4400/month, my rent is only 16% of that, been driving the same vehicle since 2005 so no car payment, so after expenses I dedicate anywhere from 30-50+% to paying down my debt, with minimum payments on everything and anything extra going toward the CC with the highest interest rate, which also happens to have the highest balance. 

I also try to put $500/month into an emergency fund until I have three months of expenses saved up. That account was recently wiped out paying 2018 taxes (no one told me claiming 0 allowances still wouldn't be enough taxes taken out if you're married with dual income). 

Basically, I try to live as frugally as possible without becoming a full-blown hermit, but I'm also married so we need to go out once or twice a month for our sanity, so even though I know I'm slowly chipping away at this thing, it feels like it's taking forever. I've gone in &amp; out of depressive slumps because of it, but I just remind myself it'll be gone one day. *But when?*

I'm hoping I can find a way to calculate some kind of end date goal, or an 'X amount of months left' plan, that would really help me focus not on how much I owe, but when I'll be done owing. When I financed my vehicle back in 2005, I new it was a 48 month loan, but almost made it a game for myself to see how much fast I could get it paid off. I would love to do that with what I owe here. I hope I'm making myself clear in what I'm looking for. Is there anything like this out there?

**Just to be thorough, I've talked to my credit union about a loan to pay off my credit cards, and they wanted me to close my accounts to qualify, which would totally screw up my credit score I've been working so hard to fix.

I wanted to know if I can close those credit cards since I don’t want to stay in the debt and had been paying them off with the great amount of money. I just paid off one of the credit cards. 

Having those credit cards make me feel like I have limited money available each time I paid CC bills and I want out. 

I currently have 4 credit cards- Old Navy (ON) , Wal-Mart (WM), Bank of America (BOA) and CARE (CE)

Those accounts do not have annual fees 

ON- about 8-10 years old 

WM- about 7-9 years old 

BOA- about 10 years old 

CE- 1-2 years old

I paid off CE few weeks ago and I haven’t figured a good way to close the account since I only used it once when my cat needs to have an emergency surgery. 

I hope to close ON and WM accounts once they are paid in full. Can I close multiple accounts simultaneously without tanking my credit? 

I also have a desire to close BOA account as I had a lot of bad experiences with that bank. I closed my personal checking account with them about 3 years ago because I got really fed up with how they handled my account. I just want to do nothing with BOA once I paid off the balance on BOA CC.

personalfinance,Need advice on my current car situation.,"So, about a month ago I was returned to the states after being stationed overseas for 5 years.  Upon returning, I bought a car and a house; both are well within my budget.  Now here’s the slight dilemma:  my commute to work is 20 miles one way.  My current vehicle is currently getting 22mpg.  I’ve only had it for a month, but I was considering trading it in for a brand new Prius Prime(54mpg). 

I could afford the payments and i would be saving tons in gas money.  I’m also factoring in the $4500 federal tax credit I’ll receive for purchasing a new plug in hybrid.  But I can’t help but think I’m wasting money in taxes/title alone.  Also, I’ll be losing out on $1500 from the trade in.  (Bought for $20k; getting $18.5 trade in; currently owe $15k)

(Even though many nations do not donate 2% of their GDP it does provide a more accurate representation!)

Second again in the event of world war, nations would use nukes also all Nato nations (Except Japan) have their own military. Third, while I understand  crime rates are not homicide rates the two are closely linked and also the apparent rise in rape in Europe does not make sense as the rate is 4% below average and robberies are 57% less than average

The only nation in europe that you could call a military power is the UK and they are still dwarfed. Japan does actually have it's own military just not a large one.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) My point wasn't that the amount that the US spends is comparable to the spendings of other nations it is a superpower rather that these countries have a smaller economy but percentage wise they spend close to that of the US military budget.  Also, you realize that the US  uses it's military for its own interests right. So relatively they spend close to the same percentage of their GDP and so it's not like they don't have to worry about their military.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Percentage of gdp is pretty irrelevant when you are comparing a nation with a almost 20 trillion dollar gdp to nations that are between 1 and 5 trillion. Without the United States Europe has very little defense.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) But they have roughly the same amount of their economy left to spend on stuff like health care, and defense against superpowers in 2019 doesn't matter as much because in the event of another world war nukes would be used. The percentage does matter because of a nation with a one trillion dollar GDP has all expenses lower than that of a 20 trillion dollar GDP nation.

A conflict in europe does not necessarily mean world war 3 and there is no guarantee nukes would be used. All expenses lower? Military equipment does not get cheaper just because you have a smaller economy, europe has far less and spend far less then the united states.  You realize only a few nations possess nukes, and the superpowers china, russia, US have about 99% of them. Europe could not compete with a superpower militarily they lack the experience, manpower and money.

[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA) By all expenses lower I mean generally they have less of a budget for all things infrastructure health care etc. In the case of war just in Europe (or a more local war) then the components would be more evenly matched because if it isn't a world war we can assume no superpowers get involved. Your experience/manpower argument doesn't make sense because first  Europe has a fairly high population. Second, how does the US have way more experience than Europe? Additionally does have a decent amount of nukes or at least enough to cause a lot of harm, for example, the U.K has  215 nuclear warheads in total. You are right the US does spend 15.876% of its budget on the military which is larger than many countries but most countries budgets are closer to that of the average nation of Europe. Additionally, due to alliances, a war with Russia or China (Just Examples) would draw way more nations in so a fight wouldn't be one on one. Also, the chances of a large conflict nowadays are very low so there is less of a need for a huge military.

[@NeilTheIdiot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5d8tmD-Vj7TCPNL6ROLUXQ) Superpowers can be in wars that aren't world wars, the us has more experience then europe because the us is always ready for war or involved in some kind of conflict while europe hides behind it. The superpowers have the ability to shoot down nukes and 215 nukes is pathetic compared to the total amount.  The only nation even coming close to the US military budget  is china and even then it's not even half, the US budget is not just larger then many of them, it's larger then all of them. China and russia have few allies and are not well liked in general what allies could they bring to the fold exactly? If there's one certainty in this world is that conflict will happen eventually not preparing for it, is foolish.

​[@RavagersPrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcdIMsarmnBRscrgqRrZvA)First my point was if a superpower was to get involved in a war with something like Nato (Which are the only nations that are guaranteed by the US and therefore are the only nations that apply for your less military spending because of the US's military  in Europe) then it would be a world war Second 215 nukes would cause a lot of damage (don't believe me check out this article[ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/13/100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn/)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgxbZn289-nUfL6FhK54AaABAg.8_qpFa8awAI8wE4-zad1sN&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fscience%2F2018%2F06%2F13%2F100-warheads-enough-cause-starvation-nuclear-autumn%2F%29&amp;event=comments&amp;redir_token=2iTcHQ3ZmSpBJuvbnGzeGjLab798MTU2MDc0OTI3M0AxNTYwNjYyODcz) Also for you point on large scale wars being inevitable while you are partially right one day there will probably be a war the threat of a nuclear holocaust and the Doctrine of mad has reduced the chance of superpowers going head to head. Also deflecting nukes on the scale of several hundred is improbable. Therefore a world war 3 is unlikely for the meantime which means that any wars would be on a far more local level which an average size military could deal with while still having money for social programs.",energy
personalfinance,Choosing between paying tuition out of pocket and saving money vs. getting more student and not saving,"Hi! I’m a dirt ass poor grad student, 26, living at home with mom, 25k in student debt (currently in deferment, fixed at around 6.5% — all federal unsub loans for grad students).  The good news is, I have very little in expenses right now as my parent has graciously allowed me to return home. 

The bad news is, I make minimum wage (for now). Working about 50 hours a week between my three jobs, I’ve calculated out that if I live very frugally, I can potentially pay my tuition out of pocket for the next two semesters before I graduate. 

I’m wondering if it’s worth it, however, to graduate with less debt and no savings or more debt and some savings, even small? I don’t even have an emergency fund or anything... 

I’ve calculated that if I do end up just putting all of my tuition on loans for my last year, I’ll end up graduating in around 39kish of debt, which would all be the same type of loan I have already.

personalfinance,Risk vs reward - Would like to know if my calculations are correct and if I'm potentially missing out on better gains (accounting for risk).,"**Stats:** Male, 35, single, net $75k pa (Aus), just paid off half a PPOR (own with my sister - house worth around 500k), saving approx 60% of income (working on financial independence by age 45 ish), government job, about 10k to be invested at this stage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q** \- Im currently putting all my spare cash into my sisters half of the loan (technically mine loan too) charging 1% less than she is paying on the mortgage. I.e. loan int rate is 4.67% and I'm charging 3.67% calculated every time money goes in (or out), usually pay day or credit card day and soon to be interest rate drops. By my crude calculations, if I was to invest this money in the share market for example, based on a 32% income tax bracket, i'm receiving an equivalent of 5.5% (not including transaction costs either) tax free by offsetting my own loan (being paid off by my sister). Hope that made sense to someone! So...

&amp;#x200B;

**Offsetting loan:**

$10,000 x 3.74% = $374 pa (tax free/risk free (ish) by offsetting my own loan as per above) is the rough equivalent to...

&amp;#x200B;

**In other taxable instrument:**

$10,000 x 0.055 = $550 pa return 

$550 x 0.32 = $176 (tax)

$550 - $176 = $374

**Ignoring issues with my sister (I know this isn't entirely without risk), is this an acceptable return on investment for the next few years while she pays down this portion of the loan?** From what i've been reading, the Aussie economy looks to be heading into a downturn, so I'm trying to time an entry to the market into dividend paying shares and living off the income eventually (assuming that's still viable with future interest rate drops).

personalfinance,How much should I be saving while paying off CC debt? I don't have a company 401k/savings plan,"Hello,

I've been working on getting my finances in order, and I need some guidance.

I have about 19k in CC debt

3800 of it is at varying interest rates

15.2k of it is at zero interest with varying expiration dates (0% int balance transfers).

30k in student loans, unfortunately I'm on a graduated payment plan, so right now I'm only paying the interest, with about 8 years left to pay. I will switch this to the standard repayment structure  (I've checked, I can do it easily) once my CCs are under control.

about 3.8k left on a car payment.

I have about 45k in a 401k from a previous employer that I did not roll over when I left. Historically the employer stock has outperformed the stock market, so I left it and have the dividends reinvested automatically. This isn't publicly traded, so I cannot buy anymore, but I felt it was a safe place to leave it long term.

I have a Roth IRA w/ about 6k in it and I contribute 10% of my gross income, quarterly. 

I do not have an emergency fund built up because I've been putting it into my IRA.

I take home about 2900 after taxes monthly. Rent, car insurance, car payment, cell phone, student loan, electric, water, and food account for about 1500 a month in expenses. I'm in the process of selling some belongings (read: expensive stupid purchases) that should free up about 3k in cash all said and done, which will go towards anything that has monthly interest rates. Most likely the car payment, since this will free up about 130 a month in ""minimum payments."" It does not have an early payoff penalty.

My question is, I do not have a retirement plan through work, should I continue to put the 10% towards my IRA, or should I build my emergency fund up to around 1-1.5k and then skip the IRA and focus on CCs?

I'm in my early 30s, and the thought of not putting anything into a retirement account kinda scares me about the future. Oddly it scares me more than having nearly 50k in debt.

Without giving to much information, this is a unique company and only a few exist in the USA, **it’s very likely in 4-5 years my company could be forced to shut down due to new federal regulations that are being discussed**.

The company is very profitable and will continue to be till we could force to shut down. My dilemma is I don’t want to find myself out of work in my early 40’s starting over again. The company owner confided in me he was cutting back his lifestyle cost and putting more money away and preparing for the worst a few months ago too so he could just retire if and when this happens.

My wife and I learned the hard way from the recession to live a humble lifestyle and live on 60k a year and invest the rest into our IRA’s and brokerage accounts. We live in the Midwest and our cost of living is low.

I’ve polished up my resume and went out looking for work, but no one can even come close to offering what I’m paid.

My skill set is very unique since I had to learn it on the job, I can say I’m almost impossible to replace, a good amount of information is in my head is not documented at all, it would require someone new to come and be trained for years and no one on current staff could even take over my job role since my roles are mine only.

So my wife and I are looking to redo our kitchen which we needs to be done badly. Our subfloor has damage that was hidden from us by the seller (we are pursuing a court case)  and our kitchen floor sags a bit on one end. We reinforced it for now but it clearly needs to be replaced. I am not handy enough to do any of this myself. We discussed doing just the subfloor and replacing the flooring but we don't  know the extent of the damage and we may have to pull the cabinets out anyways. We have decided that if we are going to do this, we should do it once and enjoy a more functional kitchen rather than just trying to refresh 30 year old cabinets and adding mismatched cabinets in another section.   


Kitchen Project: Hoping for $30,000 with all new appliances  (have quotes up to almost $40,000 without appliances). We are working with a designer we like who is very conscious of our budget and needs. We will only borrow exactly what we need for the project and we are working to keep the costs under control.

Closing Costs = $12,588  
Total Cash in hand = $38,850   
New Payment = $1840 (including escrow and insurance)  
Total New Loan =  $298,438

**Option #2: Home Equity Loan, 30 year**

APR = 4.89% (can be discounted 0.25% with our bank)  
Closing costs = Minimal (a few hundred based on research with our bank or other banks)  
Total Cash = $40,000 or so based on calculations  
Payment = $212  
Total loans = $287,000

We just are not sure which is the best option to go with. #1 only increases our total monthly payment by $99 but it is paying interest on a much larger loan amount at a higher rate and we've paid 3 years into our current mortgage.

That weird shady online place called me, at least 2x, from multiple numbers, and I explicitly said that I do not want anything before I know what exactly is it and how much it cost.

I am uneasy and unwilling to go with this. I did not order it. I am afraid that at the moment I will confirm that I actually received it, they will hit me with $10 AND with $2,440. I do not want that.

The plus side is that it used up my deductible. if I have anything more medical this year, my insurance now thinks that 2,400 was already applied to my deductible, and they will cover most of anything above the $600 that is left. But it feels like a scam and like a fraud. Is it?

personalfinance,How to handle investment losses from a tax perspective,"So I started playing around with investing about 5 years ago or more.  I put a bunch of savings into mutual funds &amp; sold fairly shortly, made ~$10k. Would’ve made a lot more if I left them (sold around Dow 18000), but it was the majority of my savings &amp; I didn’t want to risk it beyond a short term win.

Then I tried picking individual stocks, they initially went up in value, but I held them too long &amp; now a $17k investment is only worth $3k.

So if I sold today, I would be negative $4k between the $10k gain &amp; the $14k loss.  But from an accounting perspective, they are separate &amp; it would be a $14k long term capital gains loss.

My initial plan was to keep holding until the market corrects, at which point I’m hoping the speculative stocks I hold would again go up in value, at which point I could sell if I could get back to break even.

Recently though, I’ve been thinking about selling &amp; either putting the $3k in a mutual fund &amp; leaving it for a lonnng time.  Or possibly investing it in a company like Tesla where I could either lose it all or potentially see it grow faster than the market does if the Model 3 &amp; Y take off.  Plus the market is at an all time high &amp; index funds will likely not grow forever, it would be more likely to see a sharp downturn &amp; have to wait on the subsequent upturn.

Disclaimer - I’m in a good position financially, own my home, little to no debt ($10k on a car), great savings, great retirement for my age, thousands in an HSA, etc.  If I lost the remaining $3k it wouldn’t hurt me too much.

I read that if I sell, I’m limited to deducting $1500 in capital losses on my tax return per year (single), and that additional losses could be spread out on future returns (even if they all happened via stock sales in the same year?).  So if I was to sell &amp; take $14k capital losses, how would I best approach it tax wise?  I usually break about even come tax time, if I’m lucky I get $200 back between federal &amp; state.  Would I get all or a portion of that $1500 back each year at tax time via some sort of credit?  Or would my employer tax me $1500 (or some other amount) less due to the losses?

Thanks for any advice you can give.

And to anyone else reading this, stick with low cost index funds.  Don’t try to pick winners unless you’re prepared to wait out losses for a long time or lose the money altogether.",finance

This weekend I was in a little parking lot accident where I opened my door into a moving car and dented their door. Since my car and the insurance is under my dad's name, I'm even more motivated to get my own car and policy now.  I have $6,500 in my checking account and my dad said he will buy my car for a thousand if a buy a new one. I'm considering paying cash for a $8-$10k car then saving to pay off the college loan after. I make $1,550 a week as a Union Operating Engineer and the job I'm on now will definitely last 6 months. After that, I would be looking at getting laid off until my union hiring hall sends me to another job site. The average length of the layoff is about 3 months and I would be making $500 a week in unemployment during that time. Thanks for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Help thinking through a 529 account?,"Hello! I've just started the process of planning for graduate school. I'd like to start saving and take advantage of a 529 account so that my savings are tax-deferred. In my mind, because my time horizon is so short, I'd rather have very conservative investments (either bonds, or straight FDIC insured savings with minimal interest).  This way, I wouldn't be ""making money"" off of these savings, but avoiding the \~25%-ish federal taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a common saving method for graduate school? If for whatever reason I change plans for grad school, I just see it as having the account open longer for my kids education down the road (in which case I would re-evaluate my investing strategy). Has anyone else used this method? If so, any recommended 529 accounts with good options? Thanks!",finance
MachineLearning,[R] Research roadblock. Help with Extreme Multi-Label Classification,"Hey guys!

I have been working on the [BioASQ challenge, Task A](http://bioasq.org/) which is the large scale semantic indexing of PubMed abstracts. It is supposed to be my Master's thesis but I have hit a roadblock.

The current state-of-the-art results, that is if we concern ourselves with just the micro-f score, is 68.8% while I can't seem to get past the 60% mark. I am currently using pre-trained bio-medical FastText word vectors with a bidirectional GRU, the output of which branches out into two parts. The first part computes a document vector using attention mechanism while the second part applies a CNN and then k-max pooling to get yet another document representation. Both vectors are merged along with some additional hand-crafted features which are then finally fed to the output layer which is of size 28,472 (the total number of labels) with sigmoid activation and binary cross entropy loss. Upon training this architecture on 3 million abstracts, I am getting a micro-f score of 58.2%.

I have tried a number of other methods and architectures but none are working. It is extremely frustrating since I have made absolutely no progress for the entirety of this month and I am growing anxious with every passing day as my deliverable deadline keeps coming closer. It would be of immense help if anyone could point me in the right direction on how to proceed further. What to read, what to change, etc. I did read about Label wise attention networks but cannot understand how to implement that in Keras. A small hint or some pseudocode would be of great help.

I already know about Dave Ramsey but his plan hitches on having SOME disposable income. I'm in a contract with my phone so I can't get rid of it unless I pay $700 which I obviously do not have since I have no money to even put towards savings.

personalfinance,Health Insurance Switching,"I will be starting a job in August, and that means dealing with everyone's favorite benefit—health insurance! Currently my wife works and I am covered under her policy. It is a high deductible plan with an HRA, and she has an FSA where the year ends either June 30 or July 31 (I can't remember) where she's allowed to roll over $500 to the new year. She will stop working before I start working. My new job is a one-year position with the federal government and I have a plethora of options for health insurance (over 25). I'm trying to figure out if I should get a plan with an HSA, an HRA, or neither. From what I'm reading ([https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/fastfacts/high-deductible-health-plans.pdf](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/fastfacts/high-deductible-health-plans.pdf)) I would not be eligible for either an HRA or an HSA if I were covered by my wife's FSA, and apparently many HRAs make lump sum contributions in January for the entire year.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1. How does the FSA work after my wife stops working?
2. Would I be eligible for an HRA or HSA plan given that I have been covered by my wife's FSA?
3. If an employee starts with an HRA plan mid-year are they just out of luck until January or is there a pro-rated contribution made to the HRA?

personalfinance,Monthly budget doesn't leave much room for groceries? (Budgeting during major life events) [US],"Hello /r/personalfinance, it's been a hectic year for my family and I recently got my first ""real"", full-time job in my field at the beginning of May. 

After a few weeks of getting paid, I have an idea of what my cashflow looks like, and I have put together a budget of recurring expenses. After looking at the budget, it doesn't really seem like there is enough room for groceries and extra-curricular activities. I feel like there are places I can improve to give me a little more spending money while still aggressively paying down some debts. I have included my budget and personal information below and am looking for some advice on how to budget better.

There are also a few major life events on the horizon that I would like to plan for, and some events that are so close that I would like some advice on how to move forward. If I am not clear enough in my logic or information, please let me know and I can clarify. 

**TL;DR:** Make a decent amount of money, but have a large family with sizeable debts. Trying to be financially responsible and pay down this debt as quickly as possible while still trying to feed my family and plan for the future.

*: This is the price of a 3-bedroom split home we applied to that isn't available until mid August. We are currently subleasing a 2-bedroom apartment for $875/month until then. So while this number isn't currently accurate it reflects the price of upscaling to a bigger place closer to my work. 

\**: This number is an overestimate of what the utilities will be at our new place. I personally don't think it will cost that much, but it factors in everything from Electricity, Gas, Water, Trash, Lawn Care. We will also need to save up for a washer and dryer since the new place doesn't come with one. 

\***: This is likely an overestimate but ideal number. Several of my loans are still In-Grace while my wife's are all completely in repayment now. I realize that this may be the place in the budget where I need the most guidance. 

\****: This number is high. I currently commute 30 miles each way to work. When we move, I expect this number to drastically reduce. I'll only be about 11 miles away from work at the new place. 

As you can see, There is not much leftover for a family of 5. This has me rethinking my budget because I believe I make a decent amount given the low-cost-of-living area but also have a decent amount of debt. Our goal is to aggressively pay down this debt (especially the credit card) ASAP. I recognize that comes with sacrifice, but I gotta feed my family too. 

For those who may wonder, there are a few expenses that are actually currently paid for by my father still. Namely, our cell-phone bill. 

While we currently have an ""okay"" savings, I would definitely like that to be at least $10,000. This savings is currently acting as an Emergency Fund/Long Term Savings Plan. We would eventually like to buy a house in the next 2-3 years, but I am a millennial so we'll see how that turns out. This next section is major life events that are coming up that I would like some guidance on.

# Major Life Events

**3rd Baby:** As mentioned earlier, my wife is due at the end of this week. Which is absolutely crazy to think about. For those who are curious, my last 2 children were born on Medicaid and we have never really had to pay anything for those hospital visits. Over the last 4 years, I have worked 3-jobs simultaneously while going to school to make ends meet but we have always been under the cut-off for Medicaid. Since my insurance was started a few weeks ago, this will be the first time I have to deal with paying for insurance. 

I almost wish I got the job just a few months later so we could still leverage Medicaid (That's not how government incentives are supposed to work XD haha) 

In anycase, I'm worried about the $5,000 deductible and how much it truly costs to have a child. Call me an idiot for not thinking about this before. What is the best advice for moving forward? My wife still needs to cancel Medicaid as our income has changed, but should I expect a $5,000 bill + change at the end of this month? Should I throw our savings at it?

**Grad School:** I have also been accepted into an online Master's program in Computer Science through Georgia Tech. The total program is relatively cheap, ~$8,000 total, but there is a chance my employer won't pay for it. My employer has special connections with in-state schools and will pay for degrees from there, but won't necessarily pay other places. My boss thinks he can get them to agree to my program since it's so cheap, but I will need to save money for that or take out more loans (not particularly interested). 

**Appliances &amp; Trip Home:** As mentioned above, there are some new things that we will need to buy when going into a larger home. A washer and dryer will be one of them. We have seen used ones from $250-$300. Also, since my MS is online I will need to purchase some type of home desk to work from as well. Also, we currently live very far away from family and my wife desperately wants to visit home later this year. So looking to save up for a flight home as well.

Thanks for reading this far. I could really use some perspective, advice, and guidance on how to budget properly. I feel like I am covering my bases with health, savings, retirement, but it's not looking bright to pay down this debt. I appreciate any constructive criticism and look forward to reading the comments.

personalfinance,"6000 dollars in credit card debt after college, how do I come out ahead?","22 year old. recent graduate here. I would appreciate any advice. 

So in my last year of college, I had some increased living costs and to pay for that I used credit cards. I should have taken out a private student loan instead. My financial aid was delayed because of things I have no control over (verification and parents tax problems). I ended up getting the financial aid eventually but by that time I had racked up 6000 dollars in credit card debt over a span of 9 months. on top of that, I have 14000 dollars from federal school loans. So I am in the red now for 20,000 dollars. 

My first priority now is figuring out what to do with the 6000 dollars in credit card debt because of the high interest rate. 

When I asked financial aid officers for advise they told me to look for an uncertified private student loan. 

Do banks still offer these types of loans (student loans uncertified)? 

I will be able to pay off the debt on my own within 6 months at the earliest without taking out a loan but currently, I am paying 100 dollars in interest every month just for credit card debt. Another thing is my credit score is low currently because of the high utilization other than that my credit history is spotless.

Any advice guys and gals?",finance

personalfinance,Is exchanging dollars into foreign currency and placing it in a foreign high yield savings account practical? What's wrong with this idea?,"I know there's something called Foreign Exchange trading. I'm not sure if that's what I'm referring to though. I was thinking about how in some countries the interest rate placed by the country's central bank might higher than what you'd find in the US. The thought follows that if lets say the interest rate in a foreign country is 5% then I could theoretically convert dollars to the foreign exchange, keep the money in that bank and withdraw it at some point in the future to benefit from the higher interest rate earnings. Here's a list interest rates set in different countries: [https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/interest-rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/interest-rate). Obviously I wouldn't be looking to put it into an account in a country like Venezuela, but something just above the 2.5% the US is currently at. Maybe something in the 4-7%.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that there will be a hit in converting the money back into dollars but I imagine that's something that can be accounted for to some extent. Just wondering what the pitfalls of something like this would be. Immediately inflation of the foreign currency comes to mind. I also imagine there might be requirements in the foreign company to even open a savings account in said foreign country. What are the other pitfalls to this idea?",finance
personalfinance,Health insurance help for student attending out of state school?,"(cross post with r/Insurance)

&amp;#x200B;

I (24yo) am an Arizona resident currently on Medicaid insurance through the state. This fall I will be attending graduate school for a healthcare proffession out of state in Northern California. It is manditory that I have health insurance for the program I'm in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what to do for insurance while I'm out of state. My current Medicaid doesn't cover costs of healthcare outside of Arizona (found this out when I had a UTI while visiting California and had to pay about $600 out of pocket for the appointment, labs, and medication for it.) so even if it counts as health insurance for the program, any medical costs I will have to pay out of pocket.  

&amp;#x200B;

Insurance is offered through the school at $5000 per year for the basic plan (...private school...) so this seems extremely steep to me and I don't want (or know if I am able to) take out an extra $15000 in student loans just for health insurance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Parents health insurance is not an option, my father is permanently disabled and so he's on medicare, and my mom is on the federal 'Obamacare' insurance.

Any advice to undersand what my options are or where to find information on how to get health insurance as a student is greatly appreciated.",finance

Aside: 

\- I am currently under 24, but my parents say they are not claiming me as an independent on this next tax season. I do not know how this affects anything, but to my understanding, this does not affect how I fill out a W-4/Tax Withholding/etc as I am still classified as being able to be claimed as a dependent regardless of my parents' decision to claim me as one or not.

\- Using the provided calculator by IRS it determined, I believe I should withhold an additional 8 dollars from each paycheck. Correct me if this is off, thank you.

I definitely need some educating on this topic, and do not want to make a mistake. Would love to make sure I do not owe any taxes without knowing.

investing,"I wish that most stocks, ETF's and Mutual Funds did not pay a quarterly dividend.","Everyone I talk to about money and investing is so excited about the dividends their stocks, ETF's and mutual funds pay every three months.  Most of them don't reinvest their dividends and withdraw the money and spend the proceeds as mad money.  (Much like they view their federal and state income tax refund as also mad money.)

I try to explain to them that the payment of a stock dividend is more of an accounting gimmick than anything else. I tell them the stock price of the investment will drop an equal amount of the dividend the night before the dividend is paid.  So if you reinvest the dividend you have more shares but the same amount of money.  If you cash out the dividend payment and spend it on some mad money purchase you now have less money in the investment account. The stock value is less and you have fewer shares but you may be taxed on the dividend payment.

When I tell them this, no one believes me and they say the dividend payments are income, extra money much like bank interest. My comments about this fallacy are dismissed out of hand.

I also tell them that most investments with a high dividend yield won't give the total return of a TOTAL STOCK MARKET FUND.  This is also rejected.

Wouldn't it be better if most stocks did not bother with dividends and just put the money back in their business?",finance

Halfway through the month, June remains on track to be the best month for the Dow this year. (CNBC)

* The Fed won't cut rates at its June meeting. Here's why (CNBC)
* On today's U.S. economic calendar, the New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing Index is out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The National Association of Home Builders is out with its June sentiment index at 10 a.m. ET. There are no companies reporting quarterly earnings today. (CNBC)

* Wilbur Ross: It's 'complicated to negotiate with the European Union' (CNBC)
* Huawei will reduce its production capacity, which could hit revenue growth, the CEO of the Chinese tech giant said today, as he revealed his plans to deal with the continued pressure from the U.S. ""Our revenue will be down by about $30 billion dollars compared to forecasts, so our sales revenue due this year and next will be about $100 billion."" (CNBC)
* China's state news agency Xinhua said the country's investigation into FedEx (FDX) should not be seen as retaliation for trade tensions between the U.S. and China. China launched a probe over parcels intended for telecom giant Huawei delivered to the wrong address. (CNBC)

personalfinance,My mortgage lender called to refinance house under VA loan. Lowering interest rate by 1.5%. Details inside.,"Mortgage lender gave me a call, I have worked with the guy and he seems honest and truthful. We are both veterans and he reached out to let me know VA loan rates changed and he can get my percentage dropped 1.5%. I have owned the house 7 months. He sent me a rough estimate showing that I could save about 175$ a month on the loan with the percentage interest rate change. His fees are about $4000 to process it all. Loan would be extended 7 months to hit 30 years loan amount. Seems to good to be true. Just looking for some info if this is worth it.

personalfinance,Looking for student loan repayment advice,"Hey everyone, 

Sorry if you receive a lot of student loan posts, I read through many to find an answer to my question, but what I really need is advice specific to my situation. I have about 45k in student loans (direct unsubsidized) with a 5.3% interest rate. I'm scheduled for a standard payment schedule of $475 a month over 120 months. This leads to an estimated 12k in accrued  interest, and I'd like to avoid some of that by paying more than that $475 a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm looking for advice on how much more I need to pay each month to really make a difference in avoiding some of that interest** and getting my loans paid off sooner. Or should I be trying to pay larger amounts (1-2 grand) at a time when I can afford it, outside of those monthly payments? I don't have a lot of extra bills right now besides a car payment/insurance and rent, and already have a good amount of savings set aside for emergencies. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Separating from Federal Government - Rollover FERS Contributions?,"Hi,

I'm leaving the federal government with less than one year of service. From what I've read on https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/former-employees/, it seems that I'm eligible to take my 4.4% FERS contributions with me as a lump sum payment when I leave, or I can roll over my lump sum payment into an IRA, but I can't find any information on how to do that. I'm not familiar with retirement accounts and I'm scared I'll accidentally break tax laws.

I have a Schwab Roth IRA account that I already contributed the max ($6000) to this year. Am I still able to rollover my FERS contributions lump sum payment (about $2300) into my Roth IRA? If so, how do I go about doing that?

Thanks in advance for any advice or help.",finance
personalfinance,[US] - Unsure how my money would be better used - investing or getting rid of student loan debt.,"I made a new account because I didn't want all this tied to my main account. I was going to go to a financial adviser, but decided against it after reading around on here.

I've poked around on the wiki, but I very well could have missed some answers on it, so apologies if I did. I have a few questions that are probably simple enough to answer and any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Let me try and give some relevant information to start the post out with. 

* I am 30 years old and live in a rural area. No girlfriend/wife/kids and have no plans on changing any of that.

* I make about 58k a year with at least a 3% COL adjustment every year. There is plenty of room to grow here and plan on sticking around.

* I bought a house for ~82k in November and put 10k down. My mortgage is approx $550 a month and I pay $600. Since it's so new, it's still heavy in interest so the principal hasn't moved much.

* I have 2 degrees, so 2 student loans. The first one has $4,276.99 at about 6%. I pay $110 a month on it.

* The second loan has $20,546.34 on it at a much lower interest rate of about 3.75%. I pay $215 a month on it.

* No credit card debt/car payment.

* I have approx. $15,000 liquid. $10k in my emergency fund which is in an Ally account. I keep my checking at $5,000 at the end of every month. Whatever is leftover gets split between fun money and my house repair/renovation/appliance fund.

* My 401k is at ~$4,700 and ESPP is ~$3,800. I got hired/started contributing in late 2017.

My question is should I snowball/avalanche my student loans or would that be better off invested? I hate having those loans, but when I threw that info into a calculator, it wasn't saving me much interest at all. I was planning on putting $400 extra a month to my first student loan until it was gone. Then, taking the $400 + $110 and applying it to the second one.

My plan, with no real thinking behind it, was to get my student loans crushed within 3 years, and then add $400 to my mortgage payments to knock that out in about 10 years (again that was just based on some online calculator so I have no idea how valid those findings were). Maybe I got stuck in a bad line of thinking that I need to eliminate debt. But before I go down that path, I would love some advice because I am starting to think that the money would do more for me invested than it would getting rid of those loans.",finance
personalfinance,Empty ROTH IRA or take out 11k in federal student loans?,"It's really as simple as the title says. I'm torn between using my emergency fund (a ROTH IRA with 11k) or taking out loans to afford my last year of grad school. A conservative estimate of future salary is ~60k in an affordable city. I could graduate with no money and no debt. Or with debt and a chunky emergency fund (my living expenses per month come out to about 800). Two themes on this sub seem to be having an emergency fund and not incurring debt. So which ones wins out?! 

What would you do? 

Other details:

I have about 1.5k in my checking account to hold me over while I decide. 

I own an older car outright (170k miles) and live in a city where a car is a necessity. 

Finding a job in my field will be doable but finding a job I actually want may take a few months. 

My tuition is covered by a research job at the university so I only pay student fees and students healthcare which should come out to ~6k for the last year.

Edit: formatting
Edit #2:   Wow, thank you for the advice. I've never made a post on reddit before but felt overwhelmed by this decision and have always appreciated this sub. I have a lot to learn, and am so grateful for the nuanced responses that have made me aware of the gaps in my knowledge.",finance
personalfinance,Cash out refinance for student loans,"My wife has a large chunk of student loans.  $25,000 of the loans are at 5.25% interest.  $40,000 are at a 6% interest rate.  Back in 2011 we stretched the loans out to a 25 year payment period, obviously we know we pay more in interest doing so, but we felt like it was the only way we could buy a house or have a child without waiting the ten years to pay off the loans.  

Outside of the loans and a mortgage (I will come back to to that) we have almost no debt.  I have $4,000 in student loans that will be paid off shortly, and we have my wife's car payment that has about 13,000 remaining.

We recently had our home appraised and we have about $160,000 in equity.  Our mortgage is currently at a 4% interest rate.  Would it make sense to do a cash out refinance to pay off the student loans?  I just did some basic math, and we could essentially pay 200 dollars more per month in our mortgage (depending on rate we get), saving us about $505 a month in total payments.  This doesn't calculate the cost of refinancing, so the numbers are obviously rough.  In the grand scheme of this we would pay about 30,000 more in interest if we were to refinance and pay the minimum mortgage payment, but we would also have the opportunity to increase our payment amount if we wanted.  In my mind it seems like there are two threats 1. If we went underwater on our home due to job loss or sickness we have almost no protections, where we have those protections with student loans.  2.  We have less flexibility if for some reason we needed to use the cash out refinance to get cash quickly.

Would this make sense to do or am I overthinking this?",finance
personalfinance,Girlfriends (29) wants to help pay off her parents mortgage.,"Hey guys!

My girlfriend has about 120k in liquid saving (we are working on re-shaping her retirement &amp; investment strategy right now as she is way to liquid, and she is already maxing out 401k and IRA) and she wants to help alleviate some of the pressure her parents have by paying off their mortgage of about 100k dollars. Their interest rate is about 5,5 percent. Her parents would pay her back the same amount they pay every month but directly to her over the next X years till completion.

I think it is really commendable that she is willing to help her parents this way and it will save them a lot of money.

If we consider that she will help them with the mortgage regardless, is this the smartest way to go on about it?

I understand the value of having capital and compound interest. Is it smarter for her to invest that liquid money/ buy property/ try to get a return on that lump sum and help her parents pay the interest for example, or is it better to just get rid of her parents debt all together and invest the money she gets back from them as it comes in.

Also she has full trust in her parents but should she notarize such a large transaction if she was to do it?

My company is helping me with rent for the first 6 months, and they give me 700 for rent pre-tax, and I pay the rest. I have a roomate, and our apartment is going to be around 800-900 each, so for the first 6 months rent is going to be around ~$150 

then after that its 800-900. I have a car, and it's paid off completely, but I do have one college loan for $5500. It's subsidized, and the interest rate is 4.2%. Here are my questions.

1. How should I pay the loan back? I'm going to have a good amount of money left over due to the low rent, should I just pay it off ASAP? or just have it on autopay and forget about it? 

2. my current 401k contribution is 2% (I don't know who decided this) What should I make it as a 23 year old? 5%? 10%? etc Im thinking 10, but not too sure. My company does 100% matching for up to 10% as far as I know.

3. Should I also put money into the IRA 401k? maybe split it up 5% and 5%? 

Edit: Sorry I forgot, I have  $4000 in savings.

personalfinance,Using savings to pay off remaining student loans and taking a bite out of CC debt,"I've recently come to the realization that I have a spending problem, and am trying to take corrective action before I get myself further in the hole.  I want to use either Mint or YNAB to make a budget and start sticking to it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've amassed about $7000 on a fairly high interest credit card over the past few years through aforementioned frivolous spending. I use the credit card for basically everything, and I've never really had a budget, kind of a general state of my finances in my head, but things got out of hand and I got bad about not paying off the statement every month and now we're here.  I still have about $2500 left on my student loans to pay off as well - I recently used my tax refund to pay off a large chunk of them.  The student loans don't have a large interest rate fortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

I have \~$7000 in my personal savings/rainy day account currently.  I could more or less wipe out my credit card debt using what's there, but I don't want to put myself in a bind if something happens and I don't have any money in savings.  If I paid off my student loans, I could use what I normally put towards it (\~$300/mo) to put towards the credit card debt.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, in my head I'm thinking the following is a good course of action:  Putting a chunk of my savings to get rid of my student loans (\~$2500) and another sizable chunk (another $2500) towards the CC debt.  This would leave about $2000 in my savings for emergencies (not a lot, but better than nothing).  After that, moving towards using a strict budget and probably a cash only system (to help keep myself in check) for daily purchases and paying off the remaining the balance on the CC with what's left over.  What are your thoughts?  Would it better to exhaust my savings to get out from under the CC debt ASAP and slowly build it back up? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm open to any advice - mainly how to handle things as they currently stand, but also towards building a budget, as I would like to not find myself back in this position in the future.",finance
personalfinance,Pension termination advice,"Wife is an RN at a hospital. She’s worked there for about 6 years. She recently received a notice that the hospital is getting rid of all pensions and are essentially leaving employees with three options. 1.) roll over into their 403b 2.) cash out or 3.) do nothing—account will be transferred to an insurance company who will pay out once she retires. 

Back story: we have some debt that we would like to pay off.  We found out my job was not withholding state taxes and under withholding federal. We were already on a payment plan after some 1099 work I did while starting my career. Ultimately my fault for not paying attention. However this left us with a considerable tax bill. We decided on an aggressive payment plan in the hopes of just getting it taken care of quickly.  We bit off more than we could chew. My paychecks are lower due to overwithholding for safety’s sake. This along with a monthly tax bill has us sort of treading water. 

We have the option to cash out a portion of this pay out and put the rest into her 403b.  Besides the obvious taxes and penalties is there something else we should worry about if we just peeled a portion off to rid ourselves of this tax bill. 

I know the right answer; But we could really use the breathing room a cash out would provide.",finance

The first page of the document, with my name and interest rate and everything on it, listed this as a 30-year fixed mortgage at that rate. As I continued through the paperwork, though, there was a page with two check boxes: one stating that I wished to lock in my rate now and pay a fee (the amount of which was left blank to be filled in later), and another one that would sign me up for a 'floating interest rate' which would then have to be locked down within 14 days of settlement, and at that time the interest rate could change to 'reflect market averages' or something like that and included language that the bank was under no obligation to renew a previously offered rate. The check box for this 'floating interest rate' was already ticked and a line for me to sign on was dotted at the bottom.

I just graduated college and have a 61K job I'll be starting in July with great benefits and potential for great salary growth. I got through college with my 2004 Jeep Liberty, but have put over 5K in repairs/maintenance in the car over the past 14 months purely out of convenience and not having the time to purchase another vehicle. It seems like every few months there is some issue that pops up requiring another $350 to fix. This has been endlessly frustrating as it has essentially depleted any additional balance in my checking account from internships; and the car is only worth about $2400. Clearly I need a replacement, but the financing options are a little tricky. I have adequate funds to put down 20% of a 33K vehicle, but my credit score isn't exactly where I would like it to be for a car loan (under 700). And lastly, I have 25K in student loans with the highest interest rate being 4.7%.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the three options that I have thought through (obviously open to more):

1. Build up my credit to hopefully get a better APR while simultaneously saving some money so I can put more down. Using this option I was thinking to buy the car by December at the earliest.
2. Buy a car now using a longer term loan for lower monthly payments to essentially get out from under my current car. Once I am satisfied with my credit score, I would then look to refinance the loan.
3. Buy used car under 10K now with cash that I can then use for a few years. Over those few years I can build up credit and save money to possibly buy my next car cash as well.

Edit: I recognize that option 3 is the smartest decision, but I am absolutely sick of repairs/maintenance and would be worried about getting a car with significant miles on it.

I would have to liquidate some investments to cover the down payment, which I'm not thrilled about but could easily do. I have cash on hand for closing costs. 

Stats: credit score &gt; 800, owe 260k on a house worth ~450k, no other debt. I will gross 130k this year in income and next year will be closer to 150k. Hoping to get the lot for under 120k (likely).

I would not be building for at least a year, possibly 2. I've read that you can roll a lot loan into a construction loan when the time comes - is it the same deal for a home equity loan?

personalfinance,I just got a job!! I'm finally able to start paying off my mountain of credit card debt and could really use some advice.,"## I just recently got a job and I'm finally ready to start chipping away at my credit card debt! I could really use some suggestions.

📷

First off, I want to send out a huge thank you to everyone on this sub. I’ve had a lot of great advice along with some good and bad days when it comes to reducing my credit card debt. Now that I have a job and used unbury.me (HUGE help!) I have set up a plan to pay off 100% of my debt over the next 24 months.

However, I ran into a couple of pitfalls when calling my individual credit card companies. All of these have been past due at least 90 days. Most were able to significantly lower my APR while giving me attainable monthly payments. However, Capital One, Barclay and American Express still need a little work. I’ve explained the details individually below and would appreciate any advice you could give. 

American Express: Balance - $2,170, APR 29.99%, $65/month min

I called and made a small payment ($35) to prevent this account from being charged off. They said the APR is stuck here for the next 6 months of consecutive payments, then I can talk to them about reducing this to 23% APR. This account is closed, I’m surprised they weren’t able to offer me a better deal. Any suggestions?

Capital One: Balance - $13,103, APR 24.15%, $233/month min

This will be charged off on July 6th, this account is currently in Collections within Capital One. The best deal they would offer me was to suppress the past due fee and start charging a $233 minimum payment and they would then assess if they could lower the interest rate after 3 months of consecutive payments. Because of the terrible deal with Amex it makes me wonder if it is better to wait until this is charged off to negotiate a better APR?

Barclay: Balance - $2,443, 29% APR, $72/month min

This will charge off on August 29th. The only “deal” the system generated was to settle at 40% over 90 days. The person I spoke with suggested I call back in a month to see if there was a better deal that appears in the automatically generated system. I am trying to get a monthly payment plan like $300/month over 8 months or something, but right now I can only settle or continue payments as usual. Should I just do as he says and call back in a month and hope for a monthly payment, lower APR deal?

In case you were interested, these are the accounts that I was able to negotiate a more feasible plan.

Chase: $6,613.63 - 0% APR over 60 months, $111/month minimum

Frontier: $13,615 - 5.9% APR over 60 months, $273/month minimum

Discover: $1,597 - 9.9% APR over 12 months, $24/month then reassess after 12 months

I can pay up to $2,000 total per month with my new job and living very frugally. To the best of my knowledge, all of these accounts are closed and will remain so indefinitely. I won’t be using another credit card again for quite a long time if ever!!! This has all been a valuable lesson. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.",finance

So far what I have been doing seems to be working, as I currently have around a 750 credit score. 


The problem that I am having is that when I apply for new credit cards I always get denied, the reasoning being age of credit history, and lack of recent installment loans. Thanks to my parents, I did not need to take out student loans, I never needed to take out a car loan, and I have never carried a balance on my credit card, so I have no non-revolving credit history. 


My question is, should I consider taking out a &lt;=$500 secured loan just to build installment loan credit history? Also, if I pay nearly all of this loan off, and just keep it open for the next few years, will my interest payments stay low for the entire time? I hope to buy a house in the next few years, so that is why I am concerned about my credit score. 


Would carrying a balance on my credit card accomplish this as well, all advice I've seen so far has stated to never carry a balance if it can be avoided due to the high interest rate.

I was talking to a friend, and he mentioned, why pay mortgage when you are just paying the bank interest. And plus your value of your home goes up. And he said he'd rather invest that money instead of paying down mortgage. He'd rather have liquid assets rather than money tied down.

But I was under the impression that whatever we owe is whatever we owe 400k. That value does not change even if your home price goes up. And we have fixed interest rate so I want to pay down our mortgage in 20 years instead of 30 so that we don't waste money on interest. We also have a chance to refinance because interest rates went down so we'd be saving like 400 a month in mortgage.

personalfinance,Contribute to a taxable index fund vs. Trad/Roth IRA vs. School Loans,"Hi all, I was looking for a bit of advice. I've gone through investopedia, bogleheads, and this site pretty frequently but can't decide how I should best approach this next step.

I'm 30 years old and I currently have established an emergency fund for six months of expenses in a high yield savings account and realized that I have saved more than I originally intended. I currently have an employer government pension plan (automatic deductions and includes employer match) and contribute the maximum to a 457b and some to a 403b account which are divided in 70% stocks and 30% bonds.

I currently make more than the income limit for a maximum contribution to a RothIRA and but less than the income limit and judging off previous years would flow from just above the limit for a max to just below the income limit until retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

My two main financial goals are to eliminate my student loan debt (interest rate 4-6% on them; about 50K left from 110K in about 4 years) and expand my investments but have them accessible within 5, 10, or 15 years. I figured I didn't necessarily need a traditional IRA given I have two tax-deferred options and if I ever leave, I can roll over the balance to an IRA. I've  read and understand all the benefits of the roth IRA but am unclear if it's worth contributing less than the max with two/three other retirement accounts. Especially if I can use that money towards a taxable index fund. I also usually have little issues making payments on my loans plus adding to the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards placing this sum into a taxable index fund (VFINX, FXAIX, etc; ultimately do want some investments in actual stocks but thought this would be a better start given my lack of knowledge).  Perhaps I should still place a portion of this into a Roth IRA for potential future tax savings? I'm just concerned of spreading myself too thin. Another option would be to just stop contributing to the 403b (or make the contributions much smaller) and prioritize the Roth for each year instead? Also looking to refinancing my student loans for a lower interest rate as well. Thoughts on the above? I appreciate your advice in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Need help with where I need to pay off bills vs invest in myself and house.,"I have quite a few questions because I'm have no idea where I should be headed from the situation that I'm in. So a bit about the position I'm (we) in. My, now fiancé and I, got out of college May of last year. She graduated with a BS in general Biology, while due to some unfortunate circumstances I never graduated. I did however obtain an Associate degree. (not like that has much weight now a days though) We were living with my dad between when we graduated and umtil about March 2019. We had rented for all but 6 months of our 6 year relationship so we knew we were ready to buy a house. I had gotten a decent job that's salary. My fiancé couldn't (and still can't) find a job in her field, so she works at a grocery store and makes ok money for doing what she does (12/hr). My dad was kind enough to let us stay rent free until we paid off some dept and got some other things in line. We bought our first house in March for $93,500 with 0% down through a first time home buyer program with the state (WI). Being a cheaper and old (1900) house it needs quite a bit of work, which between the experience of my father and I, I won't ever need to hire someone to do. A few weeks ago my fiancé and I had a conversation about saving up an emergency fund or at least some kind of savings for when things go wrong. So this all stems from that conversation. We are both unsure of what needs to be done to head in the right direction. 

One thing I never learned how to do was budget, I was always a spender. When I got money I went and bought that shiny new object. So that's something I'm working on, but I'm far from perfect. I try to create a budget for every paycheck and stick to that. However sticking to the budget is the difficult part. I'm sick of living paycheck to paycheck,but I can never seem to break that mold. It's gotten us into lots of arguments and it needs to change. I just don't know how. Now it's less shiny new objects but more so things to fix the house up.

As for a savings, I haven't had a savings since my first year of college. I'd like to start saving and try to build up a decent nest egg so that if something comes along I don't need to skip paying a bill in order to pay for an emergency. But I have no idea what the target should be. $300? $1000? No clue. I also should mention I want to save up to start a business(online apparel company) or at least a side hustle(professional car detailing) . Either one would require about $500-$1000 startup cost. One would require minimal attention and the other would be a weekend job of sorts. 

I also have some debts. Obviously student loans, but I also have a small amount of credit card debt, car loans, and obviously mortgage. I'll break down the numbers further down the post. But what should I be paying for first? Should I pay of certain things like credit cards then stick more into savings? Unfortunately I know I don't make enough money to put a little everywhere and that's where I'm lost and need some guidance.

Our house also needs quite a bit of work like I mentioned. We have put about $4000 of work into it to make the first floor liveable. The upstairs and kitchen still needs about another $4000 worth of work total. Is this something I take out a personal loan to do? Or just save the money up to try and get this done? 

My last question is about a retirement fund. I don't have one yet. I don't get a 401k until August I believe from work. Should I be sticking money into one on the side though? Like a Roth Ira or something? Or should I wait until I have some more things paid off until I do? 

Financial details:

Salary: $38,500
Auto allowance: $550/mo or $6,600/year
Both equate to $1,405.85 net every two weeks. 


Daily car:
     Loan left- $24,353.73 
     Payment- $436. 48/mo (should I refinance? I think it's 5.9% which I know is high and my credit is quite a bit higher since I originally bought it.) 

My fun car:
     Loan left- $541.12
     Payment- $182. 11/mo

Credit card: $581 (17% interest rate) 
Min. Payment of $25 but I always try to send it at least $50/mo.

Student loan#1:
Loan left: $21,228
Payment: $221.81 though I try to send in $250/mo

Student Loan#2:
Loan left: $3,604.25 @ 8.865% interest 
Payment: $50.02/mo

Phone bill: $160/mo

Other bills(mortgage, electric, ect): $500

Groceries: $200/mo

I should mention that my fiancé and I split the bills for living costs 50/50. It's always been like that and its worked well for us for the past 4-5 years. Also I drive for work so they pay me an extra $550 a month to use my own car. Thats what the Car allowance is. Also part of the reason I have two cars. If something would ever happen where we needed money fast, I would sell it in a heart beat. The car means a lot to me but in the end I know it's just a car.

solar,I'm conflicted on getting solar + new roof regarding costs. Would you do it?,"I need a new roof and want solar (12kW system).    


I have quotes for a new roof of $17k and solar is $30k (before incentives).    


My average monthly electricity cost right now is $120 for electricity for about 1,200kWh usage each month ($0.10 per kWh cost).  I have a gas furnace and electric water heater.  I have not replaced light bulbs in my house or done any energy savings yet. I know I need more insulation my attic in various places too.  We also have a plug-in hybrid that charges full at about 13.2kWh and we travel on pure electricity about 800 miles/month conservatively (roughly 27 full charges at $1.35/charge) = $36.50 monthly cost.  


That said, regardless of how badly I want solar I'm having trouble pulling the trigger.  I have about $5k right now to spend on this and another $5k later this year for a total cash investment of $10k.    


Roof: $17k

Solar: $30k

\-$5k cash  
$47k loan at what I'm guessing will be 20 years and 5% = $310/month initially.    


Then:  
\-$9k federal incentive

\-$5k cash

Remaining loan (not counting payments towards the loan to this point): $33k = $217/month.    


And we can subtract a savings of $36.50 for charging our plug-in hybrid for free now = $180/month.  

$180 - our current average of $120 = $60  


Basically I end up with a new roof and 12kW solar panels for an added $60/month.    


We do have net metering, but no other cash incentives, we don't get paid for any extra electricity production, but we do get it 'banked' for us by our utility company for use at night or during winter.    


I want to take advantage of the federal credit and net metering before they go away, but I'm staring at $60 increase in bills every month with a 20 year loan...could probably pay this off sooner though.  Am I crazy to go forward with this?

personalfinance,Mortgage downpayment transferred to Chase and chance of on hold?,"So I am about to transfer 5X,000 USD from Korea to USA in my banking account in Chase as part of charity from parents to purchase a real estate with the downpayment. From Korean end, we don't have issues since the charity money can be verifiable within legally authorized amounts and documentations. And plus, Korean government isn't as police state as US government and banking institution, meaning that there are some other ways around (Oh I am talking about S. Korea if not N. Korea BTW).

What I am more concerned about is when the money is transferred to Chase Bank in USA. I heard so many horror stories that Chase along with BoA put customer's banking accounts on hold for fear of international money laundering, and therefore they just simply don't take the chance when red flag arises, which is often determined by algorithm not by humans, such as large amounts of international wire transfer.

Occasionally, my parents used to wire international transaction to Chase during my school, which was couple of years ago, so I don't think it is too surprising to Chase (but the amount was usually less than 20,000 USD). Also, I think I have a fairly good relation with Chase having 2 premium credit card and joint banking account with direct deposit. I don't see any red flag, but I am here to ask for lenders, who might have some terrible experiences with big banks such as Chase to determine if it is okay to send large amount of money thru international transfer, and suddenly the account was place on hold until further determinations by the bank fraud team, which often takes more than couple of months.

Some friends suggested to do this with small community union, which is often negligently reviewed by federal authorities due to small size of the bank while Chase or BoA are more rigorously reviewed by Feds. Plus, unlike Chase or BoA, where anti-fraud department is not even available to speak with you in person and in-branch specialists won't be too much helpful to resolve this issue, at least, you are allowed to talk to them in person and explain your case in small community union bank.

Once international wire transfer is posted, I am intending to wire most of the money to escrow to pay the downpayment, which is another big red flag to most of banking system since it did not stay long enough and the source is from foreign country.

My closing date is coming, and apparently, the last thing I want to see is chase bank places my banking account on hold.... Am I just being too nervous?

So my specific question is, I am sure that I will be able to verify why I transfer the down payment to escrow, (because of down payment), and will this be helpful to remove the hold?

Any one having an experience on this kind of international transfer?....",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a new credit card to transfer $7k from high interest card (Low 600s creditwise)?,"I just graduated college and have a job lined up with a $50k salary. Through my 6 years in college I wasn't the best at budgeting money and accrued about $7k in debt on a capital one platinum card which I have had since I turned 18. I have not missed a payment and lately have been paying about $2-300 per month. Unfortunately, the interest on the card is 22% meaning more than half of what I pay is simply covering interest. With my new job I plan on paying about 6-800 per month but the high interest is still bothering me.

During my time in college I have considered remedying my situation but two factors have stopped me from looking to transfer my debt to a new card

1. Due to my high debt, I have a low credit score. I was worried that applying for a new card would give me a new card with another high interest rate. While it may come with a period of no interest to allow me to pay off my debt, I was worried that after that time is up I would get screwed having two high interest cards. (Side note: using the projection simulator, I only need to pay $2500 to raise my score above 700)
2. I was worried to get a new credit card since I didn't want to increase my limit (currently $7500) and get more in debt. I saw myself get more in debt with each credit limit i was approved for and although there were times I worked hard to pay off my debt I knew it would be practically futile if I had over $10,000 in debt.

Given the reasons above, I put off getting a new card but now that I look to the future I would like to pay off this card in the quickest and most manageable way possible. Should I apply for a transfer account to lighten the burden now? Should I pay off a few thousand and then apply for a better card? Are there cards I should consider for either scenario? My student loan payments kick in January 2020 so I would like to lighten this debt so I can have it a bit easier in 2020.

investing,Arstechnica: Federal bill would allow clean energy companies to structure like oil companies,"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/federal-bill-would-allow-clean-energy-companies-to-structure-like-oil-companies/

&gt; Last week, US senators and representatives introduced bills in the Senate and the House to open up a type of corporate structure originally reserved for oil, gas, and coal companies to clean energy companies.

&gt; Called a Master Limited Partnership (MLP), the structure currently allows fossil fuel companies to take advantage of lower taxes placed on limited partnerships while also allowing those companies to issue publicly traded stocks and bonds. If the recently re-introduced bills—which have bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate—pass their respective votes, clean energy companies would have the option to structure their companies as MLPs and take advantage of the tax and funding benefits.

It's going to be interesting to see if yieldcos (e.g. Nextera Energy Partner, CWEN, Pattern Energy) switch to MLPs should those bills pass, and if other utility/energy companies would also consider running MLPs.",finance
personalfinance,Funding one year of medical school,"I have a fiancee whom was accepted to medical school last year at a new  school undergoing the accreditation process. Since it was far away from  me and from her immediate family, and it would have required taking out  expensive private loans (federal loans are unavailable until this  school's third year, which would be next year), she deferred that  acceptance in the hope of being accepted elsewhere. Unfortunately, that  didn't happen and now it appears that this first school may be her only  choice. The problem is that she has a credit score around 700 and would  have no income. I have better credit (\~790), but also have a mortgage of  \~115k and limited income (\~35k) while I'm in grad school. We were just  denied a loan for the cost of her attendance for one year ($75k). We  don't have any better options for family co-signers. How can we make  this work? How can I predict how much of a loan we would actually get  approved for? I have a modest portfolio that I could liquidate that  could probably cover most of this, but I'd really rather not nuke my  entire life savings. I think next year would be easier to get loans for since the school will have reached the appropriate status so that students can get federal loans.

 

Morning update: I'll clarify a few things to better outline the situation.

1. This is a new, US medical school one year away from accreditation - there is  no reason the last step should fail and there are safeguards in place to take care of the students in the event of that unprecedented non-accreditation situation. I have no concerns here and would rather  address the Year One financing issue.
2. I'm asking for help on figuring out how to maximize the private student  loans we can get for the first year (after that normal federal loans will be available). For instance, we were denied the full $75k, but **might we be approved for $50k? $20k?** Each different loan amount is a different loan application, and if we just keep trying I'll beat up both our credit scores with hard inquiries.
3. There are two lenders suggested by the school, both big names. **Could we potentially get a smaller loan from each?**
4. Deferment/re-application is a definite option, but I'm trying to workshop other ideas.",finance
personalfinance,Old car just died. Is looking at buying another one right now a good idea?,"On mobile so please forgive any errors. Also still dealing with the emotions of getting stranded by my car...

I purchased a used 2000 VW Jetta vr6 manual  (170k miles, now 179k) November of 2017 for $2100. Paid cash so i owe nothing on this car. Car has consistently had issues and I've fixed a lot of them myself and I've had a mechanic fix some things that were out of my league too. All in all, I estimate I've probably spent about 4-5k in repairs in the last 2 years. Today she quit on me on the way home in the rain. Total loss of mechanical and electrical power and left me stranded. Brother in law towed me home.

I guess I'm just fed up on repairing this thing and don't want to spend anymore money fixing it to have it limp by anymore.  I have 15k in savings and am really tempted to show up on a Toyota lot and get a used one for around 10k or so. I was trying to save this money to buy a house soon, but I got 15k saved up in a little less than a year so it's not like my ""life"" savings. It just feels kind of wrong to blow  two thirds instantly. House buying wasn't in the immediate future, but it finally felt like I had a good start.  I can probably recoup two or three hundred dollars by scrapping the damn vw. I also have only bought used cars from private sellers and not dealerships. If the advice is to go to dealership, what should I look out for signing papers-wise? Should I feign like I'm pulling out a loan from them and then after price is official on paper, buy the car outright? Extended warranty advice? General dealership advice would also be helpful. I'm also a salesman, but I can't counter something that I don't notice or know about since i have no experience on a lot. 

Other information: I live in the U.S. (west coast). I own a 98 Toyota rav4 that's still going strong. Fiance uses this to go to school and work so having 1 car to share won't work (that's why I bought this one). She is quitting her job, so I will be handling 100% of bills, which will come out to ~$1100/mo total. Fiance also just got a consolation for braces which will be $4500. Monthly income is ~$3500. New to credit, but score is 743 according to credit karma. I was probably going to use part of my savings to buy her braces outright, but we were planning on talking about that tonight.. i just feel a little overwhelmed. Any help is much appreciated

Edit: decision is to check out private sellers. If anyone has advice there, I'd still be looking for wisdom. Maybe like dropping half the amount on the spot and getting a car loan for the other half? May help my credit that way too?",finance
Forex,AUDUSD to 0.64 by....July?,"You may have seen my post here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/brwusb/audusd_bold_call_thoughts/

Admittedly, nobody can truly time when these things happen, I was being cute trying to get the timing right. That said, coming out of the RBA minutes less than an hour ago, I have even more conviction that the Australian dollar will hit 0.64 sometime in the near future.

That would be roughly 7% of downside from here. The RBA minutes were incredibly dovish and data has been persistently weak. I doubt the RBA rate cuts will be able to put out the dumpster fire that is happening in the land down under and safe haven flooding into Yen, DXY, etc, will be much more attractive. 

Ongoing trade negotiations between US and China will not resolve. I also think the market is in for a fun surprise on Wednesday with a more hawkish-than-expected Fed (expectations are extremely dovish, and certain transitory factors the Fed flagged did bounce back, despite a soft CPI print...but they look at PCE anyways, right?). 

This will create a phenomenal shorting opportunity for the AUD, even from current levels.

Historically, we can see the last time we saw 0.64 was roughly a decade ago. Inflation was roughly at the same level we are today, the cash rate was higher, etc.

My plan is to take my starting bonus and pay off the credit card debt and save the rest plus my first two pay checks for a down payment on a car. I have a car I can use for my first month (borrowing). 

The car loan interest will be 3.99%, and my student loans range from 2.7% all the way up to 7%.

I obviously want to consolidate the big loans (two for 45k each) at a better interest rate, but what makes the most sense in terms of what to pay off first? 

I believe if I can hold out a month longer on the car I can pay off one or two of the small student loans, as my living expenses will be less than $1,000 per month until September.

I'm wondering if it would make sense to put less down on a car and pay off any loan that has interest higher than 3.99%. This will make my monthly expenses increase (10 year student loan vs 5 year car loan) but I will be paying less in interest.

$2,000 @ 3.1%

3 loans of $5,000 @ 4.5%

2 loans of $45,000 @ 7%

personalfinance,Is the interest payment calculated differently in the US than in the EU/Germany?,"I've recently read a reddit thread were someone calculated the interest rate in the US for another user.

worldpolitics,US Cyber Attacks,"The United States has been exploring Russian power grids since 2012, but in recent months there is increasing evidences of cyber attacks by the United States, as well as a number of other countries, in particular Israel, regarding infrastructure facilities of other countries. And this, of course, applies to Russia which is the main rival of the United States. 

Thus, for example, from an article published on June 15, 2019, by the American publisher of ""The New York Times"", it became known about the intensification of US cyber attacks against the Russian energy system: US intelligence agencies tried to introduce malicious software into the Russian power grid.

US President Donald Trump said that this information is not true and accused the publisher of ""high treason"". Although the publisher itself before the publication of the material passed it to the representatives of national security, who did not see any fears. The former showman and the current president of the country, chasing a victory in the upcoming elections in 2020 and his election for a second term, even earlier predicted an unprecedented market collapse if he did not win. 

According to a representative of the Russian security agency, there was no direct damage to security. Nevertheless, a spokesman for the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, notes that these actions on the part of Washington indicate the possibility of conducting cyberwar actions against the Russian Federation.

Presumably, in 2018, the Pentagon’s cyber headquarters even got the highest powers from the Congress and the White House to independently conduct highly aggressive cyber operations, that is, now they do not need permission from the president, but only the consent of the Minister of Defense is sufficient.

Also, Washington unreasonably argues that Russia allegedly itself conducts cyber attacks against the United States. It should be recalled that Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said in a public statement that the US authorities believe that potential digital operations will allow them ""to tell Russia or anyone else who is engaged in cyber operations against us: ""You will regret it"". And ""the United States does not plan to tolerate Moscow’s attempts to influence the election results and is ready to cause serious harm to anyone who makes such an attempt"". 

However, in response to the statement in Russia, they responded that ""Moscow, unlike Washington, did not and would never have to do with cyber attacks"". And the Russian presidential spokesman D. Peskov, on behalf of the country, has repeatedly offered Washington to resist cybercrime together, but did not find a response.",technology
personalfinance,Looking for advice on getting a car with bad credit,"I'm a 32M who lives in WA and I've had no vehicle for the last year. Where I live I've been able to get to work with the bus and use the family car for errands, etc.

I've been in and out of jobs the last few years and in rough spots but that's another story. I've been working a full time job the last 3 months, and have been looking into getting a vehicle.

I live in WA state, and bring home roughly $800 AFTER taxes every 2 weeks. I've been living with my father for the last year, and pay $350 a month for rent. I have a no-contract phone that I pay 35 bucks a month flat for. I have 2 credit cards that I no longer use but are past-due and I'm paying them down (~200 a month total for the 2). I owe the state $250, and I have 1 acct in collections for an old cell phone I didn't finish paying off. It has 400 left on it, and I just set up payment plan for 5 payments every 2 weeks (~75 bucks a paycheck).

I just checked my credit score on Credit Karma, and it's 440. When I turned 18, I worked at Best Buy, and sold credit cards to people and ended up doing the same to myself. I had 2 financing cards that I just loaded up the day I got with toys and gadgets, and I got approved for another 2-3 credit cards between 500-2K. Lets just say I'm not good with money, I was young, and all those cards got full quick. Between payoffs, and write-offs, those debts are all gone, but they affected my score and I've never grown it since.

I also have about 35k in student debt, but since I haven't really settled down since college I've been postponing them. They aren't negative, or in bad standing, but it is accruing interest slowly.

So thats the position I'm in financially, and I've been thinking more and about trying to get some wheels but I don't know how to go about getting them. My father (whos 65, typical baby boomer, right wing) seems to think I can go to any car dealer and with the ""right talk"" I can get what I want. He also seems to think I can move out on my own into an apartment market of 900-1200 a month for a 1 bedroom, on a 1600 a month salary, with bad credit and no help.

I've been looking/thinking about a few different options, but not having much experience/knowledge, hopefully someone can give some advice.

I've looked and thought about a few options, between saving a few months and buying an old piece of junk outright, or should/could I try to get a loan? If so, should I try the bank? (Navy federal). I gave some info to carsdirect, and a few other sites like that, and I've been contacted by a number of people. Some local numbers, and some 800 numbers, and some who said, come down right now, you can drive away 2 hours later!. I've followed up with a few of the local places, and they told me to come in and look at their inventory and talk to them. I brought it up to my dad tonight at dinner, and said if I went if he would want to come with me, and his response was I should go myself and try and work on it, and if I couldn't he would go for support. I think he thinks I want him to go so they pressure him to co-sign (which isn't the case) I just have never done anything like this, and I don't want to walk into a sucker punch (cuz I will)

Either way, I'm hoping for some advice. Someone in my position, with my wages, and credit score, what would be the best route to go for getting a car?

personalfinance,What happens to a private student loan if the co-signer dies and then the student dies after?,When the co-signer of a private student loan dies is that persons estate relieved of co-signer duties if the student is still alive making scheduled payments? If the student dies say a year or two after the co-signer would the co-signer’s estate be liable to pay somehow. E.G if the co-signer had a house given to a family member upon death would that family member have to potentially forfeit the house? This is assuming loan doesn’t disappear after students death like federal loans.,finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

economy,The Federal Reserve is not afraid of inflation,"While financial markets are worried about the higher US tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, the Federal Reserve is considering an appropriate response to the growing trade shock, analyzes the finance and business journal [Economo](http://www.economo.co.uk/). The key question is whether the Fed will perceive the quake mainly as a contraction in demand or a supply shock that could raise consumer prices by a full percentage point.

The Fed perceives that it can ignore the inflationary risks of higher duties and lower interest rates as insurance against rising recession risks. The Central Bank did something similar in 1995.

Markets view the trade war as a global demand shock that will reduce growth without rising inflation. The regulator's answer is unambiguous. Interest is likely to be downgraded, perhaps ahead, to mitigate future growth slowdowns.

For this reason, the US bond market is currently calculating a fall in interest rates in July and a total of 1 percentage point (from the current 2.25%) to the end of next year.

Recently, the Fed's open money market failed to signal that it was considering an early interest rate cut. In fact, March's expectations were for an increase of 0.25 percentage points in 2020. Even in May, the Commission did not give any direction for its next move, stressing that it would be ""patient"" before taking any action.

Last time there was such a pause in the Fed guidelines (in December 2018), global stock markets collapsed because of fears that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates for a long time. This time, facing an even greater trade shock, the markets were protected by a much faster and supportive response from the Fed.

In recent days, the Fed leadership has definitely abandoned its previous neutral position. President Jerome Powell said that ""we will act appropriately to support economic expansion in a strong labor market and inflation close to our 2% target"".

This was taken as a promise to act swiftly if the momentum in the economy slowed further. Deputy Fed Chairman Richard Clarida explained that as a member of the Commission he is inclined to ignore the initial effects of higher tariffs on prices in the name of growth around the average. This clearly indicates that any slowdown in growth, which is already below the average, will cause interest rates to fall even if the tariffs raise consumer prices.

Richard Clarida went further by pointing out that interest rates had been lowered in the past (mentioning 1988 and especially 1995) to provide ""insurance"" against the risks to economic activity. He added that the need for anticipatory action this year will be assessed in the light of new data.",finance

I am 19 y/o engineering student with approximately 10k in private student loans and 5k in federal.  I am paying off the interest on my private loan as it accrues, totaling about $55 per month at the moment.  I am expecting to make 5-6k from an internship this summer and was wondering what the best use for it is.  Should I open up an IRA and contribute a couple grand this early to let it grow or is my money better spent going towards my private loan?  If I were to open up an IRA, would it be better to go with a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA?

On a side note, I feel that getting a credit card would help me build some credit history.  I do not believe my current credit score is that bad for my age, sitting around 650 according to credit karma, but I would like to start growing that if I can.  What is best to prioritize in choosing my card as far as rewards or card details?  Some cards offer a welcome bonus if you spend a certain amount of money in the first three months and I was wondering of I could meet this by making a payment towards my loan or towards an IRA and paying the charge off immediately through my savings.

personalfinance,"Advice for game plan of 401(k), IRA and debt","So I'm just finding r/personalfinance recently and have read the flowchart for the following:
 
* Build emergency fund - done
* Max employer match for 401(k) - done (was actually contributing more but recently decreased it to just the match)
* Pay down high interest debts
* Contribute to IRA
 
So I've recently started a side business and have some extra cash monthly and my plan was to reduce my 401k through work and start a nice Roth IRA with those extra funds from reducing the 401k deferral and side biz cash flow.  However, it looks like I should pay off some high interest debt.  This is where I get confused, what counts as high interest?
 
Debts w/ int rates and balances are as follows:
 
* Mortgage - 4% - $198k
* Auto - 2.34% - $6k
* Fed Student Loan - 4.5% - $3k
* Fed Student Loan - 6.8% - $3k
* Fed Student Loan - 3.4% - $2k
* Fed Student Loan - 6.8% - $1.5k
* Fed Student Loan - 6% - $2k
* Fed Student Loan - 6.8% - $2k
* Fed Student Loan - 6.8% - $1.7k
* Fed Student Loan - 5.6% - $2k
* Private Student Loan - 7.75% - $16k
 
I'm pretty sure the mortgage and auto loan are low enough interest rates to just continue along with the payment plan.  So should I attacked those student loans that are 6% or higher first before contributing to a Roth IRA or should I go Roth IRA first and just continue with the payment plans for those student loans?",finance

personalfinance,FIrst Time Home Buyer Mortgage Confusion,"Hi guys, first time posting here and I have started the process of buying my first home. Also posting from my phone so no idea if formatting is going to be off.

I live in the Central Valley of California. Make 80k a year and am looking to buy a house for about 320k. I have no debts and currently rent a house for 1800.

So a little back history and where I am in the process.
I started by going to my bank and getting pre-qualified, wanted to get pre approved because I had read that, that was what you actually needed before you could move forward with putting in offer so I Brought all my documents that it said to online. Found out that the pre approval is only for after you have found a house. So I got pre-qualified and found out what interest rate and cost would be associated with my banks loan. So I started shopping around for homes and loans.

The loan I am trying to get would be 30 year fixed conventional. Planning on staying in it an starting a family so 5+ years.

At this point I had seen some  online estimates for my credit score and current going rates and was pretty shocked at how much higher it was. I decided to shop around at this point, by going to a broker as well as applying online. 

So the thing is these interest rates I am getting are all estimates and subject to change, but I have found a house and want to put an offer in but from what I understand I would need to decide on which mortgage lender  I want to go with before proceeding. How do I ensure I am getting the best rate here?

 I have read about rate locks but that’s generally done after you have made an offer and by that point I would have had to select my mortgage lender to proceed with the process. Am I understanding the process right?

My other / main question is about online lenders. So I got quoted 4.375% interest from both the broker and bank, however the bank has a few additional cost and broker has opted to waive points. I also just got a rate quote from BNC National Bank for 3.875% with no costs or so they said. How likely is the BNC quote to be legit? Will I get screwed if I go with them? I looked them up online and they seem very reputable. I am just skeptical on how the rate can be that much different. Should I go with BNC or broker or bank?

I am aware that the BNC will maybe be more leg work on my end as everything for them will be remote but the cost different of .5% seems worth it from that end.",finance

personalfinance,Jumping Ship - Looking for new bank with high interest and checking options,"First of all, I've read most articles on [DoctorOfCredit.com](https://DoctorOfCredit.com) fairly well.  What I'm looking for here is a mixture of personal experience and data.

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation: My wife and I bank exclusively with Wells Fargo.  We have about $40k saved up.  We're looking to buy a house in the next 1-3 years.  Due to this, I'd rather not use a CD as we may need to take it out before the maturity date.  We currently make like 0.001% interest on our savings.

&amp;#x200B;

Needs: We're looking to move to a bank with a highly competitive interest rate.  We want a bank that has a good reputation and isn't just fighting for the highest spot on the interest rate chart (see most of the top 20 banks [here](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/)).  One that will maintain a competitive interest rate and not just unbeknownstly drop it down to nothing (I understand it will fluctuate down slightly).  The bank needs a **checking** account option with the ability to transfer betweens savings/checking seamlessly.  The checking account should have the ability to do **Bill Pay** (sends out paper checks), which we use to pay our rent and some other expenses automatically.  Must have a decent mobile banking option.  Physical bank is not required, or even desired.  Decent phone support when needed is nice.  Only interested in accounts (both savings and checking) with no monthly fees with minimum balance preferably below $1,000).  No accounts with transfer fees when pulling out.

&amp;#x200B;

Banks I'm considering (from [this](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get/) list) Please suggest others from the list if you've used them:

* Ally (2.20%)
* BMO Harris (2.45%) - Not super interested as it [appears](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/banks-credit-unions-that-dont-raise-savings-interest-rates-for-existing-customers/#BMO_Harris) they don't increase their rate when it goes up
* Citibank (2.36%)
* Discover (2.10%)

tl;dr Looking for a well known high-yield savings account to use for the long term.  Must have checking account with Bill Pay.

personalfinance,Full ride to medical school--Should I accept forgiveable loans??,"I was graciously awarded a scholarship for 70k/year to a school that costs 60k/year. With this + what I have in savings/invested (≈13K) + the income of my significant other, I'm thinking that I can get through  4 years of medical school with borrowing little to no money (cost of living isn't terribly high). I was recently selected to receive forgivable loans through my state. I can borrow up to 14K/year at an 8% interest rate (56k total if a renew every year). These loans will be forgiven on a year for year basis as long as I practice medicine in my state.

Stocks are currently valued at about $60k, which will cover my high interest loans (private, 7.1%) and most of my federal subsidized loans (5.1%).

My income for 2019 is essentially $0 since I've been a student full time. My plan right now is to liquidate what equities I need to in order to pay off the higher interest loans, and possibly the lower interest loans as well. 

I spoke to a financial adviser (concierge service at Schwab) and he made it seem like the income from the trades would be taxed at my current income bracket, rather than at the long-term investment rate of 15%, which had me a bit confused... 

I understand that since I have no income to speak of for 2019 it could make sense to apply (probably not the right word here) the first ~$12k as standard income and then the rest at the long-term investment rate. I also hope to start working in my field in/around November, so I'll have additional income in 2019 yet to be earned. 

Am I misunderstanding how long-term investment taxation works and my adviser has a point, or maybe he knows something I don't know? It should also be noted that I'm in a state with a rather high income tax (Oregon), if that helps.

personalfinance,Roth IRA Distribution vs. PMI,"I'm currently looking to buy my first home, priced around $160k. I was initially planning to put ~$20k down and pay PMI, probably around $1k/year.

However, I have $45k in a Roth IRA (and 10k in a 401k) and am strongly tempted by the option of taking $12k of my Roth contributions to boost me to a 20% down payment and avoid PMI, possibly with a slightly better interest rate as well. 

I have not yet contributed to the Roth for tax year 2019, so I could put $6k back in by the end of the year, to limit the damage to my account. In that case, the missing $6k would only have earned ~$410 over the course of a year (based on average return), while PMI would cost ~$1,000. I am also not maxing my 401k yet, so I could increase those payments thanks to a lower housing bill.

The question is, why shouldn't I use my 401k money. On a cost basis, it has done really well (only open for 3 years, 14% annual rate of return).

investing,White House Explored Legality of Demoting Fed Chairman Powell,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House explored the legality of demoting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in February, soon after President Donald Trump talked about firing him, according to people familiar with the matter.

The White House general counsel’s office weighed the legal implications of stripping Powell of his chairmanship and leaving him as a Fed governor, the people said, in what would be an unprecedented move. A replacement would have to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.

Trump’s team conducted the legal analysis and came to a conclusion that has remained closely held within the White House, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It isn’t clear whether Trump directed the legal review, and the people didn’t describe the outcome.

A White House official who declined to be identified said he wouldn’t comment on what he called alleged discussions from months ago. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said demoting Powell isn't currently under consideration.

Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in an email: “Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause.”

‘Stuck With You’

Bloomberg News reported in December that Trump discussed firing Powell out of frustration over the central bank’s interest rate increases.

While Trump still regularly expresses his displeasure with the Fed in tweets, talk of removing Powell has subsided. Trump told Powell in a March phone call, “I guess I’m stuck with you,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Federal Reserve Act provides explicit protection for all Fed governors against removal by the president except “for cause.’’ Courts have interpreted the phrase to require proof of some form of legal misconduct or neglect of basic duties. A disagreement over monetary policy wouldn’t meet that bar.

However, it’s less clear whether the president can demote a chair, removing him or her from that position while leaving the person as a Fed governor.

Scott Alvarez, who served as the Fed’s general counsel for more than a decade until 2017, said Powell could still be protected because of changes Congress made to the law four decades ago.

Up to that point, the president simply named the Fed chairman from among governors already confirmed by the Senate. But in 1977, lawmakers amended the act, requiring the Senate to confirm chair and vice chair nominees for four-year terms separately from the confirmation of their governorships, which run as long as 14 years.

Alvarez said the courts would likely interpret the 1977 change as removing not only the president’s unilateral authority to name the chair, but also the ability to dismiss him or her without cause. There is, however, no precedent for such a move and no way to know how the courts would rule if the Fed, or Powell himself, challenged the demotion.

Frustrated President

The White House legal team developed its analysis after Trump in December privately discussed firing Powell following an interest rate increase that roiled global financial markets. The Fed has raised rates seven times since Trump took office.

Fed policy makers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. No rate move is expected immediately, though economists and investors generally agree the central bank will cut borrowing costs this year.

Powell, who became chairman in February 2018, has drawn Trump’s ire for not being more accommodating of his trade war with China. The president has repeatedly complained that the Fed, under Powell, has stymied growth and financial markets by raising rates.

“He’s my pick -- and I disagree with him entirely,” Trump said last week in an interview with ABC News. “Frankly, if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn’t have raised interest rates so much we would have been at least a point and a half higher.”

Trump had a casual dinner with Powell and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida in February, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time. The Fed released a statement shortly after the meeting saying that the group discussed the U.S. economy’s performance and outlook, but that Powell didn’t share his expectations for monetary policy.

‘Law Is Clear’

Powell told the CBS News program “60 Minutes” in March that he didn’t think it was appropriate to comment on Trump. But Powell also said he doesn’t think the president has the authority to fire him. “The law is clear that I have a four-year term. And I fully intend to serve it,” he said.

Currently, five of the Fed’s seven seats are filled, and Trump is weighing candidates for the other two seats. Trump has named four people for two seats on the Fed’s board of governors. None of them made it through the Senate.

By voicing his frustrations with the Fed, Trump breaks with at least two decades of tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on monetary policy. Presidents, however, have reportedly applied pressure on rates.

Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker recounted in a recent memoir that in 1984, President Ronald Reagan ordered him not to raise rates before elections. Former President George H.W. Bush urged Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates in a June 1992 interview with the New York Times.

Trump on Tuesday took his pressure campaign against central bankers to the European Central Bank. The president accused the euro area and China of weakening their currencies to gain an economic advantage, calling out ECB President Mario Draghi for pledging monetary stimulus just before the Fed meeting this week.

Draghi said at the institution’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, that “additional stimulus will be required” if the economic outlook for the 19-nation euro area doesn’t improve.

My question is,  when do I get out? Should I get out this afternoon because tomorrow one of the 3 priced in rate decreases could be for-shadowed or even announced?  Do I wait until I figure the Fed will be finished cutting?  If the whole world knows that the Fed is going to cut rates a certain amount over the coming short term future, could intermediate and long terms bonds be at their low today?

I have a decent idea of how a few ways this could go, but I’d love to hear people’s opinion on it, because talking about current and future interest rates is fucking great and I wish people would do it here more often.",finance

personalfinance,Potential discrepancy between credit report and navient student loan report?,"Hi all,
I've decided that I want to refinance my higher interest student loans. I've got a handful that are in the 6.5% range and I figured if I can get that down to 5 or so, that's saving a little money over time. 

So I started the application process and I noticed that my credit report is showing 8 loans while my navient report is showing 10. Some of them are subsidized very low interest rate loans so maybe there's a reason they aren't showing up? 

I emailed Navient and got an automated response that basically said ""write us snail mail"". I'm not disputing anything, just looking to clear some stuff up. I hope I'll get a response from a real person but in the meantime I wanted to post here and see if anyone knew anything. Additionally, the account numbers my bank report displayed I couldn't find anywhere on my credit report or navient loan page. The amounts were similar (ie, 750 vs 749) so I think they're the right loans, but I don't have a way to verify. Wtf?

I keep on top of my loans and credit score. I'm aware of stuff that happens and my score is really good (770s) so I'm not worried about bad rates. I just don't understand the discrepancy.

personalfinance,"Post-grad school Debt/Budgeting Help (43k student loans, mortgage)","I have been out of grad school for 1 year; I took out student loans to return to school for 3 years (I have a master's in a discipline completed different from my bachelor's.) I have been reading PF very frequently and I am making a lot of adjustments to my budget and my plan to tackle my debt/increase my retirement savings. I was hoping I could just post some of my particulars and explain my plan and see if I'm headed in the right direction (this is all very stressful and I'm really trying to make sure I do my homework here.) I use Mint for budgeting.

I net about $3000 a month from two different part-time jobs and a small amount of rent money my 3 roommates (brother, SIL, and g/f; we have no children between us all) pay me for splitting bills. My pay varies due to teaching workload, I aggressively request more classes and am considering another job if time permits. 

Expenses: 

*  Utilities/alarm/cable sum to around $300/month (would like to downsize cable bill from 100)

*   Mortgage: 1050 (includes taxes/hazard insurance)

* Groceries/Food: 300 / month (This is an overestimate because we all eat together and take turns purchasing.)

* Auto insurance: 130 / month (coupled with my hazard insurance, would like to downsize this as well.)

* Gas: 150 / month (two commutes, 1 is 15 minutes city, 1 is 40 minutes highway, car is a 1996 camry)

* Student Loans: 500 / month 

* Cell Phone: 90 / month (includes my dad, I never use data, would like to downsize, dad pays me for his half annually.)

* Roth IRA: 100 / month (I put in 100 a month at this point to make me feel good that I'm at least putting something away, I would like to increase this.)

Debt:

* Mortgage: 140,000 left on principal, originated in 2014 at fixed 4.5%, house has appreciated 60,000 in value (Zestimate)

* Student Loans: Refinanced to 5.2% last year down from high 6s. On a 10-year payment plan, have made 9 payments so far.

* I have an AMEX Blue Preferred Card that I took out to build credit (current score around 730) and a Visa card from my credit union. I have never missed a payment on a credit card and have never run a monthly balance; I have no intention of changing this behavior.

Other:

* I have an emergency fund of $10,000 in a credit union, I would like to move this to a HYSA.

* I have a Roth IRA through Vanguard, around $11k in here (I contribute $100 monthly) and the fund is VEXAX.

* I have my monthly pay through the summer but I will have a windfall from summer work for around $11,000 (gross) coming up in August.

* Employer has optional 403(b) plans and such with no contribution; I have automatic withholding to two state retirement funds (STRS is one of them) but I don't utilize their other plans. I have health insurance through them as well. 

My Ideas (Please help me here)

* New Car: My car has 240,000 miles on it and I have spent around $3k on it over the last 3 years, barely passes smog, terrible mileage (less than 20 / gal highway.) A new (used) car would be ideal but I cannot stomach buying another expensive item if I can get by with the camry. My opinion is that I should stick it out.

* Leftover money: I have some spare cash each month; should I use some of that (or from the windfall) to pay down my 5.2% debt or put more into my Roth IRA? If I doubled my student loan payments I could significantly shorten the payback time and lower the total interest.

* Refinance or HELOC: I found some local credit unions that offer Refi rates at 3.75% or 3.5% for a new 30 year term; this would lower my payment and actually decrease my overall interest paid. Rate could possibly be lower if I did a shorter term (payment would increase, of course.) Worth the closing costs? Some HELOCs I found could also be used to pay off my student loans with no closing costs from another CU, but the variable interest rates and making the debt secured instead of unsecured is a risk in my eyes.



Thanks for reading and helping me out, this subreddit is really helping me put my head on straight for getting out of debt. If I had to choose RIGHT now, I would refinance the mortgage if the closing costs/rate were decent and then fire my extra money into my student loans. 

Please let me know what you think and I apologize if this post is poorly formatted/against the rules. If there's other info I can provide I would be happy to, thanks a lot.",finance

My reasoning is that I could pay it off faster and have one less loan to pay interest on.

* Turning 30 next month, graduated university in 2014. 

* Currently employed in the field I went to school for, earning roughly ~$70k per year. 

* Repaying my student loan balance now, balance is currently approximately ~$58k. 

* My monthly student loan expenditure is now $875 at minimum, more if I have extra cash at the end of the month. 

* My credit is decent enough, scores in the low-to-mid 700s. 

* I don’t really have any significant savings. I’m contributing to a 401k through work, but that balance is still only in 4 figures. I’ve got a couple grand in regular savings, and I just last month moved $1,000 to an Ally savings account for the interest rate.

Fairly common situation overall, I’m sure you’ll agree. 

I’m also dating a wonderful lady that I want to start a life with. I’m looking to the future, but really can’t figure out how I’m supposed to grow my relationship and also handle my student debt. These are my concerns:

* There isn’t really any situation where I can simultaneously start saving for a down payment for a house and an engagement ring, while also aggressively paying down my student loans. It can’t be both. 

* She has no student debt, and exceptional credit. She has substantial savings that shes been contributing to, and she understands and respects that we just have different situations. 

We want to buy a house, like any couple would. But it’s so frustrating to be in the situation of being unable to even *start!* saving for a down payment for another 10 years (roughly). I want our contributions to our shared life to be equal. But we are in such different situations. 

She’s offered to start making some student loan payments for me. Nothing crazy, but she’s willing to throw $200 a month to my highest-interest loan.

The working name for the project is Leverest and it is a trustless margin trading platform. Leverest provides non-custodial leverage by matching borrowers and lenders with different risk profiles. What makes Leverest different than other derivatives platforms like dydx or nuo is that all trading is denominated in ETH (lower gas costs and interest rates).

&amp;#x200B;

* Traders take a leveraged long position by borrowing ETH. They pay interest based on the price of ETH in USD when the contract opens. If ETH rises, traders get a multiple on the returns.
* Lenders have a different experience on Leverest than other platforms. Lenders offer ETH for leverage but earn interest based on the price of ETH and network utilization. If 50% of the ETH offered in Leverest is borrowed, lenders are 50% exposed to ETH price fluctuations. The other 50% acts as a stable coin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why should I lend?**

Through Leverest, lenders hedge against a fall in ETH prices by earning interest in USD terms on part of your position. You trade part of the upside of ETH gains for interest and downside protection.

personalfinance,"(US) I hate the concept of a 401k, what should I do with my money?","Why would I want my life savings in an account I can't access until I'm too old to enjoy it..

Some info on me:
- Single 25 year old with Bachelor's degree in Computer Science working in Harrisburg PA area
- 75K Salary
- 45K remaining student debt (Minimum payment 850/mo)
- Roughly 4K in 401K (I just contribute the minimum so I get the company match)
- 3K in cash to my name
- No car payment and currently renting an apartment
- 790 credit score

I graduated in 2016 with 80K in student debt at a horribly high interest rate, refinanced down to 4.365 in August 2017. I have aggressively paid this down over the last couple years and am now down to 45K. I have no other debt.

Current financial situation / budget
- 4K monthly income after taxes
- Rent costs me 525 a month, I split an apartment with a friend and anticipate 2 years remaining renting with him (he is in school).
- Minimum student loan payment is 850/mo
- Utilities come out to 100/mo
- Auto insurance is 78/mo
- Food / gas / gym / eating out and everything else 750/mo

This leaves me with 1700 a month. With this I have been putting 1700 into my student loan as an extra payment each month. I can probably be tighter with my catch all area (food / gas / gym / random expenses) of 750 a month but I feel like being any tighter just leads to stress. 

So that's where I'm at. At this rate I'll have my student debt paid off in around 1.7 years if my calculations are correct. We can round up and say 2. 

I'm not sure what to do then. I'll be 27 years old when they're paid off. I bet I can probably swing a good raise by that time as I'm in a niche industry .. I'm thinking 100K is easily obtainable. 

So back to the title. I don't want all my money when I'm 68 years old. I have a lot of hobbies and they are pretty cheap to maintain. So no doubt I can keep myself busy for cheap when retired.

My strategy going forward is to buy a house when I have my student debt paid off. I can most likely find a house anywhere from 150K - 230K. Probably a townhome and something I will stay at 5-10 years. I value a more comfortable place with a garage and nice kitchen / floorpan so I have space for hobbies .. So I don't think I mind spending a bit more money to get the extra space. 230K homes around here are alright but the townhomes seem to be built nicer and minus the hassle of maintaining a yard when I'm this young.

So then if I buy this home I figure I should pay the home down agreesivly as I did the loan. I could most likely have the majority of a 150K loan paid off in 5~ish years. If not pretty damn close. Right now I live comfortably putting 2.5K/mo into my loan ... I figure with a 1K monthly mortgage I can afford any 'oh shit' moments where I need cash if my car breaks down by just not paying the extra payment to the mortgage .. 

That puts me at 32~ish years old with a paid off home and no mortgage. I figure at this point I dump everything into some kind of investment account that is not a 401K .. that way I can use the money for myself. 

Is this stupid? Is there a better approach for when I have no more student debt? Such as paying minimum on mortgage, maxing a Roth IRA and investing the rest in stocks or index funds? I like the concept of a Roth IRA because if I need the cash in an emergency I can just skip the months contribution.

personalfinance,How to minimize a big incoming debt,"I'm a defendant in a civil lawsuit and the litigation is heating up. I have been able to pay as the case has gone but there's a hearing on a dismissal in July and so there's a lot of prep for May/June/July. I am wondering if there's a way I can get through this without either going into my savings or paying an unreasonable amount in loans. The May bill is $9,000; I expect June and July will top $25,000 as it includes two days in court, filings, and depositions of various parties. My lawyer agreed to bill June and July together at the end of July so I can get it done at once.

My plan to pay:
Right now I have Chase Sapphire Preferred that I will charge the legal fees (to get the travel points at least). I plan to look for a 0% APR balance transfer credit card and transfer the charges. I am confident I'll be able to qualify for the card, and pay it all off before the time period expires (or, worst case, dip into savings at the very end). 

I've never used one of these balance transfer cards before and I want to be sure I'm not overlooking something. I'm seeing balance transfer fees of 3% which I assume is on the total transferred. Questions I'll look for when I compare the offers: Will the 3% fee come just once for each transfer? Is there a transfer limit? Is there some sort of catch to it? Will I still be able to earn points on my Chase card if I do a balance transfer to another card? There's no upper limit cap on the credit, other than what the lender is willing to offer a person with my credit history, right?

Another option is personal loans, but these probably won't cover the full amount and the interest rates offered are pretty high.

Is there another option to minimize or reduce fees/interest paid?

Financial background:
Monthly income with my SO is $7,000 to our shared accounts (gross pay $175,000 but after taxes/retirement savings/etc we keep 30% of our take home pay in individual accounts). Emergency fund of $30,000. No other debts except $3,000 in student loans. Four credit cards, two shared and two individual, always paid off. No car. Rent has been higher (about $2,500) since SO and I live in different cities (a recent move for a new job) both of which are expensive. My lease is up at the end of August and I'll hopefully get an internal company transfer (plan to dip into savings for the move). Our travel expenses have been very high as we've been going to see each other on weekends. We'll have to quit that for a bit which sucks. Phone is $111/mo but 100% worth it as it has a great international plan we need and limitless data (and Hulu).",finance

Bitcoin,Argentina story,"December 2004 post – situation report on the fall of Argentina

OK, here it goes, hope it helps. We often call unprepared people, the mass, sheep. Sheep describes them pretty well. They do as the rest of them do, don’t fight for their rights, accept almost everything and so on. But what happens when “sheep” get desperate? Well, that ´s what happened here.

After years of closing factories and the destruction of the national industry, extremely low wages, people got fed up. This destructive economy by Menem, our previous president, one of the most corrupt presidents in the history, (he was into the bombing of the Jewish Embassy, managed the drug market in the country, just to mention some) plus the stupidity of the following president, De la Rúa, was a formula for disaster.

One day the Minister of Economy declared that no one would be able to get more than 100 bucks a day from the ATM (correct?) nor close accounts. You could just get 100 bucks out of the bank a day. That was it. Then came the devaluation. Before this happened 1 U$S= 1 $ Argentine peso. Suddenly this changed into 1 U$S dollar= 2 peso then 2.5 even 4 pesos. Today 1U$S= 3 Pesos. The banks kept the people’s money, including their deposits in US dollars. If you had 1000 U$S dollars in Bank Boston for example, they turned it into 1000 pesos, that equaled 333 U$S dollars. They stole 666 dollars from you! Prices went up 200%, 300% and sometimes more. Imagine for one moment what your life would be like if today you go to your local 7-11 and everything has gone up 200%. How would you survive with your pay check?

The sheep got desperate. First, because they had been stolen by banks and wouldn’t return the money to the people. (The so called “corralito”) then because the classes with the lowest income found out that their salaries weren’t high enough to buy the minimum food stuff to survive. The country marched asking for the president’s resignation. He had to leave the presidential palace in a chopper… Banks were destroyed by people that wanted their hard earned money back. Supermarkets and other shops were looted, as well as regular houses. This lasted for about a month, the chaos spread all over the country, concentrated in the largest cities.

I remember being at a supermarket and the mob outside, negotiating with the manager. Sometimes, they would not destroy the place if the supermarket surrendered them the goods peacefully. Food got scarce. I mean, you could buy just a certain amount of milk or water, 4 bottles for example. And most imported goods disappeared. Electro domestics such as TV, videos, and refrigerators kept their prices in dollars, inaccessible for most people. The same happened with real estates, cars and luxury goods. Today this all seems far away. Not because it got better, but because us humans have this damn capacity to “get used to”. How did our lives change? I cant even being to explain… everything changed! The streets are more dangerous than ever, thanks to the general poverty.

Education suffered thanks to this as well, kids working or stealing to survive instead of going to school. How could I explain this to you? For example, tools are really expensive, since most come from abroad. Remember, our national industry was sold out or destroyed.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans or buy a house?,"Really putting this all out there, but I've been debating for weeks what the best financial move is for me, and I have no idea what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering buying a house, but now realized I have the exact amount of money I need to pay off my student loans. 

* I currently have $36k in Savings (not including retirement) and 
* $36k in student loans at a 6.7% interest rate. My loan payments are $350/month.
* I currently pay $800 rent. House payments would be about $1300 (mortgage + PMI +insurance/taxes) 

&amp;#x200B;

I had originally planned to use half my savings for a down payment/closing costs, and keep the other half in savings. This would give me a comfortable mortgage with minimal PMI and leave 6 months of bills in savings and some cushion. I was feeling pretty good about it, and felt like I could handle it. I live in a hot housing market, and feel like this might be the last opportunity to get into the neighborhood I want before prices go up more. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm wondering if I should spend the next 6 months building up new emergency savings, and then using all of my current savings to pay off my loan (I want to wait so I'm not left with zero cash)? In my mind, this would free up $350/month to save towards a house and free up more income later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is paying off the loans a mistake? So many people I've talked to have said not to worry about paying off the student loans because they aren't really hurting me. If I don't buy a house soon, I worry I'll get priced out.

personalfinance,Should I use my $43k in savings on student loans?,"Apologies if this has been asked a million times.

I have about $31k in student loans. I make $73k/year and built $43k in my savings over &lt;3 years.  Currently, I pay $422/month towards these loans.

Among the 10 individual loans, I owe a $2,029 and $4,057 loan, both with 6.55% interest rates. The remaining 8 loans vary from $4k at the most, to $1k at the least with ~3.5% to ~4.4% interest rates.

I'm hesitant to spend almost my entire savings on it, as I can afford the $422/month and still live comfortably. But I'd appreciate any advice towards strategically paying off the loans. For example, it seems the general consensus is to pay off loans with interest rates above 5%? Should I do that?

personalfinance,Looking for best way to pay off debt with large lump sum and build credit,"So, I have a couple options ahead of me and thought that I might be able to get some good advice on here on how to approach it. Long story short, I started a company about two years ago and knew that in order to get going I was going to have to take on a lot of personal debt. It's finally starting to pay off and I have a contract in place that will allow me to wipe out the $50k or so in debt I've accumulated the past two years and a lot more. I want to be in a position to buy a house in the next year but right now I'm sitting at a 595 Credit Score so I'm wondering how fast I can get that in the 720+. Besides my high credit utilzation (95%ish) and about 15 different credit accounts, I should be in good standing, on time payments, no derogatory, or even a lot of hard inquires, most of the credit was approved more than 2 years ago when I had about a 680 or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I have various bad debt with insane interest rates from 27% to around 24% (maybe 6 cards, $15k total) and then some personal loans around 15% ($20k or so), Student loans and 2 car loans at much lower rates, 5% or below, for the rest of the debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $10k to start paying this down and will get another $10k every 2 to 3 weeks for next couple months on top of my normal bills, rent, utilities, etc. Within a year I should be debt free with about $50k in savings for a down payment on a home (which is the plan). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it best to spread my first pay down amounts to all cards ranging between 24% to 27% to get each of them under 30% utilization so they will have more time on my credit report to up my score, or should I just put all of my funds towards the highest interest, bring it down to zero then go to the next. This means I'll have a few cards above 90% utilization for the a few more months then bringing all below 30% sooner.

personalfinance,How does Roth IRA Early-withdrawal penalties exactly work?,"Hi Guys. I am considering to open a Fidelity Roth IRA account. I went to their webpage ([https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/ira-comparison](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/ira-comparison)). It states about **Withdrawal taxes:** You won't pay taxes when you withdraw your contributions, and you won't pay federal taxes on your earnings, as long as the five-year aging requirement has been met.

It also states about **Early-withdrawal penalties**: If you make withdrawals before you're 59½, you might have to pay taxes on your earnings plus a 10% additional tax.

There is a note 2 on the bottom of the page: A distribution from a Roth IRA is federally tax-free and penalty-free provided that the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, qualified first time home purchase, or death. 

I want to get a clarification: I am now in mid 30. If I put $6k into a Roth IRA to purchase some mutual funds, the account balance becomes $8,800 after 5 years (assume 8% return). If I want to take all $8,800 out of this IRA account at that time, **do I need to pay the Withdrawal taxes** given that the account has been 5 years? How much are the Withdrawal taxes? I need to pay 10% additional tax (which is the early withdraw penalties), correct? Should I pay 10% of the $8,800 ($880) or 10% of the earnings ($280) for the penalties?

What if this $6k was put into a brokerage account to purchase the same mutual funds? How much taxes should I pay over 5 years? I am trying to figure out, if the goal is to take the money out to buy a second home after 5 years, should this $6k go to a Roth IRA or an individual brokerage to get the maximum return? Very new to investment and hope to hear some helpful advice. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Chase Card Benefits Services (Eclaimsline) won't pay for car rental damages,"Couldn't decide if this belongs here or in /r/legaladvice so I'm sorry. This was my first accident. 

edit: if there are areas where are things I should've done/fucked up, feel free to let me know so I know how to better deal with this in the future.

Long story short, on Jan 25th, I (23m) was in a parked rental car when someone backed into the front left area of my bumper. Dude came out and apologized, I took pictures, exchanged info, etc. and we were on our way. This was in LA, CA.

When I dropped the car off at SilverCar, I told the attendants that someone hit my car and asked what are the steps in taking care of that since I was using my credit card company's insurance. The attendants checked the damage and said it was barely noticeable but if there is a charge or claim, I will receive a call, text, or email. They didn't suggest me to contact Chase Benefits Services about my damaged rental car (which I should've done in the first place).

So weeks and months pass and I didn't receive any notice whatsoever. At some point, I mentally concluded that perhaps they buffed out the small scuff and wrote it off. Until on April 4th, when I received a claim letter sent to my house asking me to pay $1400 in damages for the car. I was trying to find out why this letter got sent so late? I checked my personal email and could find nothing. Until I double checked the email address used for my SilverCar account and it was actually my dead old Facebook email address that I never touched in years.

So I logged onto it and saw all the emails the claims company sent me that I never noticed. The first one was sent on Feb 13th, and it was the same exact form that got sent to my house on April 4th.

According to the [Chase Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver page](https://www.chase.com/content/chasecom/en/card-benefits/benefit-details/freedom_vp/arcdw_secondary_v1.html), I have to report the accident to them no later than 60 days after the incident. April 4th marks 68 days since the incident, so I'm 8 days past the window. I call up Chase Card Benefits Services asking if they could waive it, even though I'm 8 days late. They told me to submit all the necessary paperwork and it would be up to the agents to decide. 

Several weeks of calls and emails pass (Eclaimsline is very anal on the type of documents you send them) and I finally submitted all the necessary paperwork for them to review. They NEVER mentioned they will deny my claim, they just kept on asking for the correct paperwork they were looking for. 

Weeks pass and they call me asking why I didn't report to them within the 60 day window. I described my whole email situation and how I wasn't aware of a 60 day window. They noted that down and we hung up. Weeks pass and finally today, I received an email saying they are NOT going to pay for the damages since I was 8 days past due in reporting the accident.

I understand it's my fault for letting time pass and assuming the damage might've gotten written off. And for stupidly not double checking my SilverCar email address after the incident. But I'm pissed off on the fact that some guy didn't check his mirrors and backed into my PARKED car and I have to pay damages for it. The guy who hit me was from Canada if that matters. I've fought this for months and REALLY want this to stop haunting my sleep. 

I want to ask if anyone has experience something similar to what I've gone through and want to know if you've won? Any advice/tips on the first steps in tackling this is much appreciated...

Thanks for the help everybody.",finance

**Zuckerberg: The man who would be monetary king**

**Facebook takes a page out of JPMorgan and the Fed’s playbook; attempts to create a global digital reserve.**

June 18, 2019 9:00 am by Izabella Kaminska

Article link (paywall): [https://www.ft.com/content/2730678a-6cfc-3a98-9ef0-8851ccb0abd7](https://www.ft.com/content/2730678a-6cfc-3a98-9ef0-8851ccb0abd7) 

This  is just one of a series of Alphaville posts on Libra coin, which we are  calling Breaking the Zuck Buck, in which we will seek to show how  nonsensical, pointless, stupid, risky, badly thought-out and  blockchainless the whole thing is.

Facebook  has just announced the full details of its Libra cryptocurrency  venture, including details of the founder members of the Libra  Association, among them Visa, Mastercard, Uber and Spotify. Its mission,  it says, is to make payments cheaper and more accessible.

Whether we can trust them about that is another matter.

Libra  could be a social-good venture aimed at “empowering billions of people  through the creation of a simple global currency and financial  infrastructure” but then again — from the details revealed — it could  also be an attempt to gain control of the money supply by a corporation  most people think already has more power than it should.

As usual, the truth depends on how things are framed.

But  in this post, we're going to argue Libra is nothing more than a brazen  attempt to override national monetary sovereignty by creating a  global-scale Federal Reserve equivalent — within which Facebook's  dominance is veiled by the cunning use of buzzwords like blockchain,  DLT, decentralisation and cryptocurrency.

But the Fed is a private organisation too!

A  conspiracy theory often circulated by advocates of a return to a gold  standard is that you can’t trust the Federal Reserve because it’s  actually a private organisation. Or to be more precise, a private  organisation structurally dominated by one particular founder bank  (JPMorgan). But central banking advocates would argue that’s no  conspiracy: the private nature of the Fed was baked into the system by  design. The intent was always to create an independent central banking  system that ran separate to the state on the basis that  government-issued bond systems had failed to achieve monetary stability.

In  the years leading up to the Fed’s creation in 1913, the financial  thought-leaders pushing the plan were more than aware of the  monopolistic implications of such ideas. Unsurprisingly, they were  primed for public opposition as a result.

This  is why, just like Facebook, they worked in secret (on Jeckyll Island,  no less) when trying to establish the key principles of the  organisation.

The core  components of the plan were hatched by Nelson Aldrich, a Republican, who  had been responsible for the creation of the National Monetary  Commission in the wake of the panic of 1907.

After  reviewing the system, Aldrich became convinced monetary instability  related to the system's inelasticity, something which could only be  solved by the creation of a private central banking institution.  Together with the key bankers of the day, notably JPMorgan, Rockefeller  and Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co, the group proposed the creation of the National  Reserve Association, to be capitalised to the tune of $100m by the  respective bank members and controlled by the member banks on the basis  of their respective capitalisation shares.

Critically,  as the Wikipedia page about the history of the Fed notes, the  Association would issue currency backed by gold and commercial paper  that would be the liability of the bank and not of the government. The  government’s only role would be via representation on the board of  directors. This proposal became known as the “Aldrich Plan” but was soon  also dubbed “The Wall Street Plan”.

As  anticipated, when finally revealed, presidential candidate Woodrow  Wilson — and the Democrats in general, including Roosevelt — denounced  the plan as a scheme “to place the currency and credit system of the  United States in private hands not subject to effective public control”.

The  cynical view that the association would be run by the incumbent elites  and business tycoons of the era — who already posed antitrust concerns  in the market — became widespread. In some quarters the plan was even  seen as symptomatic of just how much power the Trusts had accumulated  over the government. (An echo of the antitrust criticism facing Facebook  today.)

In 1984 a San Francisco Fed research paper observed the following about the beginnings:

Criticisms  of the Aldrich Plan centred on the highly centralised and privately  controlled structure of the National Reserve Association, including the  procedures by which its directors (and those of its proposed 15 branches  and local associations) would be elected. Those procedures tended to  place voting control in the hands of the larger banks because votes were  based, in part, on the number of shares of stocks that banks held in  the Association.

To get the bill through Congress,  the architects knew they would have to convert more democrats to their  way of thinking. They began a PR offensive and started to offer some  concessions.

Eventually  the bill passed, but only after both sides agreed to greater  decentralisation within the voting committee, including better oversight  of the private entities via an executive arm comprising a government  representative. It was the promise of more decentralisation, in other  words, that eventually did the trick. Something the architects of Libra  seem to have paid close attention to.

Fast  forward to 2019 and there are eerily similarities with the global  digital reserve system that Facebook’s Libra is attempting to engineer.

There  are only two major differences. This time round, no governing body is  being asked to approve the scheme via a democratic process — even though  the scheme undermines state seigniorage power to the same, if not a  greater, degree. Second, blockchain magic is replacing decentralised  organisation as the check on private power — even if in all  distributional respects it effectively amounts to the same thing.

As Libra’s white paper notes (our emphasis):

The  association is designed to facilitate the operation of the Libra  Blockchain; to co-ordinate the agreement among its stakeholders — the  network’s validator nodes — in their pursuit to promote, develop, and  expand the network, and to manage the reserve. The association is  governed by the Libra Association Council, which is comprised of one  representative per validator node. Together, they make decisions on the  governance of the network and reserve. Initially, this group consists of  the Founding Members businesses, non-profit and multilateral  organizations, and academic institutions from around the world. All  decisions are brought to the council, and major policy or technical  decisions require the consent of two-thirds of the votes, the same  supermajority of the network required in the BFT consensus protocol.

But the analogies with the Fed don’t stop there.

Like  the Fed, the Libra system has been created in the name of lowering the  costs and frictions of cross jurisdiction payments (in the Fed's case,  the system was brought about to streamline check clearance across the  nation's varying states and lower costs in the process).

Like the Fed, the Libra Association will be the only entity capable of creating or destroying its own currency.

Like  the Fed, the Libra Association will only deal with its own network of  authorised resellers (its equivalent of the Primary Dealer network).

Like  the Fed, the Libra Association will have a minimum requirement for the  type of assets it accepts from dealers in exchange for “cash reserve”  creation. Currently that constitutes bank deposits (and it's worth  asking which banks might be doing the servicing here) and high quality  government securities.

Like  the Fed, the Libra money supply will be managed via the purchase and  sale of other assets through the authorised dealer network, who in turn  will be able to pocket significant arbitrage windfalls from servicing  Libra.

Like the Fed, the  Libra Reserve intends to act as a “buyer of last resort” for its own  currency and — presumably — will also be prepared to lower the quality  of the assets it purchases in the event of a Libra coin liquidity  crisis.

Like the Fed structure, the general public can only access the “global currency” through third-parties or exchanges.

Like  the Fed, the Libra system plans to use interest rates arbitrage to  reward incentivise members (see our SDR post for more on that).  Currently that means funding operational costs and dividends to founder  members by retaining interest earned on customer deposits — a model  PayPal also went for in its early days, before it transpired it would  need additional licensing to operate in that way legally.

Unlike  the Fed, the Libra system plans to operate as a full-reserve system  meaning its reserve requirements will always be 100 per cent. The model  is based on a Hong-Kong style currency board, rather than a challenger  central bank system, in the hope of avoiding bank runs.

Except  … Libra already provides caveats that could introduce risk over time.  For example, they note that in the event of exceptional circumstances a  supermajority vote could allow for the composition of the basket to  change. In the case of currency board crises, risks are often linked to  the market wrongly anticipating how a board may or may not act to fend  off a liquidity crisis in its underlying assets.

Libra  equally fails to acknowledge that even fully backed reserve funds —  such as Reserve Primary Fund during the 2008 — can experience dramatic  fluctuations in the relative pricing of reserves to issued units during  liquidity crises. Nor does it acknowledge risks can be thrust upon a  fully-backed system via fractioning further down the shadow banking  chain.

So what could possibly go wrong?

Answer: A lot. Or at least everything that has already gone wrong for the Fed, plus much more.

A good place to start are some of the issues the Fed architects themselves failed to anticipate:

Gaining  membership was not as easy as anticipated. In the end, it took another  act of state — the 1980 Money Control Act — to compel all banking  institutions to become members of the Federal Reserve system. The act  itself was in part brought in to assuage fears that the propagation of  the eurodollar markets was leading to the Fed losing control over  meaningful monetary aggregates. By applying regulations to all banks  equally, there was no longer any reason not to be a member bank. Unless  Facebook's Libra has government and enforcement on side, it's hard to  imagine how it can compel competitors to sign up.

The  Fed's control of the money supply would be significantly undermined by  the eurodollar markets, which allowed copycat dollars to be created in  huge — often not fully reserved — sums offshore. These offshore  equivalents were tethered into the core system via correspondent bank  agreements. Libra might think it will be able to control its system, but  in reality it will be hard for it to stop a third party in a  lighter-touch jurisdiction from using Libra reserves to issue its own  Libra-pegged liabilities (which may or may not be fully reserved and may  or may not operate to the same KYC/AML standards).

The  liquidity of the underlying reserve assets and respective par  redemption promises could not be guaranteed — especially when economic  flows diverged from the make-up of the constituent reserves.

FX  manipulation risk and competitive devaluation arose in the shape of  third parties hoarding rather than spending their dollar reserves, so  that their own currencies be strategically depreciated versus the value  of the underlying reserves. (Libra accumulated by, say, Amazon against  increasingly depreciated Amazon money would amount to a Libra/Amazon FX  rate that benefited the Amazon economy. )

The  cost of managing the system might be greater than the fees raised from  members or seigniorage extracted from the system. In the Fed's example,  the government was called upon to finance the difference on the  condition any unexpected profits would always be transferred back to the  government. In the Libra scenario, there is no such government  backstop. If income earned from interest is insufficient to cover the  costs (a likely scenario in a low rate environment), the system would  have to urgently locate other sources of “benevolent” funding to finance  the system.

Managing a pegged monetary reserve system isn't all that easy.",cryptocurrency

Stopped my part time job and relied on my checking balance. Pretty much, I got to overwhelmed with school work, commute and family stuff and did not manage my bank account well. I used my credit card for purchases like food and gas and any minor expenses like school supplies and miscellaneous items(usually under 10 bucks and seldom). I had one big expense which was my for my car when the radiator blew.  I had money in my checking account(\~1500), and about a grand in my savings plus about 3 grand invested. Pretty much, I had set up automatic payments set up mostly because I usually am very good at budgeting and never go above my monthly spending cap but in my last semester I did not do that at all. I was buying out a lot more because of lack of time and stress eating. Ended up going above my cap and then some( and the some more). The real kicker happened when I  took off automatic payment, because my checking wouldn't have the funds and didn't want to pay the lack of funds fee, I switched it to manual. See where I'm going with this. Ended up with late payments 3 months in a row and I was paying off as much as I could each time but late. Also accumulated some debt during that time about 3k in total(including getting my car fixed). With all this, my credit score took a pretty big hit. It went from high 740s to low 640s. 

Current Situation: Recently graduated college and already have a job as a software engineer. Making about 5.1k/month after taxes. Have paid off my credit card debt. Still have my savings and investments. Am paying back parents for college(about 1800/month until I pay back 28 grand). Currently live with parents and they don't require rent since I'm paying back for college.  In need of a car since my other one broke down but my credit is too low to get a loan for a decent car( looking in the 15k range). What can I do to improve my credit score to get it back to where it was or to a point where I can get a loan approved at a decent interest rate! Thanks for the help in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Someone had mail delivered to my parents house that they just sold. Is someone getting scammed?,"Background: my parents just sold their house and are retiring.  They had a For Sale sign posted in their yard, and had it listed on multiple websites.  They just closed last week.

On Monday, my father went by the empty house to clear our the last of their stuff and saw 2 FedEx envelopes stuck in the door.  He opened them and realized that they weren't addressed to them (or to the new owners), but the address was the same.  There was a military rank and name on the mail.  Inside were sealed envelopes from a bank that is primarily used by military, containing a card (he could feel the weight of it).  A woman then knocked on the door about 20 min later and said her mail was delivered there by mistake, even though the street address was their house.  She collected the mail and drove off in her car (NC plates), followed by a second car.

investing,The fed will cut rates moving forward,"All the evidence points to it happening. 

While the fed remained neutral, it has moved to an easing posture that makes cuts in July and/or September a distinct possibility. While the rate decision met the consensus market view, the updated dot plot reflects a very dovish take with seven members calling for 50bps in rate cuts by year-end.

In response, Treasuries are rallying across the curve as they see a Fed seemingly poised to start cutting. While the Fed had provided a dovish surprise at each of the three prior FOMC meetings, we surmised that the only way to pull that off today would have been with a rate cut, but alas, that was a bridge too far for Powell and Co., given still decent economic and labor market results.

Also of importance, the longer-run, or neutral, rate was cut from 2.75% to 2.50%. Powell has tried to wave-off the importance of the dot plots as it was born in a rising rate world, and as such is more unwieldy in projecting rate cuts via slowing/recessionary scenarios. That being said, the important takeaway today is that the Fed sees the hiking cycle as complete, and while they were hesitant to forecast aggressive rate cuts, there is no doubt they have shifted to an easing posture as the most likely next move. Finally, the vote was not unanimous. James Bullard voted to go ahead with a 25bps cut at this meeting.

Overall, it's very evident that a rate cut is near and thus the rally today.",finance

I'd like to have the time and money to shop for a decent used truck and work on my Jeep to sell.

personalfinance,"[Auto] Down payments, or not?","We're in a fairly respectable position financially.  We have about 10k in savings, and three 5k CDs that we're laddering.  Each of them make somewhere in the 3%-ish area.  We usually have about 2k in checking, and we make about 112k a year.  We both have very good credit scores.

It's time for us to start looking at a newer car for around 18-20k.  Our current vehicles are starting to need increasingly expensive repairs.  One vehicle is 16 years old; the other is 13 years old.  The car we purchase will be something we will probably keep at least this long as well.  

That said, I'm constantly getting conflicting advice on what down payment to put down on a car.  We have been told to put nothing down, or, alternatively, put down about 5k.  The major point of contention seems to be that our interest rate for a vehicle loan would be lower than the interest rate we currently have on our CDs (the highest rate we've seen loan-wise, either through our credit union or a dealership, has been about 2.79%).

Even so, I'm reluctant to put myself on the hook for higher monthly payments if I can avoid it.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my house?,"I bought a house in December for 200k, down 40k with a 160k mortgage at 4.5% interest rate for 15yrs.  The balance is now around 156k and seeing how interest rates are around the 3.5% mark for refinancing, I'm thinking about it.

Here's the part where I'm having issue seeing clearly, I sold my old house after I moved into the new one and after half a year or so of saving money I now have a total of 60k+ cash I want to pay down my mortgage with(due to various reasons out of my control, this money has to go into the house).  I can't decide which would benefit me more, refinance and get a 90k mortgage or don't bother with paying refinance fees and simply dump the money on my principle and aggressively pay off my mortgage over the next few years? over 15years on a 90k mortgage, the 1% difference doesn't amount to very much (about 9k I think) and If refinancing cost is a few grand, then I think I'm better off just putting that money into the principle.  

What would you guys do in my situation? Keep in mind that I can't refinance to a lower rate and make it 30 years and simply put my income into other investments.

personalfinance,"3.3k in Debt, no Student Loans:Balance Transfer or Personal Loan","Hello everyone. Today I am taking the step to be debt free. I admit that I had a problem in undergrad, and after graduating, life hit in a way that made me hate owing money/having my money already go somewhere before I could spend it.

&amp;#x200B;

Context: 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent graduate with no student loans. I initially had a credit score of 760, and a credit limit of around 7k. Things changed mostly after I graduated. Hit depression, and was unemployed for a few months. Lived at home and mother is single, so I couldn’t let her struggle so I used my card to help out here and there knowing I couldn't make the payments. I just didn't want to feel useless at the time. I accrued up to 3.3k, score went down to 650, and limit down to 3.8k. I now have a balance over 30% of the available limit.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a very strong urge to fight my way out of this mess. I work and get paid about 900 dollars every 2 weeks after taxes and 401k. That goes to bills, helping mom out with her things, etc.  Current Interest rate is 23.40%. My credit is my greatest asset since i am not making much every year. I realized I need to protect it from going lower at all costs but I recognize I need whatever help I can get. I can make the monthly payments now, but it keeps on getting slapped around by the interest every month.

&amp;#x200B;

My plans:

&amp;#x200B;

Plan 1. Apply for a balance transfer card: I have done some research and it looks like the Citi Simplicity Card is pretty good; it has 0% APR for 21 months on balance transfers.  3,316/21 months gives me a payment of $157 each month to fully pay it off. And honestly,  seeing the full weight of my cash making a dent will entice me to put even more to be free of this atrocity sooner.

Plan 2. Apply for a loan from Wing's Financial at less than 10% APR if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plan 3. Try to work out a loan from Wells Fargo and see what they can do for me promotional-wise. I've been with them for years and honestly I'm tired of them and I will switch once I am rid of this baggage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, I appreciate any advice on what to do moving forward here as I just want to be free. I made some bad decisions and found myself in shitty situations that I didn't have the knowledge to navigate wisely.

investing,"If so many of you guys are scared/cautious of a market crash, why not buy a put spread to protect your investment?","I know this subreddit is inherently against options, ""oh go to wsb"", but you know they were made to protect investments right?

Assuming you took the classic /r/investing advice of ""just buy SPY and wait"", you might have a lot of shares of SPY.

SPY is at about $295 right now.  Let's say you've been working and buying SPY for a few years.  So $29,500 would be 100 shares.  

A $295 SPY Put expiring 12/17/21 is $3,122.  For a little over $3k, you can protect your entire position.  

If that is too much to justify, the $270 Put expiring the same day is $2,119.  Sell this one to make a spread.  Now, you will only protect for a 9% drop, but a 9% drop is $2,655.  

Okay, so you have 100 shares of SPY because you've been following r/investing.  That's $29,500.  You can spend $1,003 to protect your investment from a 9% drop for **TWO AND A HALF YEARS**.

personalfinance,Needing Tips Regarding Paying Down Outstanding Student Loan Interest,"I let my student loans sit in default for over 10 years and at the moment, I have just over 10k in outstanding interest on my 30k principal. I have been through rehabilitation (thanks to advice and support I received from a reddit post) and now I am wondering the smartest way to go about paying off my debt.

Currently, the monthly payment I am required to make isn't getting me very far, and because of this, I've been making an extra payment each month with my regular payment. I'm also trying to make miscellaneous extra payments when possible with money from odd jobs. My thoughts were to tackle all outstanding interest first, so I've already paid off the few hundred of interest on my smallest loan in a misc payment. My extra monthly payment gets split up between the remaining loans.

&amp;#x200B;

My loans are all Federal in the amounts of:

1. Principal: $690, Outstanding Int: $0, Rate: 6.55%, Req. Monthly Pmt: $13
2. Principal: $1150, Out Int: $575, Rate: 6.55%, Req. Monthly: $21
3. Principal: $3775, Out Int: $1600, Rate: 6.55%, Req. Monthly: $66
4. Principal: $24000, Out Int: $8275, Rate: 4.625%, Req. Monthly: $211

&amp;#x200B;

I am asking you all:

A. Should I use the snowball method for first paying down back interest? Or should I be trying to knock out entire loans at a time? Right now I am prepared to either pay off my smallest loan, or pay off the outstanding interest on my second highest loan with a misc extra payment.

B. How would you apply the extra monthly payment? I am currently paying an extra $100 along with my required payment for all loans with outstanding interest ($25 to loan 2, $25 to loan 3, $50 to loan 4).. is there a better way to allocate this money?",finance

personalfinance,Downsides of refinancing student loans,"I just finished paying off approximately 15k  in credit card debt, and I am directing my focus towards my student loans.

I should have paid them off long ago, but I was young and dumb, and spent my money on frivolous stuff like computers, knives, alcohol, a wife, a house, a car, a kid, another car, etc.  Y'know, things that help you rack up $15k in credit card debt.

I have about $12k in private student loans at 6.8% and about $10k at 0%.  And just so it is clear, I have zero intentions on paying off the 0% loans any faster than what is scheduled by making the minimum payment.

I'm strongly considering refinancing the higher interest rate student loans, and with a credit score in the 840 range and decent income, I should qualify for the lowest interest rate anywhere.

Using the snowball from finishing off the credit card debt, I expect to be making payments 2-3x the minimum payment and have it paid off by the end of next year whether it is refinanced or not.

My hold-up is whether there is any real downside to refinancing such as fees or credit dings.  By the time it's paid off, it's only a difference of $200ish dollars in interest, and any fees or other expenditures would eat away at that difference.  Couple that with being lazy, and that puts me in my current state of analysis paralysis.

Is there any reason I shouldn't refinance?

Edit: thank you, everyone, for your guidance.  I'll be refinancing for a lower rate!",finance
financialindependence,How will a change in r* affect the safe withdrawal rate and how much you need for FIRE?,"The prevailing discussion among the Federal Reserve Banks and Commercial Banks has been about what the new [natural rate of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rate_of_interest) (known as r* or r-star) is for the US Economy. [Until 2009, r* has remained around 2.5%. Since then, r* has drifted to 1% or under 1%.](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/assets/images/publications/research/econ_focus/2018_q4/econfocus_2018q4_fr_chart1_large.jpg). Previously, the federal reserve and bankers have talked about how they anticipate the natural rate of interest would be static indefinitely. However, now they are speculating that r* can and did just change.

Here's a recent speech by the Richmond Fed: https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2018/q4/federal_reserve

&gt;In previous decades, many economists assumed the natural rate of interest was fairly constant over time. But in the wake of the Great Recession, new estimates by Laubach and Williams pointed to a dramatic collapse in the value of r-star, from 2.5 percent to less than 1 percent.

Why does the natural rate of interest matter?

It's the underpinning metric for the rate at which our economy will grow. If you look at [this diagram](https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/news/speeches/kaplan/2018/rsk181024c1.png), you'll notice a decline in nominal global government bond yields over the past few decades, a change from the data we've been collecting since 1870.

https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/kaplan/2018/rsk181024.aspx

&gt;Changes in inflation-adjusted global government bond yields should, over time, reflect changes in the longer-run neutral real rate of interest. After adjusting for inflation, the real interest rates on safe and liquid assets—primarily global government bonds of various countries—have declined significantly over the past 30 years, a decline that precedes the Great Recession. Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that this decline in real interest rates is likely due to lower rates of trend economic growth in these various countries, at least partly as a result of demographic shifts (particularly aging populations) and lower rates of trend productivity growth.

[And Europe is experiencing the same thing, a shift in the natural rate of interest due to lower productivity, aging demographics, and flight to safety.](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op217.en.pdf)

If we are seeing genuine change in r* from 2.5% to 1% then all our [calculators](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bzfdr2/understanding_and_visualizing_the_4_rule_and_safe/) and [assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b9iily/20_years_of_safe_withdrawal_rate_research/) we've made regarding safe withdrawal rates need to be revised. The growth period of the G7 countries from 1870 till now may be shifting towards a more long-term lower rate. Our traditional 4% rule may become a 2.5% rule.

Disclaimer: I am by no means an economist. I work in finance, and deal a lot with interest rates, but a lot of these models are just hypotheses. Even for the fed. The very nature of the natural interest rate is unobservable, which makes modelling, estimating and predicting it incredibly difficult.",finance
personalfinance,federal public service loan repayment...too good to be true?,"not sure if this is right place for this question, but here goes. 

the FPSL repayment program says that if someone works for a non-profit for 10 year and during that time makes 120 payments on their Direct student loans, that the remaining balance can be forgiven. 

I am a health care professional with a mortgage sized student loan that I have been paying down aggressively. I'm on a 10 year repayment plan now...but I also work for a non-profit. I only recently learned that I would likely qualify for this repayment program, so I am putting in an application.  I have classmates who are paying the bare minimum because they have qualified and are basically just forgetting that their loans exist because of this program. I am worried that something will happen to this program and rug will be pulled out from under me and in 10 years I'll still have a mountain of debt. It just seems too easy for health care professionals; most large health care organizations are tax exempt or non profits. If it works, I would have put a ton of money into savings (I'd be able to max out my 403b, a roth, my HSA with the money I'm putting on loans) I could really use some input on this issue.

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more “uniform and effective” the prior “patchwork” of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the “[i]nitial registration” requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register “before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement.” §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the “[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).” The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNA’s enactment (“pre-Act offenders”), the Attorney General
“shall have the authority” to “specify the applicability” of SORNA’s
registration requirements and “to prescribe rules for [their] registration.” §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNA’s registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District
Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to “specify the applicability” of SORNA’s registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders. 

&gt;**Held: The judgment is affirmed.**

btc,"In the cryptospace, tickers are the most dangerous superstition.","Tickers are *absolutely meaningless*. If you actually read the whitepaper, you'd find that nowhere does it say a damn thing about ""tickers"". It always calls bitcoin, bitcoin. Satoshi nakamoto also didn't refer to Bitcoin by a ticker, but rather, the abbreviation ""bc"".

A ticker is the way a centralized exchange or other financial institution organizes their mountain of flaming garbage and horseshit that they try to sell you. Centralized exchanges are trying to sell you 99% pure shit and scams, and 1% things that are useful. 

Unsurprisingly, the stock market is the same way. Theorerically, the purpose of a stock is basically like a more distributed version of venture capital, you invest in a business, and if the business is successful later on, you get a cut. The problem with stocks is you can't start your IPO without spending millions of dollars in fees to the federal government. This makes the stock market *virtually useless* and just a stupid speculators toy. Centralized exchanges are basically just a reanimation of this old system, trying to sell you random shit with no purposeful existence, because you're drawn in to (getting rek'd by) these speculators toys.

Let me repeat: A ticker is a way some centralized financial institution organizes all the speculative horseshit they want to sell to people's dumb asses.

Tickers are not a concept in Bitcoin, and have only been made a concept by the banksters, saboteurs, and centralized exchanges.

*""But how do we differentiate between ""BTC"" and ""BCH""?""* The faster we can break from the illusion of tickers and understand bitcoin for what it really is, the faster BTC will die and we don't have to differentiate. But i agree there is a space and a time in between. The better way to differentiate is to give these disillusioned ticker worshippers what they want. BTC is BTC, and Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is given the ticker BCH, and its called ""Bitcoin Cash"" by some, but its exactly Bitcoin (BC). 

Most of what you people call ""Bitcoin maximalists"" are really just economically illiterate retards that are ticker maximalists, and neither understand nor care about bitcoin. They're more or less shills for the status quo hoping to accumulate more fiat.

There are two great truths in Bitcoin;

1) Bitcoin was designed to be able to be changed given the miners choose to do this. 

2) The purpose of Bitcoin is (essentially) to be borderless, global, p2p cash, and anything that contradicts this purpose is called an ""attack"" by Satoshi Nakamoto.

BSVers don't understand the first bullet point, and BTCers don't understand the second. Bitcoiners (like you and me) understand both, and that's why we'll win in the end. We're the version of Peer to Peer Cash with the longest POW chain, and by the definition of bitcoin outlined in the whitepaper, **this makes us Bitcoin.**",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help with withholdings,"**TL;DR:** change withholdings now and then check them again in a couple months, or just wait a couple months?

&amp;#x200B;

So, just did the IRS withholding calculator and it said that if I changed my withholdings to 0 now, I would owe nothing at the end of the year and get like $75 ""back"". 

However, I am unsure of how accurate it is. First, my May paycheck was smaller than normal because of a timecard problem. I do an after school program during the year. Because of when our time cards are due compared to when they finish payroll for the month, I get paid for the after school work the next month (so, the work I did in May, I get at the end of June). Well, because of said problem, My pay for the April after school work isn't being paid out til June, along with the May work. So less taxes than normal were taken out last month, and I'll be getting extra this month. Since I had to use May's paycheck for federal taxes on the withholding calculator, not sure how much that affected things....or how it is affected by my  July paycheck will have an extra 4k on it from teaching summer school in June. (I included this pay, to the best of my estimations, as part of my salary in the calculator, but had to go with the correct and current tax info)

Additionally, as long as I finish the class I am almost done with by July 29th, I will move up one step in the salary schedule. When that happens, my annual salary (July-May) will go up $3,300 and change, and my hourly rate (which affects my after school program pay) will go up just over a dollar. Additionally, we vote on a new contract in August. if it passes, there will be a 3% raise across the salary schedule (not retroactive, though, to include July).

&amp;#x200B;

Given this information, is it better to change to 0 now and check in August or September if I need to change it still or even if I have to have additional withheld or would it be better to just wait and do it after the pay dust has settled and I have more definitive and correct numbers and be prepared to maybe owe a little?",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage?,"I currently owe about $170k on my mortgage and I'm really thinking about paying it off. I work in sales and the past couple of years have been really good. 

My salary is $85k (before any bonus) and my wife works part time and makes around $20k. In 2017, I made around $130k (salary + bonus), 2018-$400k and this year it's looking like I'll be right over $500k. I have close to $200k in retirement as of now but my wife only has $5,500k since she's never had a job where they offer 401k/IRA (moving forward I will be maxing out her contributions, not sure why I didn't start before last year, stupid me). 

We have no debt besides our mortgage. Already paid off all my student loans and purchased a vehicle for my wife but paid it off after a month. I currently have enough to pay off the mortgage and still have over $200k to invest elsewhere. We haven't really had any sort of lifestyle creep since we're both pretty simple people. 

We bought the house in December of 2017 for $178k and there has been quite the boom where we live so our house was recently appraised at $246k. I will most likely be promoted in the next six months and will have to move. At that point my company will pay for all costs incurred during selling of the house and if it doesn't sell after 60 days they will get three appraisals and offer me the middle one.

personalfinance,Auto loan interest rates... Didn't immediately shop around,"I'm looking into buying a used car before moving on June 30th and made the mistake of not shopping around for an interest rate when I made my first inquiry. I've been approved with State Farm and after giving them a spreadsheet of the cars I've been looking into, the interest rates that came back were between 8.54%-14.9%. I have a 690 credit score and have never missed a payment, but my rep is estimating that the rates are so high because I've never had an auto loan before. 

While on the phone with my mother yesterday, she agreed to co-sign for me to bring my interest rate down. Her credit score is an 850. She mentioned seeing if there may be other places with lower rates since the lowest State Farm does is 4.5% I believe. The problem is that I applied with State Farm on June 4th, and now any other inquiries will not be grouped together with that.   


I'm moving to a new city in 10 days and will be apartment hunting over the next month for an August move-in, so I'm worried about how rate hunting (and this extra inquiry) may affect my credit. I've had 2 inquiries in the past 12 months, June 4th will mark my 3rd one. If I shop around now, that will make 4 inquiries.   


Is dinging my credit worth the attempt to find a better interest rate? Where else should I look for rates? I'm not sure if there's a credit union I'm eligible to join/use near me--but I am looking into it. My bank?   


Also, I know this sub never advocates for co-signing loans, but my mom wants to help me out the same way her parents did. I asked her fully anticipating that she'd say no.

a)	Should I completely switch over, i.e. take out all my money from BoA, close the account, and start fresh with a new bank?

b)	Should I keep some money in BoA, just enough to avoid fees, and open up another bank to use as my primary i.e. change my direct deposits and auto-pay to be done from the new bank.

c)	Or should I keep everything the way it is, but have auto-transfers from BoA to the new bank, for it to be automatically funneled into the pre-determined sub-savings account?

Bitcoin,When's the CutOver date due for Bitcoin. Any US Feds out there to answer this.,"I spent my life working in the Airline Industry!  When we change reservation systems, we proceed by steps.

Then on a CutOver date we 'kill' the old reservation system and flick the switch to the new one!  A date is set by the IT office, after all airport have reported 'Ready'.

This very same pattern is used in the crypto space.  Release BTC(the new tech), let develop(segwit, etc), transfer the value over(turn $$$ into Satoshies), and cut the current Fiat system out.

personalfinance,Do I have the rights to my 401k money?,"I'll try to keep this short as possible. I have a Roth 401k through my employer, the account is managed by Schwab. I recently adjusted my investments through their online service and while I was there I was in a chat room with a Schwab rep. I asked out of curiosity how it would work if someone wanted to cash out their 401k, like just pay the 10% penalty (assuming they're under 59.5) , and federal and state taxes. I had been dabbling with the idea of doing that to pay off my mortgage, which after reading I realize is probably a bad idea.  

Anyways, She flat out told me that as long as I was a current employee at my work I could not cash it out. The only way was to apply for a hardship withdrawal. I could find no hard rule on this but everything I've read is that you can cash it out assuming your willing to pay all the applicable fees associated with this regardless of employment status and age. Just curious if she was feeding me BS because it seemed like she was skirting around the question when I asked directly. 

I asked her if this was a Schwab policy and she said no. I am also fully vested in my 401k (my company has a match). Hope this makes sense, and thank you for your time.",finance
personalfinance,Need help with figuring out the best way to get my car interest rate down,"Hi, I’m financing a 2010 Toyota Corolla and would like to lower my interest rate. Honestly I should have did this a long time ago but kept putting it off because it seemed a daunting task in my head for so long.

The terms I agreed upon were a 5 year loan at 13.24% at a local credit union. I would like to get it down into the low single digits but even under 10% at this point would help. I believe I would qualify for a good rate since I’ve made all my payments on time over the last 2+ years and my credit is now on the cusp of excellent.

I looked at my credit unions website just a bit ago at their auto loan/refinancing page but they’re only showing rates for cars 2013 or newer. There is a link for if your car is older than 2013 that redirects to their page for secured/collateralized loans with their shortest term and rate being 36 months with an APR as low as 7.49%.

I’m assuming it will be very hard/impossible to just refinance the car anywhere since it’s so old, so what would be my best option? A personal loan or is there another way I could go. I have 3 years of payments to go and owe slightly over 4k still. Any help is much appreciated and if there is any information needed that I missed, please mention it and I will get back with said information.

The last thing I will mention is that I’m not trying to extend the loan out. I do want a lower rate and lower payments but not at the cost of adding additional payments, I would rather shorten the term and keep the payment amount the same if it means saving in the long haul.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on paying off car loan,"I bought a car back in December for around 7k. I put half down and then financed the remainder through a local credit union with a 12.54% interest rate. I've made 6 payments on the thing and can pay it off completely if I want to. My credit age isn't that old (~14 months). I know it takes ~6 months to see positive effects of a loan on a credit report. Is this even worth waiting out (like, how much of an improvement would I really see?) My current credit scores from credit karma and the discover FICO puts me at 720+ for everything. I just don't want to keep paying so much on interest since I could get rid of it right now (I know the old adage is don't carry debt to improve credit).

Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,California says I owe it more income tax for 2015 because my AGI was different on my federal taxes. Any tips for how I'm suppose to protest this considering I moved to colorado in july and was no longer earning income in california?,"so my parents(was using their address to file my taxes in CA) got a letter from the FTB in california saying that I owe them around $1500 because I filed my state income taxes incorrectly.

The reason why my california AGI was different was because only about 40% of my earned income that year was from self-employed income in calfornia. Around July is when I moved to Colorado and became a W2 employee there.

Has anyone dealt with this before? I'm going to protest it, but am wondering if I should protest AND pay or just protest and not pay since I'll be accruing interest by not paying(I assume they'll pay me back the full amount but i don't want to end up owing them a lot of money if they decide that I still owe them money).

What documentation should I prepare? I've got my 1099s and W-2's, will that be enough?

Bitcoin,"Libra (FB Coin) is IMF ""Crypto"" 1.0","I'm sure most of you have heard of the Libra (suckerbucks) by now, decided to post an analysis here.

&amp;#x200B;

The Tl:DR of the coin is it is a centralized/permissioned coin with giant corporations who paid 10M to be nodes. These funds will be used to back the coin with a basket of currencies and bonds. Basically the wechat/alipay of the west with all the dystopian drama of your worst nightmares. Shutdown someone's Libra account for being a ""dissident"" and they can't buy food in a world without cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people think this will be the end of banks as FB is directly competing with the banking cartel, and not a single retail/investment/wall st bank is a node validator/bought an exchange seat.

&amp;#x200B;

But in reality this project is only competing with RETAIL banks, and going to be propping up the USD and negative yielding government bonds indirectly. If you are not aware the IMF has their own currency called the SDR which is basically a basket of currencies combined into a single unit which they wish to be used as a one world currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Libra sounds shockingly similar to the SDR (basket of currencies and bonds), and to me it seems they are using FB and other large corporations as a cover to push their master plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**I submit the endgame of this project is ultimately to BAN CASH in a roundabout way and lead to the IMF's end goal of instilling negative interest rates on cash. Negative interest rates are basically another tax on savers (you pay 3% to store your money in a bank)**

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, neg rates can only be instituted on bank deposits (japan,swiss) and negative bonds (euro,japan etc) at corporate level, because retailers can always run to cash and pay nothing (other than inflation which is the stealth tax)

&amp;#x200B;

But if they push Libra onto the masses because its ""simple and easy"" and we are ""helping"" the 3B unbanked (who almost always use cash) they can start instituting negative rates on cash via an exchange rate. See the link below on their website for how they would do it. Just replace ""e-dollars"" with Libra.

&amp;#x200B;

**""To illustrate, suppose your bank announced a negative 3 percent interest rate on your bank deposit of 100 dollars today. Suppose also that the central bank announced that cash-dollars would now become a separate currency that would depreciate against e-dollars by 3 percent per year. The conversion rate of cash-dollars into e-dollars would hence change from 1 to 0.97 over the year. After a year, there would be 97 e-dollars left in your bank account. If you instead took out 100 cash-dollars today and kept it safe at home for a year, exchanging it into e-money after that year would also yield 97 e-dollars.""**

[https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/)

&amp;#x200B;

The whole ""but regulators are fighting back"" argument is a media smokescreen. Facebook has made the rounds with regulators already and this has been planned at the highest levels. Ironically retail banks will probably be killed off as a result of this, but millions/billions will be duped into using Libra due to ""no fees"".

&amp;#x200B;

Also through the ""basket of currencies and bonds"" the IMF (through FB) can prop up any FIAT currency (USD) or negative yielding bonds (Eur,Japan) they like and destroy any one they don't by simply dropping it from the basket.

&amp;#x200B;

They are going to try to prolong the death of FIAT for as long as possible but ultimately they know they are dead in the water.

&amp;#x200B;

Implications &gt; Buy bitcoin and understand we are at a crossroads to a better world without central bankers. We don't need their IMF fake crypto( wrapped in a FB wrapper). They can try but this time they will fail, they are only slowing down their inevitable downfall.

personalfinance,Student Loan repayment questions.,"My loans are coming into repayment. Thankfully I have a job. I owe 32,000  in federal loans, with interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 5.05%. I have some Credit Card debt from my months of unemployment post-grad that is priority #1, but after that I plan to aggressively over pay on my student loans but for now I could afford to make about $200/month in student loan payments.


When using the calculator it asks for my Adjusted Gross Income. My current yearly salary will be 42,000, but its my first full time job. So my last years AGI will be real small. So do I use last years numbers or my current salary info? Because if I use last years I'd probably qualify for the $0 a month payments but isn't that like lying to them? Also couldn't I qualify for the $0 a month and just make payments? 


I guess I'm confused about the legality/morality of using last years numbers to achieve low payments if my current income could support more payments.",finance

Bitcoin,My personal story of Buying at the ath,"Before i start, all values are in cdn $.

So I bought my first bit of Bitcoin 2 years ago during the big spike.  Even though I had thought of many times to buy it before I didn't.  But when it skyrocketed i knew i wanted to get in.  I started buying a little bit when it was at $9,000.  Due to the verification restrictions and single time our base restriction i could only buy a little bit at a time (i think it was $500 per week i could buy).  This was really frustrating for me because the value was going up like crazy and I felt like I was missing out big time.

During the time I couldn't buy, all I had left to do was follow this subreddit.  And i learned some things that helped me a lot in the long run.  Most importantly, don't out in more than you can afford to lose.  I decided on $10,000.  This was a significant amount for me still but at the same time, if i lost it all it wouldn't have affected my other plans to buy a house etc.   Secondly i kept reading everywhere to hodl.  So many people mentioned at the time (and they got downvoted too) that we should expect the price to go back down as its likely a bubble but they all said to hodl. Honestly this was huge because if it wasn't for this i would have lost all the money.  Thirdly, to realize that you don't lose until you sell.  Fourthly, dollar cost averaging.  

I ended up buying my $10,000 worth of Bitcoin at varying prices between $9000 and 25000.  I think the average purchase price ended up being around $15000. 

And then it tanked.  It went all the way down to $5000 and the only reason i didn't sell was because of the points mentioned earlier.  Instead i started buying more smaller amounts regularly ($50 a week).  Did that for two years and I'm now easily in the green.

My point is just that i could have panicked and sold but this sub taught me a lot and it really helped.  Bitcoin is now my ""fun"" side investment.  I could have definitely done it better and been more profitable but that's the other thing i learned, if you always try to time the market, you will fail more often than not.

And the biggest thing that Bitcoin has helped me with is to be steady with investments and not panic.  I remember about a year ago when I read in the news that the ""stock market is plummeting"" and i went to check my mutual funds and stock profiles.  They went down like 5% which i guess is a big drop in the stock market but i kinda just scoffed and went about my day.  I was amazed at how it didn't even phase me at all.  

Just wanted to share my story and take a minute to thank the random people in this sub.  I don't fully get Bitcoin yet, I haven't used it as a currency yet but I know I'm part of something new and exciting and it feels good.",cryptocurrency

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

investing,When to contribute to your IRA. An original study of five different approaches.,"I have been curious about how to time my contributions to my IRA. Is it best to do dollar cost averaging over the year, dump it all in at the beginning or try to time the market?


I did a little study where I downloaded the last 40 years of the S&amp;P 500 index and compared five different IRA investment strategies. [Here's the exact spreadsheet I used for those who want to take a look at the numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QlouWy6ZQq09cDqUWT1jIkbtU4JcFpSdf6XLExO3cwk/edit?usp=sharing).


If you're interested in a more visual journey, you can check it out here: https://imgur.com/gallery/myWu64q


I wrote it out as a little story with fictitious characters to make it a little less boring.


#Five way to time your IRA contribution

Steve, Mike, Larry, Tom and Paul were college friends who graduated 40 years ago. On they day they graduated, they made a pact to max out their IRAs every year, starting in 1979. (It was a Traditional IRA back then as the Roth wasn’t introduced until 1997).

&amp;nbsp;

They continued contributing every year for 40 years from 1979-2018. Every year they maxed out their IRAs as allowed by the IRS. Over the years the IRS has changed that contribution limit as follows:

 * 1979-1981: $1,500
 * 1982-2000: $2,000
 * 2002-2004: $3,000
 * 2005-2007: $4,000
 * 2008-2012: $5,000
 * 2013-2018: $5,500

Maxing out their IRAs for those 40 years, each of the friends contributes a grand total of **$123,500** in cash.

#Save or Invest?

Steve had heard that the stock market was risky, so he decided to never actually invest his money and instead left it in a money market account inside of his IRA. The other four were ahead of their time and knew the power of buying and holding index funds. They all decided to invest 100% of their contributions in a single S&amp;P 500 index fund and never sell. But each had a different strategy about when to make the contribution and investment. Let’s see how they fared.

#Steady Saving Steve

Steve hated the thought of losing his retirement money and heard the stock market was risky. So every every month for forty years he would contribute 1/12th of the maximum allowable IRA contribution to his IRA and leave it invested in a money market account. (Basically an interest paying cash account). His account earned interest, which was a bit of a wild ride over the years since the interest rates were over 17% (wow!) for many months in the early 80s, but under 1% from 2009 through 2018. With his slow and steady saving and consistent interest, Steve’s nest egg never went down in value and grew to **$210,557** by the end of 2018.

#Monthly Maintenance Mike

Mike also contributed money once per month in equal amounts of 1/12th of the annual contribution limit. But instead of leaving it in a money market account, Mike always invested it in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. He left it alone and never sold anything. His monthly strategy grew his investment to **$1,045,129** at the end of 2018, beating Steady Saving Steve by 396%.

#Lump Sum Larry
Larry didn’t like waiting or making monthly transactions. So on the first day the market was open each year, Larry maxed out his IRA and invested it in his S&amp;P 500 index fund in a single lump sum. His lump sum strategy grew his IRA to **$1,109,386** at the end of 2018, beating Monthly Mike by 6.1%.

#Terrible Timing Tom

Tom also dumped all his money in at once each year, but he had the worst timing possible. Instead of buying a little each month or buying all at the beginning of the year, Tom invested the moment of the absolute peak of the market each year. For example. in 1987, he dumped all his money at the peak, right before Black Monday only to watch the value of his IRA drop by more than a third over the following few months. But he never sold, and stuck to his terrible timing for 40 years. His strategy netted him **$919,533** at the end, about 12% less than Monthly Mike made.

#Perfectly Precise Paul

Paul also dumped all his money in at once. But Paul was omniscient. He was only person on the planet that pinpointed the exact instant of the market low 40 consecutive years. And at that instant he optimized the potential value of his IRA by dumping every penny of the annual max contribution and happily watched it go up for the remainder of the year. Paul’s impossibly perfect precision earned him the most of any of the five friends: **$1,212,838**. Even with his ability to see the market bottom before it happened, he still only beat Lump Sum Larry by 9.3%.

#The Lesson

All four of our index fund buyers handily beat the savings account by well over 4x. They were wise to understand the power of buying and holding an index fund without worrying about the volatility of the market. Terribile Timing Tom and Perfectly Precise Paul showed that even the worst or best possible timing really doesn’t change things all that much.

Bitcoin,How I think Bitcoin will be affected by Libra,"After some critical thinking about Libra I have come to the conclusion that Libra is just a threat to the US dollar (and all fiat) in the sense that it will inflate those fiat currency supplies dramatically.

Libra is a company which is trying to print its own money. That is as basic as it gets. They want to print their own money to bring people into their sphere of influence so it is hard to leave their sphere. Where nations have borders which demand local currency be used inside those borders, Libra demands that Libra be used inside the Facebook network for payments.

Because Libra will be backed by fiat, this devalues fiat. This is assuming that Libra will print coins and not establish a 1:1 ratio of current currency market rates. If Libra never creates a coin unless there is $1 USD to back it, then there's not much issue - it becomes a mass-adopted stablecoin. If they do any printing at all, which articles about Libra suggest (discussing credit lines and ""rollbacks"" if a hack occurs), then Libra just becomes another money supply.

It occurs to me that Libra is no different than if Facebook released a new series of stocks. This might be a violation somewhere in some lawbook regarding such a thing. The value of Libra to Facebook is when 200 million people each buy $100 in Libra, Facebook gets $20 billion to spend in the real world. People with Libra will then be locked into the Libra network, and can trade between each other for what they perceive as value, while the small but ever present fees chip away at the supply much as taxes do with normal fiat.

It also occurs to me that Libra is the same as if I went out and scanned a $20 dollar bill and printed off high quality copies of it and told people this was a myUSD dollar and tried to use it in normal exchange in everyday life. Facebook wants to print money above the Federal Reserve and have people accept it. I like this aspect - it does damage to the Fed and removes a lot of their power. For this reason alone I have a feeling this will not be allowed to come into fruition. Maxine Waters - financial chairwoman in Congress - is not a smart person. Yet she jumped and demanded Libra be halted until the government can address the issue. She didn't come up with that idea herself - the Fed and those who enjoy printing free money are at risk here, as the one issue preventing central banks from dominance is national borders and ease of transferring money, which Libra solves.

The more people who come to depend on Libra the more they will not see the national fiat currencies as worth much anymore. It's so simple to use Libra to pay for your Uber ride to the restaurant which takes Libra which pays its employees in Libra who buy your product for Libra that you pay for your Uber ride (etc currency cycle) that the USD will look slow and bulkier than ever. Eventually someone with USD cash money will want a Libra from someone else, and the Libra holder will say it is not worth it to just trade on a 1:1 basis - they will want a $2 USD to 1 Libra - slightly inflating the national fiat currencies. Of course, Facebook will likely control the entry point where the person with $2 USD can just exchange it for 2 Libra, but that is only if you go through their controlled entry point.

As people consider national fiat less valuable, inflation will occur in small but regular steps no different than the Fed today. This brings monetary competition into the arena again - something the Fed was specifically created to remove. If Libra is allowed to exist, the Fed and Libra will be competing to devalue each others' monetary value unless they join hands and well, then there's not much difference to today.

The end result is mixed. The utility Libra will bring to be able to send $100 Libra to someone in China (assuming they allow it) to pay for a product that you want shipped to you with an 'instant' transaction and nearly zero fee is strong. Since the transaction is recorded on a blockchain and you can always point to it occurring, it has some kind of security to the average user. The nodes however could, since they control it, just print off their own money to buy whatever product they want from any vendor who accepts Libra. They could still falsify their real world books but generate Libra in their own accounts with nothing stopping them. That is the risk; likewise that risk is still always there if the US government wants to print off $1 billion and buy $1 billion Libra, inflation occurs on both systems.

I feel that Bitcoin will be tepid during the launch of Libra as people worry about it replacing current crypto. I feel this must be what it was like when the US adopted the dollar instead of gold as a payment currency. Those who held on to their gold did very well, while those who jumped to the dollar did poorly. However at the beginning, no one could deny it was more convenient to carry around the paper money and use it.

The only threat to Bitcoin comes in the form of utility and mass adoption, where mass adoption is the more disruptive of those factors. Most alt-coins are not performing as well as Bitcoin even though they have greater utility (or utility potential), simply because there is not mass adoption of those coins; stability being a main complaint. If Libra can become so widely used that the use of Bitcoin begins to not be worth it to bother, because it's just so much easier to accomplish what you want with Libra, then there will be diminished interest in using Bitcoin as a medium to complete transactions. Bitcoin will still retain value - one of the core features of Bitcoin is its relationship to fiat currency. It is, on paper, directly proportional to the amount of fiat currency in circulation. This should not change, but utility is also a factor which can hinder price performance in the long run (for better or worse, that's debatable).

https://i.imgur.com/xB7hHwk.jpg​

I am strained to compare Bitcoin to salt or pepper. Pepper was at one point worth more than gold, because of its rarity and its ability to do something nothing else could. Eventually, locals found out they could make their own pepper. Quickly the price due to rarity (in being something nothing else could do) dropped dramatically and now pepper exists at an extremely low price. You might even have a superior pepper, from the original lands it was grown in, but the reality is people will adopt the much more convenient and less costly local pepper because it does the job good enough.

That is a strained analogy and I don't think Bitcoin will ever have that kind of devaluation. It is just an example. The reality is more people are born every day, and governments will have to continue to print fiat money to steal the labor from those people, one way or the other. Bitcoin and crypto will continue to grow in the long run, but that's not to say there isn't a threat in utility where a more widely adopted system cannot come in and force Bitcoin out of its Fear Of Missing Out ranges and down to a more stable position. Overall even that is good for Bitcoin, and long term value is as strong as everyone expects, but I expect a large downturn during the Libra period as people rally around convenience for a bit until they get burned.

personalfinance,Opportunity to pay off loans from my retirement account. Am I missing something?,"My wife and I have approximately 15k in college / car loans. 

I work a government job, and I recently learned of a program through my retirement account that lets you borrow up to 50% of your vested balance for general loans and primary residence purchase loans. I have enough in my account to cover my outstanding debts. 

After reading over the terms. You’re distributed your desired amount from your retirement account, after which point my paychecks would have automatic deductions taken out from them.  I can chose any payback schedule between 1-5 years, and this loan is not deemed a taxible distribution of funds unless it takes longer than 5 years to pay it back. 

So while paying back on this loan, the payments would be going back to re-inflate my retirement account to its original balance. The loan will have a 5.5% interest rate. 

So my question is, am I missing something here? Is there any reason to not kill all my debt and paying these banks interest, as opposed to “paying myself” back??",finance

personalfinance,"What does ""amount owed on accounts is too high"" mean?","I am 26 years old. I've been keeping up with my credit report and credit score since I was 19. Most of the online sources I have used to check my score/report offer unsolicited automated tips on how to increase your credit score. I have had ""the amount you owe on your accounts is too high when compared to your income"" or ""try to keep credit card balances below 40% of their maximum whenever possible"" or ""reducing the amount you owe on debt per month to less 40% of your gross monthly income would raise your score"" or some variant of these appear every single time regardless of which tool I am using to check my report/score. This is from various credit services offered by Capital One, Navy Fed, USAA, Wells Fargo, and an Army financial advice website (they already have all of my info so why not give the site a shot right?).

&amp;#x200B;

My gross income is 3800 a month with a take home of around 2800. My only sources of debt are an auto loan and a personal loan that I used to buy an older cheap car. The initial amount for the auto loan was $12,500 USD in November of 2016 for a six year term at 3.99%. I currently owe \~$3000. The monthly payment is $240 a month. My personal loan was originally for $5,000 in August 2018. Six year term at 5.89%. I currently owe $2900. The monthly payment is $120. My credit report does not show a single account that I am unaware of. It accurately displayes my entire credit history.

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly amount owed to debt is only $360 dollars a month, or 12% of my take home income. I am far below the ""less than 40%"" of my gross income that every credit tool tells me I should maintain. If it was just one bank telling me this I would assume it was a mistake, but it's consistent across the board. My credit score is sitting in a very good place, but I am starting to get pissed because these tools are telling me my score could be higher if I met a certain criteria that I have already met. Am I misunderstanding what it means? Is there a reason I keep getting this ""tip""? Should I continue to ignore like I have for the last five years since it appeared?",finance

personalfinance,"For the first time in my life, I'm going to be in credit card debt. I'd like to know whether just hunkering down and paying it off is my best option. Worried about things like credit rating, interest payments tearing me a new one, and not knowing what else I don't know.","​This is pretty tame compared to a lot of questions but I've literally never been in a position like this before.

* I've always managed to pay my credit card balance in full by the due date.
​​
* Recently I've gotten a mortgage and, to put a long story short, my cash balance has been cutting very close to zero. It just seemed a matter of time until unexpected expenses would put me in the red. I have $6000 due July 15, and anticipate just $4000 in my cash account at that date (after paycheck comes in, rent goes out, mortgage payments deducted, etc)

* Fortunately I'm employed and my plan is to just work my ass off, put a lid on discretionary spending and pay this fucker off right quickly. However I still anticipate ~3 months to knock this out (obviously I'll have ordinary expenses those months too, rent, etc),

* As far as a schedule goes I'm thinking (1) I pay $3000 on the due date, leaving $1000 in emergency cash, then (2) $1000 each of the subsequent 3 months.

* Over the next few months I'll aim to pay everything on credit to stay liquid (in addition to keeping expenses down).


What I'm wondering about: is there a better way to go about this? I have no idea how this affects my credit rating, whether the interest payments will steamroll me, or what else I haven't thought about. I've only thought of the following alternatives so far:

* This'll hang over my head til I'm in the ground if I ask family, so that's not happening.

* I've thought of asking friends, but I haven't asked a friend for a loan since high school ($100 to sign up for taekwondo classes). I'm familiar with the notion of money ruining friendships, never loaning what you can't afford to lose. However I can think of one friend in particular who might be able to spare it, and whose pocket I wouldn't mind being in. I'd be happy to pay him off at the same interest rate as the card company if it means saving my credit score. Still, there's a chance he'll say no so I'd be risking a friendship.

* I'm not sure if there's anything I can do with my mortgage to assist this, e.g. is there a way to pay it out of my offset and take advantage of the lower rate on that?


Any thoughts would be great.

Also, if the Fed raises rates, that doesn’t mean the stock market is going stop growing and plummet overnight. It just means that growth is going to be moderated a bit. And the Fed never raises interest rates by a huge amount. At most, they make small adjustments a few times per year.

personalfinance,Renting with my SO or buying,"Wasn't sure if this was the right sub for this but I'm in a situation where I plan on getting a place with my SO once my lease is up here in September.  She and her daughter practically live here now that school is out and a 1bd place isn't very practical for a family of 3 with cats.  I pay 940 a month for my current place which is run by a larger property management company that runs most of the larger apartment communities in my area.  Most places require 500 down for a deposit, are pet friendly, do a great job maintaining their grounds, maintenance is great.  I'm just not a fan of having people above and below me or having to restrict my volume since I work midnights.  Figured renting a home might be a better deal, but I'd be dealing with an independent landlord, most homes aren't pet friendly, have a lot of rules, and deposits for most homes in my area will run up towards 3 grand or so when everything is said and done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking into manufactured homes on a lot because they seem like they're less of a hassle than a normal home.  I had previously looked into buying one but I've been talked out of buying a home on leased land. I'm also being told renting from most of these communities can be a nightmare. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan before the relationship was to buy my own home since I don't plan on leaving this area any time soon, and the housing market in this area seems like it's on the rise, so better now than a year or two down the line.  I've done some legwork already and could easily get an FHA with 3.5% down.  My credit is great so my interest rates aren't that bad.  I'd have just enough saved up to factor in a down payment with closing costs and and a few grand left over for emergency funds  for homes up to 150k.  I'm on the fence on buying a home with my girlfriend in mind since we have only been together for 6 months at this point, regardless of how well it's going shit happens.   My current plan is to rent something for a year while she helps pay some bills and pay a quarter of the rent.  The money I saved would go towards my savings towards a home.  I've been told I may qualify for grants or programs that assist with down payments and that PMI isn't something I should factor in for the long term, but I'm still learning the do's and dont's when it comes to buying a home and I feel like 3 months isn't enough time to start my search. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not too sure what the best situation here would be.  I can easily rent a 2 bed place in a shady area for 600 a month, or we can stay close to work and school and rent a townhome for 1100 a month or a home for 1200-1600 a month, or I could just jump head first into buying my first home since mortgage payments would ultimately be less than what it would cost to rent something with the standards I'm looking for.",finance

There are many cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied [Batson v. Kentucky](https://casetext.com/case/batson-v-kentucky) in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule [Auer v. Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auer_v._Robbins) and [Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/325/410/), which direct courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the [Lanham Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act)’s prohibition on the federal registration of “immoral” or “scandalous” marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

###UPDATES:

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Held: All of the relevant facts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.

**North Carolina Dept. of Revenue v. Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust** ^^^[shout ^^^out ^^^to ^^^anybody ^^^studying ^^^for ^^^REG]

&gt;Held: The presence of in-state beneficiaries alone does not empower a State to tax trust income that has not been distributed to the beneficiaries where the beneficiaries have no right to demand that income and are uncertain to receive it. 

**Rehaif v. United States**

&gt;Held: In a prosecution under §922(g) and §924(a)(2), the Government must prove both that the defendant knew he possessed a firearm and that he knew he belonged to the relevant category of persons barred from possessing a firearm. 

**Knick v. Township of Scott**

personalfinance,An inescapable financial disaster,"My car broke down for the 2nd time in a week, it keeps overheating and nobody seems to be able to figure out why.

And as of right now, this car has become my money maker because I drive Uber and Lyft. Because I accepted a new job that while has much room for advancement, I took a huge pay cut with a focus on the long term supposed financial gains I’ll make in my field. Plus my last job was a dead end job that I absolutely hated. I picked up Uber and lyft to make up for the pay cut but now my car keeps acting up

With my new job I’m in, I make $1200 a month after taxes, and I can’t find a 2nd job because they all only pay $8 an hour, and anything better than that, you “have to know somebody,” And my schedule is so funky with my job that getting a 2nd job would create constant scheduling conflicts. That’s why Uber and Lyft were appealing to me, I drive around my work schedule and I increased my income to $3600 a month

It’s becoming cost prohibitive to keep it running, but I can’t buy a new car because I’m almost $10k underwater and they pretty much want that much as a down payment in order to make that happen.

devops,Cloud Kubernetes clusters with on-premises data store,"Here's the situation: client wants to have their application layer in federated Kubernetes clusters running on cloud providers (various regions of AWS and GCP). Due to legal requirements, the data must be stored on-premises in different regions depending on where the user is (e.g. a user in Germany can connect to any of the application layer Kubernetes clusters in the world, but their data must be routed to an on-premises cluster somewhere in Western Europe). These on-premises clusters have multiple distributed services, such as MySQL NDB Cluster and HDFS, so there is obviously some load-balancing needed between the nodes in these clusters. So, the flow would look something like this:

1. User tries to visit application page. DNS health/latency checks direct user's query to most appropriate K8S cluster on a public cloud provider.

For step 5, what's the best way to load balance these requests, and to secure the nodes in the on-premises datacenter? Ideally, not every node would have a public IP that could be accessed externally.

personalfinance,Advice prior to starting medical school.,"Hello,

New to r/personalfinance here, but I guess the best time to start is ""now""!

I am a 25M,  starting medical school in New York on 7/1. I will be taking out federal unsubsidized loans totalling \~$95k a year with \~7.5% interest.

&amp;#x200B;

In the mean time, between now and 7/1, I have a total of $5,000 cash for personal use until I receive my loans, and $25,000 in savings.  To note,  I am uninterested in loan forgiveness programs at this time, meaning I'll total roughly $500,000 in debt after I graduate as a doctor, making on average $300,000 a year based off annual income for emergency physicians (it is what I plan on specializing in for the time being, but of course this is subject to change)

For those who have been or know people who have been in similar situations:

1. What can I do with my $25,000 for the time being? invest?
2. How should I go about budgeting my yearly expenses when I begin to receive my loans? Because of the debt I will accrue, should I never use my loan money to enjoy myself on weekends/etc?
3. Do you have any tips on how I can be prudent with my financial decisions to best help me  retire early?",finance

I have been given strictly loans (federal unsubsidized &amp; grad plus) from my school and am wondering the best way to approach financing my education. I thought I should be conservative with loans early on and rely on my savings (e.g. take out 70k in loans in year 1 and use 20k from savings). My rationale is that the loan interest will accrue more slowly by taking fewer loans earlier on and rely more on loans the further I get in my educations. I’d like to keep at least 10k in savings and not even touch my retirement savings.

personalfinance,Preparing to Move Out,"Throwaway because I don't need my friends knowing all about my financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

25M currently live at home and am planning to move out of the house next year with my girlfriend. She is also living at home while finishing her second degree; she has one semester left. Because I live at home, I don't have to pay rent/utilities/groceries/internet/cable/etc. so I want to be prepared for everything that will come with moving out, while also maximizing my benefits from investing.

&amp;#x200B;

We plan on looking for places after her graduation in December. We will most likely move into an apartment in a city. We could probably get a 1bed1br for \~$700-$800/month (with all of the things we would want: location, living space, parking space, gym, etc.) so split between us, our rent would be $350-$400/month/person.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I am wondering where I should move money around to increase the amount in my ""leftover"" fund for the new expense when I move out, while also maintaining good  investment practices. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Income** = \~$2400/month after:

* Taxes
* 401k (17% Roth and 5% Traditional = 22% total + 3% company match), current value = $9k
* Parking ($50/month before taxes)

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Expenses**:

* Car Loan
   * How much I am paying = $400/month
   * Required payment = $190/month over 5 years
   * Total remaining owed = $8.5k
   * Interest rate = 4.45%
* Student Loans (4 different loans with different interest rates)
   * How much I am paying = $300/month
   * Required payment = $80/month
   * Total remaining owed = $7.5k
   * Highest interest rate = 4.04%
* Personal Roth IRA
   * How much I am paying = $500/month
   * Current value = $9k
* High-yield savings at 2.25% (Emergency fund)
   * How much I am paying = $500/month
   * Total value = $4.5k
* Car Insurance
   * How much I am paying = $90/month
* Gas
   * How much I am paying = $70/month
* Leftover cash
   * Comes out to about $400/month
   * I stick to this pretty well to spend on fun and save some. I give myself a $1k cushion and am slowly building this up for the move out.
   * Current value of checking account = $2k

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**:

* Should I be putting more money into my emergency fund/loans before my retirement funds?
   * Should I stop maxing out my Roth IRA or lower my 401k contribution (I have lost a lot of money this year)?
* How high should I build up my emergency fund for a 25M who will move out soon?
   * My aim was 10k but should i stop putting into it after that or go for 15k?
* Should I change the percentages of my 401k to put more in traditional than roth?",finance

personalfinance,Do I stop 403(b) contributions to pay off debt?,"Hi everyone!

I'm happy to be apart of this community and wanted to pick your brains on a specific question I have been having about stopping unmatched 403(b) S &amp; P 500 Index Fund contributions to pay off debt of 20k with a 9.19%, and 65k with a 6.29% interest loans.

**Life Situation:** Single, no dependents, California USA, age 32

**FIRE Progress:** Brand new to FI/RE, learning a lot, and adjusting my life accordingly!

**Gross Salary/Wages:** 65k annually gross, \~47k annually net

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** 403(b) john Hancock managed S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, has 3k in it currently, on track for 7k annually contributing to it. This is UNMATCHED by my current employer and I am currently looking for jobs that provide a matching 401k plan.

**Other Ordinary Income:** Tutoring, which provides $240-480/month and occasional house and dog sitting that provides a few extra hundred dollars a month sporadically.

**Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation:** Rent costs about 800/month.

**Current expenses:** Living costs are about 1,750 including rent, bills, food, etc. and loans payments are a 1,377 minimum of month for tiny house that I bought, so around $3,125/month. However, I am working to aggressively increase my loan payments in order to avoid interest payments and am ultimately striving for 2,500/month towards my loans + 1,750 for living expenses so $4,250/month in expenses. I am working towards picking up side hustles, etc, to help supplement my income to do this and also considering increasing my hours at work, which has a gross $70/hour pay rate and is approximately net $54/hour after taxes and 403(b) contributions as another option to pay the loans off but not have to stop my 403b contributions.

**Expected ER expenses:** I don't know what ER expenses are.

**Assets:** 10 year old car that is paid off, few thousand dollars in my savings.

After I pay off my 85k in loans I will own my tiny house free and clear, which is valued at approximately $90-100k.

**Liabilities:** Tiny House Loan: original amount of $65,000 with a 6.29% interest rate with a 7 year length and monthly payment of $958/month. Current balance is $63,762 and just started in April 2019. With full-term amortization interest paid will total $15k.

Personal Loan (also used for tiny house): original amount of $20,000 with a 9.19% interest rate and a 5 year term with monthly payment of $418/month. Current balance is $19,777 and just started in May 2019. With full-term amortization interest paid will total $5k.

If I run both loans full-term I will pay $20k in interest above and beyond the original amount of 85k, for a total of $105k.

If I paid $827/month towards the 20k loan and $950/month towards the 65k loan I could have the 20k loan done by 10/2021 and will have paid about 2k in interest on it. I could then put all payments ($1,777/month) into the 65k loan and have that done by 10/2023 and will have paid 11k in interest. So 13k in interest over 4 years to have both paid off.

Otherwise I could pay $1,550 towards the 20k (while maintaining the $950/month to the 65k) and have the 20k loan done by 08/2020 and paid 1k in interest, and then all payments into the 65k at 2,500 a month and have that done by 08/2022 and paid 4k in interest. so 5k in interest over 3 years to have both paid off.

**Specific Question(s):** My contributions to my retirement 403(b) fund are approximately $300 per pay period, so $600 per month. I wondering if I should stop or reduce my 403(b) contributions and put those funds into paying off first the 9.19% loan and then the 6.29% loan to reduce the total interest I will pay. I want to be done with the loans so that I can then put the extra money into my pre-tax 403(b), but I am also worried about the opportunity cost of stopping contributions to do so. Can someone please help me figure out the math as to what makes the most FI/ER sense here? If I should continue with my 403b contributions and perhaps pay off the loans in approximately half their scheduled time and pay maybe 10-13k in interest on the loans? Or should I throw everything I have at the loans and then restart contributions after two or three years to pay the least amount of interest possible? Or some kind of solution in between?

investing,Can someone explain the impact of the Fed Balance Sheet?,"Not sure if appropriate here but curious to know if anyone can explain what the impact of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is on the market?

From what I understand if the Fed reduces the size of the balance sheet (through Quantitative Tightening) then the effective level of the Fed's liquidity (reserves) also decreases. This reduces the power of the Fed to inject liquidity into the market by buying up assets? (But can't the Fed just ""expand the balance sheet"" again? By issuing more notes and using those notes to buy more securities? I'm guessing the issue is that the balance sheet can only be expanded so many times before hyper-inflation?)

personalfinance,Should I dip into emergency fund to pay student loan interest?,"Hello everyone! Brand new to the sub and new to personal finance so please forgive me for my ignorance/lack of basic knowledge as I'm still trying to get the basics down. Also so sorry about the block of text below!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 23 (single, living on my own and family member lives with me due to illness) and just graduated from pharmacy school with 90k (including accrued interest) in direct federal unsubsidized loans ranging from 5.3 to 6.6% interest. I've accrued a total of 6k in interest over the past 4 years, and I go into repayment in January (my plan is to do IBR during residency and then pay off aggressively once I have a higher income). I'm going into residency where my base salary is 50k/year, and I plan to be in residency for a total of 2 years. I currently have 15k in an emergency fund in a high yield savings account, which accounts for exactly 6 months of necessary expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being in a residency program does provide me with job security (not getting laid off, etc.), and my plan is to put $500/month in student loans and $500/month in savings to get back up to the 15k emergency fund (if I dip into it). A few bigger unexpected expenses that might occur before I can save back up to the 15k would be car repairs/replacing my vehicle (would likely spend 5-7k on another car if mine was totaled), a family member passing away from a chronic terminal illness (I would be responsible for 100% of the funeral costs and subsequent loss of their $950/month income), or a medical/dental emergency (my max out of pocket for my health insurance is $4500). 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is should I dip into my emergency fund right now and pay off the 6k in interest immediately so that my next payments (budgeted at $500/month) will start paying down the principle? I am considering dipping into my emergency fund to pay the 6k in accrued interest so that my monthly payments will start going toward the principle right away, and I don't run the risk of not paying off the entire interest before it begins to be capitalized (Jan 2020). However, I know that having 3-6 months in emergency fund is incredibly important, and I do have some bigger cost expenses that *may* occur (worst case including death, totaling my car, and medical emergency in one year\~ 15-17k).

We’ve consolidated the high interest balances onto no/low interest cards, so now we’re just tackling paying them off and I’m hoping to find a tool better than manually entering into a spreadsheet. Thanks!!

Ps: any other newlywed financial advice or tools is greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Ally Bank - Notice of Withdrawal,"I've been looking into opening online savings accounts to house my emergency fund and a pet/vacation/whatever fund. I've decided to go with Ally Bank where I'll have two savings accounts and one checking, so I can easily withdraw the funds if need be. As I'm in the sign up process, Ally requires me to read the ""Deposit Agreement"" where it states:

&gt;""If you have an Interest Checking account, Money Market Account, Online Savings Account, or IRA Online Savings Account, as required by federal regulations, we retain the right to require you to provide us with seven (7) days written notice before withdrawing funds.""

Has anyone who uses Ally run into the need to do this? Isn't the point of having a checking or savings account so that you can readily access your funds when you need it?

personalfinance,"Struggling Financially, any advice?","I didn't take college seriously til I was 22 and didn't graduate until i was 24. I went into the film industry as a producer where i worked until 26, this was my plan the whole time - I love film and was my career choice. I never really understood money, as I came from a relatively poor family (however my mom never had to work, so maybe a lifestyle by my parents' choice).

&amp;#x200B;

I started getting paid $33k, after three years that turned into $40k salary. I lived at home and saved up $20k during this time. However, as my family doesn't have money I immediately became 100% self-sufficient paying all my own bills including $40k in student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized pretty quickly that there was zero growth at my company and I needed to make a career change if I ever wanted any sort of financial freedom (even the people at my company 50 yrs old were not doing well financially). I started a ""side-hustle"" which was doing well making me an extra $700 or so per month. I quit my job to do this full time and start a business - which had pretty significant success over the following three years. I had partnerships with Google, Airbnb, 3 employees and interest from investors. But ultimately at 27 years old everything crashed and burned when we lost Google as a client and I went an additional $40k into debt (now \~$80k total). Mostly because I never paid myself during this time and took out personal loans to cover my own expenses while building the company (per my business advisors advice).

My parents are amazing and paid off my business loans because they could get lower interest rates on their equity line of credit, so now I'm paying my parents back, but saving a lot on interest.

&amp;#x200B;

My company was ecommerce based, so I got very good at digital marketing and got a job as a Marketing Director at an Agency in Denver making $55k but no benefits as they were a very small company. I have a fairly nice car that I bought at my first job that I pay $330 per month (plus $250/mo insurance) which is crushing me but I've played it every possible way and getting rid of it doesn't seem to save me much in the long run (i'd save $600/mo without a car at all, but I live in CO where it snows and even going all summer I'd only save about $2400 which would be the downpayment on a diff. car).

I left my job last week because it seemed there's no future potential there being so small/no benefits/growth, for a startup that has 13 employees and recently funded $3MM. I will be working directly under the VP of Marketing, but being a startup my salary is still $55k.

&amp;#x200B;

I use [YNAB.com](https://YNAB.com) to budget but I'm not going to be able to make rent next month and I have $1k left in my savings and only $6k left in my IRA that I'll probably have to use to cover bills. I'm sure my parents will loan some more to get by but I really do not want to do that. I think I've made some poor financial decisions, but all of them in an attempt to grow myself personally, and even my failed business ultimately doubled my salary and future potential, right? $40k in business debt is cheaper than a second degree/MBA.....yeah?

&amp;#x200B;

I think my new job has potential but I'm going to be using up everything I have just to see it through, and I have no idea how to pay off this debt. I live in the cheapest place I could find in Denver ($1540/mo) and it's a studio apartment, however I do live alone but I'm 27 and single and all my friends are married/in relationships and I wouldn't even know where to start finding a roommate now. I also quit drinking/going out, and have no memberships/subscriptions at all. I spend a little more on food ($350/mo) just to stay healthy, and spend most of my free time cycling or at the gym in my building.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody else been in this situation/can anybody offer some advice? I very seriously want to be better financially but I just don't know how to start. Do I need to keep job searching to find something better than $55k? I really would prefer to avoid bankruptcy.

personalfinance,What can I do to keep my head above water and not miss a car payment?,"In February this year, I signed a finance agreement for a 2017 Subaru Legacy 3.6R Limited with around 32,000 Miles. With $5000 down, the financing is at a whopping 9.9% interest rate adding up to $400 a month (7 yr term) for the vehicle itself and $415 for the insurance considering my tumultuous driving record. The vehicle is in great condition besides a road rash on the front bumper that was there when I bought it. At the time I was working at a restaurant making $500 a week on average. Today I’m unemployed and have been seeking other restaurant employment but haven’t been successful yet. I’ve run out of money and I know that I’ll find a job soon but I’m on the verge of losing my insurance and not being able to pay my 5th payment since I got the car. On top of this I have a phone bill at about $100 a month plus a lot of surcharge fees for the points on my license and a Best Buy credit card run up to around $1000. However I do live at home with my parents and have not been asked to pay rent yet. I’m 23 with an average credit score and I’m looking for some options to keep my head above water for about 6 months with the car until I can make a financially stable decision that makes sense whether it be a trade in or refinancing.

MachineLearning,[D] Machine Learning Approach in detecting if companies are the same,"I have a very large dataset of shipment data where the company names are not normalized (e.g. companies that are supposed to be the same are treated different, like Walmart Inc., Walmart Incorporated, Wallmart, WalmartInc.). A simple string normalization like regex would not do good on this.

I have thought of TEXT SIMILARITY approach (Levenshtein Distance, Waro-Jinkler, etc.) which theoretically would work but would not do good in practice. One is that you should set a threshold and thresholds are different for each of them and various problems would arise.

Example:

1. Large and Short Company Names would skew the threshold: (Walmart Inc - Walmart Inc. vs ABC Co. - In behalf of ABC Group of Co.)
2. Almost similar company names that are supposed to be different (ABC Company Thailand vs ABC Company Taiwan)

The problem for #1 is that Thresholding for text similarity ratio is tricky.

The problem for #2 is that these companies have high ratio but are supposed to be different companies shipping different products (for example, ABC Thailand ships dresses while ABC Taiwan ships gadgets).

I have shipping data that looks like this

&amp;#x200B;

|company name|products|company postal address|country|zip code|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ABC Company Thailand|1x dress pink|Bangkok Thailand|Thailand|11100|
|ABC Company Taiwan|20x Phones|Taipei, Taiwan|Taiwan|00291|
|Walmart California Inc.|100kgs banana|California|California|9929|
|In behalf of Walmart CaliforniaInc|200kgs meat|California|California|9929|

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of a solution that uses TEXT similarity metrics but across fields that could indicate that they are the same company (such as country, zip code, even products).

&amp;#x200B;

My proposed solution is

\- a new entry is compared to a constructed table consisting of columns that are distinguishing features (company name, zip code, country for example)

\- the new entry is only compared using the company name. the highest similarity is returned. And text similarity across different columns on new entry and selected data is produced.

\- text similarity ratio/points of these two is fed to a classifier that tells if they are similar companies or not. Basically, the input for the classifier is the text similarity ratio of the new entry and the nearest company name from the list.

&amp;#x200B;

Any easier approach? The approach should be able to tackle both an existing large data and new entry (for example, deduplication does not seem to tackle addition of new entries). Thanks!",technology

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 24th, 2019","Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 24th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead: Stocks on track for best first half in 22 years  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/what-to-watch-in-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-stocks-on-track-for-best-first-half-in-22-years.html)**
*****
&gt; The fate of U.S.-China trade talks could play out in the week ahead, and that could set the tone for markets and the economy in the second half of the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks set new highs in the past week, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was ready to cut interest rates if necessary, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said trade and the global economy are two factors the Fed is watching.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track, as of Friday, to score a more than 17.6% gain for the first half, which ends Friday. If it stays at that level that would be the best first half performance since 1997, when the S&amp;P was up 19.4% in the first six months.
*****
&gt; The big event in the coming week has been as anticipated for weeks, and it could sway sentiment for weeks to come. At the end of the week, the G-20 meets in Osaka Japan for meetings Friday and Saturday.
*****
&gt; ‘Could go either way’
&gt; President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have their own dinner meeting at the G-20 next weekend, following discussions between their trade representatives. That meeting could decide how trade negotiations go forward, and whether the U.S. proceeds with another round of tariffs, this time on $300 billion in goods.
*****
&gt; “Everybody knows the Trump, Xi meeting could go either way,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “I think everyone expects a new tariff freeze. That the $300 billion won’t go into effect. The most you can hope for out of G-20 meeting is the tariffs are where they are right now, and there’s no more escalation.That also means China will not release the list of companies they won’t do business with.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said he will be looking for signaling from Trump and Xi on whether they are working on a deal that would be just on the trade topics, or bigger issues like North Korea and differences on the South China Sea.
*****
&gt; “I do think the G-20 is quite important in that there’s not question in recent months, the trade war started to really move into measures of confidence and measures of manufacturing activity,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Harris said he expects a positive message with an agreement of no further escalation, but probably not signs of significant progress. “I think the vibes coming out of it will be modestly positive,” he said.
*****
&gt; “Whether there’s an escalation to the next round of China tariffs is going to set the theme for the rest of the year. Even if tariffs on China are reversed, or partly reversed, at some point, every time there’s an escalation or temporary escalation, it’s another kind of blow to confidence,” he said.
*****
&gt; Harris said there’s the same risk as after the Trump, Xi meeting at the last G-20, where it was a positive tone but there was little progress afterwards and the markets then reacted negatively.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s been this broad increased awareness from every economist that the trade war is starting to have noticeable impact. Further escalation with China would be quite a big signal. If the Trump administration puts tariffs on all the Chinese products it roughly doubles the size of the trade war and it sends a very strong message that there are very few constraints on where [Trump] goes next,” he said.
*****
&gt; Powell and data
&gt; Besides the meeting between Trump and Xi, the market focus will be on anything that could provide clues on what the Fed or even the European Central Bank will do, after ECB President Mario Draghi last week basically promised a new era of easing. Consumer price inflation data is expected for the euro zone, and on Friday, the U.S. personal consumption expenditure data is released, including the PCE deflator, a major inflation indicator for the Fed.
*****
&gt; There are also a few Fed speakers, including Powell who speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “It’s probably going to be a big picture kind of talk about the broader challenges of the Fed,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They’re certainly going to ask questions about political influence at the Fed, and he’s going to dodge those. I think what I’m waiting for him to comment on is what it is they’re looking for to determine whether they’re going to cut in July or not.”
*****
&gt; Harris said Powell is not likely to say anything he did not reveal at his press briefing in the past week, and the big focus will be on the lead up to the weekend G-20.
*****
&gt; Falling interest rates and rising oil prices were two big factors in the market int he past week. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped briefly below 2%, a near 3-year low, as the Fed signaled its willingness to cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Should we get some sort of trade agreement that would be a nice pop to the [stock] market, but that could take the rate cut off the table,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the stock market will also be watching oil after its rapid run higher, and the events in the Middle East surrounding Iran. West Texas Intermediate futures were up more than 9% in the past week, to $57.43.
*****
&gt; “The old adage is every $10 increase in the price of oil takes off 20 to 25 basis points off of real GDP growth,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said stocks have had a solid run so far this year, but they may face some rocky times between now and the end of the summer. “For the rest of this ‘sell in May’ period we could be facing some challenges, headwinds. I think we’ will still end higher on the year. I think the seasonally optimistic September to November period will kick in but there will be a lot of challenges...will the Fed be cutting rates? what are the growth prospects?” he said.

# Big S&amp;P 500 Junes Drain Life from Julys

&gt; S&amp;P 500 is off to it best June performance since 1955, up 7.34% as of yesterday’s close. If yesterday was the last trading day of June, this performance would have been strong enough to push the month to 6th best going back to 1930. Looking back to late May, this performance is still impressive even though it was anticipated following May’s abysmal showing. However, such strong performance in June may not carry over into July.

&gt; Below S&amp;P 500 performance in June has been split into positive and negative tables. Each table contains July’s historical performance as well as full-year performance. Historically July has been weaker after a positive June. July averages just 0.48% after an up June compared to a gain of 2.84% after a down June. Examining the Top 20 Junes and subsequent Julys showed only a modest improvement in performance with average July gain climbing to 1.11%. However, even if July does disappoint this year, the full year is likely to still be quite fair as past positive Junes where followed by full-year gains 80% of the time with an average gain of 13.44%.

# Can Stocks Really Gain 20% This Year?

&gt; U.S. stocks could have a big year if LPL Research’s forecasts prove correct.

&gt; All year, we’ve maintained our fair value target on the S&amp;P 500 Index of 3,000, implying that we expect this bull market and economic expansion to continue. If the S&amp;P 500 closes the year at 3,000, the index will have gained 19.7% in 2019.

&gt; On the surface, that seems like a high hurdle for U.S. stocks. However, the S&amp;P 500 has already gained about 16% this year, so a rally to 3,000 isn’t far out of reach.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also hasn’t posted a 20% gain for the year since 2013, an unusually long stretch compared to history.

&gt; “It is interesting that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t gained more than 20% in any one year for five consecutive years,” noted LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Only once since 1950 did it go more than five years in a row without gaining 20%, thus if this pattern continues we very well might get to 20% in 2019.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day “Can The S&amp;P 500 Index Really Gain 20% This Year?” shows, it is quite rare for the S&amp;P 500 to go this long without a 20% annual gain. Could the streak end in 2019? Be sure to read our Midyear Outlook 2019, which is set for release next week, for more on why this could be the case.

# Prospect of Lower Rates Lifts Gold

&gt; As widely anticipated, the Fed did not change its target rate today. Instead, the Fed set the stage for cuts possibly later this year. Overall, the market’s response was a choppy climb to a modestly higher close. A more enthusiastic move by the market may have occurred if the Fed cut rates. Gold’s reaction was more favorable, finishing the day higher by over 1%. Generally, the lower interest rates go, the more desirable gold can become as lower rates typically result in a weaker dollar.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/06ee5a896971da25f3f06e3861567f44/tumblr_inline_ptd73ep0rI1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; In the above chart, gold’s monthly performance from 1975 to 2018 is displayed. Historically, October has been gold’s worst month and June is a close second. Historically, after weakness in June, gold has, on average, enjoyed solid gains in July, August and September. Some of this strength in gold is likely due to safe-haven demand during the stock market’s worst two months, August and September. Gold’s best three months, July to September, could easily be above average this year, especially if the Fed decides to cut sooner rather than later.

# Are Bulls An Endangered Species?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index closed at a new all-time high yesterday, the 5th new high so far in 2019. After May, the worst month for the S&amp;P 500 since 2010, June is up 7.3% as of 06.20.19, which would be the best June since 1955.

&gt; Much of the rally this month has been sparked by a more dovish Federal Reserve (Fed), combined with U.S.-China trade discussions potentially back on track.

&gt; What’s quite interesting about things now though, is many signs of investor sentiment are a long way from bullish. Remember, from a contrarian (or opposing) point of view, this can suggest there is still money on the sidelines.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 might be at new highs, but global fund managers and individual investors are quite underweight equities right now,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If you are looking for a reason this rally can continue, that could be it.”

&gt; For example, the recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch June Global Fund Manager Survey (a survey of managers who oversee more than $600 billion in assets) showed the largest jump in cash since August 2011. Additionally, equity allocation was the lowest it had been since March 2009, and the equity-to-bond allocation was the lowest since May 2009. Not to mention the allocation to bonds was the highest it had been in eight years. “Money on the sidelines might sound cliché, but it really seems to be the case this time,” said Detrick. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting more all-time highs, having money in the market may make more sense (or cents!).

&gt; Individual investors are skeptical as well, as the recent American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey showed more bears than bulls for six straight weeks, the longest stretch since November 2016. Finally, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, AAII bulls have been under 30% for six consecutive weeks for the first time since January 2016.

# Broad Strength in Health Care Sector

&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the fact that some of the ten best performing S&amp;P 500 Industries between the S&amp;P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20 were from the Health Care sector. It hasn't just been these four industries that have been strong in the Health Care sector either. The performance snapshot of the sector below shows just how strong the sector has been lately. While all six of the industries within the sector aren't up YTD or so far in Q2, between the S&amp;P 500's highs on 4/30 and 6/20, Health Care is the only sector where every industry within the sector has posted positive returns. Not even the industries within the Utilities sector have been this uniformly positive. The best performer of the bunch has been Health Care Technology, which is up 8% since the end of April and has extended its YTD gain to 36.8%. The worst performing industry in the sector has been Biotech which is up 2.1% since 4/30, and while that may not sound like much, it's still better than more than half of the other industries in the index.

# Best and Worst Groups Between Highs

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 made a new high for the first time in 35 trading days yesterday, many of the characteristics of the groups driving the rally have shifted. To highlight this, in the table below we summarize the ten best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 Industries from the close on 4/30 through yesterday. During that 35 trading day stretch, 34 Industries saw positive returns while another 27 declined.

&gt; Industries that have seen the biggest gains between the two new highs are primarily defensive in nature as all but three come from sectors that are typically considered defensive (Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Real Estate). Health Care has been the real star of the show, though. Of the sector's six different industries, four of them made the top ten!

&gt; On the downside, cyclical industries have dominated the weak side. When industries like Semis, Autos, Construction &amp; Engineering, and Air Freight are lagging the market, it really illustrates the presence of economic concerns. Leading the way lower, Energy Equipment and Services declined over 10%, followed by Semiconductors which were down just under 10% after failing at resistance on Thursday for the third time in a month. These two industries are followed by two industries (Tobacco and Power and Renewable Energy) that come from sectors that are traditionally considered defensive, but they have their own specific issues to deal with.

energy,When will CARB propose it's 2025+ standards?,"Hi all, so I know that CARB and EPA have fuel mpg standards set through 2025. And that there is likely gling to be a legal battle between CA and the Feds over the EPA freezing 2020-2025 standards at the 2020 level.

&amp;nbsp;

But what I'm actually interested in is when will CARB announce its standards for 2025 to 2030/35? I'm assuming these tbings have to be announced at least 5 or more years in advanced right? So will we see them soon?

worldpolitics,An Examination Of The Leftist Cult And Their Religion,"There is a common misconception among newer activists in the liberty  movement that the idea of the “false left/right paradigm” means that there is no political spectrum; that the entire notion of left vs right is a fabrication. This is not exactly the case. When we talk about false  paradigms in regards to politics (or geopolitics), what we are actually  referring to is the elitist class, otherwise known as globalists, and the fact that they have no left or right political orientation. They do not care about Democrats or Republicans, they have no loyalty to either party. Their loyalty is to their own agenda, and they will exploit BOTH  sides to get what they want whenever possible.

Beyond the globalists, average people do indeed fall on a political spectrum that could be broken down and simplified to a set of basic ideals or ideologies. On the left side of the spectrum, we find the collectivists and socialists, who believe that society (the group) is vastly more important than the individual and that the actions of individuals must be strictly monitored and governed to prevent negative effects on the group.

The core argument of the leftists is: “We are all a part of society and must act in harmony with society so that the system continues to function. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few…”

On the right side of the spectrum we find the individualists, sovereignty activists, and true conservatives. **People  who, in varying degrees, believe that society should be restricted from dictating the life of the individual and that group participation should be voluntary.** Where leftists seek to centralize, people on the right seek to decentralize.

The argument of the conservative is: **“Without the individual the group does not exist. The group is an abstraction created in the mind. When groups do form they should only exist to serve and protect the inherent rights of individuals, not be used as a mechanism of control by weak people who are afraid to function on their own…”**

This separation of philosophies is simple and easy to follow. Where things start to become confused and convoluted, however, is when political “gatekeepers” or globalist controlled pundits and media outlets get involved and muddy the waters. For example, there are some egregious misinterpretations of conservative principles in the mainstream, especially in places like Europe where the word  “conservative” is considered dirty and is barely spoken. Gatekeepers who have no loyalties to actual conservative values have attempted to soil the image of conservatives as a whole by misleading them down the wrong path or acting as false representatives.

Inevitably, these pied pipers try to lure conservatives to support leftist ideologies, like big government interference in people’s lives, or in the politics of other nations, or even in free markets. In other words, they want to sabotage real conservatives by making them look like hypocrites. But, the ideals of conservativism and centralization are mutually exclusive – If a conservative supports big government control, they are no longer a conservative. Period.

It is certainly the case that similar gatekeepers on the left side of  the spectrum are misleading leftists to destructive ends, but not in the same way that they try to mislead conservatives. **While globalists will attempt to trick conservatives to act more like socialists, they do not try to trick leftists into acting more like conservatives. Rather, they trick leftists into becoming even more extreme in their collectivist tendencies.**

The end goal of the globalist cabal is to eventually reach a point where EVERYONE in the world is a supporter of totalitarian centralization – a world where everyone is a leftist, whether they realize it or not.

How they plan to achieve this goal is rather indirect but potentially very effective. By pushing one side (the political left) to extremes, they hope to drive the other side (conservatives) to respond with extreme measures that they would otherwise consider contrary to their principles. To avoid this outcome, **conservatives must understand the root motivations and contradictions of what has become the leftist cult. To avoid falling into madness, we must examine the behaviors of the insane.**

It is hard to say exactly where the left began to migrate away from more centrist politics and go full bore communist. Some would say it started when the Frankfurt School of academics transplanted to the US during and after WWII, bringing with them the ideology of cultural Marxism. Some might argue that they have been this way since the 1960s and 1970s during the rise of the antiwar movement and second wave feminism. But if leftists were raging socialists back then, for decades after that chaotic generation there was at least some self-discipline among them in terms of revealing their true intentions outright.

I would place their transformation, or violent mutation, closer to 20  years ago as college campuses shifted completely away from a focus on practical skill sets and STEM fields over to hackneyed social sciences.  This was the moment that the conspiracy to completely radicalize the left was truly implemented.

Colleges became centers of worship, but of a new religion called  “social justice”. This religion relies on rehashing and reigniting old social conflicts as if they had not already been tackled by far smarter people decades beforehand. SJWs act as if America had never come to terms with slavery, racism, women’s rights, sexual orientation, etc. as  if all of these problems were boiling in the background waiting for the social justice warriors to finally grace us with their presence and  solve them. The reality is that while there will ALWAYS be some conflict related to these issues, there is no need for the existence of “social  justice” today. They are rebels without a legitimate cause, and so they create causes out of thin air.

Many pundits on the political left are careful not to publicly associate with SJWs and attempt to portray Democrats and progressives as somehow separate. And for some of these people, this might be true. But social justice mantras and disinformation have absolutely permeated democrat language and conversation. Gatekeeping media outlets like The New York Times, Vox, and The Atlantic have seen to this, as they flood democrat oriented web spaces with article after article of rant laden editorials presented as if they are factual journalism.

Many of these articles are written more like personal biographical accounts and anecdotal tales; each leftist writer clamoring to become the next Steinbeck rather than an objective investigator of facts.  True journalism is now dead in the mainstream – hot garbage factories like The New York Times and Vox killed it and replaced it with a Roman bathhouse of narcissism and iniquity.

The only job of these outlets now is to continue fueling leftist faith. Colleges made them zealots; insane devotees of the cult, but the media keeps them on the path and ensures they do not stray. But what beliefs define this religion beyond vague notions of “social justice”?   Let’s examine a few…

**Burn It All Down?**

While the Molotov cocktail was actually invented (or at least popularized) by the Finnish during the Winter War to help stop a massive communist invasion from the Soviet Union, it has now become a kind of symbol of communist rebellion in the West today. The Frankfurt School and Marxism, in general, teaches that existing systems are not changed diplomatically, but demolished violently through the exploitation of social conflicts. In traditional Marxism the idea was to use economic class conflict; to rally the lower classes to overthrow the upper  classes. Cultural Marxism relies not just on economic disparities but also racial and political tensions to bring down a civilization.

After the dust settles the socialists/communists seek to introduce their own “Utopian” system and take control as the nation lays weak and helpless in the midst of a complete breakdown.  When the existing system and government works in their favor and feeds their sense of public influence, leftists sing its praises. When it stops working 100% for them (even if only on the surface), they seek to tear it apart and remake it. These are the people you cannot play a game of chess with.  The moment they start losing they cry foul and dash the board to the ground in a rage.

**Everyone Is Born The Same?**

This notion is biologically absurd but it is gaining momentum in leftists movements.  Essentially, collectivists believe that all human beings are born as blank slates and that their entire personality is a product of their environment. While psychologists, anthropologists, and scientists from across the spectrum from Carl Jung to Joseph Campbell to Stephen Pinker have all shown extensive evidence of inborn psychological traits and inherent constructs within the human psyche, this evidence is utterly ignored by leftists as it runs counter to most of their fundamental assumptions.

If everyone is born different, then fairness in society becomes subjective and inapplicable, and only accomplishment, hard work and merit can be trusted to determine what is “fair”.  If people’s characters are not necessarily ruled by their environment, then this means there is no point in creating a social Utopia to micro-manage every aspect of our lives. If psychopaths are not made but born, then the question of inherent evil becomes a possibility, and according to  leftists, there is no such thing as evil people, only evil systems that spoil the minds of good people. If gender is inborn and the vast majority of people fall on one side or the other psychologically, not just biologically, then leftists can no longer claim that gender is a social construct that must be dismantled.

The blank slate, or Tabula Rasa, is a key factor in the leftist religion that must be defended at all costs. Otherwise, half of their  ideology falls apart.

**Everything Can And Should Be Fair?**

Anyone who has actually lived in the world for a while on their own knows full well that life is not designed to be fair. Some people are born with advantages while others are born with handicaps. Some advantages and disadvantages have to do with family and wealth, while others are simply genetic. There is nothing that can ever be done about  this that would not devastate our species.  What leftists don’t seem to  grasp is that perceived disadvantage is not always a bad thing.

People who struggle and overcome life’s obstacles tend to be much wiser and more skilled than people who never had to put in the effort.  **Leftists want to take away all adversity, not in the name of equal opportunity, but in the name of equal outcome.** In the process, they make all of society weaker, wimpier, less innovative and less productive. In a leftist world, humanity would have to create artificial “adversity  camps” just to retain its survival instincts. But then, of course, those camps would eventually be put through the fairness filter as well…

**“Intellect” Is More Important Than Experience?**

Leftists worship intellect as a divine power. So much so that the notion of real-world experience rarely crosses their minds as important in making decisions or forming opinions. When social justice warriors  talk of things like “racism”, most of them have never and probably will never experience or witness legitimate racism. They read about it in books and hear about it in lectures, but have no personal relationship to it. They believe it is rampant everywhere, around every corner and under every bed because they must. Their reality depends on blind faith that this is true.

The idea of social inequality between men and women also relies on blind faith in misrepresented statistics and fraudulent accounts of crimes that were never committed. To this day these people still argue that the “gender wage gap” is a real thing despite the fact that it has been debunked endlessly. This behavior requires a cult-like devotion to fantasy. It is not normal or logical, it is extreme mental illness. If  these people were to go into the working world and study real business models and talk to men and women who are not members of their own echo chamber, they would see through experience that their assumptions are  wrong, but when intellectual notions outweigh first-hand observation there is no hope of this.

**Conservatives Are Evil Incarnate?**

I started writing this essay in part because I’ve noticed a steady stream of articles in mainstream media outlets posing as studies of  “conservative extremists”. I figure, if they are going to analyze us inaccurately then we can do them one better and analyze them as accurately as possible. In reading some of these pieces I find that  leftists have created their own language completely separate from the rest of the world and reality. That which they interpret as “racism”, or  “misogyny”, or “fascism” does not fit the textbook definition of said  labels. They have developed their own bewildering vocabulary filled with made-up words and illogical concepts to describe the world in a way that fits their desires and supports their accusations.

Conservatives don’t live in this world and frankly, we don’t ever  want to. To them, we are heretics or barbarians. In their eyes, we are  the dirty untouchables, the “deplorables”. We cannot be saved and should be destroyed. Zealots always seek to treat ideological outsiders as mortal enemies even when those individuals have done nothing to them.  The fact is, most modern political crimes and genocides have been enacted in the name of socialist ideals; in the name of concepts, the left holds dear. We continue to suffer under these ideals in the name of globalism.

How many people have suffered because of decentralization and  individual rights?  not many, if any.  How many people have been exterminated in the name of the non-aggression principle? Answer:   Zero. Conservatives are certainly not evil, or extreme. But in the  twilight zone of leftist thought, we are the monsters.

This is why leftist behavior is becoming so incomprehensible.  Corporate behemoths like Sony, Disney, Netflix, Facebook, Google, etc. have chosen to force feed the public social justice ideology, and have placed their business at risk because less and less people are buying  the religion they are selling.  The same is true with companies like Gillette or Starbucks, which are willing to insult their own customer base and sabotage themselves just to preach the social justice gospel.  Why would they do this?  Because they see conservatives as a demonic force that must be erased from civilized society.  We are not even  allowed to be heard, otherwise, the evil magic of our arguments will mesmerize the masses and turn them away from the light of cultural Marxism.

Another more covert reason is that through the use of popular media and corporate influence globalists are able to exploit the useful idiots on the left and manipulate them into acting even more absurd than they already do.  And, by extension, they hope to terrify conservatives into throwing out the Constitution and going full fascist as a defensive response.  They are absolutely willing to bring down entire corporate structures to make this possible.  They are going for broke.

**The Leftist Gods**

The social justice embrace of Atheism seems to have left them feeling unfulfilled as their explanations of existence do not satisfy the innate human relationship to the metaphysical. As a result, the leftist cult is always seeking out gods these days, with all-encompassing  government filling in as a proxy for now. The next deity of the left is clearly nature, or “mother earth”, as this god satisfies their need for a vengeful and omnipotent force.

Many leftists desperately desire a kind of apocalypse, but an apocalypse on their terms. The globalists are giving them one, or at least a farcical version called “climate change”, in which mankind angers nature with his production and progress, but is smote down with catastrophe while the devout leftists watch on in their purity saying “We tried to warn you, but you would not repent…” This is of course fiction, based on junk science funded by organizations with agendas to  undermine real science and common sense.

The solution to this apocalypse coincidentally always ends up being more government, more control over human trade and progress, population  reduction, and perhaps even global governance of every aspect of life.  Otherwise, we might incur the wrath of the great leftist war god of destruction – carbon fed global warming. In the minds of leftists that will be the moment when we will all understand that they were the sane ones, that their cult was right all along, and we will come to them willingly, prostrating ourselves before their mighty intellectual superiority.

It is this type of ignorant thinking that makes the left an easily exploited tool for the powers that be. It is also the source of calamity throughout the ages.  Attempting to appeal to these people’s better nature is not going to help us as they are too far lost in their own dimension, and neither would using big government as a weapon against  them.  It is quite a conundrum.

My Civic is unfortunately not as reliable as I had hoped, and putting that aside I really did not enjoy it. I understand it's an emotional decision more than a financially wise one.

I make good money, but find I never have enough to do the stuff i want to do. My goal is to be able to travel a lot more now that I have a remote job. I have a girlfriend and a dog that I am the provider for. 

My rent is pretty comparable with the city, and I am stuck on the lease until august of next year, so finding a new place to live isn't much of an option at least for the next year. 

My car is in disrepair, but I still owe money on it so, selling it is not an option. My car loan requires full coverage no matter what.  

I also want to start getting on some health insurance, but there is nothing left in my budget to pay the 3-400$ a month for health insurance. 

I do expect to get a pay raise at the end of the year that will be roughly an extra 1000 after putting some away for taxes. Once i get my raise i want to increase my extra debt payment to at least 500$ a month.

I bought the car in 2015 and although I came in with a big down payment and a credit score over 700, I got rejected by many lenders due to an insufficient debt to credit ratio.

energy,Renewable Clean Energy,"In this post I want to play **devils advocate**.

**Question:** *Should we be spending billions of dollars a year on renewable and clean energy such as wind?*

**My Answer:** (Remember I am playing **devils advocate**. This is not necessarily what I believe.)

Investing billions/year into solar and wind energy production could be a bad idea.

If we spend that money on solar and wind just to turn around and harness the power of fusion or find ways to make power much more efficiently, then that money may have been wasted on outdated technology. (I am not saying only fusion. There is room for improvement in many technologies.)

By pumping billions of dollars into research, we could potentially leap well beyond the benefits that would come from spending those resources on infrastructure which makes use of current technology.

You could relate this to a financial plan developed to give lower class families a higher chance of success. Often times people leave all of their assets to their children who are often in their mid 30's to late 40's. Some argue that it would be smarter to leave that money and many of the assets to the grandchildren. If the grandchildren were left with 30 - 100k at age 15, then this money would be worth between 70 - 210k by age 30 and 100-340k by age 40 without any added contribution (5% interest rate). This would be much more helpful in pulling families out of poverty.

Of course this could be said no matter the level of technology, but at this point it does feel as if their will be far greater technology within the next 10 years.",energy

A bit about our situation:
-Both work full time, no kids, and saving/making enough to max out 401ks + IRAs after expenses

-We will have some income in the 22% tax bracket even if we maxed 401ks completely

-Just bought a house, have money saved up for our next vehicle so do not have any large savings goals ahead of us. We also have emergency fund in HYSA.

-Student loan debt under 7k, with interest rates under 4% so not a priority (no other debt beside mortgage)

-Wife is already on track with 401k contributions to max by end of year

-I am currently contributing 25% salary to 401k but did not start til later this year, so on track to put in approx 9k

personalfinance,Buying a House vs Renting and Investing,"We live in a HCOL area (Southern California) where rent for a 3 bed/2 bath house runs you $2,800-$3,400 a month. 

For the last 2 years we’ve been living in a home with a reduced rent rate because we know the owner, he wanted to move quickly, we helped him pack his house and we worked with painters/flooring guys to get the house “renter ready,” he wanted to rent to someone he trusted, and we take care of all property management needs (fix broken appliances ourselves, built fence around pool, etc...)

We are starting to really wonder if we should be moving up our timeline to buy a house, or if we should continue to rent at this location hoping the rent only increases a little bit each year (in two years it’s increased $250 monthly). Our two main reasons for wanting to move is to have a home of our own with a fixed rate mortgage to keep our housing cost consistent in an area with rising rent prices (our landlord is in his late 70s and we don’t know his long term plans for the property), few options at that low price point in the surrounding area (20mile radius), and to have a usable backyard. Our current backyard is pretty much just a pool, so it is fairly unusable most of the year. We’ll probably only be able to afford to rent or buy a 1,500-1,800 sq/ft house so a backyard with small kids (3yr, 1yr, and one on the way) is a must. 

As members of the Navy Federal Credit Union (through grandfather, not military or military spouse), we can qualify for a 30yr jumbo fixed rate mortgage at 3.375 interest rate. Here’s the kicker, we only have to put 5% down to ensure no PMI. Everything I’ve heard says don’t buy a house with less than 20% down because you want to avoid PMI, but with this you only need 5% (not sure if th3 catch is the interest rate rises so I’ve got to research that myself).

By February 2020, we’re looking at properties around $550,000, 5% down, property tax rate of 1.0706%, .1% Insurance rate, and no PMI. We will be able to put 5% down in cash and have enough left in savings to cover 6+ months of mortgages payments (closing costs + emergency fund). My husband and I are both 30 years old, and we intend to stay in the house 10-15 years minimum, I’d love to make this a forever home (the whole “starter home” idea seems like a huge waste of money to me), but I also want to be realistic and I don’t know how many people know exactly what will be going on in their lives 15 years from now.

Currently, our monthly income is around $11,000 after taxes, but this includes overtime (my husband is a firefighter/paramedic with 2 required “assign hire” overtime days a month and we add 2 more every month to save for a house). He will be getting raises over the next three years that will give him the same monthly take home pay, while only needing to work 3 overtime days per month. Our current monthly expenses, including maxed out retirement savings in a 457 account, is $8,430 without strict adherence to a budget (we could easily get it down to $7,500 by eating out less and hiring our babysitter less often).

My question is, since rent is slightly higher than what we’d likely pay on mortgage/homeownership costs, does it make sense to buy even though it would be with only 5% down, a little more than our current rent (which will most likely increase by 1-3% annually), and comes with all the costs of home ownership.

Or does it make more sense to invest some of our “nest egg downpayment” money now in other tax-deferred and taxable investments, slowly save for the big 20% down payment on the same size house that will likely be a $750,000 in 5-10 years.

Edit: We are currently debt free.

tl;dr: Should we buy a house even though it would be with only 5% down (no PMI), a little more than our current rent (which will most likely increase by 1-3% annually), and comes with all the costs of home ownership.

F, on the other hand, has over 100k in student debt because she went to a private college and didn't have any help paying for school unlike me. Now, we are on a single income because I'm in school. F is working close to full-time at a hospital making around 12/hr. After I graduate. I'll be making substantially more than what we're both making combined before we moved in together and before I started grad school. It's just the matter of getting there at this point. 

She has 2 private loans and a couple of federal loans. I'm paying the rent and payments on my car with the money I saved up but there's no way F can pay her loans, our groceries, her car payment and insurance with the income she has. 

She applied for refinancing through several companies but were ultimately denied because her debt-to-income ratio is too high even with her dad as a cosigner. What other options should we explore here? Any tips? Private loans are a killer but she just wanted to get through school like the most of us.

personalfinance,Need help with student loan amortization schedule,"Hello PF,

On mobile so formatting is going to suck. I have student loans through Great Lakes borrowing service. I’m making extra payments and I’m trying to figure out how early my loans will be paid off when paying extra. The website only tells me when they will be paid off if I pay the minimum payments. I tried playing with a stock template I found in excel but it didn’t account for two loans. These are the two sets of loans I have.
Set 1: consolidated loan- $23,112.19. Interest rate is 6.625 fixed. Minimum payment is $175.81. I pay $275.81

Set 2: stafford loan- $25,889.95

personalfinance,Should I take negative points on my mortgage?,"I'm taking out a 30 year $300k mortgage on a $375k home (paying 20% down). My interest rate is 4% even with no points. When I sell my current home a few months later, I plan to pay off $130k of the mortgage, and after that I plan to contribute an extra  $1200 each month on top of the normal payment to pay down the principal. According to mortgage calculators, paying like this will let me pay off the loan completely after 6 years.

I'm still preferring the 30 year over the 15 year though just so I have a lower monthly payment in case something changes for us financially.

Given this information, would it be worth it to take negative points on my mortgage to pay for closing costs?",finance

personalfinance,"Does anyone have any experience with “The New Hope” loan or any other special loan for low income, first time home buyers?","Went shopping for mortgage quotes the other day, and one of the banks I stopped at said I qualified for something called the “New Hope” loan. The qualifications are as follows:

* Income less than $52,000
* First Time Home Buyer
* House either in an area where the government wants you to buy, or home price does not exceed $150,000 
* Credit Score Above 620
* Downpayment of at least 3.75% (20% no PMI)

The loan is a conventional 30 year mortgage at a 2.75% interest rate, and no early payment penalties.

I was ecstatic when I found out I qualified for the loan, because a 2.75% interest rate leaves quite a bit of financial flexibility.

My relator though told me that some sellers do not like to work with programs like these because repairs have to be made if the inspection finds anything. My thinking if the rules are really stringent how would anyone be able to take advantage of the loan, especially buying in an undesirable area?

The homes I am looking at are below 150k, and I have 20% down so no PMI. I feel like I would be crazy not to try to find a home that fits the critera for this loan, if for nothing else to build equity in a home even if it isn’t my “forever home” (although I am looking for that).",finance

personalfinance,Car Dealer sent in 5 hard inquiries without permission...,"TL;DR: Nightmare car dealership misinforms potential customer and pings credit 5 times after being told several times that  we don't want to purchase a vehicle from them.


I went car shopping with my friend yesterday. They wouldn't negotiate price and just kept adjusting the monthly payment amount and trying to pressure her to buy/sign. They would write a random payment amount and say, ""Okay go ahead and sign next to this and well try and get you this monthly payment, but if you sign that means you guarantee us your business and you will buy the car."" Thankfully, she kept declining them, which was smart because they would waffle between saying ""we will get you this payment amount guaranteed"" and ""if you sign this, that means we're going to try and get you what you want, but we might not be able to"". The salesperson would walk away instead of accepting that we wanted to leave, and then he would come back with different monthly payments. They calculated her at a 21% interest despite her great credit. We only found out after going home and doing our own math because they wouldn't even tell us thre interest rate, saying ""that's not something the sales team knows, that's for the finance guy to figure out once you decide to purchase."" 


The salesperson ran and got his boss at one point who tried to convince us that there would be enough equity in the car for us to refinance and that she didn't need a cosigner ""because his kids didn't need one for their first major purchase and you should expect to pay a lot in interest."" He chastised her when she mentioned she didn't want to pay $5000 in interest over 66 months, and assumed she meant she didn't want to pay interest at all.


After finally escaping from them, the salesperson texted her from his personal cell, ""Hey, it was nice spending time with you today [person]. 😊""


She then recieved 3 more texts and calls from them within 6 hours of having declined purchase of a vehicle.


This morning, she woke up and checked her credit. She was upset yesterday because they ran two hard inquiries on her credit and she had only approved one of them. Turns out, they actually ran five total, four of which she did not sign or give permission for, nor was she informed of.

personalfinance,Student loans from GC services (Navient solutions) not on my credit report,"Hey PF,

personalfinance,Pay Off Mortgage or Not?,"I currently owe about $80,000 on my 2.875% mortgage that matures in mid-2023. Since I make about $1200.00 additional principal payments every month, I'm on track to pay it off before the end of 2021. As you might imagine, nearing the end of the mortgage, the majority of the payment is towards the principal and very little towards interest (right around $130 per month currently and decreasing quickly). So little interest in fact, that this past year was the first that it was not advantageous to itemize deductions (partially due to the tax reforms).

Excluding my retirement accounts to which I contribute the maximum, I have about $140,000 invested in a municipal bond fund which earns about $350 per month, which is then re-invested into the fund. (All earnings on this bond fund are state and federal tax free.)

So here is my question - 
Is there any advantage to pay off the mortgage from the bond fund and then rebuilding the bond fund from what would have been the P &amp; I payments on the mortgage?

Obviously, the bond fund income is greater than the mortgage interest so there is no significant financial gain for early pay-off are there any not so obvious reasons to pay off early?",finance

personalfinance,Student loans - pay them off vs autopay every month?,"So I'm having a hard time making a choice here. Basically I have about $40k in student loans and I just earned a bonus of about $75k. My salary alone (without my bonus) pays for my lifestyle plus 20% savings so the way I see it I have two options:

1. Pay the loans in full. I'd imagine this will save me money due to unearned interest but I'm not positive (it's a Stafford loan). My thought is I could pay off the remaining principal amount. 

2. Open an account and deposit cash equal to the remaining balance of the loan, set up autopay, and forget about it. 

If I go with option 1, I will be debt free. Sounds like a great place to be in my late 20s. But I wonder if dropping my credit utilization by that much could really hammer my credit score. Credit score isn't great as I was unemployed and unable to pay my loans right after I graduated college for about a year. On credit karma it sits at about 650. I want to get this up above 720 for buying a house in the future. 

If I go with option 2 I'll end up with a record of 10 years or so of on-time $500 payments. I'd imagine this could be great for my credit score in the long run but I can't be sure how to properly weigh this against the time value of money and the interest rate I'm getting from the us Dept of education (I think it's 6-7% on average).

With the HSA plan, my employer will also contribute $1,500 to the account annually.

personalfinance,63k in Federal Loans - Need Help Understanding,"Hey y'all,

I owe about 63k in federal student loans. I work for the government and make about 50k gross income, and will hopefully make a little over 60k gross income in a few weeks with a promotion. It's just me and I'm pretty young so I'm paying a lot in taxes. I just don't know how to go about paying off these student loans which I'm sure is a feeling shared by a lot of people. There's a lot for me to sort of unpack so I'll just make a list about the stuff I'm having trouble with the most.

\- One of the loans taken out under me was 10k all on its own with a 6% APR. This loan was taken out during a time where I was struggling in grad school and I had to withdraw from both classes that semester. Considering how large the loan was I'm not sure whether it was for that one semester or for multiple assuming I'd be back again, but I have since decided to withdraw from the program. It was a horrible mistake to enroll in the first place in hindsight. Is there anything I can do about it in terms of forgiveness or reducing the debt or can I only hope to restructure the loan?

\- From what I can tell from looking at my loan repayment plans I'm gonna have to pay like 675 a month if I use one of the approved repayment plans under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan. I don't know how familiar anyone here is with that plan I'm just throwing it out there because the information available online about it is pretty confusing, but I'm mostly curious about this: The plan has it so that I'd be eligible for loan forgiveness after making monthly payments for around 10 years, but would I be able to shorten that time frame if I just pay more per month? So instead of 675 I pay 1250 a month, would I be eligible after only 5 years?

\- Are there any resources that I should specifically know about when trying to tackle this debt? I know it probably sounds silly but I've just been trying to look through search engines and the website where I pay my student loans through but I feel like they are not providing enough information for me to understand what exactly I need to do, at least not concisely.

I'd appreciate any advice. Sorry if this post is a bit of a mess but I just have a pretty loose grasp on how to deal with this problem in general.  


EDIT: I also forgot to mention, although it might not matter at all, but all of my student loans were taken by my mother without me actually signing or doing anything, and I don't really know where all of these loans went to. I never saw any of the money and I always assumed that they went straight to the school, but part of me is worried they may have been used by her for whatever. Is there a way I could check and if so is there anything I could do about it?",finance
personalfinance,"Given my financial situation (included), can I afford some fun, or should I focus more on the future?","My wife and I have been saving for a few years to be able to afford a house and ultimately a child. My father passed away unexpectedly at the start of this year. He wanted to see a grandchild raised in a home, so I’m comfortable using what his life insurance paid towards accelerating our savings goals timeline. As such, my wife and I are signing to close on our first house together in a few days.



We have used YNAB to track income and expenditures for a few years. The below numbers are approximate. I have already subtracted out what we expect to pay in up-front costs for the house, and adjusted our expenditures to account for the new costs of living in a house and not an apartment.




**Assets:**

* About $45,000 in the bank. (Actually $52,000 but we’ll be doing some having some work done on the house before moving in, and we have to buy all of those little things that we’ve never had like a lawn mower, ladder, or hose.)
* Two vehicles in working order, no major issues expected any time soon.


**Income:**

* $7,835 / month after taxes (combined income).
* Monthly income - Minimum monthly cost of living (see below) = $1,315 / month.


**Liabilities:**

* Mortgage: $1,520 per month. (Calling it $1,600 because I haven’t figured in paying for trash/recycling and possible other small things I may be forgetting.) (Mortgage is for $243,000 at an interest rate of 4.125%.)
* Student loans of approximately $125,000 @ ~5.36% ( == sum of interest / sum of balances). Minimum payment required of approximately $1,500 / month. Paying off via avalanche method.
* Monthly cost of living has been $3,420, not including rent or student loans. We can definitely cut this down further by not eating out so often, but I’ll leave it as this.
* Total minimum monthly cost of living: $6,520 ( == $1,600 + $1,500 + $3,420). 


**Savings Goals:**

* Pay off student loans. Presently paying bare minimum.
* A child.




Given that we could cut our expenditures to $1,900 in an emergency such as to have a $30,000 (6 month) emergency fund, we have about $15,000 remaining, with a monthly surplus income of approximately $1,315. **I am writing to ask for advice as to what to do with this $15,000 + $1,315 / month.**



We are interested in a home theater setup ($3k+). We are interested in building a “catio” for our attention starved cats, and a nice one at that ($2k?). We’re interested in setting up a nice crafts room. We want to buy that $1,800 dollar couch that we just can’t seem to find a $500 version of. I’m interested in getting a dog now that we have a yard for the first time, and it is already fenced in. We have things we want to spend money on now, so that we can enjoy them for as long as possible. We’re also interested in setting aside money for a child in the next year or two. **In short, we’re trying to decide between buying some “fun” projects now or just paying off our loans.**




There are two issues that are making it difficult to decide. The first is that my father spent his life saving up money, rarely spending it, with the intention of using it in retirement. Then he passed, and I’m left realizing that my father spent his life working for tomorrow and never enjoying today, so to speak. This makes me want to enjoy today, but I need to be careful that it is not at the expense of tomorrow. The other issue is that my wife has been diagnosed with a fairly severe case of arthritis at a surprisingly young age. This affects us financially in two primary ways. First, if it worsens and she is for any reason unable to work, we’ll need to drop our monthly expenditures (sans mortgage and student loans) to $1,620, which will hurt. Second, every day she comes back from work in pain, and we often just want to enjoy the days that we have together. Sitting and reading with our cats in an enclosed “catio”, leaning back and enjoying a movie in a home theatre system, having a nice crafts room to work together… these are things that we feel will bring us joy in the now. We want to enjoy today, but not at the expense of tomorrow.




Should we use some of this $15,000 towards some “fun” projects like a home theater and a “catio”? We’re venturing into the unknown and hope for some wisdom. What advice can you render to us about our financial situation and future?

**Edit:** For some student loan math, I already have an avalanche payment calculator built in Google Sheets. If we only put $1,500 toward student loans per month until they are paid off, we'll pay a sum of $208,500 over 11.67 years, paying $40,603 in interest. If we pay $10k now, the sum of our payments (including that $10k) is $188,500, with $30,815 paid in interest over 10 years. $10k paid now is worth $20k over the length of that loan. I ran a few numbers and came up [with this small table](https://imgur.com/An3wwGL). I've looked at this in the past, and based upon it, am looking at putting AT LEAST $10k towards student loans as soon as the house is all settled. Because I always erred on the side of estimating myself as having less money, this should leave $5k+ for projects or paying off loans. So I guess maybe... one fun project, and the rest towards loans.


**Edit 2:** Ok, so looking at my own math developed during/after the writing of this post, we will likely be doing the following:

* Putting $10k (of $15k) towards student loans immediately.
* Using no more than $5k maximum for necessities and a few tools that save money in the long run (e.g. a lawn mower, a grill, quality pots and pans that don't burn all of our food)
* Using some of what is left over from the $5k above towards things that bring us joy or otherwise make us happy when we return from work. A few thousand now may be worth twice as much in the long run towards our student loans, but it's still a decade long journey, and we'd rather be happy during that journey. We'll repaint some (awkwardly high gloss) accent walls and probably build a cheap ""catio"", as happy pets bring us joy every day. This spending will be carefully considered, and the rest goes towards student loans.
* We will be reviewing our day-to-day spending and cutting out everything that we can. A significant part of our costs have been eating out; This new home has a proper kitchen and kitchen appliances, so right away we'll see savings there. We use YNAB to budget and track expenses, so we are already in a position to decisively reign in spending.
* All money above our $30k emergency fund will be going towards our student loans. **Is this the right way to do this?**",finance
personalfinance,Pay Student Loans Debt or Put Money in Roth 401k,"Hi, this is a throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about 32K student loans split between two loans; Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan of $10.5K at 7% and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan-Graduate of $21.5K at 6%. They are 10-year terms with fixed payments. If I were to pay the bare minimum fixed payments (about $370/month) for 10 years then I would end up paying about 45K (so about 13K in interest).

&amp;#x200B;

I give about 700$ monthly (15% of salary) to my company's Roth 401k account. Their matching is crap and only a 1/4th for 6% contributed (so basically 1.5% of my total salary).

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if I should lower my Roth 401k contribution to 6% (minimum amount to take full advantage of my company matching) and use the excess to aggressively pay off the student debt so save on future interest costs. I have my money split between S&amp;P 500 index and total stock market index (both vanguard funds). Unfortunately, I can't predict the return on those two funds to know if the returns are higher or lower than my student debt interest. Therefore, I am unsure where to push my money towards: retirement account or paying off debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I assume I would pay off the 7% loan first rather than 6%. They are different types of loans but I think interest rate dictates which one to focus on first.

Any thoughts from you alleged finance professionals?

I was thinking of lowering my Roth 401k contribution to 6% and trying put as much money to pay off my student loans as I can.

personalfinance,Defense Finance and Accounting holding 65k debt hostage,"Long story short, I owe roughly $65,000 to DFAS for an educational debt. DFAS is typically for military but in this circumstance, I am a civilian and have never been in the military.

In November 2018 I was removed from a college military training program. In January 2019, I received paperwork informing me that they were initiating a collection action for all scholarship funds I had received, and that I should receive a notice of indebtedness from DFAS within 90 days. Suffice it to say, I did not receive any such notice. I have called multiple times and been told that such a debt can not be verified. I have emailed multiple times and been ignored.

It is my understanding that this debt is accumulating interest as of the date I was removed from the training program in November 2018. I do not know the interest rate, as DFAS will not acknowledge the debt. Although their site does suggest that it will be ""based on the 90 day Treasury Bill auction rate on the day which reimbursement is determined."" 

I would just wait for them to contact me, but I am afraid they'll come back in a year or more asking for an exorbitant amount of money based on some interest rate I have no knowledge of. All I want is to start making monthly payments on my debt so I can stop bleeding money to interest, but no one I can get in contact with has any information about this debt. The site claims the debt is considered a contract debt and not an educational loan, if that makes any difference. I tried looking up if it were possible to escape with bankruptcy but it looks like it is not.

I'm fresh out of college and just started a new job, I have absolutely no idea what else there is I can do.",finance
personalfinance,Large credit card debt. Options?,"I had some mental health issues a few years ago and my financial decisions were pretty poor. I really sucked at budgeting. Then throw in thousands of dollars worth of old medical bills and foolishly putting that on my credit card. I owe $15,000. Tack on another $9,000 in fresh new medical bills (the affordable care act isn’t very affordable). I also owe about $15,000 on a car loan. Payments are made every month on time, there’s no issue with paying that off.

With the new medical bills, I’m freaking out more than I was before. I pay my bills on time and am paying a hundred dollars more than the minimum on my credit card debt. I don’t have any delinquencies on my credit report and my credit score is about 690 (it’s been growing). I’ll be setting up a payment plan for the new medical bills but what I’m really trying to fix is my credit card debt because I’m making my monthly payments, not adding new expenses, and my balance isn’t getting much lower. The interest is insane (I have a Discover It card).

Here’s what I’ve been looking into. I’m very inexperienced with this stuff so I apologize for my ignorance in getting a handle on this. 

-Personal loan with a lower interest rate?

-Call the credit card and try and get a lower interest rate?

-Balance transfer? I think my debt is too high for that and if you don’t pay off the debt within the introductory time frame, do you owe all this back interest or is it as simple as your APR going up to said rate until you pay off the balance? If I would owe back interest if the loan isn’t paid off, can I just transfer the amount that I know I could pay off during the low interest payment? 

-Bankruptcy?

Would it be wise to maybe see a financial advisor who can guide me through all this? 

Thank you so much for any insight.

Wanted to add: I will be getting another job (something like door dash) that will be work around my current busy work schedule. It won’t be much but anything is better than nothing.",finance

personalfinance,26 years old [70K Salary] &amp; ~45K in student loans + ~15K in other miscellaneous debt.,"Hey Reddit Fam -- I'm would really love some help from you all! I am a single 26 year old (turning 27 in November) living in Atlanta, working in IT and really want to get a firm grasp on my finances &amp;amp; credit.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

To start, I have always had issues managing money... But I have realized there is stuff I would like to have in my life that may not be attainable unless I get my finances together.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

So lets get to the numbers!

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Monthly Income after taxes: **$4,500.00**

Checking: **$2400.00**

Savings: **$0.00**

401K: **$5000.00**

Credit Score: **600**

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Debt**

Credit Cards: **$2,900.00 (90% Utilization)**

Student Loans: **$45,000.00 - 4% interest rate**

Car Loan: **$11,300.00 - 22.75% (36 Months Remaining) --- Would like to refinance for a lower rate + longer term, which could save me a couple thousand dollars, but I don't think with my credit that is an option.**

Collections: **$6000.00 ($4,000.00 was first Auto Loan) accrued during college (All of it will fall off by 2022)**

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Expenses**

Rent: $1450.00

Power: $75.00

Car Payment: $420.00

Insurance: $310.00

Student Loans: $170.00

Gym: $75.00

Phone: $150.00

Streaming: $35.00

Other Subscriptions: $40.00

Credit Card minimum's: $125.00

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Total: **$2850.00** \+ Spending (Groceries, Gas, Misc...) would like to keep it between $600-800/month

&amp;amp;#x200B;

First, I would like to get the ball rolling by paying off all credit card debt in the next 2 months... This would help me feel good if I ran into any financial emergencies. Also with my utilization being so high, I think it would provide a bump in credit score and possibly an increase in credit line.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

After that, based off my reading I should try to pay off my car loan first since its the highest rate?

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Please advise! Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

gaming,Why there shouldn’t be another ‘GTA:San Andreas’,"— Reposted, toned down the language a bit— 

KEY:
feasibly: arguably 
intercontinental: worldwide 
rhapsody: exciting
wit: jokes
treachery: betrayal
dubious: doubtful
hymn: song —in context: GTA SA Theme Song—
frolic: dance 
lull: safety
bohemian: alone
Contemporary: present time
muse: intended narration
pirouettes: circles
impartial: equal 
reprimanded: referenced 
mis-en-sene: setting 

Now look, I entirely understand the potential friction which may occur throughout this article, I’ll be sincerely frank during my analysis on the subject matter, even if I am barking up the wrong tree. 

𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙜𝙚𝙨
GTA:San-Andreas; the apex of uncharted narration, the iconic characters, and feasibly the birthstone of intercontinental desperado buffs. This virgin rhapsody of this thirty-two hour parable utilises the blend of slapstick wit, emotive treachery, and a magnified look into the life of a dubious apprentice recruited through the means of securing moolah, or liquidating mortals. Well... he’s better known as the abbreviated CJ—Carl Johnson—. This outlawed epic issued in 2004 takes place within the orange hue’d state of San Andreas, rooted in fragments of California and Nevada. Comprising itself through fictional fused metropolis’: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas inaugurated in 1992. 

Very few games compare to the jet-black static blared loading screen, in anticipation to the title card’s notorious hymn, through the use of the significant instrument known as the flexatone felicitated by a Hip-Hop metronome. Making players without hesitation jump out of their seats as they gleefully frolic in rap bliss; even making metalheads rejoice! Such conventions of gameplay are in conjunction with the infamous territory of Grove Street, plastered with individuals sporting the pea green attire. Then being met by Ballas, the frenzied posse distinguishable through their lilac regalia. Sending shivers down the spines of many gamers once in the proximity of the shoot-on-sight clique, ultimately triggering the players fight or flight response. —i flee’d...allot—

Assignments challenges the players ‘gangster’ as they are confronted with mortifying tasks as you venture San Andreas, also setting up great character development. One being the vulgar, but comical; Catalina, at one moment she lulls the player into a false sense of security, though shortly thereafter you are met with explosive fury as she berates your manner of living. Though the Bonnie &amp; Clyde-esque parallel will leave you wanting more! Including The Truth, an ageing hippie residing in the woodland plains of San Fierro. This bohemian of a character is most definitely memorable, drape’d with a rainbow tie-dyed polo shirt, as he leisurely blathers and gestures on about the welfare of smoking. And who can’t forget OG Loc, an aspiring—yet dreadful—amateurish rapper who will stop at nothing to seize notoriety, the pesky laugh, persistently broaching his stage name in all sentences. a memory worth forgetting. Loc was formerly a convict, shortly after landing himself a job at Burger Shot. Yet nothing compares to the humiliation of the Dance Dance Revolution styled missions, subject to Cesar Vialpando’s Low Rider event, and ‘Life’s a Beach’. Once misplacing the intentional arrow key, on-lookers slander your ability as CJ awkwardly stumbles. A fool’s paradise. 

Now this wouldn’t be an analysis without disclosing the viral sensation of internet memes and the out loud rhythm used to memorise cheats, I still remember to this day the Jetpack code, and will probably continue to boast such talent for decades to come. Varying in lines such as “You picked the wrong house fool!”- Big Smoke, “All you had to do was follow the damn train”-Big Smoke, and the illustrious “Ah sh*t here we go again”. Ultimately establishing the sensational gem to the contemporary generation. 

𝘿𝙞𝙨𝙖𝙙𝙫𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙜𝙚𝙨
Though setting the ‘fun’ factor aside, the question arises, at what point does fiction dawn a palpable civilisation? The mis-en-scené of minorities were characterised to rough-hewn tropes, depicted in a bleak light. The quota of GTA: San Andreas stimulated it’s muse rather as inspiration whilst glorifying the scarcity of opportunity and vile poverty, and the only way out being? Becoming a hitman, robbing stores, ransacking homes, homicide, drugs, gun violence, collateral damage, neglecting regulation, gang initiation/war. I could go on. This immediately draws parallels with the materiality of the modern era, kids dying every day, the sustained reference to GTA: San Andreas reprimanded by affiliated gang disciples throughout broadcasted documentaries. 

Stereotypes were toned down though subtly employed into the narrative here and there, in Rockstars most recent iteration ‘GTA V’. The first mission being Lamar &amp; Franklin breaking into the car’s of wealthy individuals. Though I can applaud Rockstars efforts in fair narration, as Franklin strives to depart from his state of affairs. 

In my impartial cessation. The utter facet of jubilation which pirouettes the ghetto, ridicules the true misery experienced by those in the cross-fire. Mockery will be scoffed to divert the actuality of the true horrors within poverty.",technology

This is a crop of strawberry plants that were planted in the system in early last spring. They have done OK but 9 months on I am about to remove and replant  them all because they have maxed out in the gullies and need some space.

My gullies are made from 6"" x 3 1/2"" rectangular white PVC tube which is usually sold for spouting downpipe.

The collection manifold was designed for 3 gullies but 2 is enough at the moment. This is how to drain the gullies without pooling. The gullies have a lip bent into the lower edge at the end so that they pour nicely.

Each gully is fed about 1-2 litres per minute of water pumped from the black tank underneath. The feed is not shown here, I can post a photo if anyone is interested. 

This is a reasonably well-behaved system although it does get a bit warm in summer and I have to fight off the pythium (root-rot disease).

I have a long history with NFT hydroponics, including designing systems for commercial use. This system was mostly thrown together from leftover bit and pieces.

personalfinance,Closing WF account and opening Schwab account,"Hello! 

First time poster here after lurking for a little bit, and as I just finished my Masters degree, I'm doing my best to educate myself to be financially responsible, as well as getting the most out of my money. 

With that said, I'm wanting to close my checkings and savings with WF I had opened while I was in high school. I see absolutely no reason in having my money in either of these accts with their abysmal interest rates, not to mention their horrendous business practices. I've opened up a savings with Marcus, and am considering opening a checkings account with Schwab. 

But I've got a couple of (maybe newbie) questions regarding this: 

1. I have a cashback cc with WF that I plan to keep. Is this still allowed even if I close both my checking and savings with them? 
2. SHOULD I actually keep this cc with WF? I have no other real reason to have this specific card other than the fact that I've been using it for years now. It's the cashback that suits me, I know other banks offer those... 
3. What is confusing to me about Schwab is their ATM situation. I understand that they offer rebates on ATM fees, but where do I even withdraw the money from? It's not like I could take money out from a WF ATM, does Schwab have their own? I don't really recall seeing one where I live.. 

It would seem that the one drawback about banking with Schwab is that I wouldn't be able to deposit cash. I teach music and sometimes my students pay me in cash. I know that there are workarounds to get that cash into the checking acct, but it certainly won't be as easy as just walking over to one of the millions of atms WF has everywhere. 

But I do like that a Schwab checkings come with a Brokerage account as well - I don't have any investments going on yet, but like I said, I'm educating myself and investing is certainly something I'd like to do, so having that brokerage account is definitely an incentive! 

Any general and Schwab advice, as well as some answers are much much appreciated! Thanks!",finance

Apologies if this is long winded but I’m not sure who to turn to for advice.

So, my dad has a brain hemmorage 2 weeks ago leaving him in a coma at the hospital currently with no clue of whether he’ll recover, pass away or stay in his state of a coma.

Before all of this, my father was unemployed and disabled (63 years old). He received unemployment and disability before and it is still continuing. My first query is what to do about his financials alone first. He has racked up a large amount of debt on his own name (5-10k), which he has been paying direct debits. I’ve cancelled them as money is tight and he’s in a coma, I sent out an email explaining he was and am waiting for a reply.

Before his incident, my dad took out about £20k in loans out on my mums name. Now, with 2 sons (me and brother), it shouldn’t be too hard to clear this within 2 years. Both being able to pay somewhat near 1k-1.5k per month in order to help out the house and these debts. Obviously the largest problem here is that the 20k has. 30% interest rate. Is there any way that I, a 19 year old student, or my brother, 23 year old Virgin Media worker, to get a loan or something at 0% where can can pay 1k per month. The 30% interest will leave us paying over 5-10k on ‘waste’ (interest rate) by the way it’s going now. 

Is there any way I can get loans for 0% in order to pay these 30% interest debts for my mother. I honestly do not mind taking on the 20k debt myself as my mother is unable to work due to her hand being severely damaged; however the 30% interest rate would obviously kill me 😂.

I don't need the Annual Fee metal card, as there's no way I spend enough on food to make that one worth it (I think), though I do eat out often. I'm sad I missed the original Savor card that got grandfather upgraded to the new one but without the annual fee.  


My credit was pretty bad back then (450-500) but I've been steadily improving it and getting my life back together. To me, getting this card is one of my home stretch goals that I'm in a good credit spot.  


Currently, according to Credit Karma (I haven't seen my FICO score yet), Transunion has me at 649 Credit Score and Equifax has me at 691. I've got a 6 year student loan that doesn't seem to be affecting my credit age on CK, however I used my Equifax annual report and saw that they have my student loan and my total credit history at 6 years+. The next credit history I have after that Student loan is 1 year ago.  


Here's what my situation looks like:  
1 Student Loan for 3k - 6 years - Missed 1 payment a year ago, enrolled in autopay afterwards. Considering writing a letter asking for it to be removed. It's a Navient loan.  
1 Secured Credit Card with a 750 limit - 1 year  
1 Secured Credit Card with a 500 limit - 1 year  
1 Personal Loan for 1,000 which does \*not\* appear for Equifax on CK nor on the Equifax official credit report (appears for Transunion on CK, but says I still owe a balance. \[I paid this off in full already months ago and have the receipt to prove it.\]  
1 Loan that I settled and paid less than the balance due when I was young and stupid with several missing payments. My first credit history. That one was opened in 2013, delinquency and closing reported on 2015.  


I've got about 7k on me right now and earn a ""profit"" each month after all bills are taken care of, earning roughly 2500 a month before accounting for bills and food. I \*could\* knock out the student loan immediately if I wanted, but its a fixed 3% federal loan and I feel its more useful to me to help me in getting the Savor card to pay monthly, and \*then\* I can close out the balance.  


Sorry its a bit winded, but I wanted to get some good advice for my next steps to getting this card. Credit Karma recommends it at 700 Credit Score, which is obviously no guarantee, but I feel I have a good chance for the 0% annual fee one if I hit the 700s. CK has me at ""fair approval odds"" for it at the moment. I realize I shouldn't take CK literally at all, but it seems to be a good guiding start.",finance

There are **12** pending cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule [Auer v. Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auer_v._Robbins) and [Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/325/410/), which direct courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the [Lanham Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act)’s prohibition on the federal registration of “immoral” or “scandalous” marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

###UPDATES:

[**United States v. Davis**](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-431_7758.pdf)

personalfinance,Better to pay off debts or take advantage of 401k matching?,"Details:

I've got about 40 grand in debt, mostly in the form of student loans but also about 3 grand in credit card debt. I'm pretty confident that it's better to take advantage of the matching than to pay off the student loans but I'm wondering about the credit card debt specifically, the interest rate is around 22%.

The 401k matching I get is an 87.5% match on up to 8% of my salary (meaning I contribute 8% and they add 7% on top of that).

Which one makes more financial sense? I know I'd ideally be doing both but I don't have enough disposable income to pay much above minimums on credit card debt right now.",finance

personalfinance,Small ($5K) windfall— credit card payoff or savings?,"Last week, I received a little over $5K from a class action lawsuit. I'm aware of the tax implications, so I'm good there. What I can't decide is what to do with this unexpected money.

Personal info: I'm 28, have a full-time job, and have $2K in a savings account and $17K in my 401K (I have maxed out my employer match). I have $6,800 in credit card debt that I am currently putting $470/month towards paying off. I'm also trying to put any extra money I have towards this debt, so I'm planning to put an extra $400 towards the debt this month (I have a separate checking account for automatic bill payments that builds up extra cash over time, so the extra $400 is from that). My direct deposit allocations are set up to put $650/month into my savings account.

I'm just having trouble figuring out if I should put the $5K directly into my savings account, or use some/all of it to pay off the credit card. This credit card is my last high-interest debt left (22.24%)...besides this I have an auto loan for $8K at 4.14% and a heap of federal student loans (I'm on an in-school deferment right now). 

I know the typical advice is to have one month of expenses in savings and then work on high-interest debt before returning to continue building savings, but my workplace has been going through layoffs in the past month, so even though they say the layoffs are over and I'm safe, I'm having trouble parting with this safety net. Any help in making this decision is greatly appreciated!

**Edit:** Thank you all, you convinced me to do what I clearly needed to do. I just initiated a full payment of my credit card balance of $6,847. I still have $1K in my emergency fund (I used the $870 I had already scheduled to pay and $1K from my emergency fund in addition to the $5K windfall), and now I can focus my energy on that emergency fund and will put $1K/month towards it. Thanks for all your advice, I really needed that push!",finance
personalfinance,Advice After Losing Job/Becoming More Financially Independent,"Hello all. I have a couple of questions.

I (23 M) semi-recently (in April) lost my job. Luckily, I had \~$3000 saved up in my bank after working there for 3 months. I was making \~$38,000/year. I currently live with 3 roommates - my partner (24 M, who makes \~$64K/year), and a friend (23 M). In light of this, me and my partner don't go out to eat, we cut down on frivolous spending, and in general try to live frugally. My next big financial goal is to save up a year's worth of expenses.

In a few months (late May), I got a job that pays $12/hour, 30 hours a week. The hours are flexible (I make my own schedule each week), and while it's in an industry I'm passionate about/would like to get into (horticulture), that industry doesn't pay too much. I am also currently looking into options to make additional income, whether this is getting another job in the field, or working something like DoorDash/Uber Eats to supplement my income. I plan on becoming more financially independent outside of my job so I can spend my hours doing more of what I actually like to do (which would be landscape architecture or managing a garden at a botanical garden/arboretum). Me and my partner have thought about doing this through means like house hacking, where me and my partner are thinking about buying a multifamily unit and renting it out to tenants in order to cover the cost of our house. Eventually, we'd like to invest in real estate, but that's a ways off.

In the mean time, I'm puzzled about some steps I should take. So here are my questions:

* I am confused about what I should do with my student loans. I only took on government loans, not private loans. I'd like to start saving money in order to have more of a safety net. When I lost my job, I applied for an income-based plan of $0; currently, that is what I'm paying with student loans. Obviously I'd like to be debt free, but I also see the value in having a safety net after losing my jobs. I'm currently thinking about applying again for an income-driven plan, and taking one of the lower payment options. Now that I have a job, how should I balance saving money and paying off my loans?
* In the mean time, while I have this lower paying job, what would you advise that I do? As I said, I've thought about keeping my current job and simply working another job/getting a side gig. I've also thought about going back to what I was doing before (working as a lab technician in a research lab), as you make more money off the bat. That being said, it's not an industry I'm passionate about, and I'm anxious since I lost a job doing that before pretty quickly. I've managed the reason why I got fired (ADHD meds/therapy are life saving), so that shouldn't be as much of a problem.

Thanks much for reading this. Let me know if I should supply any additional information.

Edit: Just meant to mention that at most, the interest rate for my student loans is 5%. Most of my loans have an interest rate of 4.5%.",finance
personalfinance,CC Consolidation to boost Credit Score for Mortgage,"Due to several circumstances, culminating with an offer from my employer (unfortunately the company does not offer any sort of relocation assistance) I will be relocating my family from Ohio to Tampa Florida.  We are going to be selling our home in Ohio and building a new home in Florida.  We have approx 8 months till closing.  We have been pre-approved through the builders mortgage company for the home and will have no issue, except that I would like to improve our credit score as we approach closing to get the lowest interest rate possible.  


Due to the short notice our 1 year plan to pay off our current CC debt is being put on temporary hold while we keep our emergency funds intact, create a  moving fund, and save the proceeds from the sale of our current home for down payment and closing on the new home.  


My question relates to how our credit scores may be affected by taking the CC debt and taking our a personal loan to consolidate into 1 payment.  The DTI won't change, but it will obviously have an impact of taking the CC balances down to 0.  Factoring in 1 additional credit inquiry should not overly affect things but my understanding is that zeroing out the CC utilization percentage will provide a decent boost.  Also, moving to Florida while we wait on the build to complete will free up approx $1,000/mo from the lack of state and local income taxes in Florida.    


In a perfect world we would hold out till the CC debt was at zero and then build our home we will make the best of it in the mean time and optimize the reality we have.",finance
personalfinance,Is this car loan interest rate reduction worth it?,"I recently purchased a car, financing out just about $48000 with an interest rate of 4.99%. It was through a credit union and in attempt to gain my loyalty they’re offering to reduce my rate to 4.79% which works out to approximately $500 over the length of the loan. 

In order to qualify I have to drive to the nearest location (which is an hour away) to open an account and then set up direct deposit with them to avoid a fee for having an account. 

Overall it seems inconvenient for the money I’d be “saving” which is $6 a month. My current plan was to make six additional payments a year and just pay the loan off faster. Am I stupid for not taking this deal?",finance

Bitcoin,6 simple ways we can all promote Bitcoin! Lets! Do! This!,"https://i.redd.it/7d8ns5xolb631.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

6 simple ways we can all promote Bitcoin!

&amp;#x200B;

From the easiest and most passive to the most labour intensive method:

(1) Put a ""Use Bitcoin, Fiat is Dead!"" Logo Sticker on the side and/or back of your car. With only a minimal one off effort, whenever you are driving around you will be promoting Bitcoin! (Can also paste sticker to mum/dad/brother/sister/wife/husband/gf/bf/nephew/grandparents/neighbours/employees car to yield multiplier effect)

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Whenever you see or use a cash machine, put a Bitcoin sticker there. People will see it, and through time, the idea will register in their mind Bitcoin is money.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) When taking group pictures, hold out your phone which says ""Buy Bitcoin"" on the screen. Like what that guy behind Yellen did in the Federal Reserve meeting. When your friends share the picture on social media the idea will spread. Might ruin the picture but help your crypto portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) Whenever you buy something from a shop, always ask the cashier ""May I please pay with Bitcoin?""

Depending on the environment, if the cashier says ""No"", you may choose to add ""Well ok I can pay you fiat but I do want to give you something of value in exchange of the item I am taking from you""

&amp;#x200B;

(5) Whenever you meet someone new, introduce yourself as a ""seasoned Bitcoin investor"". Openly educate the people who want to know more about Bitcoin/blockchain from you. Do try not to enter into any argument, just ignore the people who sneer at you, especially if they are jealous or clueless.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) Whenever you are on crowded public transport such as a bus or a train, speak on the phone loudly including sentences such as:

""Yes I totally understand about the intrinsic value of Bitcoin, I am buying two more this week"",

""Yes I know Bitcoin price can fluctuate quite a bit, but it is a real asset unlike the USD, GBP or EUR where their issuers are loaded with trillions of debt""

""Bitcoin is up 800% since two years ago, which other asset will give you that kind of return?""

This is the last and least recommended method as an imaginary conversation really is difficult to perform all the time and you are only heard by 20 people max at any one time. Where as the car sticker method is the best and yields the highest effect.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Inheritance and debt,"Hey, almost 30 year old married male looking for some advice.

Wife and I have a decent household income but like many folks our age we came into the relationship with debts.

I have ~$30k in student loan debt remaining at I believe 3.5% interest, paying roughly $400-500 a month on this.

I also have a car loan with about $22k remaining - just purchased earlier this year and I pay about $350 a month on this, I believe interest is around 4.5%

My wife has about $10k in debt owed to her father at an unknown interest rate but paying $500 per month.

I had a relative pass away and left me $60k.  My mother (was her sister that passed) wants me to save at least half for a rainy day or growing it but I am torn.

I could pay off our entire debt and increase our cash flow significantly (don’t have cash flow issues now, we live modestly).  Issues or not, $1350 per month additional cash flow is very significant..  on the other hand $60k is also very significant.  

Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: thanks for the quick responses, interest rate on my wife’s debt is an impossible figure to acquire. I don’t think he even knows (her father).  I’d estimate it’s reasonable though 3-4%.

We do have a rainy day fund, I have about $7k in savings, wife has about $3k and in our joint we have about $3k.  We don’t live beyond our means but I do enjoy technology and we do a big trip (camping, but usually other side of the country) at least once a year.

I think the company will continue to do well, and am planning on keeping the shares, at least for long term capital gains, instead of selling them right away.

The federal AMT seems completely unavoidable to me, since even if I exercised as many shares as I could without hitting AMT each year, my options would expire before I could exercise them all.

The plans I've come up with so far are to either exercise my options over the next couple years and just pay state/federal AMT each year, or to leave the company and exercise all my options at the beginning of a year (and not work for the rest of that year) so that my tax rate would be as low as possible.  In addition to this second plan, I'm considering moving to a state with no income tax (like Nevada) to try and avoid the state AMT as well.

personalfinance,Car Lease Help Needed,"Hello, everyone.  


I got a leased Toyota Corolla in July 2016 from Toyota Financial. I was unable to buy a used car because I had only just started making money at a job. Since I had no credit history, my mom cosigned the lease. If it matters, I was 22 years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

In April 2018, I got into a car crash that totaled the Corolla. My insurance refused to pay for the car repairs or for a replacement for the car.  My credit was still not good so I bought a car with an extremely high interest rate (26%APR) in May 2018 to drive to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is now June 2019, and the car has finally been inspected by Toyota. They will not be receiving the car back or making repairs to it. They want the buyout price, which is \~$12,500. They do not want to finance those $12,500. I have applied for the money through 3 different credit unions without a cosigner and been denied through all three. My credit score is tanked.  


Please tell me what to do to get on a payment plan for the $12,500.",finance

stocks,"A concise guide to shorting stocks, calls, and puts for new traders. I put this together for my own self-education - have I made any mistakes?","**Going Long on Stocks**

Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up.

When you buy a share, you create a sort of contract with a stock exchange that is then stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Long means ""up is good; down is bad"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting a stock**

Shorting a stock is the opposite going long; if the price goes down when you're short on a stock, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works¹: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.

¹: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. To quote @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;When you short, you borrow the stock, not the cash. Let's say you short 100 shares of DIS, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account, the broker then sells the other person's 100 shares of DIS, and then, gives you the cash which goes into your account. You then are on the hook to re-purchase 100 shares of DIS at some point in the future (called covering your short). If DIS goes down, then, you repurchase at a lower price and therefore make money.

When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Short means ""up is bad; down is good"".  Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Purchase Stock`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)`

&amp;#x200B;

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on the direction of a stock's price. Note that ""selling"" without a share to sell is ""shorting"".

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**Limit/Stop Orders**

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Stop Order`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD (price action) [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png](https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

A notable comment from @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;As an FYI, I've never seen anyone use this type of order among professional investors….just not the way people think. Most analysts/PMs at institutions are not buying based on momentum. This type of order might be used more by programmatic/algorithmic funds.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value by a specific time, you profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Going long with a call option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or call it into your wallet - for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the option game looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png](https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Going short with a put option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.

Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments.

Here's what an option contract looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $200 [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Once you hold an option, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on price and time in a way that limits our losses and leverages our capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.

Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. $TSLA is currently trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more - stocks have no time limits)
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

It looks like the $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400–225) \* 285 or \~$50,000
* My max loss is $10,000–100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

&amp;#x200B;

Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my ""contract"", in this case:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $TSLA`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $221`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $225 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 285`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: December 20th`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $10,000`

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Why can't I afford affordable housing?,"Hi PF,

I (24M) am currently living with my parents, but I'm looking to rent my own apartment.  I work as a lab tech in the biology field for a major university in the upper midwest.  I make $39k/year, but I have to pay $135/mo for parking at my work, so it's really more like 37.5k/year.  I was looking at income-restricted housing nearer to my job, and almost all of the units have an income cap of $42k/year gross, which I am close to.  However, the rent for these units is $1060/month, which is about half my take home.  The major utilities are included, but parking isn't, and would cost another $80/month.  If I were to rent one of these units, my monthly budget would look like this:


Salary:  $3250

 
Pre-tax Expenses:

State and federal taxes:  $545

Mandatory state pension contributions:  $190

Medical and dental insurance:  $70

Parking (work):  $135

 
Post-tax expenses:

Rent:  $1060

Roth IRA Contribution:  $500

Parking (apartment):  $80

Car insurance and gas:  $100

Renter's insurance:  $15

Food:  $300

Internet:  $50

Cell Phone:  $30

Total expenses:  $3075

Total surplus:  $175


Without budgeting for any other expenses and putting away the bare minimum for retirement savings (pension and Roth IRA contributions), I wouldn't even be clearing $200/month.  I don't know if I'm out of touch with how much low-income rent should cost, but I'm shocked that income-restricted ""affordable housing"" is so expensive.  My income is near to the restriction cap, but still doesn't put me in a financially sustainable situation.

Edit:  I do have an adequate rainy day fund saved up, so I haven't included building that up in my budget.

Edit 2:  Added renter's insurance to budget

Edit 3:  Looks like I should try for roommates if I want to keep my savings on track.",finance

I don't estimate needing a lot of money for food since I'm provided with a base meal plan from the school that would cover about half of my meals. So let's say I have $450.00 every two weeks to play with, or $900 a month. Should I be throwing this all at the student loans, or mostly to Vanguard and keep paying only interest on the student loans? With $900.00 a month thrown towards my student loans I can get them very low before the NDSEG fellowship runs out.

personalfinance,FHR 203k Rehab vs. Home Improvement Personal Loan,"Hi all - I'm looking to replace my 50+ year old oil boiler/furnace with a new natural gas boiler, as the local gas company is finally coming down my street. I do not have the cash tucked away to pay for this straight up - I'm looking at cost estimates of just under $10k. Unfortunately, I am just over 2 years in my new home and don't have a ton of equity in it yet, so a regular Home Equity Loan (or Line of Credit) isn't an option. I'm a few years out from a divorce where the ex kept the house and I started over building up equity again. Which is another story, and fine, I have a really good salary and can afford to do so.

So, the two options I've landed on are an FHA 203k Streamline Rehab loan and a personal loan through my bank that is a specialized ""home improvement"" loan at a better interest rate (under 7%). The 203k Rehab loan appears to be a refinance of my existing FHA backed loan, and would actually drop my monthly mortgage, escrow, and PMI payment down from $1440ish to about $1140ish, but at the cost of extending the mortgage by 2 years and adding on $800+ in closing fees that get lumped into the mortgage over 30 years. The home improvement loan though would be for just the next three years at a little over $300 a month (based on preliminary info from the bank). I will say, the other downside of the 203k is that it has some contractor requirements and finding a good contractor that wants to participate has been a pain.

So... what is the best option here? Between the savings of gas over oil (I live in northern New England and spent almost $3k on oil last year - I'm hoping to drop that cost down in half), I would either be adding that to the monthly savings from the mortgage refinance with the 203k Rehab loan, which would give me some additional liquidity to apply towards paying off some higher interest debts, or I go with the shorter personal loan, at a higher rate, but over time I'll be paying much less. (Ideally, I could use the savings from the 203k option to pay down other debts and then pay down the mortgage earlier than the 30 years, but as we all know, that is a longer term plan that could be impacted by other life events... and having good discipline.)

Looking for any general advice folks might have on the better approach to help tip me in the right direction. Thanks!",finance

She is 50 with no debt and 400k in investments, 100k which is retirement etc. She is not married and doesn't expect she will. A year and a half ago she bought a house, and she regrets it because it's not right for her - either in layout or neighborhood but the market has softened and she estimates it has gone down by 10%-15% - she says she'd need it to appreciate by almost $70,000 to make up for the 50k it lost and the approx 20k in realty fees.

Or, if she is waiting for her own house to appreciate, which might take 3 years or so, should she liquidate more stock and buy her permanent/replacement house - 250k inheritance and 150k liquidated from her stock portfolio (she assumes if she did a bank loan the interest rate would be very high b/c she has a 375k mortgage on first house - so she'd like to buy it outright). She'd live in the 400k house, rent her current home and eventually sell her current home when it came closer to recouping it's loss (or hold on to it as a rental for years and years)

&amp;#x200B;

With the latest trend of interest rate drop, I started looking at refinancing to lower my monthly payment. The general rule of thumb I read online is about 1% rate drop to start thinking about refinancing, but really how does the math work?

&amp;#x200B;

The breakeven point most website talks about is the new closing cost divided by monthly payment difference. But to me, they all seems to be missing the fact I already paid a year (or whenever you choose to refinance) worth of interest. When I refinance, I will have to restart the loan term with new amortizations table. Isn't the accumulated interest something to factor into the breakeven? Yes of course I took tax deduction of the mortgage interest, but should that be factored in as well?

Am I nuts? Why doesn't any website talk about this? Is there a good calculator somewhere I can use to look the true cost of refinancing?

**Going Long on Stocks**

Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up.

When you buy a share, you create a sort of contract with a stock exchange that is then stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Long means ""up is good; down is bad"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting a stock**

Shorting a stock is the opposite going long; if the price goes down when you're short on a stock, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works¹: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.

¹: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. To quote @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;When you short, you borrow the stock, not the cash. Let's say you short 100 shares of DIS, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account, the broker then sells the other person's 100 shares of DIS, and then, gives you the cash which goes into your account. You then are on the hook to re-purchase 100 shares of DIS at some point in the future (called covering your short). If DIS goes down, then, you repurchase at a lower price and therefore make money.

When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Short means ""up is bad; down is good"".  Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Purchase Stock`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)`

&amp;#x200B;

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on the direction of a stock's price. Note that ""selling"" without a share to sell is ""shorting"".

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**Limit/Stop Orders**

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Stop Order`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD (price action) [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png](https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

A notable comment from @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;As an FYI, I've never seen anyone use this type of order among professional investors….just not the way people think. Most analysts/PMs at institutions are not buying based on momentum. This type of order might be used more by programmatic/algorithmic funds.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value by a specific time, you profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Going long with a call option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or call it into your wallet - for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the option game looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png](https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Going short with a put option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.

Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments.

Here's what an option contract looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $200 [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Once you hold an option, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on price and time in a way that limits our losses and leverages our capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.

Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. $TSLA is currently trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more - stocks have no time limits)
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

It looks like the $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400–225) \* 285 or \~$50,000
* My max loss is $10,000–100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

&amp;#x200B;

Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my ""contract"", in this case:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $TSLA`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $221`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $225 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 285`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: December 20th`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $10,000`

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering which will impact my credit more.

EDIT: So after reading your replies and reading other threads here I decided to do this:

I disputed the hospital bill because I don't think the amount is correct as before the debt got sold, the hospital offered to cut the bill in half so that is being processed. If it doesn't go through in my favor I will be sending a letter with an offer in exchange for this to be deleted off my credit...and if they refuse I will be requesting debt validation..and continus from there...someone correct me if this seems wrong.

According to credit karma, if I pay my credit down ~$1300 I will be put into the next bracket of credit utilization (0-9%) which should raise my score 40 points. This was a better option than paying all of it according to credit karma. (I'm not sure why paying some is better than paying all..can someone clear this up?) I paid the $1300 to my credit card and will pay the remaining in the following 4 months and hope to see a jump in my credit.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Debt 
- $48k student loans ($20k private at 5%, $28k federal at 4% average)

Assets 
- 20k between 401k and Roth IRA (contributing 11% of my salary, employer matches 4%)
- $4,500 emergency fund
- a very supportive boyfriend

Take home pay is $4,400 per month. I live in a moderately HCOL area and I help support my family, so overall, after expenses and paying minimums for my student loans ($650/month) I have about $1,500 to play with.

My strategy for the last 5 months was to save $1000 for my emergency fund and throw the other $500 at a loan above 5%. Now that that loan is paid off, I was planning on continuing this ratio for the next few months until my emergency fund is $9k (3 months) and then after that, reverse the ratio so I'm throwing $1000 additional at my student loans and $500 towards cash/emergency fund.

I know that the wiki recommends only contributing up to employer match and then emergency fund and then loans, but I feel like at my age, I should be putting more money away in my retirement fund since I only started when I was 31. Also, eventually my partner and I want to purchase a home and have a kid, so I want to build up my cash for that.

I don't understand why I should only be contributing to my employer match, is that a hard rule, and if so, why? Does my $1000 cash/$500 debt pay down strategy make sense for my situation? I always see people give advice to prioritize paying off debt, but does that make sense for me?

personalfinance,I'm (26) looking for advice on 401(k) fund allocations from (I think) poor options,"I just started a job which offers a 401(k) through Edward Jones/ADP.

* Employer match: 4%
* Living situation: No debt. Still at home, but I live in a LCOL area so I would like to move out soon. 


I intend to allocate 10% total (6% mine + 4% match). Comments on this % are welcome, though.  

I’m not well-versed in fund allocations, etc., but I am fairly sure my options are poor. I was given an information packet from 2014, so I don’t know if that has to do with the specific plan they chose or if they’re just running on outdated information, and it doesn’t include the full list of fees/charges, just the expense ratio. I’m considering going with either a target date fund for simplicity or a collection of index funds, which are pretty much the only options that have an ER &lt;1%, and none of which contain S&amp;P 500 I believe.

Some other questions I have if anyone can chime in:  

* My IRA is a Roth. I was just going to do the traditional 401(k), but a Roth 401(k) is available. Am I okay if I stick to traditional or should I go Roth since I'm in a lower tax bracket currently?  

* If I'm already maxing my IRA, is it worth it to go beyond the employer match on this plan?  

* Does the “Class” have any bearing on fees? I read somewhere the “R” class is the only way to avoid extra charges if through EJ? I don’t know if that’s factual at all, but if so, maybe I’m better off with the target fund rather than the “Class VIII” or “J” of the SSgA options?

fintech,"For blockchain to succeed trust is paramount, Facebook’s is project libra is a perilous development.","Trust is earned, Facebook has been in decline due to a history breaching user privacy rights. Project Libra receives global scepticism prior to launch. The reception of Libra has been perturbed by Facebook’s past, and rightfully so. The company that puts a price on its user privacy, Facebook now offers you a bank account without interest rates, insurance, or oversight. There has no term ends on who governs Libra and nothing to stop Mark Zuckerberg from screwing up monetary policy.

Regulators across the world are waving a red flag over Facebook’s native digital currency. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the United States House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee requested that Facebook halt development on its crypto.

“Given the company’s troubled past, I am requesting that Facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action,” Waters said.

Facebook has a history of misusing data and now project Libra wants to control its user’s money. If history shows, they will use and share your data according to its own agenda rather than that of the people and the decentralized community.

financialindependence,4% rule for retirement distributions is very safe because inflation has been beat!,"The EXPERTS say that if you expect a 30-year retirement you should take 4% of your nest egg out each year and adjust for inflation.  It has a 95% chance for success if you have at least 50% of your portfolio in stocks.

When did the 4% rule fail?  For people retiring in the late 1960s whose retirement funds got killed by inflation rates in the double-digits during the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s.  After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the early 1980s and caused the Reagan Recession we never saw real high inflation again.   Since then technology, massive immigration, and globalism have seen that we never have double-digit inflation ever again.

AGAIN:  What caused the 4% rule to fail for people who retired in the late 1960s was not related to a bad stock market but huge increases in the year to year distributions due to inflation.

The 4% rule is based on the worst case situation over a 30 year period.  It has survived:  Vietnam, Recessions, The Dot Com Bust, 9-11- the Great Recession and many political and social upheavals.

In 1982, massive inflation had been beaten.  If you would have put One Million Dollars in a 401K mutual fund that was 50% total Stock Market and 50% total Bond Market on January 1982 and took out an inflation-adjusted 6% starting that year, your 401k would have 15 MILLION dollars in that account today.  1982 is really the start of the modern economic era, good growth and lower inflation.  Check my results on this great website:

 [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation#analysisResults) 

So with inflation beat, maybe the 4% rule can be a 6% rule.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance low rate FHA,"So I got a very low interest rate when I purchased my home in 2016 (30year 3.25%) however it is an FHA loan with lifetime PMI. The PMI premium is &lt;1% and it brings my effective rate to around 4.1% (would have to double check exact numbers) 

It made total sense at the time to accept PMI (and still does to an extent) as the effective rate was so low that if I had waited until I had 20% down I would have ended up with no PMI but a higher rate so same difference.

Of course now that the rates are coming back down I'm trying to figure out at what point I should consider a refinance. I do not have 20% equity going by the original loan value but I likely do if the house were to be reassessed (current loan ~200K)

Things to consider... 
1) FHA PMI was once removable and may be again in the future (recent bill floating out there again but a low chance of ever getting anywhere)
2) The FHA loan is assumable (although we have no plans to sell anytime soon)

I'm thinking it would only be worth it if I could get the same 3.25% rate or very close to it without PMI.",finance
personalfinance,Suspicious Mortgage Rate,"Hello Reddit, I need some advice on renewing my mortgage rate. When I initially bought the house my fixed interest rate was 2.99% over 5 years. I need to renew by October  I recently received an offer for 3% for 5 years fixed or 2.73% for 3 years fixed. 

The reason I find this so suspicious is the housing market has went down considerably here and everyone else I know is getting 3.15% on 5 year fixed. 

I straight up asked the bank what the gimmick is and she said perhaps they are worried we are more likely to switch banks. 

We bought a house for 270k and have roughly 215k still owing. Other than that we owe the bank nothing and have roughly 20k invested through them in ETFs and RESPs. My business has roughly 40k with them and owe them nothing. My credit rating is very good. 

I realize they might want to lock us in for 3 years  then really get us on the next 5 years but nobody know what the bank of Canada is going to do with interest rates in the future. 

So my question is, what’s the gimmick here? I am smart enough to know the banks aren’t looking out for my best interests.

Obviously we can ignore the vehicle debt in this situation since vehicle loans are so low and that type of debt isnt what has been killing us for years.

- Second, I would like to put aside ~1 month income for a true start to an emergency fund (in this case about ~7k)
- Last would be to either try and refinance the personal loan to see if I can get the interest rate lowered (currently 10.5), which may require a slightly larger than the normal monthly payment.

*What I wanted to really check is whether or not we should set aside the 1 month income as a starter emergency fund or should it be a smaller amount put aside to pay a larger chunk of that personal loan down?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Basics: I'm 25, living in NYC, in software/tech and making low-mid 6 figures, credit is above 800.

The question: Should I:
- take the dive and just outright pay off my student loans, diminishing my reserves a bit
- pay off just my private variable loan, wait on federal
- hold off, and pour money into investment accounts given return is likely more than 7%

The consideration: I currently have enough savings to last me a year (~50k). My expenses are about 50% of my income (take home roughly 6.6k a month) and student loans are ~12% of my expenses per month. I currently owe ~35k in student loans (29k principal, federal interest rates varying 3.8% to 6.8% fixed) and private (~7.5k, 6.8% variable rate).

personalfinance,Should I change my student loan payment plan?,"I have $27K remaining on my student loans at 3.1% interest (thanks to consolidation in early 2018). Student debt doesn't bother me much but overall I don't really like having that loan hanging out there, so I am making extra payments to get it paid off quickly. Part of my motivation is that I'll likely be engaged soon and don't really want to carry this loan too far into my marriage. My minimum loan payment is about $700, and right now I make an extra payment each month of another $600. At the current payment rate I should have the student loan paid off at the end of 2020. (If I didn't make these extra payments it would be the end of 2022.)

However, since the interest rate is low I also contribute to other savings goals rather than making even larger payments on the loan. Right now I contribute 10% to my 401k ($933/month; employer contributes another 3% and a yearly profit share of about 3%), max out my Roth IRA ($500/month), and save for True Expenses (thanks r/YNAB) and shorter term goals in a HYSA. I have one month's income sitting in an investment account, but don't currently contribute more to that account. I own a 2 bedroom home and my car is paid off. 

I feel like my plan is responsible and I'm proud of what I've done with my money over the years. I started with $105K in student loans and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I'm wondering whether I should slow down my payment and put the extra $600 into my investment account (or my 401k, or a mix) instead. What do y'all suggest? Anything else I should be doing?

I'm a single 25 year old (M) with no kids and about 1400 in debt with 1 credit card (recruiter said it's no big deal). My credit score at the moment is 744, according to Credit Karma. 

I've been looking at going active duty in Navy for about a year now, but I wasn't fully commited then because I was still attending community college. Well one semester later and I've decided to join the Navy. I've racked enough credits for E-2. At the moment I'm unemployed and was actually getting by with the little savings I had and financial aid I was receiving, but now I'm down to about $460 in savings. I still live at home btw. 

As far as picking a job goes, the rates (jobs) that I'm interested in the Navy (IT, CTR, and CTN) all require a TS clearance, which shouldn't be a problem for me to get and translate well into the DoD and civilian side. I know the Navy helps you get certifications so I plan on taking advantage of what's provided. I know you can save a lot in the military if you play your cards right. Being as your fed, provided shelter and utilities, the only thing I would have to pay is my cell phone and my entertainment services such as Hulu, Netflix, DAZN, and Spotify.

personalfinance,[Ontario] Asking for a raise in the social services/non-profit sector,"Hello! My yearly review for my job is coming up and it's time for me to ask for a raise.  I'm in the social services sector, at an agency that is funded through a mix of Federal, provincial, municipal and fund-raised dollars. Unfortunately I did a piss-poor job of negotiating my initial salary four years ago (given my experience in the sector) and took the first offer without thinking about it, at the very bottom of the position's salary range. At the time i was bringing about 13 years of experience in the sector and had provided relief coverage here in addition to my full time job elsewhere. Since my initial hiring i was able to negotiate a raise of about 2.5% at my 1 year during an agency wide pay freeze, (so I'm grateful for that) and at the end of the pay freeze last year we all received a raise of about 5%. Currently we're expanding the size of the agency with a lot of new staff being brought on and I notice that the bottom of the salary range is maybe 2.5% less than what I'm making with the upper limit being much more than I'm making. I'm also at a point where I need to be bringing in more than I'm making and have taken on a relief position at another agency in town (which offed me full time, but could only afford less than I'm making now).   

I do feel that asking for a 9.5% raise is probably unrealistic, but I'm hoping for about 8% and will settle for what ever I can get, for now. 

So i'm hoping folks could take a look at my letter asking for a raise and give advice. I'm kind of iffy on everything after the points I make on how I add value to the agency, especially the part about the changing work environment (a lot of people are moving into shared workspaces) and the part about my financial situation (as it's really not the agency's problem, beyond retention. but given the culture of the agency, they may be sympathetic). I also worry that perhaps I'm being too blunt?     

&gt;Dear (supervisor) and (director),


&gt;With my fourth anniversary as the full time (job title) having just passed, and now being into my eighth year of working at (Agency), I’d like to formally request a review of my salary.  Since the agency-wide raise in late 2017, I have received two very strong performance reviews and provide the following value to (Agency) above and beyond my regular duties:

&gt;•	Point 1

&gt;•	…

&gt;•	Point 10

&gt;As (agency) continues to grow, there is an expectation that the scope of (job) and my responsibilities will continue to expand to reflect this growth.  At the same time, with the reorganization of the work space at (job site), it is anticipated that I will be losing my office space and moving into a shared work space. It is my belief that these expanding responsibilities and changing working conditions should also be considered in reviewing my compensation.
        
&gt;Although my starting salary at (agency) in 2015 was $39,500, and has since been bought up to $42,500. This increase lagged behind inflation and has not kept pace with increases in my cost of living. On this point, I would point out that when pay does not keep pace with inflation, the worker is essentially receiving a year over year pay cut.  As a result, I have found it necessary to take on a second job. In short, I cannot afford to keep working for (agency) at my current salary level.  I certainly cannot afford to go into another period of pay freeze, similar to the one we just came out of, at my current salary.

&gt;I also ask for this review of my salary in recognition of the fact that while I have been in this position full time for over four years, and employed by (agency) for over seven years in temporary and relief roles. However, despite my length of service to (agency), my current salary is only about 2.5% higher than that of new staff being hired into comparable roles, assuming they are receiving the minimum salary listed in recent job postings, of $41,500. Of all the non-managerial staff, I believe I have the fourth or fifth longest tenure at the agency. It I also worth noting that starting salaries for comparable outreach positions at other (city) agencies run the range from $41,500 at (other agency 1) to $51,000 at (community health clinic) and about $54,000 at (public health unit).

   
&gt;I note that my current salary grid appears to run up to $48,000/year. I would ask that in recognition of the experience I brought to the agency, my continued excellent performance within my position, and the anticipated expansion of my responsibilities as the agency grows, that you consider raising my salary by roughly 9.4% to $46,500.  I believe this leaves sufficient room for salary growth in the future to incentivize my continued excellence and growth in my position.

Student Loan 2: $2,502 Balance- 6.8% interest rate

Dental Loan: $1,793 Balance- 10.99% interest rate

My current monthly recurring cost of living (including groceries utilities etc) is approx. $4000/month. Im paying the care credit card a total of $1280 through November 2019 to get it paid off during the interest free period, therefore that  brings my total cost of living up to $5280 for the next 5 months

So $5,280 per months is my cost (until Nov when it will drop to $4000/month) That is before including any monthly payments on the debt accounts above outside of the care credit..  Im currently netting about $7500/month in income. Therefore after bills and expenses Im standing to have about $1700/month remainder.

personalfinance,Advice needed: buying first home + calculating acceptable mortgage + real estate questions,"Hello everyone, I am first time poster here, thanks for all your time and effort if you decide to help with an advice. :)

I am in long term relationship and plan on buying an apartment for myself and my SO. We are 27 and 29 yrs old. We live in smaller country in Europe and don't have any debt, we have a car and we live in rented flat. We don't have any savings. My salary is 12 000 EUR/yr after taxes. (East Europe, yay) SO has a bit higher salary, around 14 000 EUR/yr after taxes, so together we get cca 26 000 EUR/yr. Our salaries are considered decent middle class salaries in our country.

Our plan is to buy an apartment for us to live in, an real estate investment. Is is pretty much a norm of sorts here, but I am welcome for any other investment advices  if this one is not sound.
Apartment prices swing from 1500 to 2200 EUR per square meter. We plan on buying perhaps 60 m2 (90 000 - 132 000 EUR).
Current interest rates for mortgages are around 3%/yr.
My maximum mortgage rate could be 500 EUR/mo (my salary is 1000 EUR/mo). 

Advices needed:
1. Are there any upsides towards having mortgage now while interest rates are low versus waiting for some kind of financial recession and lower prices (but higher interest rates)? Recession carries additional risks as well.

2. Are there any upsides towards buying larger apartment (planning for kids) versus having a smaller and cheaper one which will have to be changed when kids arrive?

3. My maximum mortgage rate could be 600 EUR/mo (my salary is 1000 EUR/mo) for 30 years. I am the one who can get mortgage, my SO is working as well but is not eligible yet to take part in the mortgage (Self-employed, ergo riskier). Is it wise to have half of my current salary indebted for next 30yrs? I guess I kind of gave myself an answer on this one here. :)
Which percentage of salary would you recommend to lock in for potential debt/mortgage?

Is there any advantage to owning any real estate currently? I heard from some friends that it is not necessarily best decision, but I am not an financial expert, and that's why I am hoping that someone might share their insight here. :) Do you have other suggestions for investment instead of homeownership that might be better for us? Investing in stock and bond market is a rare animal here and less than 1% of population does it, so I lack a lot of information regarding that one and I am not even sure how to go with it. 

Anyway, thank you for all your time reading this and for all the replies you post. :)


Edit:
Forgot to add crucial information: our current rent is 500 EUR/mo for 60 sqm apartment and it is an average market rate rent here. We can maybe find something for 400 EUR/mo but it will be hard to find anything cheaper. This is basically the reason why we considered buying pur own apartment - why pay the rent for someone else's apartment if we can pay the same rate of mortgage for our future home? Does that make any sense?",finance
personalfinance,"Bought a house with a loan from father-in-law. Mortgage agreement all looked legit, but the mortgage still isn't showing on my credit report a year later.","Lengthy post.  tl;dr Father-in-law gave wife and me a loan for the full amount of our house, and we then purchased our house in cash.  Only our names appear on the deed (me and wife, not FIL).  We signed a mortgage with FIL, and all has been fine between us, but the mortgage hasn't shown on my credit report in over a year.  Is this normal?

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I bought a house for $350k last year.  Rather than going with a mortgage through the bank, we accepted her father's offer (let's call him Andrew) to essentially front the cash to purchase the house straight-up.  His name was nowhere on the paperwork for purchasing the home, so as far as the builder knows, my wife and I bought the house in cash and are the sole owners.

When we originally discussed this with Andrew, we signed a very simple one-page form which basically stated our names, the loan amount ($350k), the term of the loan (15 years), and the interest rate (1.5%).  It didn't include the property info or anything like that.  We all signed off and that was that.  Fast forward several months, and Andrew tells us that his financial advisors told him that he needs to have us sign an official mortgage for the deal.  This led to Andrew giving us a mortgage document (something like 15-20 pages, if I recall correctly) to review.  I wasn't happy about it, and I argued against it a bit, but we ended up signing the mortgage.  I'm not a lawyer and I'd never read a mortgage before, but I read through every word of the mortgage several times and addressed any questions with Andrew and his lawyer who built the agreement.  Nothing in the paperwork seemed suspicious in any way.

It's been about a year since we signed that updated mortgage.  There have been no problems, and we're all on as good of terms as ever, but I'm just curious about why this isn't on my credit report.  The interest rate that he gave us (1.5%) is below the legal limit as of the time of our agreement, so he has filed ""Interest Forgiveness"" forms and provided them to us for the past two tax years (which basically say, ""Hey, at the time of our agreement, the minimum legal loan rate was 3%.  You only paid me 1.5%, and I'm okay with that.  If you had been paying 3%, you would have paid me $2000 more this year, so this form states that we're all clear and you don't owe me that $2000."")  It really seems like everything is being done by the book.  Wife and I have even received spam mail from insurance companies saying, ""Hey, we found in the public records that you have a loan of $350k with Andrew Andrewson.  We want to sell you insurance for this mortgage.""  These notices have been reassuring, because it at least seems like there is some official paperwork out there showing the mortgage.

I think I would like the mortgage to be on my credit report, just so I'd be sure that there's no foul play going on.  My credit and my wife's credit are both solid (in the 770 range), and we are both responsible with our debts.  I'll note that Andrew is a very wealthy man, very close with his daughter, and has been nothing but good to me for as long as I've known him.  Nevertheless, I've always felt a bit uneasy about the situation.  So I ask you, personalfinance:

\- Should I be concerned about this?

\- Who can I contact to check whether the process was all done legally and by the books?  I'd rather not bring in a lawyer since it would cause drama, be costly, and because I really don't think Andrew has any motive or desire to screw us.  Is there a government agency I can contact and basically say, ""Hey, can you tell me if you have a record of my mortgage and if it's in good standing?""

\- Are there any reasons why the mortgage might be in public record but not reported by credit bureaus?

\- Anything else I should maybe look into?

personalfinance,Is it okay to make a downpayment of 10-15%?,"My wife and I are working to buy our first house next year. First, some background info!

Age: We both turned 28 this year. 

Income: $140k-150k a year combined (we both receive significant incentive comp, hence the variance). 

Debt: I have about $7k left with an interest rate of under 4%. Wife has about $40k left with interest rates all over the place. We had an aggressive plan to attack this debt that we may have to pause for a year to get our down payment together. We have no other debt besides our credit card balances, which we pay in full every pay period.

Savings: We currently have about $33k in savings accounts, which is functioning as both our emergency fund and the beginning of our down payment. 

Retirement: I also have about $34k in retirement accounts (company-matched 401k and Roth IRA through Vanguard). 10% of every paycheck goes into my 401k (plus a 3% match), and $220 from each paycheck goes into my Roth IRA ($440 a month). My wife also saves into her company matched 401k, but can't really go much further because of her student loan debt. 

Upcoming expenses: We've already bought flights for a 2-week trip to Tokyo next year. We were planning on a one-week trip to France this fall for our anniversary. Let's call the total budget for both of these trips $7k.

Now, for the house... We currently pay $1450 a month in rent, but we'd like to buy a starter home. We plan to have children in two years and need more space, and we'd simply like to build equity instead of paying rent. We're looking to buy in one year's time. We're looking at homes that cost $240k-$300k. We plan to live in this home for five to ten years. If a 15-year mortgage is feasible, that is our preference. 

That means a 20% down payment would be anywhere from $48k-$60k. That gives us one year to save anywhere from $16k to $30k PLUS have money left over for our emergency fund AND for any work/ purchases we'd need for the home. I honestly don't see how we could do this in a year, at least not without cancelling one or both of our trips, and greatly reducing how much I'm saving for retirement (I'd probably have to hit pause on my IRA contributions of $440 a month). 

However, a down payment of 10-15% is much more manageable. We think we can do that comfortably. I'm aware that there's a monthly insurance payment I'd have to make if I don't put 20% down, but that seems easier than saving up the 20%. 

What do people on here think about this? Just how important is the down payment?",finance

In all, I'm fine. However, a financial advisor told me a few years ago that I shouldn't focus on paying off the house because of the tax break it provides. I agreed at first, but now it confuses me. I don't have debt, other than the house...I have perhaps 8 years left on the mortgage, and I could pay that off pretty quick if I wanted to.

My question is...am I going to get surprised by anything if I were to pay off the mortgage? If we're just talking numbers, paying off the house will at least save me the remaining interest...right?

I THINK the point the advisor was trying to make was that if you have debt, or the house, it's better to pay off the debt because I had a great interest rate on the mortgage. Therefore, I not only got a tax break on the mortgage interest, but it was like a low interest loan that could either be invested, or the money would be used to pay off higher interest debt.

Considering I have no debt right now other than the mortgage, it just seems natural to start paying that off early, but I wanted to see if I'm missing something. If I payed off the rest of the mortgage tomorrow, other than saving for property taxes, wouldn't that be better off than paying the interest?

Between typing cover letters, looking for jobs I qualify for, and making sure I pull my weight when I move in with my girlfriend are a few of my priorities. I had to make this move as my options right now are very limited.

I found out about 6 months ago my old car (09 Scion TC) that the motor was failing so I figured I could shop around for a new  car until it fails. Couldn't find anything but the motor ended up blowing and it pretty much forced me to find one quicker. Found a little mom and popish dealer and after talking with one of their sons they offered to buy  my old car and just put a used motor in it but under the condition I get a car from them. Well I found one and it was a automatic FRS low mileage too.  And out of all the dealerships (minus the big ones) they offered me pretty good monthly payments and the best interest rate I could find (18.17%) percent. Looking back it was a huge mistake. It was the first car I financed with new credit. The dealership screwed up the car and weren't willing to give me any written proof that they were gonna work on it so I spent 2k out of pocket to fix it... it runs for now. Looking back I should've done something else. The interest rate is killing me its been almost 6 months and my current balance is almost as much as the original loan and I deeply regret getting a automatic.

I meet all the requirements EXCEPT they won't match unless I'm ranked as a good employee at my review which I get on my 6 month anniversary, so November 28th. Also all the payments they make count as taxable income for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My new plan** be good employee, pay at least 2k before December 31st to get this years benefit. paying off higher interest loans first. 

Pay aggressively 2020, get my 2k match. Try and get loans down to 12k by 12/31/20

2021: slow down (hopefully still move out) and pay 2k (+interest earned on loans) Get 2k match. Loans down to 8k. 

2022: pay 2k + interest and get match. Loans down to 4k.

2023: 2k + interest and get match. Loans paid off yay! Could do this as early as January of 2023.

personalfinance,50 year mortgage,"3 years ago (I am 30 now), I was talking to my mother about my desire to buy a house and how with the prices going up it seemed like even though I was saving a lot, I was still getting further away from being able to even make a down payment. She mentioned how after she was given conservatorship of my Grandparents’ trust (around 600K) that it has only been making around 1.5% interest annually.


What we ended up doing: My Grandparents’ trust acted as a lender to me at 3.25% interest rate for a 50year mortgage period. I got to make a “Cash” offer on a house, and a relatively low monthly payment that I could afford. 

Benefits: 

1. I got to purchase a home in an up-and-coming neighborhood (Japantown San Jose, CA) probably about 5 years before I would have through more conventional loan practices. The housing market has been favorable in the 3 years since I purchased with an estimate (Zillow/Trulia) of about 325K more than I bought for.

2. My Parents (now 70) and Grandma(now 95) get to convert a good portion of the trust into steady added monthly income roughly equivalent to purchasing and renting out a home without having to deal with any of the hassle of managing or paying someone to manage a property. Their investment went from making 1.5% to 3.25% annually and the investment is secured with the property if I somehow turned out to be delinquent.

3. The normal downside of a 50 year Mortgage is that you pay a ton in interest. In this case, all of the interest that I pay goes toward my parent’s expenses or back into the trust that my sister and I would eventually be a beneficiary of.

4. With rental prices in the area, if I were to rent the house out (roughly $3,000/mo) it would be basically net zero cost to me, while slowly building equity and likely increasing in price.

5. As time goes on, the value of the House and potential rent adjust faster than inflation, but the payment stays fixed. (In 20 years $1,770 a month payment will mean a lot less than it does now).

Downsides:

1. My parents may have been able to do better than 3.25% if they had invested elsewhere. Though at the time (July 2016) a 10 year treasury bond was yielding about 1.7% for reference.

2. If the housing market tanks I have not built much equity as much of the payment is interest. But in this case I feel like I can just keep making my monthly payments and wait it out, I don’t have any intent of ever selling.

I am completely open for criticism, as there may have been better options, but I feel like this was a fairly novel idea with the long term loan period, and without a whole lot of drawbacks as far as I can see that allowed me to get in early into the housing market.

Numbers:
At purchase 2016
50 year 3.25% loan 525k (House 575K)
Monthly Payment on loan to trust $1770/mo
Taxes: around $800/mo (ouch)

Future Plans: Build modest ADU (100K) in backyard for additional income.

There were a number of circumstances that lined up, and I will be the 1st one to admit that this is a specific case, there may have been better options, and I found myself in a very privileged situation. But the solution we came up with is not one I hear anyone talk about (though I’m sure others have found similar solutions) and seemed mutually beneficial for all parties. I'm interested in hearing some other opinions.

personalfinance,Thoughts on giving financial advice as a business,"HI PF,

&amp;#x200B;

Long-time lurker here.  I have a  huge interest in personal finance and helping others get their financial life in order.  Currently, I work in a position that is Business Development oriented so I have experience in sales and have been told I am an excellent salesperson, especially when it comes to ""selling"" people into my way of thinking which applies to both job related tasks as well personal.  This is something that applies to my regular job as well as the financial ""tips"" I give my coworkers, most of which aren't too financially savvy.  I do not give advice, as in you should invest in x,y, or z.  Most of what I provide are basic financial ways to get out of debt, tackling interest rates on loans or CC, and more general planning such as what to aim for in retirement.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told that I am very good at this and have helped several coworkers with their financial issues while never making a single dime out of this.  It's been brought to my attention that this is something I may be able to turn into a business.  I was hoping that PF would be able to provide me some insight or advice into this endeavor.  Below I will list what it is that I have in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to start a company that offers financial advice, specifically towards eliminating debt and working towards financial goals.  I will NOT be selling investment vehicles, funds, stocks, or anything like that.  My idea is to charge by the hour and provide recommendations. For example, personal has 10k in debt at 15% interest, I would then provide them with ways to get rid of this debt based on their goals and means.  I know there is a market for this because my coworkers, mostly millennial and under 40; are always asking me what they should do and have often times recommended me to their friends.  Again, I've never charged for this and thought of it as a favor.

personalfinance,Hospital bill was not submitted to insurance company (insurance info was given to hospital) and now the bill has been sent to a debt collection agency that says I owe the entire $2200 and has put a delinquency on my credit report.,"First of all, thanks for clicking and reading. So this bill actually has to do with my grandmas accounts and credit score. Short backstory, she has dementia and I take care of her finances, medical issues and pretty much everything except bathing at this point. Few notes, I have her POA, I'm listed on her accounts and insurance so they know the situation and we live in Texas.

She fell a few years ago and had an emergency room visit where my family presented the hospital with her insurance info, very good insurance as she worked for the government for a loooooong time. About a year and a half went by and we recieved a bill in the mail for roughly $2200 for the hospital visit almost 2 years ago. I immediately called the collections company who informed me that the bill was never sent to the insurance and that she now owes the full amount since now it is too late to submit the claim (is this true??). I then called the hospital that confirmed they did send the bill to collections and also confirmed they had her insurance info. (WAT!) The bill has now become delinquent and in addition to feeling like we are not responsible to pay the entire amount, it is effecting my grandmas credit score. This is an issue because we take her to many doctors visits using her car and its starting to break down. We are needing to purchase a new one, one she can get in and out of comfortably because her current car is too low, preferably one we could eventually fit one of those wheel chair ramps onto. This delinquency has dropped her credit score almost 60 points taking her out of the good range and I know that will affect her interest rate. 

Does anybody know how I can handle this in a way that gets the bill paid, not by me, or erases this from her credit report?

Bitcoin,"Why Tether is just as good as ""real"" USD","It is backed by nothing real. A private corporation creates it, and issues it electronically in its computers with essentially no real limitation. Several other companies honor these units, and value them identically. That is the USD.

Tether works much the same way, and most of the time, people value it exactly the same as the dollar.  When it comes down to it; tether *is* a dollar, just moving over a separate network. Just because USD typically moves over the ACH network, while USDT move over the Omni network, doesnt really mean there is any fundamental difference between them. Since dollars dont exist on the omni network, and are just so slow moving and clumsy, tethers basically take their place on those channels.

If the USD is over issued, then tethers will be worth less. If USDT is overissued, then dollars will be worth less. Bitfinex's frankencoin is no less legitimate than the ordinary federal reserve banking system. (this says more about fiat banks than it does about tether really)

so long as Bitfinex's people float their bubble of tethers at a pace roughly matching the market demand, and make a reasonable effort to maintain stability, their USDT bubble is just as good as any USD bubble.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Starting Medical School - need help!,"Hi guys,

I will be starting medical school this August and I just want general advice catered towards my case. I have already read a few posts regarding other people's medical school questions and I want to say that this sub really has great insight and I hope to receive the same kind of insight regarding my own questions.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I will list the estimated cost of attending this school:

Cost of Attendance  Books and Supplies -- $2,213.00

Direct Unsubsidized Loan Fees--- $454.00

Fees ----  $40.00

Grad PLUS Loan Fees -- $1,737.00

Room &amp; Board and Personal  Expense -- $18,220.00

Transportation -- $3,118.00

Tuition --- $59,560.00

Total: --- $85,342.00

&amp;#x200B;

I have been offered:

 Federal Grad PLUS Loan Offered -- $42,620.00 (fixed 7%)

Federal  Direct Unsub  Loan Offered  --$42,722.00 (fixed 6%)

**Total :**$85,342.00

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my plan. Since this will only be my first year of medical school, I plan on accepting the entirety of the unsub loan followed by an additional 20k from the grad PLUS loan. My idea is this: $42k unsub loan + 20k PLUS loan = 62k. Tuition is already 60k, but I need the extra 2k to offset the loan fees. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am budgeting freely for the school year amount of about: $8,500 rent, $1,500 transportation (gas), $7000 food (this comes from $300 monthly in groceries with an additional $10 a day for eating out). The cost of this will be covered by my savings to the dot and by the end of the school year I will have no money left, which is fine by me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is that I only want to take out enough loans to cover my tuition and use my savings for the rest of my living expenses. Therefore, I would have taking the minimal amount of loans necessary during my first year. Then in my second year, I can take out the full 85k in loans because this will save me about 25k + compounded interest for one year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also considered taking out an additional 10k in loans so I would not be so strapped for cash in case emergencies do happen. But assuming no emergencies happen, do you guys feel this is a strong budgeting plan? Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Loan Consolidation,"Hello!

I have spent the last year or so accruing massive debt in both loans from friends, various companies, and from letting bills fall into collections while unemployed on and off. I have a difficult time saving, and with moderately-sized bills from so many different sources adding up, I feel overwhelmed by it all. Each time I call a collector to make a payment, they ask more than I can currently afford, and so the unpaid debt is left to rot my credit (currently suffering at about 520). I'm looking to take out a personal loan to consolidate, in total probably looking at 10-12,000. With my line of credit, I know I can expect a fierce interest rate, but having a new job that pays well enough coupled with the peace of mind that I only have to pay one bill every month to one entity, the cost seems worth it. Where can I get a guaranteed personal loan of that amount with my credit as bad as it is, and can I get one that will cover things like personal loans from friends/family that are undocumented?",finance
personalfinance,Overborrowing student loans and investing,"Alright, so this is potentially a stupid question, but I've been trying to find any reason not to do this, and I just can't. How bad of an idea is it to just be very generous on your estimate of your expenses when taking a student loan, then just dumping what I don't use in an investment account until I graduate and get a job? I can get around a 5-6% fixed rate loan with my credit, which I'm pretty confident I can match, if not exceed with fairly conservative and easily liquidated investment.

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking here is that I'd rather have some extra money stashed away just in case something unexpected comes up, like having to repair my car. I'd rather have the money to cover that from a low-interest loan than to have to potentially max out my credit card and get eaten alive by ultra high interest. I'm not planning on just blowing it all on luxuries. I'm also aware that even if I match the interest rate in gains, I'd be losing some money since I wouldn't be putting the entire loan into investment. I'm okay with that loss, and I'm okay with the risks involved with investments going down.

&amp;#x200B;

So is there literally any reason not to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: From what I understand it's pretty iffy to do this with federal loans, but generally legally okay to do with private loans, which is what I intend to do.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to Liquidate an Actively Manage Account,"Hello PF, Seeking advice on a situation related to liquidating all or some of a taxable account to fund other retirement related ventures.

**Situation:**

1. Stable employment and income
2. Meeting all financial obligations and saving some for retirement via. (TSP ~12% w/ match and Roth IRA as I can via dollar cost averaging)
3. Have emergency fund and insurances
4. Only debt is a mortgage (no PMI), not planning to pay it off early at this time.
5. Married, no kids yet, 33 years young


**Account in Question:**

1. When I was younger and in the Army I lived a simple life outside of deployments, was single for most of it.  I failed to contribute more than 5% to my TSP (Fed equivalent of 401k) and as I was cash rich, I put it in a bunch of CDs and a few mutual funds through USAA (have divested a lot to Vanguard due to cost savings).  The one I am seeking advice on is an actively managed fund (non-retirement).  I know this may have been a poor decision, but it was easy and I was fairly PF ignorant at the time.  This account dates back to ~2010 with contributions made till about 2014 and it has a modest unrealized gain.  Its been re-balanced a few times and the gains/dividends cover the management fee.  Balance is ~$ 78k if sold right now.

**Challenge:**

1. I am a federal employee and looking to buy back my time in the Army.  Bottom line, it will cost me $15K to buy back my 8 years of uniformed service towards my federal pension calculation.  I have no intention of going back into the Army and I don't want those years to go to waste.  I can do a lump sum, a paycheck deduction, or a combo of the two.  In 1.5 years a variable interest rate of ~3% kicks in.  I wish to pay this off prior to that.

2. I want to fund my Roth IRA this year, maybe even max it out.  Its invested in a 60% stock/ 40% bond index fund, a dividend fund, and a REIT ETF through Vanguard.

3. I try to fund everything through my monthly income and leave investments/savings untouched, but post-mortgage down payment and the assumption of a mortgage, it will be difficult to make #1 and 2 work purely on monthly income.  (I pay for insurances and HSA)

**Question:**

1. Is it worth keeping all or most of that active fund where it is due to its time in the market or should I liquidate some/all of it to fund these retirement ventures listed above?

2. If I liquidate it all and re-invest it through Vanguard, I am reluctant to put too much into stocks being at near all time highs.  Is this a reasonable stance? Alternatives?  Maybe keep some in a war chest for a market dip via the money market holding account in the IRA?

Thanks PF.",finance
personalfinance,Go back to school or find whatever job I can to pay off student loan…,"I am 22 years old, I recently graduated with a degree in Commerce in June with 31K of debt. I have been applying to jobs before and after graduating but with no luck. My last semester at school was a part time semester so the 6-month interest free period on my OSAP Loan (Ontario Student Assistance Program) started in January (interest rate is 6.45%). My first payment is due at the end of July. I have already applied for repayment assistance. The only problem with that is the representative told me they would let me know if I have been approved for repayment assistance before my first payment is due July 31st. My understanding of the repayment assistance plan is that if I am approved I would have to pay the new agreed upon amount for 6 months then re-apply for assistance again or begin paying the original amount OSAP had designated for my loan. 

**Option 1**

My job situation is as follows. I have had a full time security job overnights since February. I recently told my scheduler that I wanted another shift because overnights have been tough for me and I would rather have a day shift. Since then I haven’t had a shift for almost 2 months now which has obviously put stress on my financial situation. I am still constantly looking for jobs to apply to and I have considered having both a day job and this overnight security job to pay off my student loan. 

Note: In regards to this job I have got in contact with my scheduler for overnight shifts again as I am getting a little worried/desperate because I need to earn some money.

**In my head this is essentially Option 1; keep applying to jobs, hopefully luck turns my way soon, also work 1-2 jobs for the foreseeable future and pay off whatever I can of the loan.** 

**Pros –** Get 1-2 years of work experience + pay off a portion of my loan. 

**Cons –** Have no current job, cannot assess what portion of my income to designate to paying off student loan. 

Will not be working in my desired field. 

Not much social life

Possibly effect my credit score 

**Option 2**

While waiting for another shift I applied to go back to school in September. There were certain 1 year graduate diploma programs I was considering applying to before completing my degree. I applied to each of these programs after graduating and I have been offered admission to 3/4 programs including my first choice. These programs are all in fields I would love to work in and they include a mandatory CO-OP/Work Term to complete the program. I know nothing is a guarantee, but when I look up jobs or companies in this field on LinkedIn all or most of the employees have graduated from my first choice. The graduate programs are relatively inexpensive for Canadian students (around 5k for the year) but I would still have to apply for OSAP to help fund this new program as well, adding to my overall loan amount. As explained to me by the same representative, if I go back into full time studies I will not have to make monthly payments until I go part time or complete the program. 

**Notes:** I have reached out to someone on LinkedIn who works at a company I wanted to apply to and also graduated from the program I got accepted into, she gave a glowing review. Also, some program offers expire as early as this week (highly competitive), some expire in the second week of July. 

**This is Option 2; Make the first two monthly payments for my student loan while working what ever job I can find this summer. Then go back to school in September.** 

**Pros –** Learning to be a professional in a field I want to work in + meeting and networking with people who will be in the field and are already working in the field. 

New environment (different city than my previously completed degree)

**Cons –** Increased total loan amount

Additional year of school workload and part time work

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read through my situation. Any guidance or opinions on my situation is greatly appreciated as I am looking for an outside perspective because maybe there is something I am not seeing. My main concerns are; **1**. Not having money to make my monthly student loan payments and the loan service going to the credit bureau.. **2**. If I do go back to school, I could possibly be in the same position I am now…",finance

investing,Some basic questions about the bond market,"This text from Monday's WSJ, ""Bond Yields Fall Signals Unease"": 

&gt; In mid June, UK based telecom giant Vodaphone Group PLC won low borrowing costs for decades by issuing a combined $2.25 billion of 30-year and 40-year bonds. It will pay a slightly higher rate on the bond due four decades from now--5.125%--than the 4.375% it paid on a 10-year bond issued in 2011.

What I'm getting from this quote is that there is high demand for 10 year bonds. Investors seek safety in the near term (economy might hit downturn) so they move to longer term? Also what's this deal about comparing interest rates? Is this simply to show that they're paying less than 1% more in interest for a loan that's due 40 years out? If corporate bonds are paying historically low yields now, why would I buy corporates? Is it because I anticipate that yields won't be low forever because the Fed will eventually have to raise the interest rate? 

Meanwhile insurance companies and other large institutional investors are moving to invest in CLOs rather than treasuries. This is a side-effect of lower yields on treasuries? 

What's surprising to me is this quote: ""The bond market is really saying that it thinks we are facing a significant slowdown or a recession and the equity market thinks there has been no change at all."" Which doesn't make a ton of sense to me since all of this seems to be perpetuated by the Fed refusing to cut rates? If the Fed were to raise rates, investors would pull money out of the market and bond yields would go up (correcting the yield curve inversion). I guess the danger is would it cause a deflationary cycle?",finance

They did so by **placing fraudulent orders for precious metals futures contracts that, at the time the traders placed the orders, they intended to cancel before execution.  In doing so, the traders intended to “spoof” or manipulate the market** by creating the false impression of increased supply or demand and, in turn, to fraudulently induce other market participants to buy and to sell futures contracts at quantities, prices and times that they otherwise likely would not have done so.  **Over the relevant period, the traders placed thousands of fraudulent orders.** ~ [justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/merrill-lynch-commodities-inc-enters-corporate-resolution-and-agrees-pay-25-million) (edit: link fixed)

Many people have been saying for years that precious metals prices were being gamed by traders.  They were labeled conspiracy theorists.  But I propose that fake futures trades are just one of the methods used to manipulate prices on open markets.

&gt; Of course, since we are talking about a bank, and since banks are in charge of not only the DOJ, and virtually every other branch of government, not to mention the Fed, nobody will go to jail and MLCI entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a combined - and measly - $25 million in criminal fines, restitution and forfeiture of trading profits.

&gt; ...MLCI and its parent company, Bank of America, have agreed to cooperate with the government’s ongoing investigation of individuals and to report to the Department evidence or allegations of violations of the wire fraud statute, securities and commodities fraud statute, and anti-spoofing provision of the Commodity Exchange Act in BAC’s Global Markets’ Commodities Business...

personalfinance,I want to quit my job but I’m conflicted about how to do it,"16 year old high schooler here. I work as a host at a local restaurant and I would like to quit my job. The pay isn’t very good, the drive means I have to pay extra for gas, I don’t like one of the managers and I’m blamed for things that aren’t my fault and I’m given no chance to defend myself in anything. 

I was originally planning on quitting at the end of the summer and using an easy “my senior year is very demanding of my schedule and I don’t have time to work” to quit, but recent events have caused me to change my mind. More of the blame/scapegoat stuff on Mother’s Day (one of the busiest days for us) and then scheduling during my vacation (which is right now) despite telling them the days which I wouldn’t be available during my interview in April. The interview was with a manager (there are four) who said that she would enter in the dates. My schedule for last week also said that I had days during my vacation off so I assumed everything was alright (I realize now it was a bad assumption).

Last night, they called asking where I was for my shift. I explained to the manager where I was and why I couldn’t make it, as well as explaining that the dates had been blocked off for me since late April. It was the same manager who often blamed me for various things and when I explained what was up she told me to stop giving her attitude. I’m fed up with this job, which is a shame because some of the people there are really nice and I enjoy working with them. I would like to quit as soon as I possibly can. I return from Europe on the 28th and blocked off the 29th for jet lag issues. I have from the 30th to the 9th of July to work before I leave for Europe again until the 18th (but I am again blocking an extra day off so I can deal with jet lag.

Ideally, I would like to quit as soon as I get home. There’s no point in sticking around for something I don’t like and I don’t want to deal with an inevitable encounter with a manager. That being said, I feel like it would be a poor reflection on myself to not give a two weeks notice. As a minor, could I quit right away without consequences? Would not giving a two weeks notice be bad for attempting to get another job in high school? What should I do?

Edit: I do not have a new job lined up. I would consider getting one near the end of the summer because I am not too concerned with a new job. I feel like I could easily get a job at where my brother works but I am not hedging my bets on anything.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing vs. taking out a private loan,"Wouldn't taking out a private loan to pay off my student debt essentially be the same as refinancing my loans with a bank? I am a U.S. citizen and have been working in Germany for five years and could get a loan here with an APR between 3-4%. All in all I have about $26k in federal student loans from undergrad and grad school at the following fixed rates:

~ $4k @ 4.8%
~ $5.5 @ 5.16%
~ $4k @ 5.6 %
~ $4k @ 6%
~ $8.5k 6.55%

I haven't consolidated these because I wanted to pay off the highest interest loans first to have a lower average interest rate if I do consolidate. I am finally in a position where I can pay more than the minimum on these and have started throwing a lot of extra cash ($1k+ /month) at the highest interest loan.

I don't have any credit card debt and have an excellent credit score. I am not sure at what rate I could consolidate and refinance, but if I didn't want to privatize all of my loans or if the refinancing rate is higher than the private loan I could take out:

Would it make sense to take out a private loan to pay off at least the loans in the 6% range so I can continue my ""debt avalanche"" approach? Are there any advantages to refinancing my loans instead, or is this essentially the same thing? Not sure if I'm missing something here...",finance

investing,"Justice Department Investigates Chicken Industry: Retailers, restaurants say producers including Tyson, Pilgrim’s colluded to boost prices; meat companies deny claims","* The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into allegations that top poultry processors colluded to keep prices artificially high.
* The probe came to light after federal attorneys sought to intervene in a long-running lawsuit in which customers accused chicken processors, including Tyson Foods Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc., of illegally cooperating. The processors have denied the accusations.
* The government asked a federal judge in Illinois to halt evidence-collection in the suit for six months to protect a grand jury investigation into the matter, lawyers from the department wrote in a motion filed Friday in Chicago. A ruling is expected Thursday.
* Plaintiffs ranging from independent restaurateurs to Walmart Inc. and food distributors such as Sysco Corp. have sued chicken companies over the last three years, alleging they improperly shared data and influenced meat-industry benchmarks to push up chicken-meat prices.
* Meat companies have denied claims that they cooperated to boost prices, attributing higher prices to stronger demand and reduced production after a tough period for the U.S. poultry industry in the late 2000s.

There are **8** pending cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**
&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**
&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule [Auer v. Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auer_v._Robbins) and [Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/325/410/), which direct courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

The Federal Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

**US v. Haymond**

The 10th Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

[Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1672_5hek.pdf)

The court holds that a federal law requiring a defendant who is registered as a sex offender to return to prison for at least five years if a federal judge finds that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release is unconstitutional.

personalfinance,Should I sell stocks to pay off mortgage?,"I am in my late 30's and have a balance of about $107,000 on my house assessed at $185,000.  The interest rate is 4% and there are 26 years left on the loan. My monthly payment on the note itself is $600 (with escrow is $1,000). Total interest paid last year was $4,500. I do not itemize so there are no tax savings by paying interest.

&amp;#x200B;

In a non-retirement account I have about $100,000 in index funds and $40,000 in individual stocks.  They throw off about $4,000 in dividends per year. This is up about $30,000 over the past decade. I rebalance twice per year so the true increase is probably more than $30,000. I have $7,000 in short-term gains and $2,000 in long-term gains currently.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read and read and read varying opinions on this and still have not found one calculator or source that gives a definitive answer. I know I could make more money in the market but there is something appealing about freeing up that cash flow every month. We have two children in daycare which costs about $1,600/month total and two car payments totaling $470/month (at a 2.9% rate).

We have an emergency fund of $35,000 cash at Ally and put the maximum towards Roth IRAs each year.  In addition I save 12% into my 401k and my wife has a pension that we cannot control. I use this stock account as a savings, so to speak, to pay for house repairs, and trips, etc.  I fear that if I pay off my mortgage I'll have less debt but lose the funds to pay for big projects should they arise. 

My parents are very open about their finances and they have about $5m in net worth they plan to split equally between my sibling and I. My dad says he doesn't want to sell his stocks because of capital gains taxes so his preference is to wait until his death when we'll get the inheritance tax-free but that I shouldn't worry about my non-retirement account because it's more than likely there will be something for me in the pipeline. I am grateful for that safety net but it does not help me in the present time and he has no desire to cash out his money to give it to me now to pay off the mortgage.

Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Pay Off Question- interest rate vs. monthly payment and term length,"I have a little under 77K in student loans left. (I know....) My monthly payment is around $950 and the loans have interest rates ranging from 5%-8.75%. I'm about to pay off about 30k of these loans, but have a question about prioritizing. I know that i should focus on paying down the highest interest rate loans first.

But my question is this--my highest interest rate loans (8.75% and 7.75%) only make up about $6500 out of the $77k and both loans will be paid off in the next three years. Additionally, these two loans only cost me about $100 a month. The rest of my loans (71k worth) are in the 5-5.75% interest rate range, will not be paid off for another 11 years and my monthly payments for these loans total $850 a month. 

Does it still make sense to apply some of the 30K to the high interest rate loans, given that I wont have them for that much longer and the monthly payment is manageable?",finance

It is worth noting here that this is an llc and currently is fully funded by a federal grant and there is no projected revenue for the first few years.

personalfinance,How do I get a credit card that actually benefits me?,"I (36m) stopped using credit cards by the age of 20 after doing some dumb things when I was 18. I was moving around a bit after high school, first stop Baltimore. I got a guitar center credit card for $700 which I maxed out before my physical card came in the mail, fully expecting to pay it off. But then I moved and wasn’t great about changing addresses and what not and I bounced to Connecticut and then Colorado, where I was offered a $2,000 credit card from maybe first bank, I don’t really recall. I was a bit better with this but was making significantly less money out there so I put emergency... blah, blah...maxed out. Then I moved, again without updating addresses. Back to CT, it all caught up with me through collections and everything, worked my butt off and paid them off. Vowed never to use a credit card again. I’ve been pretty successful but it’s dawning on me that my credit score is barely budging, and honestly I have no idea what it is.  It I’m also nervous about fraud and using a debit card I understand is not a great option. So the question is: how do I get a credit card that’s not going to charge me a stupid high interest rate and one that will maybe benefit me instead of bending me over again. I’m making good money now and plan on paying everything off immediately. Also my wife has a credit card and I’d like to transfer her balance to my own card because I’d like to pay it off ($2k) but would like to get the credit boost if I’m paying it.

Bitcoin,The attack vector most likely to bring down Bitcoin,"Hey all!

Long time BTC enthusiast here, first time poster.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin maximalist small-blocker theory (which I myself subscribe to) as put forth by the likes of Andreas Antonopoulis and Saifedean Ammous holds that the main use of Bitcoin is as a store of value. As more and more savers discover BTC (including central banks), the price will rise to very high levels. Bitcoin will begin to edge out major currencies. This makes Bitcoin a concern for major world governments

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the most likely attack vector for Bitcoin will not be a double-spend, 51% attack., or blockchain fork, but capture of the full nodes.

&amp;#x200B;

In this scenario the central bankers of the world would conspire to set up full Bitcoin nodes running proprietary software indistinguishable on the network from Bitcoin Core. They may do this anonymously so as not to draw suspicion, or they may publicly embrace BTC as a reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the governments of the world criminalize Bitcoin and work with ICANN and IANA to shut down real cypherpunk node operators.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, their nodes will become an integral part of the Bitcoin network. At which point they have captured the network and can introduce backdoors to alter the validation rules at will, changing difficulty, changing the coin cap, etc.

personalfinance,Federal Grants and getting a job.,"Hey everyone. I come here looking for clarification and everyone's opinions on what I should do.
First off I'm 28 with about 4k in the bank and live in Oklahoma. Last January I went back to college last minute and had to quit my job because they couldn't work with me and school hours. Fortunately for me, I am living with my parents who  dont mind me here as long as I'm actually pursuing school.

With that in mind, I have no Bills of my own except food once in awhile if I go out on my own. I'm introverted and tbh dont have many friends so I mostly stay in and dont spend money like ever. I realize I am fortunate to be able to live like this but with that in mind I have a few questions. 

I am currently getting about $3500 in Grants per semester with tuition being around 4k. Meaning I have $500 out of my own pocket plus books to fend for. Along with that I can get 2k in subsidized loans to cover the rest. If I get a job will I no longer get that grant money? If I wont, wouldn't it make sense to stay jobless as bad as it sounds? One of my parents says I might as well take advantage of Grants while the other wants me to get a job. Both have their obvious merits. And I'd like to be able to get Grant's and have a job if possible but I dont know where that fine line is between being denied or accepted for a grant almost paying off all my semester tuition.

personalfinance,Tax question help please,"I filed taxes jan 16th this year and was set to recieve $11332 back. Well my wifes former job never sent in or reported her wages for 2018 and it delayed my return. The IRS did multiple reviews trying to get ahold of my wifes former employer ( a Cadillac dealership) but the IRS themselves couldn't get a response back from them either to verify my wifes information. We faxed in her w2 from that job in February and eventually our return got sent to the exams department and they had us resend the w2 along with a letter from the dealership with a company letterhead on it. And that was in the beginning of May. I have spoken to the exam department of the IRS once on the phone and they agreed it was all because of the employer and their continued non responses and that I was going to recieve interest on my return because it has been so long. My question is does anyone know the interest rate the IRS applies to returns they pay out late? I read a few places that it is between 4% and 6% interest rate and a article in USA today said it is daily interest is this correct?  It just seems unrealistic as 4% interest on $11332 is $453.28 and 6% is $679.92 which if it is daily interest would put my return ammount up over $45,000 at the minimum if its a flat non accumulative 4% and over $300,000 if its accumulative 4% interest. Lastly does anyone know if its a flat interest or a accumulative interest as in does the interest climb as the daily total updates to a new ammount each day? Just hoping for some clarity.

personalfinance,Pay off student loan or 403B loan first?,"Hello, I have several different loans and have increased cash flow recently so am trying to accelerate the payment of my loans and wanted some advice.

403B loan: $3000 at 4.75%

Student loan: $30000 at 3.549% 

Student loan: $20000 at 2.625%

Student loan: $36000 at 2.125%

I have been paying extra to both the highest interest student loan and occasionally the 403B loan, but am wondering what is the best use of my money.  Typically I know that paying off the highest interest loans will save the most money over time.  But the 403B interest is paid to myself rather than the bank—a fixed amount is taken out of my paycheck every month for the loan payment and all goes into buying new mutual fund shares in my 403B, but only a portion of that amount reduces the principal balance on my loan.  Since I would be contributing one way or another to my retirement plan, I don’t see this as a negative to be contributing “extra” every month that is counted as loan interest.  

Should I be focusing on paying off my student loan balance since the interest is going to the bank rather than to me, even though the interest rate is higher on the retirement plan loan?  I am not in any loan forgiveness programs  so am trying to eliminate debt as fast as possible.",finance

WA state if it matters.

Have signed an intent to proceed with a refinance from an online lender.

Their online portal has a ""You have 10 days to achieve loan approval!!"" ticker that stresses me out. Generally an all around bad experience. Hard to reach on phone and e-mail.

My sister offered me a custom whole life plan where she will pay for it for 10 years while I am in school. The premium runs about 6-7k a year if I remember correctly for a million dollars. Looking at the numbers she ran I would pay until I’m about 45 and afterwards it seems like the cash value grows much faster and by that age I would no longer need to contribute.

personalfinance,Rethinking the Math on the Company Match when you have CC Debt,"I was reading an article  where a person was asking Dave Ramsey whether to give up the 401k match to pay off CC debt faster.  Normally I dismiss DR pretty quickly, after all, ""Always take the match, it's free money"" is one of the basics of this sub.  But he got me thinking about something.

&amp;#x200B;

Shouldn't you factor in how long it will take you to pay off the debt otherwise as well as the interest rate?  The key reason being that it while it's a 100% return, that's also only a one time return.  After that, it grows at the market rate while your debt grows at a presumably higher CC rate.  Eventually those two lines will intersect and you should have paid down the CC instead.  The same calculation should exist for all debt, Credit Card debt just makes the case most obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take two scenarios. 

**Background:** You have $50k of credit card debt at 25%.  It's a massive amount, but you're paying it down at $1200 a month.  At this rate, it'll take you about 8.25 years to pay off this card( [Debt Calculator](https://www.vacu.org/learn/your-credit/debt-management/how-long-will-it-take-to-pay-off-my-credit-card?CURRENTBALANCE=50%2C000.00&amp;PAYMENT=1%2C200.00&amp;INTERESTRATE=25.000+&amp;COMPUTE=COMPUTE&amp;CALCULATORID=PC02&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.vacu.org_2&amp;PostBack=true#results) )

**Scenario A** \- You take the match.  Let's assume a contribution of $500 with a 100% match.  So that means you've taken $500, and immediately earned a 100% return.  However that money can't be used until retirement, and we'll assume it's invested earning 7% a year while invested.

**Scenario B** \- You walk away from the match.  Instead, you use the $500 to pay down credit card debt on the card and avoid 25% in interest payments.  That's $100 a year in interest that you don't have to pay.  Since you wouldn't have paid that particular $500 off without giving up the match, you can consider it the last $500 that would have been paid off. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Numbers:**

In the 401k, you've made a quick 100% profit, and that continues to grow over time.  So the $500 turned immediately into $1000, and grew at 7% for 8 Years.  At that point, it's now worth $1,718.  So by getting the match and investing, you Earned $1218 over 8 years.  

However at the same time, your credit card debt of $500 that you didn't pay off with that contribution has also grown.   It's been compounding all this time and that $500 piece of the total debt is now a $3,166 piece of debt.  That's an extra $2480 of interest expense.

&amp;#x200B;

**The take away:**

Yes, the company match is a very nice bonus, and most people should definitely take advantage of it.  But for those who are perpetually in debt, the one time benefit of the match doesn't outweigh the on going difference between the market's average return rate and the interest rate if you're going to be several years away from paying off the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

The exact break even point comes out to \[Match%\] / (\[CC%\]-\[Market Return%\]) in terms of years.  So for this example, it's 100%/(25%-7%) = 5.5 Years.  So if it would take you longer than 5.5 years to pay off the debt, you should be paying down your CC before taking the match.

&amp;#x200B;

*Note*: I have left the tax implications out of this example intentionally.  While they would ultimately be a part of the true decision, they would mostly confuse the math on the break even point, but would not eliminate the fact that there is a point where you're better off skipping the match.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, I have a very cushy 40 hour a week job. Never more than 40 and usually less. The job comes with health, 401k match and I generally enjoy my day to day. I also have a 10 federal holidays, 24 vacation days, 12 sick and unlimited management leave which would allow me to have a very healthy work life balance. I am not shy about using my unlimited leave so it is a true benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a side gig a few years ago which has decent income, healthy growth and minimal expenses. Most of the year I spend minimal time working but there are a few months of non-stop action. Additionally, I am on call for about 60 clients with daily emails. I receive a few emails a day with very simple requests but it makes it difficult for me to free myself from work as I am always on the clock.

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some notable stats:

&amp;#x200B;

**Age:** Young 30s

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets:** 

House at purchase price $173k

Cash: $23k

Investments: $209k (includes retirement and brokerage)

&amp;#x200B;

**Liabilities:**

Mortgage: $105k

**NW:** $300k

  
**Income:**

Full time Job: $110

Gig: $50

Rental income on 2nd house: $10k

&amp;#x200B;

My lifestyle is pretty cheap so I am able to save some good money. I am able to save approximately $55k of my full time job income (includes match) and all of the gig income less expenses and taxes. This represents approximately an additional savings of $35k a year. I do not think the additional savings brings me any fulfillment.

devops,How do you flag features in your codebase?,"I am an engineering manager at a 30 person startup in New York. Recently, we found a last minute bug in our code as we were preparing a deployment for our biggest client. This happened on a Friday after everyone left, so I begun to message each engineer individually (9 staffed on this project) to track down the source of the bug and figure out a solution. Luckily, it only took an hour to figure out where the bug was occurring and which engineer had originally developed the code for it.

This ordeal made me think about a better way to manage dependancies in code - specifically, some system to keep track of WHO has special knowledge about a specific feature in our codebase.

At any given moment, I have a general idea of who is working on what, but I don't know who is working on what parts, i.e. Bob and Charlie might both be working on a billing system together, but I don't know which one of them is working on the DB models and which one is working on the Stripe API.

Git Blame is a theoretical solution to this problem, but it is only useful once I have isolated a bug to a specific point in the code. Ideally, I would like a Git Blame-like system at the repo level so that I (and my non-technical colleagues) can quickly track down which engineers are responsible for specific features in my codebase.

I was checking my online banking to see what my new monthly repayments would be, and was surprised to see that the amount has not changed (even though my interest rate has been lowered). 

I contacted my bank and was told that there is a tolerance of $50 per month, meaning they don't bother to alter the minimum repayment amount if the difference is less than $50.  The reason for that decision is avoid the bank sending me a letter every month advising of a lower repayment amount.  Each repayment I make would cause my next payment to reduce slightly, therefore causing the bank to be legally required to send me a letter advising of that fact. 

I have 2 queries:

1. Does it actually matter if my repayment amount hasn't changed? My interest rate is definitely lower and I'm fine paying more than the minimum to help pay off the loan faster. I wasn't planning on reducing the amount I physically pay anyway. 
2. Can someone please ELI5 - Why would my repayment amount be different every month if the bank did not have this $50 tolerance?

Whereas they would on paper be renting their house from me, they would in turn pay their portion of the new  mortgage for their house, and I would be paying the remaining mortgage on the old house (along with any additions i would like to make).

My issues with this is we have had a strained relationship in the past, to which she has made efforts to make amends in the passing years, she is just very controlling and invasive. It would also turn my 10 minute commute into an hour long commute. However I currently pay $1000/month in rent, and their mortgage is currently $750 including all related fees/taxes etc. And there are of course many positives to being in a home rather than renting. All in all my personal problems with her seem to be dwarfed by what I see as the positives on a personal level.

There are **5** pending cases to be decided by ruling today:

**[Department of Commerce v. New York](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf)**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, [5 U.S.C. 701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/701) et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. 

**[Lamone v. Benisek](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf)**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs’ claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as “undisputed” evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs’ years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

&gt; **Held: Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.** 

**[Rucho v. Common Cause](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf)**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolina’s 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

&gt; **Held: Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.** 

**[Mitchell v. Wisconsin](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-6210_2co3.pdf)**

&gt;Issue: Whether a statute authorizing a blood draw from an unconscious motorist provides an exception to the [Fourth Amendment](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992#145) warrant requirement.


&gt; **Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.** 

**Carpenter v. Murphy**

&gt;Issue: Whether the 1866 territorial boundaries of the Creek Nation within the former Indian Territory of eastern Oklahoma constitute an “Indian reservation” today under [18 U.S.C. § 1151\(a\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1151).

personalfinance,Lender claiming rate lock agreement void,"I am purchasing a new home in roughly one week.  I am using conventional financing.

At the beginning of June I signed a rate lock agreement with a lender locking in my interest rate. The agreement states that it is only valid for the program that I applied for, and that changing the program renders the agreement void.

Two weeks ago, I decided I wanted to make a larger down payment.  The lender said this was fine, then yesterday sent a new rate lock agreement that required me to pay points to get my previously-locked interest rate.

My interpretation of ""program"" is the type of loan, i.e. conventional, which has not changed.  The lender seems to be saying that any changes to any details of the loan count as a change to the program, voiding the initial rate-lock agreement.

I've asked that paying the points be waived, and my loan officer has ""raised this issue with management.""

The rate lock agreement hinges on the interpretation of ""program,"" so I realize there's probably no ""right"" answer as to what it means.  I was more wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience with this, and was specifically wondering about threatening a cfpb complaint.  If I threaten that, is the lender able to withdraw their offer of financing one week before closing?  I've supplied everything required by the committment letter, but that letter also says they can withdraw the offer if ""any of the conditions set forth in the attached pages are not satisfactory to the bank."" Which, to me means they could just change their mind, since all those conditions come *from* the bank.  

As much I think the lender is in the wrong, I am very happy with the purchase price of the house and if it comes down to it would be willing to pay the ~$700 in points for this purchase to still happen.

Update: the higher-ups waived the points fee after I complained about the ambiguous wording.  Thanks everyone for your responses.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans using my car savings?,"Efund: $10k  
Car savings: $15k  
Student loans: $11.2k, 3.5-4% interest rates

The car I'm planning to buy will be $20-24k OTD, depending on mileage/options. I'm not imminently in need of an upgrade but it's something I have an eye towards and I'd definitely like to have a new car by this time next year, at the latest. Currently driving an 06 Impreza with 155k miles that's in decent shape but has some rust starting on the roof (No idea how) and I have a 25 mile one way, all highway commute that the the car is not ideally suited to (Loads of road and wind noise).

I don't like that spending the car savings would set me back a couple years of saving (mentally) and it'd rob me of the ability to jump on a good deal on a car if I found one. That being said, in the worst case scenario where I pay off the loans and my car gets totaled the next day, I would be able to go get the car and I wouldn't be in a significantly different position from where I'd be if I decided to buy it today. That being said, the only payoff on paying the loans immediately is ~1.75%, the difference between the loans and my savings account. Losing out on that isn't the end of the world.

Any thoughts on the way to go here?

A couple more details:
$75k salary, $3300 take home after a 20% 401(k) contribution and assuming 2 checks per month  
$2250 minimum monthly expenditure (besides loans). Might go lower if I get another roommate. Currently paying $500/mo or a little more into the loans",finance

personalfinance,I got this idea about taking on student debt to build up cash and a investment portfolio,"I know you should not invest with debt, but hear me out. 

Ok, I’ll try to explain this as good as possible. And I need advice if this idea will work out or not.

I’m going back to school this year, what means I can take a student loan of max 1k per month, what will work out to 48k in 4 years of my school career. If I took on this debt of 48k with at the moment a interest rate of 0% ( this can change every 5 years ), I could build up 40k ( I would save the other 8k in cash ) of investment portfolio. I would get 1k every month which I will put 833€ in my portfolio for 4 years straight ( I will work on the side and will life of that money ). 

So now I will have 48k of debt spread in to 8k cash and 40k in a portfolio. And I was thinking of paying of the debt with dividend I would get from my 40k portfolio. 

I have to pay the 48k debt in 35 years, so that would be around 114€ per month for 35 years. Could I make 114€ of dividend every month with a 40k portfolio and pay of my debt with my portfolio? 

Worst case I will have to pay 114€ per month for 35 years and my 40k portfolio will be worthless and have 8k in cash.

Best case I will have a portfolio of 40k that will pay of my debt and have 8k in cash. And my portfolio will be growing in that 35 years I will pay of my debt.

This is just a idea I had and don’t know if this is a good idea or not, just want to know what some of you think about this.",finance
personalfinance,Received Notice of Tax Due with a Late Estimated Payment Penalty. Can I request a penalty waiver?,"Howdy folks, hoping I can get some advice from you fine people.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Backstory: In 2018 I was on a grad school fellowship that did not take any taxes out. I calculated the money that would normally be taken out and saved it myself for tax season, not realizing that underpayment penalties were a thing and I apparently should have filed quarterly. In early Feb 2019 I filed my federal and state (IL) taxes and paid everything in full.

&amp;#x200B;

Today: I received a Notice of Tax due from IL with a Late Estimated Payment Penalty that I assume is another name for an underpayment penalty. I've never been penalized before and am hoping it can be waived if I say the right things to the right people. I realize I should have been more informed on this, but frankly I think it's a little ridiculous given how early I paid everything in full.

personalfinance,Can I Lower Interest Rates on an Auto Loan?,"Hello, bear with me on this as I'm not too educated on auto loans and financing- about a year ago I acquired a 2013 Kia Optima through Carmax and make monthly payments on it at an interest rate of 12.45%. I have made all my payments on time and possess a credit score somewhere in the 700's (I'm not sure how much that affects auto loan interest rates). 12.45% is incredibly high I feel, even for a used car.

Is there a way I can contact Carmax and negotiate lowering the interest rate? If not, is it possible to transfer the loan to another company or credit union for a lower rate? Is that a thing? Thanks again.

personalfinance,"19 y/o with Unique Financial Position, Need Advice","Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I am a 19 year old that has just finished his first year at college. I received a full ride that includes money for books, housing, food, and other expenses. Starting next year, I will receive a check that is equal in value to what it would cost a student at my university to stay in the dorms (hilariously overpriced). This means that I will have a guaranteed source of income that will easily cover my rent, with more than enough left over for food and entertainment. I have enough money in a college savings account to cover a large portion of, if not all of a masters degree, depending on where and if I pursue one (my major, aerospace engineering, doesn't strictly require it in industry).

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to purchase a car with money that was liquidated from a college savings account along with earnings from past summer jobs, so I don't foresee any major purchases until at least after college; my biggest expense is rent. In addition, I have $2k saved in a high interest rate savings account that acts as an emergency fund for any car repairs I may need. The car is fairly new so besides an unfortunate busted tire or something of the like, preventative maintenance and fuel are my only expenses there.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of investing, I opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard when I was 18 and made a $3k contribution towards it last fiscal year as I was unsure of how much money I had earned at my job last summer. This year, I am on track to contribute the max amount of $6k. I have been dollar cost averaging my contributions every month in order to hit this mark. I am in a position to make the max contribution every year from here on out through income from internships and any money remaining from the aforementioned check used to pay my rent.

&amp;#x200B;

My internship this year pays a gross profit of $11,760, with the \~20% tax rate that is taken off each paycheck this comes out to $9,408 net profit, with a $3,300 stipend (after taxes) given to me for living expenses; bringing it up to $12,708 net. Rent, food, and utilities will cost me $4464 this summer so I will have approximately $8,244 in take home. As mentioned before, $6k of this will then go towards my Roth IRA so I have $2,244 extra money.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do with these very fortunate circumstances that I have been lucky enough to receive? I have been reading about investing for the last year and a half, but don't feel as if I'm nearly advanced enough to stick my neck out beyond my Roth IRA. I'm aware that people almost always overestimate their tolerance for risk, but I don't feel as if I would be wrong to say that mine is pretty high, as I essentially have an ""emergency fund"" that covers my expenses for the next three years at a minimum. I don't want to be stupid and lose my shirt immediately because of this, but I'm covered if I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't plan on getting a massive mortgage once I settle down, either keeping it small or building a tiny home where I can pay in full. Either way, I have a solid credit history for my age with 2 credit cards I use for necessary expenses and the perks that come with them. I plan on adding a card without annual fees every 3-4 months to help build my credit over the long term. NerdWallet lists my credit score as a 754, which I'm aware is inaccurate when it comes to a hard inquiry pulled by the bank or the credit card company, but is still a good starting point in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance is greatly appreciated. I've stuck to mutual funds for their reliability over the long term so far. I've heard talk of a market crash soon, but I know that a lot of this is speculative and people have been crying that the sky is falling since the dawn of time.

personalfinance,What time of year to open a mutual/index fund?,"Hi everyone, this is my first post in this subreddit! I apologize in advance if I don't use correct terminology. Thanks in advance for your help and advice!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been investing since 2012 after I graduated from undergrad and started my first full-time job. I started off with my 401k and Roth IRA, and then opened my first non-retirement fund in 2013. I have always opened new funds in January of any year because prices tend to be the lowest of the new year after December price drops from end-of-year distributions. This has generally worked well for me, as my initial investments ranged from $1,000 to $3,000 for each of my mutual funds. If I buy low at the beginning of the year, then I would be buying more shares than if I purchased $3,000 worth of shares later in the year, and these ""additional"" shares would be worth more as prices increase as the year progresses.

&amp;#x200B;

My current conundrum is that in earlier this month (June 2019), I found a few index funds that I would like to invest in. On one hand, I think that buying in at $3,000 for each initial investment at any point after the beginning of January would not take advantage of the low prices at the beginning of the year. When I factor in paying taxes on capital gains and dividends in December on money I didn't make for the entirety of the year, I am hesitant to open a new fund (mutual or index) until January of next year. On the other hand, opening these funds now may be better than waiting six months, as the value of my shares would appreciate as prices increase over time. My money sits in an Ally savings account (currently a 2.1% interest rate) until it gets used.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your recommendations? Should I continue to only open new funds in January, or should I open new funds as soon as I've done my due diligence in research?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to add that after I buy into a fund, I contribute to it on a monthly basis. The way I wrote my original post, it seemed like I only invest the initial minimum amount and then let it sit in perpetuity.",finance

One of the jobs I might do at job #2 only pays $5.00 + tips, so for making a stricter budget let's assume that's my base pay.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also an extra $10 taken out of my paycheck (per my request) for federal and state taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, things I owe:

Credit Card Debt: $40.14

This credit card is used for, Emergencies, gas, and groceries. I am new to credit so the interest rate is 18% with a $500.00 limit. I am aware that I should not at all reach my limit and only spend roughly $150.00 in credit at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

Student Loan debts:

Sallie Mae: I currently owe $19,285.12

My interest rate is 11.375% with interest accruing before I graduate because it was apparently overall ""cheaper""

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky in that my folks are helping me pay student debt, but I want to be able to help pay some myself because it's my debt that *I* took out for school.

&amp;#x200B;

Great Lakes: I currently owe $4,120.00.

My interest does not accrue until I graduate, and I don't have to start making payments until 2023 but the sooner I can start the better.

&amp;#x200B;

My College: I currently owe $2,490

There is no interest amount, I broke my contract for my dorm housing because it was cheaper to rent with friends then it was to live in the dorm for another year.

&amp;#x200B;

The last debt that I am aware of is I owe my roommate for this coming fall roughly $1,000.00

She decided to pay off our housing deposit and needs repaid for it, so that's what I am going to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now What I Have:

&amp;#x200B;

Checking Account 1: $37.91

Savings Account 1: $22.66

&amp;#x200B;

Checking Account 2: $46.67

Savings Account 2: $55.76

&amp;#x200B;

In cash from making tips at my jobs I have $76.00.

&amp;#x200B;

Other money I have saved currently and why:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to study abroad in Europe in the 2020-2021 school year. I currently have $350.00 saved up and would like a % of my budget to be put towards this. I plan on being able to work overseas if I study abroad, but having savings to help pay for tuition, meal plan, and other expenses would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I need to be able to budget for rent for my upcoming year of school.

My rent for me will be $212.50

I also need to have money saved for groceries and honestly, I have a lot going on and I'm not totally sure on how to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried spreadsheets and all that jazz but I'm not the best at setting things up. My parents know how money works and are always willing to help me- but I want to do my best to become independent from them so I don't have to constantly rely on them for everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So financial reddit, if you're willing to help- what is the best way for me to start?

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Bought a car with my spouse and there was a large discrepancy between credit scores,"My husband and I bought a car recently and I was the cosigner on the loan. I'm not sure how interest rates with these kinds of loans work, so I signed on just in case we could get a better rate with both our incomes. We both keep a pretty close eye on our credit scores - his is 816 and mine when I last checked was 742 (FICO from Discover-less than 1 month ago).

When they brought back the credit check, his was 816 and mine was **659**. I don't know much about credit scores but I feel like thats a pretty big discrepancy. I noted that to the salesman but he said that it wouldn't affect the interest rate we would get since I was just a cosigner. I checked on Experian the next day and the average between Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian was 729, and there wasn't anything out of the ordinary on my credit report. I haven't opened any new lines of credit recently, but I was just approved for a higher line of credit on one of my cards.  

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't say anything more at the time, but I'm worried I should have. I'm also worried that something is wrong with my credit. Is this a normal thing that happens? And should I be concerned that we got a worse rate on the loan because of this? Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,High interest savings account recommendations,Hi. I've been banking with Marcus by GS for just over two years and haven't had the best experience.

Thanks for any help.,finance
personalfinance,Is a checking line of credit something my mom really can't take off her record herself?,"So, a few years ago, my mom opened line of credit for my selfish grandfather. He came to my mom on a Friday saying the county was going to take his home on Monday if he didn't pay property taxes. He doesn't work and bummed off his mom( who is now deceased) his whole life, so of course he couldn't pay it.

Anyway, she got this checking line of credit account for 7,000, and my grandad didn't make payments on it like he said he would. So my mom paid it off in the hopes to get it off her account sooner. She now wants to close the line, but Navy Federal (our bank) said my mom cannot get the account off her account unless he closes HIS bank account. Which means he can still run it up at anytime he wants and it still affects her credit score even just sitting there.

Why can't she remove it herself? Why must he close his bank account to remove the line of credit? What if that's something he's not willing to do (closing a bank account IS a hassle, after all) and would rather just keep it or run it up? If it is true she can never get him off her credit without his consent, thats worse than marriage at that point.",finance

The interest rate is also higher than other offers I've been receiving. I am worried that closing the card will negatively impact my credit score. If I close it, should I wait before applying for a better card? If you need any other info, I'll do my best to provide it.",finance
personalfinance,"I have a mortgage that can reach over 70% of my income, but I don't really feel like I'm in over my head. Am I delusional?","Let's get the numbers out of the way first. My monthly take-home pay varies depending on how much overtime I take but is bolstered by a $730 partial disability check from the VA. I'm making between $3,600-$5,150.

I bought a home in May 2018 for $318,000 using the VA loan, which means I didn't put any money down. The entire cost of the 15-year mortgage is on my lap and comes to $2,600 a month (well, $2,581 but I pay extra principle to round it up). 

With some 2+2=4-1 that's 3 quik maffs, that leaves me with between $1,000 and $2,550 to spend on literally everything else. That means that my mortgage makes up between 72% and 51% of my income. But somehow I still think I'm doing alright... Why is this?

I have no debt. I drive a 2010 car that's paid off and has all the original parts. I'm still putting in the same $300 to an Edward Jones Roth IRA that I been for 8 years. I also have an $800 emergency fund and about 5k in my individual portfolio. My monthly expenses aren't that bad (maybe like 60$ between Netflix, Spotify, and Patreon), and I keep myself well fed on chicken, beans, and rice. I haven't missed a payment in over a year.

I say to myself often that I'm technically putting $1,300 a month on the principle and that on its own puts me above a ton of people in my age group. But still, I can't invest any extra for my retirement (or power the emergency fund), which I really want to do because I know how insanely powerful compound interest can be. I still have to wait for the end of the month to roll around so I can get the partial disability check before I can actually make my payments. And I'm very worried that if the worst happened and I ended up unable to work for a while that I'd almost certainly end up losing the house because a $2,600 monthly payment would wipe out my savings in like 3 months or less.  

I know this has been a long post but I could really use some clarity from people who aren't friends. Am I deluding myself with this mortgage or am I fine so long as I make sure to live frugally for a while?",finance

personalfinance,Advice for Refinancing Student Loans,"TL:DR: Fiance has high interest loans we want to try and refinance and we are looking for options after being told we will be rejected by SoFi for ""not enough cash flow""

&amp;#x200B;

My Fiance and I, are trying to refinance loans, hers have higher interest than mine and we really want to get them to a manageable level. 

Here is what has happened thus far:

Her debt after college was is about $80000, split between a few Sallie Mae loans (the only place that didn't reject her with her nonexistent credit history) with an average Interest of about 10%

She landed a decent job at about 22 an hour in January, which was great except that Sallie Mae is saying her minimum payments for a 20 year plan totals over $1400 a month. That's about half of her income BEFORE taxes.

She has some federal loans (totally only a few thousand and at low interest rate with monthly payments in the low hundreds )

She recently with my help has paid off some outstanding medical debt from when she was a teenager. She no longer has any derogatory marks on her credit score and it has gone up a surprising amount of points, shes at about 680 Transunion and 685 Equifax as of 2 months ago.

A couple of days ago she tried applying for Sofi to try and refinance and consolidate her Sallie Mae loans with a cosigner who makes a substantial amount more than her (over 3x to be exact), they called her today to say that her pay stub wasn't enough ""proof of cash flow"" and that her application would be rejected because there was not enough shown.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this mean they are saying her and her cosigner do not have enough income to take out a loan with them? what are our other options for trying to accomplish this goal? are there more lenient loan services we could refinance with that I am unaware of?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is extremely appreciated

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info: I make enough to cover our other bills (rent, utilities, etc), and we both contribute to food and other essentials(hygiene products and cleaning supplies etc.). I would like to help her out to make these payments but don't have enough after these expenses and my own student loans to be able to help her at this time. We both have credit cards but don't put much on them and pay them on time every month (she pays a car payment on her card and I pay the internet bill and buy groceries on my card)

If the utility company doesn’t continue the program the 2 units would end up costing me 3-5k. But if they do continue the program I could potentially be making 7k (assuming another 10k payback in five years)

personalfinance,New dentist with 130k worth of student loans,"Hello everyone, I am asking for advice on what to do when it comes to managing my debt in the most responsible way. Loans are federal and are set at about 6.5%. 

First let me say I will be working in the public health sector, receiving 135k/yr.  After 3 years of working, the national student loan reimbursement program will pay off 50k of my student loans. And every subsequent year will reward me with 25k loan reimbursement.  Not sure how long I will be working in this job, but right now I plan on staying in at minimum 3 years.  This program will only reimburse federal loans, so refinancing is not an option for me at this time.

I originally wanted to pay my loans off aggressively so that when the 50k came in, that would be the last chunk. Then I would focus on investing. 

I recently met with a financial adviser. He advised me to instead pay the loans off minimally and to put the difference in what I would be paying into a non-retirement (backup) acct with the idea that I would allow the 50k and then the 25k to come in, and at that point I could dip into this backup acct to pay of the rest.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,[Question] Father's Old Student Loans,"Just for some context, this is for the US. My mom is a US citizen and father is a green card holder. My father had some federal student loan debts since obtaining his PhD back in like 1980's. Since then my parents have moved to another country, but they have been making small monthly payments towards the student debts. That is, until 2012 when apparently the debt had switched creditors/loan agencies numerous times and my dad no longer received any correspondence regarding the debt through the mail. They're not sure what balance remains or how to even begin paying off the debt. Is there anything they should do to settle this debt or is there anything else they need to do?",finance
personalfinance,How to Finance MBA Education - Consolidating Credit Card Debt + Living Expenses + Program Costs,"I've just been accepted to my dream program in Spain for an MBA and now looking at financing options for the MBA program. I've had a really bumpy ride over the past 10years due to personal mental health, so I have literally nothing to my name and this is the only option for me to move forwards into a better life, better work options, a career that I am passionate about, and an increased salary in a country I want to live in (for a while at least.)

**I have the following to my name...**

* 19,000 USD of Credit Card Debt with Chase Bank
* £0 of Savings / no Roth, No IRA / ETC

**I need to cover the following (total 140k EURO)....**

* Consolidate 19,000 USD of Credit Card Debt
* Cover 80,000 EURO for Program Costs (1 half due in October 2019 / the other in October 2020)
* Cover 45,000 EURO for Living Expenses (includes 19 months of expenses calculated out)

I will have an internship in the summer for 3-4 months which would give me at least 20-40,000 EURO

My parents will pay for the initial deposit of 10k which reduces the total amount a bit.

**The School says they have the following funding options but are there any others available??**

* Banco Sabadell for up to 80% of the program cost
* Prodigy Finance Loans for 100% of program cost
* Sallie Mae Loans for up to 100% of program cost
* US FEDERAL LOANS (These are available but I DONT WANT to use these - because the US GOVT has a very unfair rule of prohibiting me from doing a 3month exchange into ANY US MBA if I use their loans)
   *  Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and Federal Direct PLUS Loan would be offered if I give up my right to exchange for 3 months.

**I have the following questions**

* Anyone have experience with Banco Sabadell, Prodigy, Sallie Mae? 
   * Fixed or Variable Rate?
   * Should I get my retired parents to co-sign?
* Anyone know how I can get a loan to cover living expenses? 
   * I have a  GOOD credit score - above 700 (730 TU / 715 EQ)

personalfinance,Authorized User Removal,"Hello all! I made a post a few days ago about me and my wife buying a new car and our financial status. I mentioned that I am an authorized user on someone’s credit line and the account went south and my credit took a hit because of it. I’d like to know how my credit would be affected if I were to call and remove myself from that account. 

So a little back story on what happened there, the account owner went over their credit limit and my score dropped from 720 to around 600. I have built it back to 644. They have since kept their credit utilization around %95 percent if not a little higher. The account age is 5 years or a little more. 

I have an open line of credit with a borrower with 40% utilization and working to pay it down quickly, and student loans. The oldest account would be my loans at 3.75 years. 

So my question is, how would my credit score change if I were to remove myself from the other persons account, or if there is a way to figure it out without simply doing so. I don’t want to remove myself and my credit tank again so I can get a decent interest rate on an auto loan.

I'll be making my 12th consecutive payment on Monday on my private student loans financed through Discover at a variable interest rate currently sitting at about 10.3%. What would my best options be for lowering my interest rate? I'm paying over $600 / month for a minimum payment and would like to free up some cash flow. I never finished college and when I looked into a few of the big names I see advertised such as Sofi, it appeared that a requirement for refinancing was a college degree. Are there options that don't have a degree as a prerequisite?

investing,How do Bond ETFs respond to the fed rate being raised or cut?,"In a vacuum we know from basic finance principles that a single bond will decrease in value with an increase in the risk free rate, and vice versa.

How does this logic apply to an ETF? Specifically, I hold VCLT for long-term corporate bonds as a way to keep some of my portfolio on the sidelines while still getting 4.5% dividends with low risk.

I wouldn't expect a fed rate cut to immediately jump the share price of VCLT. Some of their bonds are coming due all the time while others are still maybe 20 years out. And I'm sure they buy/sell before expiry all the time as well.

Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Why can't I open a bank account?,"UPDATE: So the good news is I was able to open a checking account. The bad news is that the savings account I applied to still gave me the ""we couldn't verify your identity"" denial even though they made me give them my driver's license information in addition to my SSN, so I'm calling the bank when they open tomorrow to hopefully get that cleared up. Plus, all three of the checks I tried to deposit to my checking account got rejected from the bank for some reason. I re-submitted just one of them after taking the picture on a darker background, so fingers crossed. I don't know if the check issue is at all related to the inability-to-open-an-account issue, but honestly this whole situation has been really bad for my mental health. Gaining some amount of financial independence is a really important step for me to start living my own life away from my parents' control, and it feels like the universe is doing everything in its power to keep me from that...

--

I'm looking to open a new bank account. I currently have a joint account with one of my parents at a major bank. (I don't want to say which one to protect my identity, but if it's necessary I can mention it in the comments.) But since my parents have been abusive to me in the past, part of which involves them taking all of my money from my bank account, I want to protect the money I'm earning at my job from them. I applied for a checking and savings account through my current bank (all of the accounts have the same login info), but since I realized my parent would probably still be able to have access to those accounts, I started looking to get an account at a different bank instead.  



The problem is, I keep getting denied. I've applied to both major banks (different from my current one, obviously) and smaller ones with higher interest rates. I got a report from ChexSystems, but no ""incidents"" or anything showed up on the report, which I believe is a good sign. And I have a 750+ credit score, so I don't think it's that, either. The only other thing I can think of is that my multiple bank account applications are somehow raising red flags, but even my very first application got rejected, and I haven't sent in, like, potential-scammer levels of applications or anything (maybe 4-5 over a 3-month period).  



I don't have a steady year-round job and I'm not financially independent since I'm a 20-year-old college student. But I didn't think that was necessary to open a bank account. I do have an internship this summer, and I literally have over $1000 in paychecks that I'm just *waiting* to deposit somewhere.  



Thanks in advance for your help! I'm seriously out of ideas.  

EDIT from comments: Also, I forgot to mention that there might be something weird going on with my social security number, since my electricity company wasn't able to make my account online and it sounded like they had to go through some extra verification steps to get it approved over the phone. But I never found out what it was.",finance

Just a heads up for anyone who has Fed Loans. Make sure you're on the standard payment plan.

personalfinance,First time home buyer. Need advice on manufactured home mortage.,"First time home buyer here looking for advice and best way to move forward. We are looking at purchasing a used manufactured home on approximately 3 acres of cleared land. Property is fenced and includes a barn and small shed. This property is neighboring two other properties that belong to my immediate family. The home is was placed on a permanent foundation in 1990. Seller told me the property was last appraised at $113k.

We have negotiated a price of $65k with the seller and I will be paying closing costs. No real estate agents will be involved. Most banks I have talked to will not finance a used manufactured home or will only do a 10-15 year mortage and I have been told that it is not eligible for an FHA loan. The average interest rate I have been quoted has been 6% from local banks. Monthly payment with all taxes/insurance would be around $800+. A 10% down payment would be required. I felt that this was a bad deal and would stretch out budget and savings too thin. 

I found another lender through online searches that specializes in manufactured homes. After going over all the details they pre-approved me for a $70k loan on this property. They are offering an FHA loan with 3.5% down at a 4.7% interest rate. They also quoted prices on appraisal and foundation inspections. All told they said that I would likely need to bring around $9k to the closing table up front. Which is doable but also stretching my savings.

They mentioned increasing the selling price to $69k and having the seller issue a ""credit"" of $4k to me to use towards closing costs, reducing my upfront cost to $5k. They quoted my monthly payment as being $590 for 30 years if we raised price to $69k. 

Basically I just want to know if this all sounds right and if it is likely best deal I will get. As stated, this is my first time buying property so I dont know much about it. I have stable income and a 758 credit score. Any and all opinions are welcome and appreciated. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,I don't want to fall down the same hole with my credit cards again.,"Hello, Until recently, I had 4 credit accounts with very high-interest rates(20-30 percent), and I was able to receive some assistance from a parent in the form of a balance transfer for no interest for a year. I am a broke college student, who will have a job come fall, and I fully intend to pay off the loan with my parent. My question is whether the effects of closing these accounts would be too detrimental for the benefit of no longer having that available credit which I feel I may not be able to resist.

personalfinance,“Credit card modification”,"Hello all. I’ll be blunt, I’m drowning a bit in unsecured debt. I cannot consolidate into a lower interest rate as my DTI is high and credit score low.
A company is offering this program to negotiate a lower pay off and I pay them monthly and in debt free in 42 months rather than 40 years and I’m sure at least some of you have heard of this.
I have significant concerns.
It sounds too good to be true.
I would stop paying the creditors and start paying into a fdic trust that they would then use to pay off the negotiated amount.
This sounds like me not paying and sounds like it’ll ruin my already terrible credit.
The monthly payment they offer is significantly lower than the minimums I have now and as I’m having trouble with those, this looks tempting.
But something tells me this might be snake oil and could make my situation worse.

personalfinance,Is refinancing or trade in is better ?,"Hi everyone, it’s my girlfriend’s car. She came to the U.S 2 years ago so she’s new to everything. Since she had no credit back then, about a year ago, but she needed a car. She bought a 2015 Totoya Rav4 for 17 grands, with all the taxes and fees, it added up to around 20k-ish, with, according to her, around 30% interest rate. She has been paying around 350$ per month for a year now. 
So what is her best option here? Just go to the bank and try to refinance to a lower rate? Or trade it in for a cheaper car (and how does this work by the way, if someone can explain, it’d be very helpful) 
The cars with the same year and probably same spec are around 14k$ around where we live. 
Any advices would help. Thank you",finance

investing,Rates go down = Bond ETF value goes up?,"I want to confirm my understanding. If the federal reserve lowers interest rates it will mean new issue federal debt will pay less and will trickle out causing other new bonds to lower. This will inflate the value of currently held, higher interest bonds. In medium/long term overall bonds will yield less payout.

If interest goes up, the value of held bonds reduces as new bonds with higher rates come out. In medium/long term bonds overall will have a higher yield.

I'm currently invested in corporate junk bind ETF (JNK) which has annual dividends around 6% and a share price at $109. So if interest drops the share price should go up, but disbursements will go down after a year+ as new bonds enter the ETF. If interest goes down the share price goes down but in a year+ disbursements go up.

Is this the right overall assessment?


EDIT: it seems I understand the relation between bonds and general interest rates but not what the ""fed rate"" is and how it affects the bond market. Hitting the books again, thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Improving a Credit Score by Paying off Debt with a Personal Loan?,"I managed to stay out of any credit card debt through college, but made some poor choices after I moved to a new city and signed a lease on an apartment I really couldn't afford. I've since downsized and am living within my means again and slowly paying down my debt. The debt is spread out across a three cards and a car loan (A Discover card with $6,335.80 @ 17.240%, a Capital One Card with $6,879.2 @ 25.240%, a Wells Fargo Card with $622.09 @  26.24%, and my car loan,  $890.25 @ 6.04%). I've been using the snowball method to pay down my Wells Fargo card and should have it, as well as my car loan paid off in October based on a debt reduction spreadsheet I've been using for the last year.   


While I've never missed a payment and have some pretty old accounts, my credit score is hovering in the 630s due to the Discover Card and the Capital One Card being basically at their limits. My question is essentially: would it behoove me to get a loan to pay off one (or both?) of my remaining cards after I've paid off my car loan? I've read that your score can actually drop once a loan is paid off, as credit scorers like to see multiple lines of credit. I might also be able to get a better interest rate? Or should I keep just doing what I'm doing and not make things more complicated? Just funnel those payments I was making to my loan/Wells Fargo card into that high interest Capital One Card?

personalfinance,"PAYE Plan- $250,000 in debt -FedLoan totally unhelpful","Hi All,

My primary question is if there’s anything I should be doing that I’m not doing. Also my $0 payments seem too good to be true and I think there’s a mistake somewhere, though FedLoan Servicing says there isn’t.

I graduated with an advanced degree and $250,000 in debt. I currently make $70k/yr, and that is expected to increase to probably $100k or so over the next 5-6 years. I consolidated my loans and am eligible for the PAYE repayment plan, under which I currently make $0 payments towards. I also qualify for PSLF, and I hope these payments count towards that. 

I’ve made these “payments” for 4 months now. Because I make $70k/year, $0 payments don’t seem right. So I contacted FedLoan, who told me that the payments are based on my 2017 tax return. I was a student at that time and making like $20k per year. 

They told me that my payments would update based on my 2018 return next year (in 2020), when I recertify. However, they said that I could have my payments updated to my current income “if I wanted to.” (Why wouldn’t they use my 2019 tax return in 2020??) 

So, I am really confused. Should I just leave the payments as they are? Update to my income? Is there any benefit to doing that? Is this complex enough to seek out a professional or am I missing something?

Also complicating things- I just got married (he has very little debt, similar income), and I have no idea how that will impact this situation.

personalfinance,401k/Roth contribution questions- forgive my basicness,"I'm posting here because I can't get a clear answer from my HR/401K people at my new job, nor my (what I now realize is a crappy) personal financial advisor I've used from an old job I had 15 years ago. Forgive me if this is in anyway against the posting rules, but I am completely befuddled. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the 2019 contribution limits is $19,500 for a 401k. What I'm not clear on is if contributions to my personal ROTH IRA counts against that $19,500 or if it's part of the $6000 limit for 2019. Like, I seriously cannot get or find a straight answer if I can do both $19,500 to 401ks AND $6K to IRAs?

&amp;#x200B;

My quandary is in part due to taking out $4837.70 from a failing Index fund toe dip I took with aforementioned crappy financial advisor and putting it into my ROTH IRA.  Last year I put in $5k as an experiment to try and figure out what the hell Index Funds can do, he put them in under performing funds for a 1.5 years and I got fed up last month and had him take what was left and put it all into my existing Roth IRA with his company. I was freelance for years and an old job of mine set up a SEP IRA with his company, which I still have. From this reddit group, I am now realizing I can just do a Vanguard on my own, but seriously, I had zero idea about any of that til this month.

personalfinance,Refinance Question,"Our history:

We bought our first house (376k in MN, valued at 400k) almost a year ago with a 4.375 VA Home loan. I was in the military for 5 years and honorably discharged with one combat deployment (For anyone wondering). My wife and I are both 34 years old.  I am an RN (got my license a year ago) and my wife is an elementary teacher (5 years) at the same school where our children go. We earn a combined 108k/yr with an average increase of 3% per year.  We both are currently at 8% contribution to employer retirement accounts with automatic increases of 1% per year until 15% is reached.

We have been receiving correspondence from our mortgage company about refinancing since the interest rate has dropped and they are offering as low as 3.490/3.570% APR.  They would not be requiring any additional verification or supporting documentation to do this.  

What we are thinking about doing is rolling our credit card debt into our refinance at the same time.  We have about 28k in credit card debt that is due to a first time home &amp; three kids under 8 years old who go to private school. We were renting a three bedroom townhouse prior to this. If we are able to roll our credit card debt into our mortgage we are hoping to free up some financial stress with the month-to-moth payments as well as a decreased interest rate.  We are also making lifestyle changes to reflect this decision and have already set up a monthly budget and cut costs where we can.

We have a few questions for you kind folks as all of the stuff we have been able to find online is a website that is owned by companies providing these products .

1. Besides turning unsecured debt into secured debt (which we understand) are there any other negative implications for rolling credit card debt into our mortgage?
2.  With this high of CC debt, we can't reasonably (at this point) see how we can accomplish the snowball/avalanche method. We have read Dave Ramsey recently and are motivated to use the methods he describes but would like to reduce stress and would rather pay down more on our mortgage at a time rather than revolving credit lines.  Is this a rational thought process?
3. Are there any additional options that anyone would suggest prior to us pulling the trigger on rolling CC debt into our mortgage?

We are grateful for reddit and this community for any and all insight into this situation. We will humbly take your advice into consideration and will for sure follow up on this post when our decision is made and the positive changes to our financial lives.  Thank you for your time!",finance

personalfinance,Questions about the appropriate time to refinance a VA home loan,"I took out a VA home loan about 2 years ago and bought a brand new house. In total I borrowed $467k with 4.0% interest and paid nothing down. Since then I've been consistently paying my $2500/month payments. Considering that renting an apartment in my area costs more than that nowadays, I feel pretty good about my decision.

I've been getting offers to refinance since the week I moved in, and have been discarding them. I look to see what the terms are, and typically they appear to be better than where I'm at (of course), but I never follow up.

I'm about to change jobs, and my salary will go from $103k to $95k. The benefits and work environment made the salary cut worth it for me, but I'm wondering if this qualifies as an appropriate time to refinance?

I can supposedly get a 3.25% interest rate but I probably have to borrow more than I need (they're offering a loan of $491k). Is there a conventional wisdom about this kind of thing?

Contrary to her, I am M 24, going for FIRE and an avid value/fundamentals investor. While I am happy to make my own long-term individual picks, I would not feel confident in making individual picks for her due to the shorter time frame in which she will need the money and the point in the market cycle that we are in.

If it were someone younger I would suggest DCA in ETFs (S&amp;P, Emerging, Total world...). BUT, I'm not sure if this is the right advice for her. Similarly I would normally suggest at her age to pile up on Government bonds but here in Europe the interest rates are abismal (&lt;1%). 

I think the first thing we will need to do is work out exactly what she has and what she is spending. This will give her an idea of how much longer her money will last. Then we need to work out what her budget will be and where to but allocate her capital.

Also the interest doesn’t go into the account, they cut the check to you directly. 

Is there a catch to this?

personalfinance,Should I get a personal loan to consolidate my $10K in credit card debt?,"I’ve (28/F/USA) been working toward paying off this debt for quite a few years, but I had some unexpected vet bills at the start of this year that has me right back where I started. 

I’m finding it very difficult to get back on track paying it off, as the interest is amounting to half my monthly payment, making my progress really slow to a crawl, and I would like to get a personal loan for $10K that would pay off nearly all of it. 

My credit score is only around 630-650, so I’m concerned I won’t get a good interest rate and it won’t help that much. I’m also a little nervous because part of the reason I’ve gotten myself into this mess is that I’m not great at sticking to a budget. I’ve been really working toward improving that with a new app I really like (Daily Budget), and it has me on a good pattern of not overspending.

I am comfortable making $500-650 payments each month and would love to pay it off in 18-24 months. Wondering if anyone has advice on how feasible this seems, how to go about it (I’ve never applied for a loan before) or if there are alternatives that would work better. Thanks in advance for any advice!!",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019","Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.

# **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/what-to-watch-in-markets-for-the-week-ahead-after-g-20-focus-shifts-to-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer.
*****
&gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act.
*****
&gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.”
*****
&gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise.
*****
&gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks.
*****
&gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%
*****
&gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer.
*****
&gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said.
*****
&gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate.
*****
&gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to.
*****
&gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna.
*****
&gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December.

# July 4th Market Returns

&gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.

&gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Week.png))**

&gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-Before.png))**

&gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19

&gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.

&gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco1.png))**

&gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.

# Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought

&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA.png))**

&gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.

# US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack

&gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.

&gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.

# July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time

&gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.

# Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and strength towards the end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fd24fdadfeace7c60e914f3ebcfb44c/tumblr_inline_pts3qnHGqq1spdppr_400.jpg))**

&gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #6 for DJIA and #7 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #8. NASDAQ has only advanced in six of the last twelve pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.

personalfinance,"My Comprehensive Personal Finance Strategy (Young, Single, Professional)","**Introduction**

Hi all, throw away because I'll be getting into some great detail about myself:

I just graduated college w/ a degree in engineering and began my first job a couple months ago. I've been lurking on this sub for about 6 months to cultivate a comprehensive personal finance strategy/budget/plan, and now that I've began work, I wanted to share with you all what I came up with. I think there are many young people that are in a similar situation as I am, just out of college w/ debt and their first job, so I hope the outlined strategy will inspire/inform others about where I'm headed and what I'm doing.   


Please feel free to comment advice/feedback/thoughts/criticisms as to where I could improve this plan.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* Education: Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering
* Age: 22
* Single. No kids. No pets.
* Living in a large city in the Northeast

**Finances**

* Income: $74k base pay gross, (end-of-year bonus TBD?)
* Side Hustle Income: $0 ... for now &gt;:|
* Debt: $23k @ 3.5-5.05% (all federal student loans)
* Savings+Checking: $5k
   * Open a High Yield Savings Account @ 2% interest rate
   * Open an account at a local Credit Card Union, just...cuz?
* Credit Score/Cards
   * Score: 710 (soft pull)
   * Three Cards: Chase from Amazon Prime (primary), my starter card from college, and a TJMaxx/Marshalls card

**Expenses**

* Annual Expenses: $31k = $24k + $7k
   * Projected Annual Living Expenses: $24k
      * Rent: $925/mo (I live with 2 other roommates)
      * Utilities: $110/mo (split with the 2 roommates)
      * Food: $350/mo (trying to drive this lower, meal prep hasn't been effective yet)
      * Transportation: $360/mo (train/bike commute, no car)
      * Home Entertainment (Audible, Spotify, Google Storage): $30/mo
      * Side Hustle Expenses (website+hosting+prototyping): $45/mo
      * Entertainment/Misc: $155/mo (honestly, this number is arbitrary and needs better calibration, I don't go out that much and when I do, its usually coffee/a book/ occasionally a concert)
      * Dental/Vision/Accident/LTD: $40/mo
      * Health Insurance: $0 (covered by parents plan)
      * Phone: $0 (covered by parents for next 2 years)

* Pursue a Master's degree (company contributes \~$10k/year)
* Left over Savings after expenses + investments: $20k/year
   * After emergency fund is established, I am planning on investing in real estate (house hack a condo/duplex)

**Other Info**

* Expecting a windfall between $10k-$40k sometime next year
* I'm in reasonably good health
* Side hustling a hardware startup, in the prototyping phase (specifically, it works-as-it-should, but it doesn't look-like-it-should) I don't calculate my finances based on this succeeding however. 
* Long term I plan to have my own company/design firm.
* I plan to be financially independent by, at the latest, 40, maybe not retire early however. This is greatly subject to change, but I'd like to get my PhD at some point
* Not really planning on marrying/having kids until I'm 28-34, who knows with that though.
* I don't feel like I'm living insanely frugal to the point of deprivation.  I'm a generally happy fella. I'm sure I could cut in some areas (looking at you food...it's so tempting to grab a bite in the city!)

Again, please feel free to comment advice/feedback/thoughts/criticisms as to where I could improve this plan! Did I forget something? Is there any glaring miscalculations/assumptions?",finance
personalfinance,"17 yrs old and possibly might have tax debt to pay by signing ""Exempt"" on w-4 for 3 years straight. What do I do now?","Hello there, I have been lurking on this sub for a while now and need clarification for the situation I am in. I was, (still kind of am,) completely clueless on taxes and would like some help understanding the topic and how much money I would possibly owe.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 I started my first job at the beginning of the summer and signed ""exempt"" on my w-4 since I am a dependent and I was expecting to make no more than the standard deduction for that year. A few months go by and my plans eventually changed because I was home schooled for that period of my life and decided to hold that job throughout the rest of the working year while working occasionally. I was not paying attention to the amount I made and I believe I made somewhere around 7,500$ in gross pay? (I will be returning to my first job to get paperwork to confirm this number.) 2017 rolled by and 3 things happened in that year.

1. I did not file for 2016 because I was unaware of this number
2. I did not submit an updated W-4 form to update my exempt status, (I have read that my employer would automatically switch my withholdings and would start pulling out money for federal withholding taxes but this did not happen, in that year it was still set to as if I were exempt, I.E. just medicare and social security.) Please help me understand what this means.
3. I also made about 7,500$ in gross pay that working year. (I have paperwork to prove this number)

&amp;#x200B;

Once again because I was unaware/was not paying attention I also didn't file for 2017. I started a new job in 2018 and signed ""exempt"" once again on my W-4 but only made about 4,000$ in gross pay. Should I worry about not having filed for 2018 either? Now that all of this has come to my attention I recently sat down, did the research, and made the proper corrections to my W-4 form moving forward. I want to pay whatever I owe ASAP, I am not attempting to evade taxes, I was just simply unaware of this situation that has recently come to my attention. I am worried and confused as to what to do next.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how much money would I possibly owe, how do I pay it off? maybe an idea for what I should gear up for to pay what I need? My other question would be, what steps should I take moving forward? any tips?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 17 years old, for the past 3 years I was signing exempt, made over the standard deduction for 2 years and forgot to submit an updated W-4 form to re-submit my exempt status. (I was unaware and completely clueless to my tax situation.)",finance
personalfinance,Anyone tried the savings account by Wealthfront?,"They offer a good interest rate but I wonder if it's riskier than a ""real"" bank? How legit is Wealthfront?

Wealthfront Brokerage conveys Cash Account funds to depository institutions that accept and maintain such deposits.

personalfinance,"My 529 might be overfunded, should I withdraw for K-12?","I posted a longer version of this to Bogleheads, asked financial advisors, read tons of posts &amp; articles, and still can't decide what I should do as I can't find a general consensus :(.  I have 3 kids, and all combined, their 529's have $589,000 in them.  The oldest has 3 years until college, and the youngest has 9 years.  The high schooler will graduate with 60 credits and an associates degree, and could very easily only have 2 years in college (advanced degree doubtful).

However, they've all been privately schooled K-8, and finishing that education is of utmost importance to us.  One has 2 years left, and the other has 5.  This huge expense used to be covered by my mom, but she recently died.  Much of my inheritance is in an IRA and real estate that wouldn't be smart to tap.

Continuing to cover the next 5 years of private school is doable, but a stretch and I will be drawing from taxable savings and investments.  Our state would tax earnings at 4.25%, even though it's exempt from Federal penalties/tax.  I figure the simplest choices are:

1) Just let it sit until the end just in case everyone goes to a $60k a year (today) 4 year school and maybe graduate studies. Probably includes some strategic change of beneficiaries for it to trickle down.

2) Wait a few years and reevaluate needs based on school progress and outlook, however then I lose up to the 2-5 years need of current tuition I could use the money for.

3) Withdraw up to $20k for the next two years and $10k thereafter (or not) and take a state tax hit of around $600/yr, which would allow us to use income/savings for household expenses and taxable investing.

I really don't want to end up overfunded.  If I continue to invest I could make-up a shortfall with that growth later on, but then I lose the tax benefits... ugh, I know it's not the worst problem to have, but I just don't want to do something stupid.

personalfinance,Trade in ole faithful and lease a car or pay way more for her than what she’s worth,"Hi guys! I’m sorry for formatting but I’m on mobile at the moment but anyway here’s a little bit of background on my car - she’s a newer car and I got her during a very desperate time of my life. College. My car had just broken down and with no family to support me - I needed a car and I needed fast to keep myself afloat. So I made possibly one of the stupidest decisions of my life. I went to the dealership alone as a 20 year old (female) college student. And yes, they looked at me like a minnow in a shark tank. So, yeah I got swindled into a pretty crappy deal. 6% interest rate on a 7 year 13k loan. But the payments were in my ballpark during that current financial situation and they got me a great deal on insurance. It was a desperate move and needless to say I do regret it. 

So... almost two years later and I’m still paying on it with barely making a dent in the initial value of the loan. I’m now graduated with a great job and while I’d hate to part with it, the brand of car (Chevy) is known to break down after a while AND I recently found out that I owe 4k-5k more on it than what it’s currently worth. My original plan was to buckle down and pay the car off in a 2-3 year span but after learning how much she is currently worth.... I’m debating on trading it and leasing a brand new car instead.

 I don’t really have anyone to turn to and discuss this with so I was hoping someone here could provide some insight on what they think is the best course of action. If I were to lease, I do have the current means to put money away and save in case I wanted to buy the leased car at the end of the lease OR have a down payment for a new car. Please give me guidance I have no idea what I am doing and don’t want to make another decision like the one I did before lol",finance

personalfinance,Mom wants me to take out private loan for Parent Plus Loan debt,"This is a little lengthy, but I'll try to be brief. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents and I had no idea what we were doing when we signed up for loans to pay for school because none of us had ever been to college. My mom and dad (married at the time) qualified for Parent Plus Loans and covered about half of my tuition, room, and board. I received a scholarship, which paid the other half. My parents told me that they would take on the debt because I had ""paid"" half by receiving the scholarship. Now, my parents are divorced and they want me to pay off my own student loan debt because they say they cannot afford it anymore. 

My mom is pressuring me to take on a private loan in my name and pay the loan off. I graduated in 2015 and deferred for 2 years because of a public service organization that I was involved with, so what has been paid so far has barely scratched the surface. The PPL is at about 43K right now. At this point, I'm paying this under my mom's account - I go in under her name and use all my banking information to pay the loan each month (about $260 per month). To make things worse, at some point, I also had to take a loan out in my name while I was going to school, so there's a second loan for about 33K that IS in my name and I pay that each month too. I'm paying this one through MyFedLoan and I pay about $150 on this each month, so total, I'm paying about $410 every month, just in student loan debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also completely financially independent, so I pay my own rent, phone bill, car insurance, etc. and I feel like I'm drowning. I'm working two part-time jobs and trying to go back to school for a master's degree. I have already made the commitment that I will not go back to school unless it is fully funded, so that I will not have to take on any more debt. I plan to return in the fall of 2020 if everything works out, but I'm really stressed about my money and financial future. I feel crushed under the weight of all my bills every month and I'm barely keeping up.

financialindependence,A lateral move on the path to FI,"Just a few days ago, I got my acceptance to an online M.S. program.  The Masters in question has a focus on education, business, and administration, though especially on education.  It's that focus that made me choose this Masters over something like an MBA or MHA, though being able to learn admin and business skills helps me feel like I can leverage even more out of it.  I have a well-paid full time job with benefits in healthcare, so this move doesn't necessarily help me achieve FI faster, and might even move it back since I don't see myself directly making more money from it.  But I think this is a move on the 'build the life you want, then save for it'.  And being on the FIRE path made it a pretty low stress decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 32 years old and make about 90k a year gross, but have intentionally kept my spending to about 1600-1800 a month.  I saved a bit of an overstuffed E fund at 20k, then have put everything into maxing out my 403b, a roth IRA, and the rest into a taxable brokerage since I don't have access to an HSA.  My Masters is going to be 2 years and 45 units, but my workplace provides 8 units a calendar year of tuition assistance, and I'll be getting another 6 from the program directly (this is all if I never get lower than a B, which I am confident I can do).  Between the 30 units I'll be able to get for free, that leaves 15 to pay for myself over those two years.  Because I have some extra liquid money put aside and I kept my lifestyle at the level I had it when I was making much less, I'll be able to pay for the program in cash and still be able to max out all my retirement buckets, plus a little extra for the taxable account.  I may hold off on that and put the extra in savings while in the program just for peace of mind.   There is a cost in time, but I'm actually looking forward to the studying so I don't consider it a a large one.  

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest takeaway is the kind of freedom that these habits can give, even when you're not fully FI.  This started when some of my old instructors got in contact with me to tell me about the program and also expressed interest in my joining them at some point in the near future to teach myself, which sounds like an ideal post-FI challenge.  I didn't have to think a moment on 'how would I possibly be able to afford this?  What loans will I have to take out?' It was only 'am I ready to do this?', and then do it right away when I made my decision.  You don't have to wait till you FIRE for the payoff of your choices to start having an effect.

&amp;#x200B;

As another takeaway, look at your benefits.  Go through them with a fine-tooth comb!  Download any employee brochure, the retirement benefits through your provider, everything.  It was through asking around that I found out about the tuition reimbursement, an annual textbook allowance, the ability to open a self-directed brokerage (and escape the investment choices the plan comes with if I want) even a potential additional 403b employer match I'm planning to see if I can qualify for.  There may be all kinds of gems that are buried just under the surface, and considering way too many people don't even take advantage of their employer match it isn't impossible there are other benefits that your coworkers just aren't talking about.",finance
personalfinance,(US) I keep getting FHA streamline letters in the mail,"I get about 1-2 letters in the mail a week about my FHA Mortgage that I took out in at the end of november 2018.

personalfinance,Debt Management Plan v. Debt Settlement,"Hey yall - need advice about which route to take, debt management or debt settlement. 

Originally, I'd been looking into bankruptcy, but I've backed away from that ledge for the moment. 

I have $30k in credit card debt, only am making \~$30k annually atm, though looking for new work + side hustles to up my income, now that I'm actually dealing with this debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Debt Management plan has me paying $534/mo for 58 months. I'm 28, so I'll be debt free by 33. Seems alright. I'm going through American Consumer Credit Counseling which is a non-profit and has been helpful. I know my credit score will drop since I have to close all the accounts, but it's trashed as is so I'm not worried about that. They're going to negotiate with my credit holders to lower my interest rates so that I can actually make headway on the balances. Their services also only cost like $15 a month and it's built into that figure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Debt Settlement, as described to me, will let my accounts go so overdue that they can then settle for less than I owe, and estimated I'd pay \~$21k instead of the 30 I owe, with $585 payments for 35 months, was the quote. This is through National Debt Relief, and I don't know if it was just the guy I talked to, but he was pretty pushy in a way that made me uncomfortable/ second guess the entire thing. But I guess that makes for good negotiating and settling skills. Also, their fees are built into the figure they gave me, and end up being like $134 a month, which seems like a lot.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love any advice / experience / perspectives anyone wants to share here. I'm so glad I finally woke up and am ready to handle this mess I've made, and work on financial freedom, but there's so much to navigate . I also started wondering if I should just try to negotiate the interest rates down myself, though I'm not sure I've got the grit for it.",finance
investing,A Potentially Terrible Idea,"I had an idea which I think is good but runs completely counter to traditional investment advice. I wanted to make my pitch for it and see what everyone thinks and what Im missing.

tl;dr - Based on the studies below, I think an internationally focused, diversified equity portfolio has a higher chance of netting 3% per annum over a 35 year time horizon than a traditional domestic focused stock/bond portfolio.

**My situation** \- Im in my mid 20s. No debt and work in a moderately high paying field (IT) with a fairly secure career. Thanks to living at home for a year after college, starting investing when I was a teenager and saving like crazy, I saved quite a bit of money. Assuming I keep up IRA contributions and get 3% matching on 401k contributions for my career, I need a real return of about 3% to retire comfortably. 

**My Idea**

Given this, I think traditional advice would be to hold a decent portion of the portfolio in fixed income (bonds/CDs) and put the rest in mostly domestic stocks. I don't want to do anything particularly close to that. Here's my pitch for it:

* According to Jeremy Siegel (U Penn prof. *Stocks for the Long Run*), over 20-30 year time periods stocks show strong mean reversion and have a lower variance than bonds. ([link that shows this](https://gfmasset.com/2018/11/13-thought-provoking-charts-from-stocks-for-the-long-run/)) looking at returns since 1800 in the US. In the [Return on Everything Paper](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/ms28533.pdf) (Harvard/The Fed) which looked at global and US returns, this was more or less confirmed. 
* So, I think that over my time horizon, stocks should be less risky than bonds. Its not to say I don't need to transition to bonds toward the end of my career, for retirement, but I don't think holding them until I need to is helpful. (Im very risk/fluctuation tolerant)
* That said, I don't totally trust US equities. Our current environment matches Carlo Cipola's criteria (*Economic Decline of Empires*) for an economically declining world power pretty closely and the last decade or so has seen us move closer and closer to the characteristics he identifies as common in these situations. I also don't see the US as particularly effective or cohesive socially or politically.
* On top of this Jeremy Siegel notes that returns generated over longer periods of time have much more to do with valuations at the start of investing than the GDP growth of the country. PE ratio, although crude, does hold a decent bit of explanatory power and it is considerably higher for the US (20 or so) vs. internationally diversified ETFs (low teens). 
* Ray Dalio's Bridgewater &amp; Associates published [a piece](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-library/daily-observations/geographic-diversification-can-be-a-lifesaver/) which suggested that an equal-weight portfolio among developed countries would have returned something close to what the US market returned with much less volatility over the 20th century, which included 2 world wars which devastated Europe.
* That said, I don't plan on leaving the US permanently (although I think living in another country for a few years would be cool) so whatever happens here economically will have an outsized effect on me vs the rest of the world and I want to make sure I don't totally miss growth here. Also a lot of our larger companies have significant revenue from abroad (40% for the S&amp;P last I heard) so I will get some international exposure through that. Although, as Bridgewater points out, the country the business is located in matters a lot, irrespective of revenue. 
* Also, for buying international ETFs, buying an equal weighted basket of international equities is pretty expensive compared to buying internationally diversified index funds. 

So, Im thinking of putting about 35-40% in the US (VTI or similar), 25% in emerging markets (IEMG so I can get S Korea exposure) and the remainder in a mostly developed market, diversified etf (IXUS). 

&amp;#x200B;

This totally goes against most investment advice I've seen (60-70% in the US, often including some bonds, and 20-30% international). 

I imagine there are pretty good reasons why the typical advice is to invest a lot more in the US than overseas, but I don't know what they are. What am I missing here?",finance
personalfinance,Marriage - Debt - and dent consolidation,"Hi all. I got married two weeks ago today and my husband and I are navigating debt. Today I talked to him about combining finances. I make about 2x more than he does and I’ve been throwing money and debt like no other. However. He is struggling to pay the regular bills. So I suggested we get one shared account and one shared savings account. We’d each have a weekly allowance in cash and any decisions to make a purchase from the shared account would need to be discussed. That’s the easy part. 

The debt is where it gets hard. I have three credit cards. He has some irs debt. Here is how it breaks down:
Care credit (I got lasik) $3k
Capone $1.5k
Best Buy $1.6k

In the last six months I’ve paid off a personal loan of 2k and lowered my balances another 2k. 

Husbands is as follows:
State taxes $1.1k
Fed taxes $2.8k

Our debt totals at about 10k. I’m considering the option of a consolidation loan with my current credit union. Looking at a 48 month timeline at about 9% interest putting a monthly payment at about $450 which. I alone could double. But with our finances combined we could pay it off early. We leave our cards at home now and give ourselves a fixed budget already. I don’t necessarily like the idea of consolidation because it means a new inquiry and a new account. But my credit cards have 23%-38% interest and that’s ridiculous to pay that much in interest. Plus. Paying the minimum payments on a bunch of loans versus making one big payment sounds attractive. The big thing is making sure nothing goes back on those cards for a while. The taxes will close, so that’s good. And the care credit can only be used at medical facilities. So that only leaves 2 cards that can possibly have added expenses and that’s all on me. I’m comfortable with myself knowing that I won’t add a bunch of crap to it. 

If I went on my merry way by myself I could pay everything off by October. And combined I think we could do it in a year or less. 

Looking for thoughts from other married couples with debt. Just to see what you are doing. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,I want to maximize my credit score. Is it possible to pay off my auto loan TOO fast?,"My main goal right now is raising my credit score. I am 25, I opened my first credit card in March '19, and I purchased a new vehicle 2 weeks ago. I had no credit history before this year. I make frequent payments to my card to keep my credit balance less than 1/3 of my credit limit. Intuit estimates that my credit score is 688. However, my credit is so new that BofA has not yet assigned me a credit score. A teller told me it takes 3-6 months. So when I bought the car, I still had zero credit history. The interest rate isn't great but I actually have enough cash on hand to pay it off today. Sure, I could avoid interest by paying it off; but I want to have the highest credit score possible when I'm ready to buy a home 1-2 years down the road. I want to know how quickly I should pay off my auto loan in order to maximize my credit score. Here are the details:

auto loan balance:  $5,135.70, term: 48 mo, APR: 8.2, minimum payment: $124.87.

I have  $8,500 in checking and $5,550 in savings at BofA. 

monthly income: $2,400, average monthly spending: $1,800 including rent.

I do want to avoid some of that interest so I have a modest plan and a more aggressive one. Lets say I pay off $1000 the first month then $250 each month after. According to the calculator on this [site](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/extra-payment-calculator?skn=#results) I could pay off the loan in as soon as 19 months. Or I could go bigger, pay $3000 or more on month one then, still pay $250 monthly, and pay it off in as soon as 12 months. So here's my question, is there any reason that paying it off more quickly would raise my credit score less? I hear that an auto loan is a great way to build credit; but does a lender dislike if one pays off a 4 year loan in only 1 year since they would make less on the loan? What about paying the whole think off in one month?",finance
financialindependence,What do y'alls spreadsheets look like?,"I think most of us build our own planning &amp; tracking sheets, and I think we should. Just thought we'd compare notes to see if we are missing something from each other. Here's what mine has

   * Inputs for these: An ESPP sub-sheet, an RSU sub-sheet, a house-value sub-sheet and text inputs that take in numbers that drive these, return rate, inflation etc.

* A summary sheet that holds data from multiple input values fed into the above two sheets, for a good ""at a glance"" picture
* A ""Diversification"" sheet for post-FIRE investment strategy, outlining various investment vehicles, % allocation across vehicles, tax for each, expected returns on each, and giving a picture of what overall returns I can expect.
* A ""Monthly expenses"" sheet breaking down current expenses, projected post-FIRE expenses and inflation projections for these
* A ""Partial exit"" sheet that is a variant of the first (main tracker sheet), this is sort of a ""what if we sell the house ahead of time"" what-if analysis I did sometime back.
* A transportation sheet outlining cost of transportation per month based on combinations of miles and prices of a car, motorcycle and public transport.
* A ""past inflation data"" sheet that has data from the early 70s to 2018, with means and medians of every 10-year period, to give an overall conclusion.
* A ""past returns"" sheet that has returns over multiple 10-year periods from the 70s to 2018, for the major indices. This is to give a rough picture of what I can expect from the index funds.
* An ""ideas"" sheet where I started jotting down possible CoastFI / FIRE ideas for business / alternative occupations.
* A ""moving expenses"" sheet (since I plan to relocate after a certain milestone)
* A ""timeline"" sheet with TODOs

personalfinance,Should I contribute appreciated stock to a donor advised fund this year?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

A few facts about my situation. I think I should donate my stock, but I am not sure if there are any factors I might be missing, and it would be great if you guys can tell me what else I need to consider.

* I'm a single, healthy 26 years old residing in a high tax state in the US.
* I'm currently a graduate student with at least 54k annual income (for living expenses) guaranteed by the school until June 2021 (I live in a high COL area and most of my funding comes from a government fellowship with 2 years left), so my marginal income tax rate is about 31% (federal + state).
* This year (and most likely next year) I expect 65-70k AGI due to additional income from industry. The additional income doesn't actually benefit me, because my (non tax deductible) expenses must also increase by about 5-8k, but it does put me solidly into the 31% marginal tax bracket.
* I donate 10% of my income to nonprofits, and I do not plan to change this.
* I started a donor advised fund a few years ago (and itemized my deductions that year), and this year there is only $3.5k left in the fund; I expect to use all that's left in the fund to finish up my 10% giving.
* I plan to max out all the available retirement fund contributions this year (6k to Roth IRA). Other than retirement funds, I have an 8 months' emergency fund in cash as well as $80k in a taxable investment account split evenly between stock etfs and bond etfs.
* Besides the retirement fund contribution, I save a negligible amount every year after living expenses.
* I do hold one individual stock, and it is worth 6k and has over 3k in longterm unrealized gains. I wish to diversify away from this stock.
* If I were to donate 20k in stocks (\~30% of AGI) to my donor advised fund, I would avoid taxes on unrealized longterm gains on about 7k of it. I can also take advantage of itemizing another 4k in state income taxes. (I had to pay another 1k on my 2018 state tax returns this year)
* It would be easy to rebalance after the stock donation; there isn't that much appreciation from my bond holdings.
* Of the 20k contribution, I expect to grant away about 6k next year (2020) and at least 3k-6k the year after to nonprofits from the fund (10% of my grad school income).
* Students in my program tend to get high paying jobs after graduation (marginal tax rate will be \~34% assuming I stay in state). Assuming I get a high-paying job (i.e the job market is good), I would want to grant at least 14k the first year of my job (2021 or 2022).
* Other financial considerations: It does not make sense in my area to buy a house compared to rent (house price to monthly rent ratio is a few hundred). I don't foresee marriage in a few years, and a relative will start attending college in 6 years but his parents do not anticipate needing significant help in tuition.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this, I would like to contribute 20k in stocks this year to itemize the deduction and take the standard deduction for the next few years. On paper this plan makes sense and saves on taxes. I also have all the numbers right for financial wellness (emergency fund, income stability, etc), and I will not change my giving habits. However, I'm uncomfortable with this decision right now because it's a large sum of money compared to my income. Are there any other considerations I should think about? Should I contribute more cash on top of the stocks to get more deductions in the same tax year?",finance
MachineLearning,[P] Writing mission statement for project related to machine learning for catalyst design.,"Hey all!  

I am starting my first scientific job after my PhD in Physics, as a research scientist this summer in Beijing for a project related to catalyst design. I am very excited to be part of this project. I am starting to write out the scope of the project.  Let me know any tips or advice you may have. 

Many fields in Physics and Chemistry utilize the Schrodinger Equation or Density Functional Theory to compute various properties and insights into the systems under study. Any computational natural scientist will know that in practice the starting point for many of these calculations, in other words what is fed as input into the machine are the atomic numbers and geometries.  

**Two Approaches**

* (a) Can machine learning help discover new insights and physics into the systems of interest- From knowledge of just the molecular structures of the atoms are we able to acquire any insight into more efficient and less harmful combustion reactions that utilize catalysts? In a more broader sense this may give insight into the computational quantum mechanical approach.  

* (b) The inverse design problem deals with the prediction of novel undiscovered molecules.  

**Methodology**


These two problems have the opposite approaches: in case (a) we move from a known chemical space towards prediction of physical and chemical quantum properties, whereas in the second case we would like to start from a desired property to make predictions about the chemical space. 

To approach question (a) the work uses quantum mechanical data to undergo supervised learning methods which have been shown to perform generally on the same scale as models that utilize unsupervised (for e.g. convulutional neural networks).  
No theoretical methods exist to explore all combinatorially possible alloyed systems. ( for the smallest known thiolated nanocluster, Au_15 (SR)_13 there would be over 32k possibilities which presents a significant computational challenge to characterize all potential structures)[1]

The overall problem of catalyst design from a brute force machine learning method would therefore be to have stacks or layers of features and predictions starting from knowledge of just the geometry and atomic numbers of the molecular structures.  

(b) The inverse design problem revolves around finding the best chemical structures with desired properties. One could utilize invertible models from machine learning such as generative models (GANs, autoencoders).  
According to Kulik et al. [2]  only a tiny fraction (1 part in 10^50) of chemical space has ever been explored. This necessitates the need for machine learning approach rather than design each molecular system by hand (either experimentally or computationally). A great review paper that provides insight into how the inverse design problem may be approached was written by B. Sanchez-Lengeling and Alan Aspuru-Guzik [3]. One could begin unsupervised learning starting from databases of potential catalysts.

investing,Does anyone else think that Jim Rogers is right on the money (pun intended)?,"He's predicting a more severe crash than 2008 to occur within the next year or two.  His logic is simple: far more debt now than in 2008.  US mortgage debt is back at 2008 levels, but more importantly US non-financial corporate debt is far higher than it's ever been due to a decade of cheap money from QE.  Global debt is higher than it's ever been and China is in trouble this time with a 300% debt-to-GDP ratio, largely from unsustainable construction projects.

Factor in that derivatives trading and debt traunches were never made illegal after 2008 and continue to be widely used.  Also factor in that the Fed is currently transitioning from QT to QE BEFORE THE RECESSION IS EVEN STARTING - they're just trying to further inflate the stock-market bubble and now won't have much QE available when the crash actually does happen.

personalfinance,A question about pre-approved used-car loan,"I'm trying to help my son buy a used car. Twenty years ago, when I was shopping for a used car, and my credit wasn't very good, I couldn't get a used car loan from my bank. I would go to a finance company to get a pre-approved used car loan. Higher interest than a bank, but lower than the outrageous interest rate I would pay for dealer financing.

Now my adult son doesn't have very good credit. The credit union denied him. I went looking for the kind of finance company I used to go to, but it looks like brick-and-mortar finance companies have pretty much disappeared. As far as I can tell, this kind of business has moved to the internet.

My son seems eligible for a used car loan from CapitolOne, one of several used car loan companies on the internet. The interest rate is reasonable, given his poor credit score.

I have to confess, I don't know how this works. How does the check get from CapitolOne, or some similar company, to the used car dealer. The website says it will send an electronic payment to a ""participating dealer"" but there are dozens or hundreds of used car dealers around here. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to find out which ones are ""participating."" Maybe all used car dealers participate, or almost all?

Meanwhile, a lot of used car dealers have a ""no hold"" policy. They won't hold a car to give a potential buyer time to make arrangements. If it takes a couple of business days for the loan company to get a check to the dealer, the car might be gone.

With all the brick and mortar finance companies out of business, I wonder if most used car shoppers are getting financing from the dealers these days? I'm assuming he'll get a better interest rate if I get a pre-approved used car loan? Is that still true?

I'm a little lost here. Advice and guidance would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Investing student loan,"I'm starting my studies next fall and I'm wondering what is the best option for my situation...

In here you can get a student loan where the goverment pays out 40% of your loan if you graduate in schedule (to some maximum). 

I already have some savings which I can use to live out pretty decent for some time.

Also students get student support and housing benefit. These two almost cover my rent so that is the biggest money hole gone.

Given these prequisites which of the following makes most sense:

A. Stay loan free, live out of my savings and be living on the cheap side to through out the studies.

B. Take loan so that I can live more freely and don't have to use so much of the savings but don't take it too much so I'm not so deep in debt. 

C. Take maximum amount of loan that goverment refunds, invest the extra money that I dont need to index funds and live pretty well.

I'm leaning most towards option C as the loan is pretty cheap and you get a portion of it as free money. And after I graduate I already have some good savings to buy an apartment etc.

What are your opinions?

They said a portion of it would be viable for rent, books etc basically we could use the loans for things outside of tuition. How exactly does that work? How does the whole credit card/ debit card situation work with loans? I will be getting an apartment off campus and the renters said that they would look at my loans and divide that by 12, thus giving me around 4k a month for rent, books, food etc. How do I pay my rent with loans if I'm paying with card? Do I have to make my own credit card because so far I have been paying the application fees with my parents credit card?  I'm new to this and my parents aren't offering me a lot of help so I have no one else to ask. Please help. I am clueless and confused.

personalfinance,Refinancing: FHA streamline vs Conventional.,"I currently have a FHA loan for my first home and am exploring the idea of refinancing with the goal of getting a better rate, lowering monthly payment amount, and eliminating/reducing PMI. After talking to several lenders there seems to be 3 real options with how to proceed forward. Depeding on what my home appraises to now would determine if I have to pay PMI on the conventional. I have a feeling it would appraise just a little short of what it would take to drop PMI altogether so either refinancing options would carry some sort of PMI payment. 

1- refinance as FHA 30 yr fixed streamline through my current lender. I was quoted a interest rate of 3.75% which is the lowest option by more than a quarter point. However the PMI payment would be in the $80-$90 per month range and would have to be paid for the loans duration. The type of refinance does not require a re-appraisal and is set using original value of the loan. This option would add approximately $4,000 to the total payoff amount over what it currently is. 

2- refinancing with a convention 30 yr fixed mortgage. Quoted rate of 4.125%, PMI ranging form $20-$30 and would automatically fall off once reaching 20% equity in the home based on a re-appraisal that would need to be done. this would add approximately $10,000 to the current payoff amount due to closing and processing fees. 

3- dont refinance now and continue to pay down my principle and hope that rates are the same or better when I do have 20% equity in the house and would also qualify for a prime interest rate. 

I like the idea of getting into the conventional cause the monthly payment would be lower and allow me to reach 20% equity faster due to the additional amount being able to pay towards the principle. However the conventional costs more than twice as much as the FHA streamline in closing costs and fees as well as the re-appraisal which could come back lower than expected. 
Just hoping to get a little insight into how the best way to evaluate these options might be as I have never been through this before. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I get divorced to save on taxes?,"My husband and I live in SoCal. We both just got bumps in our salaries, and I'm at the point of wondering if we should get ""divorced"" legally, in anticipation of lowering our taxes due to our combined income. A little background info:

We bought our first house (actually a condo, not sure if that's relevant or makes any difference) last June, 2018 for $557,000. We put 10% down. The mortgage is in my husband's name only. He has no other debt. I carry $30,000 of student loan debt in my name only. I have no other debt.*

*We actually do have some credit card debt, but this will be paid off within a couple of months, so I'm not taking this into consideration for this situation as it isn't long-term debt.

------------------------------------------------------------

- Husband's new gross annual income = $129,480 (old gross was about $117,000)

- Husband's annual bonus = approx. 7% of gross annual income (the % fluctuates slightly from year to year depending on how the company's year was)

- Husband's federal/state taxes = 36% (including an additional $150 withheld on his w4)

------------------------------------------------------------

- My new gross annual income = $78,000

- My annual bonus = $0

- My federal/state taxes = 24% ? (this was the percentage of tax being withheld from my previous salary at $54,000 -- I assume my taxes will likely go up with my new salary, but am unsure by how much)

------------------------------------------------------------

This year (for 2018 taxes), we owed $5,000 in taxes. The year before, we owed maybe $4,000? So we both changed our w4's to ""married but withholding at a higher single rate"", and my husband also withholds an extra $150 additional on his w4. 

So hopefully we won't owe this next year with those changes, but still.... So, I'm wondering if we weren't married on paper, if that would be better for our taxes, with our increased salaries especially. Any advice would be welcome!",finance

personalfinance,Should I get into real estate business with my mother (CAN),"Well this is my first post ever but been a lurker for about 3 years on a bunch of subreddits.

I have been working 2 jobs for give or take 3 years or so, currently 25 and I am pretty fed up with working a part time job (20 hours) and a full time job (40 hours) a week. I just purchased a house and have a wedding coming up this august and have decided that I will keep sticking to these jobs up until after the wedding because we need the money for it but I honestly miss my own free time and believe I can make much more money going into real estate and attempting to do what I think I will love and open my own business eventually. 

This recently came up,

My mother who lives in a 2 bedroom house by the university has her mortgage renewal coming up this august and I had a thought that maybe I would buy my mothers house from her and rent it out to people and eventually pay off the house and make some extra income in the near future, basically wanting to plant a seed now and see how big it grows.

I brought it up to my mother and she suggested that I buy it from her for 200k (was purchased for 150k) and that she would pay my downpayment (20%) and with the money she gets from the house she would add another 2 bedrooms onto the house and another kitchen and rent out to people and she would split it 50/50 while she pays for all the bills and the mortgage itself on-top of that. 

I talked to my fiance and she was telling me that the first rule of real estate and renting in general is never get involved with family and that this could turn out really bad. I myself see it as a amazing opportunity where I don't need to provide no cash and can even go to the point of telling my mother I would like to manage the money she gets from the pay out and help her change up the house.

I haven't got many opportunities like this and I really don't want to keep relying on 2 jobs for the rest of my life. We both decided that getting opinions from everyone else would help make up our mind about this situation.

Sorry I wrote so much, this is my first post and hopefully I get better at writing these.

TLDR - Tired of working 2 jobs, mom offered to sell house to me, pay for the everything and still live there and rent to people, no money out of my pocket, fiance thinks business + family = bad

personalfinance,Credit score is suffering because I got rid of all my loans. I can't get the car loan I want. How do I turn my credit back around?,"I'll try to keep the rant to a minimum, but it's ridiculous that you're punished for being debt free. I've never owned a credit card, paid off a 5 year auto loan in 4 years, and have been debt free for a year now. I was sitting on a 750 credit score in January, and decided to do the frugal thing and NOT buy a new vehicle at the time.

About a month ago I got a decent pay bump so I started playing with the idea of getting a new car, my current one is constantly in need of repairs, terrible on gas and I drive 70+ miles a day. I noticed that my credit score had dropped almost 100 points because my paid off loans were starting to drop off of my credit report. The bank my previous loan went through offered me something like 10.9% on a $20k loan and the one car dealership I had give me a quote came back and said ""we can't find any record of your credit score"" and quoted me $879/mo for a $44k loan. I didn't even look at the interest rate, I just laughed it off and walked away. Supposedly they used TransUnion and Equifax, which Credit Karma has no problem pulling up. Well, I got in a car accident last week and my vehicle is most likely totaled. The insurance payout won't even be enough to use as a down-payment, so I'm back to getting a loan.

I've considered getting a credit card to bump my score back up, but I'm afraid it's going to take another 6 months or so to take effect. I found one that does 5% back on gas purchases, and 1% on everything else, which is fine by me, I'll only use it for gas and keep paying it off.

Bitcoin,"I am so incredibly angry right now. We need real adoption, and we need it right fucking now.","I can’t even begin to tell you how mad I am right now.  It’s taken a while to get to this point, with a myriad of issues accumulating over years time, but today was the straw that broke my back, not the camel’s.

The Banks which control 99.99% of the flow of money are FUCKING US ALL, and laughing in our faces while doing it.  I need to pay for something (international transaction in EU), but for some reason they aren’t allowed to accept Credit Cards/PayPal since it is a preorder.  (Dictated by laws or whatever).  The only way you can pay is with a bank transfer, aka wire.  (The company product is 100% legit, I’ve done business with them many times.)

So I go online in my banking app to do a wire transfer.  Well apparently you cannot do it online, so I call my bank’s 14 hour customer service line.  

“Sorry Sir, but to do a wire transfer you need to visit one of our physical branch locations and complete it there.”

“But I need to submit it now as it is a time sensitive payment, and it’s Sunday so none of your branches are open.”

“Yes, unfortunately you will have to wait until regular Branch hours on Monday morning.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?”

I hung up on them after that because I didn’t want lash out on this dude who was just relaying the policies that someone else made, but boy was I ready to.  I calmed down and looked at my other checking accounts policies on wire transfers (different banks).  My hope was restored after a customer service rep told me that she could do it over the phone any time today.  Then I realized that I would need to deposit/transfer money into that account in order to do it, because it is just a placeholder account with $20 in it so I can use the Credit Union’s other services.  I’d use that bank full time (NavyFed Credit Union), but there aren’t any locations near me whatsoever.   

So I logged back into my main account and went to transfer some money into the NavyFed one.  What’s that you say, I won’t receive the funds for at least 24 hours?  You are fucking kidding me!  I can’t even access my own fucking money to buy something.  Just like with private keys, you have no money if the bank has it.  They have it, and they determine when you can and cannot utilize it.  They also can decide who you can or cannot send your money to (like not allowing customers to buy crypto with their own money since crypto poses a threat to the bank’s total control).  

Oh, and don’t forget about how they fucking rape the shit out of you with Fees and Charges.  I need to spend $25 just to wire the fucking money!  Just this week they also charged me $15 for a “maintenance fee” and $1 for a “paper statement fee”.  That is $41 fucking dollars in less than 5 days just for me to be able to use my own fucking money.  It is fucking theft, plain and simple, but rather than getting robbed by some junkies in ski masks, we get robbed by fucks in suits who are rolling in cash.

We have self driving cars, rockets that can fucking land upright after falling from space, and satellites that can zoom in on a penny from outer space, but it takes DAYS just for me to send money to a European country. They are intentionally strangling us and our money.  They want to keep total control, all while stealing from us along the way. A few bucks here, a few bucks there, $2 every time you withdraw cash, etc, etc, etc...  It makes me think about the movie “Office Space”, when the dude steals a fortune by just scraping pennies off of millions and millions of transactions.  

Enough is enough.  WE NEED ADOPTION NOW.  Mass adoption, not just a few random online shops and tiny restaurants.  That is what Bitcoin was supposed to be about.  We have strayed so far away from that, so much so that actual adoption (at least with bitcoin) will never happen.  People have hoarded it, price fluctuation has scared so many, and the big institutions have infiltrated the system.  When I first learned about bitcoin I believed in it; I saw how we needed a way to allow people to control their money.  The message has always been there in my head, but it faded somewhat over time.  Bears and Bulls, charts, developments, whales, and drama with Vermin and the delusional nutjob crybaby took over the limelight.  The majority of people who are involved in crypto now are just gambling to make money.  They don’t care about adoption; some might say they do, but it’s not really true.  They just want to make big $$$, convert to USD, and lambo through life.  Hell, prior to today, I was like that for the most part.  I always wanted to see progress, but I envisioned myself hitting a high point and pulling out almost everything and cashing out to USD.  

Today was my true day of awakening.  I learned about bitcoin and it’s goals/purpose years ago, and have been involved ever since.  It sounds stupid, but I just now feel like I’ve reached true enlightenment (in terms of believing in the concepts that Satoshi Nakamoto(s) built upon).  My involvement in bitcoin is going to change from watching charts and chasing profits to doing WHATEVER I CAN to push back in the face of the banks and give people real control over their money.  Prices shouldn’t be what’s in focus, real adoption should.  Bitcoin might not be the answer to this issue because of the issues I talked about above.  If that’s the case, the solution has yet to be made.  Bitcoin’s white paper is a great (currently the best too) foundation .  Down with the banks.",cryptocurrency

3.) Replace my wife's car: 2012 Honda Accord 120K miles (only minor maintenance repairs over the past year)

4.) Vacation of a lifetime - 2 weeks in Italy visiting Rome, Capri, Amalfi, etc. for a minimum of 10 days ( a dream my wife and I always had). \*Can't do with children\*

5.) Downpayment for a home (will most likely be my parents home currently assessed at $320K). We do have an excellent relationship with my parents so downpayment could likely be under 20% but I want to be honest, fair, and keep recurring mortgage payment low to maximize investments etc.

\*\*In that time my wife and I would like to have 1-2 kids around the ages between 30 y/o and 32 y/o ideally!

Side Note: Wondering if I should pump the brakes on my student loans 171K through my parents home equity line of credit ( originally to decrease interest rate) due to the possibility of ""student loans being wiped away"" and invest in a taxable account to achieve all other financial goals.

I just wanted to share that I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel - which if anything is giving me hope to my future.   Thanks to this forum and having a reason to turn things around in my life I was able to stop myself before things got too far.  In October of 2017 I missed a credit card payment for the first time in my life; while I had excel spreadsheets to track my spending this scared the shit out of me so I decided to make a change.  I opened a crappy checking account at Bank of America that has no debit card attached to it and I pay all of my credit card bills out of it so at least at the bare minimum monthly payments are being made.   When I started doing this my total debt was around $23,000 on 9 cards or credit lines and I was a 27 years old.  I had $150 in my  checking and around $700 in my savings.  The light at the end of the tunnel wasn't visible to me at all.   


Today - my debt level is around $19,500 - little high still considering the time span but I have been nickling and diming these payments and taking my time coming up with a plan.  My late payment to discover I was able to mostly get expunged by immediately paying it and getting Discover to not report it (I have a 99% on my credit report for bad marks, so I am not too sad by this - better than what it would have been for a missed payment).   I have $1,500 in my checking (I set a personal goal of having at least a full check worth of pay in there at all times, before deductions) and I have $6,500 in savings - with my tax return still outstanding because I filed late w/ an extension (was waiting for a 1099-misc that I didn't need to wait for because it was below the threshold - it never came  because it never existed oops).     


I've carved out a snow-ball plan for my debt this morning.  I'll be taking out three cards, high interest rate and high monthly payments in one swoop once my tax check arrives (I could do it now but I want to keep some funds in my savings) -- this will lower my balance to $12,500 and free up more funds to re-use on the next high interest card.  The next two cards can be paid off in 3.5 months with my excess left overs - which will leave me on a plan to debt freedom by March/April of next year by my math.. without having major significant disruption to my savings.   


This has been a rough year for me; my fiancee/SO passed away in March of this year - we had been working on this road to freedom for a while and she was my guiding strength in getting my shit together for these last 5 years.  The hope and goal of having a family and a car and stability was insight for both of us.  When I lost her I kept those promises I made to her (to us) alive - working diligently on my degree (yay more debt, but low interest and not something I'll have to worry about too much when I am done) which will earn me a significant pay raise ($10-15k) in the next 12 months and keeping my head up and positive about things to come.    


I ache daily still with her loss; but I made a promise when she passed that I would live through her.  I have always been a debbie downer - she brightened everything in my life and I have found my own ways at ensuring her light continues to shine on me.  I didn't see this light in March, April or May - but the glimmer of hope is here at the end of June and finally having a plan in place has given me security and the ability to see my future.",finance

The tendency is to look at economy, particularly inflation / deflation and currency value at a national level and not the local level.

You have a community where 7% of revenue is taxable income (macro level, combined).

In addition, nearly 50% of purchases are from non-local industry, predominantly: electronics, automotive, oil/gas, parts, textiles, and certain supplies and commodities.

The other 50% is local: dairy, grains, lumber, poultry, and services, such as hair cuts, food service, retail.

The community sends 9% of its revenue to Washington and the State Capital. About 20% of its revenue is spent on national markets.

On the other hand, it is apportioned only 2% of state and federal taxes in various grants, for things like transportation, roads, utilities, and USDA.

It has a gross loss of 7% of its revenue to taxes, and 20% to non-local trade, for a total of 27%.

On the other note, it sells some lumber, grain, poultry, and certain small services to non-local recipients. This brings about 16% back in.

The net community loss is 11%.

The effect of this is a slow reduction in labor, increase in productivity, reduction in prices, and other efficiency-improvements, which over time, reduce the net loss to 8%.

The negative effect of this is unemployment levels of about 6.5%, and homelessness (no dwelling, rental or otherwise) of about 1%.

Due to unemployment and homelessness, certain social services cone into play: food stamps, snap, childcare, housing, etc, which brings an additional 5% apportionment of taxes back into the economy.

The net loss now is down to 3%.

Now. National inflation increases 2%. Since 50% of the community’s expenses are non-local, this raises the net loss to 4% (+1%)

Now, this loss shows up in many forms, most notably, property devaluation, low wages, higher than average crime, low student academic performance, and other issues.

Now, a few hundred miles away, you see the opposite occurring. A large Government Contractor is in play, and they receive a substantial excess in apportionment. They have low unemployment, and have national industries in steel, manufacturing, and other areas.

At the end of the day, I see one community being taxed to make another community prosperous.

Community A is a high investment risk, while community B is a secure risk.

Now, we fast forward a few years.

Community B starts to see a lack of labor availability. This is reflected in wages which are very high. Its investors start shopping for new locations to build factories. It stumbles across Community A.

It buys up land at pennies on the dollar, and begins infrastructure growth to accommodate its plans. The promise of jobs and investment greets the city council of community A with big eyes and open arms, and it begins granting permits and accommodating the investment needs with boosts in infrastructure spending and certain subsidies. Factories begin being built, unemployment drops to 2%, business begins to grow, but before it can really mature, it begins attracting other investors as well.

Over the course of 5 years, 35% of residential dwellings are owned by non-local rental investors, new businesses: corporate retail outlets, restaurants, convenience stores begin cropping up and 30% of local businesses go broke at the benefit of these large enterprise chains.

The town is transformed.

30% of the towns locals left, they could not afford to live there.
45% of the locals rent
50% of the towns businesses and land are owned by new residents and out of area investors.
85% of the population is new to the area after 15 years due to growth.

It was a quaint, quiet little town, now twice its size, and bustling with business and new population.

Some people call this economic imperialism.

Would you argue that national trade and taxes were responsible for this town’s transformation?

Is it wrong for the locals, 25% of the population, to be angry that their quiet little town had turned into party town USA? Angry their taxes perpetuated this issue? Angry their representatives invited the growth that put them out of business, forced their children to move, or try to bide with low income jobs paying rent their whole lives?

It just seems to me that all the nice quiet communities across the US are experiencing this rapid growth and economic insertionism.
