**GOLD - Trading environment:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold prices dipped back below $1600 per ounce in London trade Tuesday, retreating $100 per ounce from early March’s new 7-year highs, as world stock markets struggled to extend their week-long rally in the face of awful economic data and forecasts as the spread of coronavirus accelerated.
* Shanghai gold prices today fell nearly $18 per ounce below comparable London quotes, showing a discount to the world’s central trading and storage hub for all but 3 days this March.

**OIL - Trading environment:**

* The contango for Brent between May and November has widened to a record $13.45 per barrel, a reflection of the massive short-term glut.
* The oil market supply chains are broken due to the unbelievably large losses in oil demand, forcing all available alternatives of supply chain adjustments to take place during April and May.

**ECONOMICS - Where we are heading at:**

* US GDP contracting by 9% in Q1 and 34% in Q2 in annualized terms.
* Jobless rate reaching 15% by July - the highest level of unemployment of the Great Depression in 1939.
* US unemployment could reach over 32% by mid-year according to back-of-an-envelope estimates in a new blog post from the St.Louis Federal Reserve, with more than 47 million lay-offs between April and June.

I ’ve started to feel that a diversified allocation in different trading strategies is much safer than trying to time the market or implement the strategies on my own.Until now I used to invest through Interactive Brokes (for options, futures, Forex, bonds, and funds) and Vanguard for some ETFs. I ’ve now found Daedalus platform, which seems to be having a good combo of alternative strategies.

solar,"Sunnova protection pan, good deal?","I am considering solar and one of the salesman is pushing this protection plan pretty hard.  The upfront cost is 3000, and sunnova finances the loan at 6%.  This is what is offered under the protection plan: 

### System Monitoring and Diagnosis

We proactively monitor your home solar system. If something goes wrong, we let you know right away so you can take steps to address it. 

### Eliminate Out-Of-Pocket Expenses

Our warranty covers equipment repairs and part replacements. If there are any issues with your solar system, our expert team will manage any maintenance and repairs.   covers all system components unless previously excluded from coverage  

### Production Guarantee

If your solar system does not produce the amount of energy we estimate over the term of your Sunnova Protect™ Service plan agreement, we’ll refund you  85% of the production guarantee of Sunnova’s estimate, or we'll credit you the difference up to 50% of the contract price 

 [https://www.sunnova.com/solar-repair-warranty](https://www.sunnova.com/solar-repair-warranty) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally pretty wary of these protection plans, and sunnova does not have great reviews online (although many of the poor reviews seem to be from leasing issues, and install issues, sonnova will not be installing my panels, just financing them).  From what I've read the inverters are not going to last the entire 25 years, and replacing just one of them would likely be over 3k.  The interest rate is a little higher than I am finding elsewhere, but not a ton higher (lowest rate close to 5).   Has anyone dealt with an extended warranty plan like this?",energy

personalfinance,Filing an amended tax return through a software and am confused with the wording,"I'm filing an amended tax return and am having trouble with the wording on the H&amp;R Block software (I'm also aware I may be overthinking it). 

It asks:

**Taxes paid with original return** and **Taxes paid after return filed**

I'm not sure if any of this means the literal amount I've paid say if I owed money, or the amount I've already paid (withheld). The problem is any number I put in the box, it prompts next by saying **based on what you've told us, your refund amount is ______*

So if I put $1 in both, it'll say my refund is $2. If I put $0, it'll say my refund is $0. If I put $600 in both it'll say my refund is $1200. Additionally, it adds this amount (in the Federal overview) to the amount I was owed (refund) originally.

economy,"U.S. Fat Cats Consider a ""Virus Be Damned, Get Back to Work!"" Policy","As the Coronavirus crisis intensifies globally, the U.S. elite are growing increasingly concerned about the impact that this pandemic will have on the economy and their wealth. Last week James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Fed, said that [GDP could contract up to 50% in Q2 2020, and that unemployment could reach 30%.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/unemployment-surge-to-30-percent-q2-gdp-50-percent-james-bullard-2020-3-1029022288) Major banks have put out [similar analyses](https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/markets/morgan-stanley-sees-us-economy-plunging-30-25-in-second-quarter/ar-BB11yajt). The impact of the economic downturn and work interruptions are being felt across all sectors of the economy. Last week [U.S. unemployment claims skyrocketed to 3,280,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-unemployment-idUSKBN21D1WJ), a 3 million increase over the previous week. This means that around one percent of the entire U.S. population filed for unemployment last week. This shattered the previous record of 695,000 unemployment claims in a week, which was set in 1982.

The number of unemployment claims [will likely increase in the coming weeks](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/26/a-word-about-the-horrid-spike-in-unemployment-claims-and-why-its-even-more-horrid-than-it-appears/). The numbers from last week are from the claims that were filed on the week ending March 21st, and therefore do not reflect the number of people who filed last week. During the week of the 21st, [many state unemployment websites crashed](https://news.yahoo.com/state-unemployment-websites-crash-applications-150200792.html), preventing people from filing online. As a result, many of these people ended up filing for unemployment this past week. What’s more, the $2 trillion stimulus package includes [provisions which allow gig workers such as Uber drivers to file for unemployment benefits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-relief-act-expanded-unemployment-payment-and-eligibility.html) as well. This is a welcome change, and long overdue, but it does mean that we can expect that unemployment claims will continue to climb in the coming weeks. And we are still only at the beginning of a crisis that is [expected to last for 18 months](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/there-isnt-going-be-all-clear-signal/608512/). Italy was unable to contain the spread of the Coronavirus even after imposing social distancing measures similar to those in effect in the U.S. right now. In a last ditch effort to stop the spread, they ultimately decided to [shut down all industrial production for at least 15 days](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-drops-deficit-dogma-deaths-184032455.html).

While the measures taken here in the U.S. do not entail a complete shutdown of industrial production, the U.S. elite and especially the big capitalists are not thrilled about the prospect of a similar shutdown. Last week Trump said that [“America will again and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.""](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/trump-coronavirus-lockdown-skepticism-143800) He also stated that [he wants to see “packed churches” on Easter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/03/27/churches-easter-trump-closed-coronavirus-services/). He has since [walked back this goal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/trump-extends-social-distancing-measures-to-april-30-walks-back-easter-reopening-plans/ar-BB11SH5q). Despite this reversal, Trump has not been the only one pushing to rush everyone back to work during the pandemic. His statements are not isolated incidents, but represent a growing trend among the U.S. elite, who stand to lose billions in future profits and lose global influence if the shutdown continues.

For example, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, recently tweeted that ‘[Extreme measures to flatten the virus “curve” is sensible-for a time-to stretch out the strain on health infrastructure. But crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond. Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.](https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/1241907502662418437)’ On Fox Business, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow recently stated that, [“There’s no question we have to think seriously. I would say, after the 15-day period is over, which I guess ends after this weekend, we will take another look at targeting areas \[to reopen businesses\] that are safe enough.""](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/larry-kudlow-trump-coronavirus-business-restrictions-15-days) Big capitalists like Bob Luddy (founder of CaptiveAire systems) have argued that if [the U.S. doesn’t “get back to work” by March 30, it will be a total disaster](https://spectator.org/back-to-work-by-march-30-a-coronavirus-imperative/). Right-wing talkshow host Glenn Beck, even went so far as to state, [""I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working\[...\]Even if we all get sick, I'd rather die than kill the country.""](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/25/glenn-beck-tells-older-americans-to-get-back-to-work-id-rather-die-than-kill-the-country/) He also noted that he hoped his comments trended on social media.

It’s not just billionaires, libertarians, and right-wing news networks who are pushing these ideas. The New York Times recently ran an opinion column by Thomas Friedman, a columnist at the paper, [in which Friedman made similar arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-economy.html?fbclid=IwAR2j6dA_UUUABRCZEj7vqtq0uydKuq5elicaAKstv3BKbb_VMaLhLSyP1_w). A few days before that, the Times [ran a similar opinion piece by David L. Katz](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html), president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal recently [published an opinion piece that made a similar argument](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154).

While there is not yet a complete bipartisan consensus on this issue, it is concerning to see a large section of the U.S. elite so openly proclaiming their willingness to let millions die to further their political and economic interests. If people are rushed back to work before the pandemic has died down, or before there is a vaccine, this will lead to a massive outbreak and the unnecessary deaths of millions of people. This would be akin to responses during the 1918 Flu pandemic in which some places rushed people back to work and hosted big public gatherings, which led to [massive spikes in the weekly death rate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus/).

Criticism of this push to get people back to work during the pandemic have primarily [focused on how this prioritizes profit over the lives and well-being of people](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/i-will-not-kill-my-mother-for-your-stock-portfolio/). This is an important criticism. It exposes the logic of the present social system which serves the interests of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the poor and oppressed people. These exposures are all the more important during times of crisis when so many are in dire straits both from the virus itself, and also the looming economic depression. However, it is also important to see that push to get everyone back to work is not just about driving the stock market higher and maximizing corporate profits. The U.S. elite have a series of economic and political interests which are related to, but not reducible to maximizing their profits and driving the stock market higher.

For example, competition between the U.S. and China has been intensifying in recent years. This has manifested in many ways including the military build up in the South China Sea, and the ongoing trade war. Right now, the U.S. elite are worried that [the Coronavirus could reshape the global order](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order) and allow China—which seems to be recovering from the virus—to overtake the U.S. as a the dominant global superpower. Major think tanks and policy circles have speculated that if China recovers from the virus before the U.S., then the former [will make big political and economic inroads into regions like the Middle East at the expense of U.S corporations](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/covid-19-impacts-on-strategic-dynamics-in-the-middle.html). They are also concerned that China could strengthen its relationship with [European countries like Italy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/) by providing them with economic and medical assistance during this crisis.

The push to get everyone back to work is also related to the U.S. elite's concerns about [major disruptions to global supply chains](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/a-contagion-is-spreading-through-the-economy-too/). Some key industries are already [shutting down some production](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/sc-automakers-temporarily-closing-manufacturing-plants-due-to-coronavirus-supply/article_25e08da2-6aa5-11ea-9056-af6c129aca07.html) due to supply shortages. There is [growing concern about what is known as the bullwhip effect](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/12/coronavirus-supply-and-demand-economic-effect) in supply chain engineering. The basic concept is that as one supplier attempts to adjust to new changes in demand and available parts, like those caused by the present crisis, relatively smaller misadjustments by this initial supplier can lead to even bigger miscalculations down-stream or upstream. The metaphor to the bullwhip is that a small change/disruption—like a flick of the wrist—leads to bigger changes down the line, like the movement at the end of the whip. This is already playing out in multiple ways throughout the economy.

For example, many hospitals have urgently been requesting supplies of personal protection equipment, such as masks and gloves. While there have been steps to address these shortages—such as [automanufacturers shifting production to make ventilators and masks](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/two-gm-plants-will-build-ventilators-masks-to-help-fight-covid-19-pandemic/ar-BB11O17H)—other shortages throughout the medical system have been neglected, [including medicine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/critical-inhaler-medication-shortage-looms-coronavirus-cases-soar/story?id=69759965) and [many other medical devices](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update). In the end it is likely there will be an oversupply of gloves, and [undersupply of](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/03/02/coronavirus-outbreak-will-lead-to-more-drug-shortages-in-the-us-including-antibiotics/#3b425623320f) these other products.

On a larger scale, the initial outbreak of Coronavirus in China and the related economic downturn there [led to major disruptions in production and supply](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/trade-lanes/trans-pacific/coronavirus-could-delay-normal-post-cny-trans-pac-flow-march_20200210.html) of made goods made in China. This led to a [significant loss of profits to producers there](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-industrial-profits-idUSKBN21E08I?taid=5e7da812e370aa0001622e7d). It also led to major [disruptions in supply for manufacturers around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/business/hyundai-south-korea-coronavirus.html) who rely on parts and equipment made in China. Following a partial recovery from the pandemic, many businesses and factories in China have quickly invested in the reopening of operations throughout the country, assuming that their international customers would purchase the same approximate quantity of goods that they did before the crisis. However, faced with [declines in demand because of economic crises in the U.S. and Europe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already), these factory owners may experience even further losses on investments. They are already beginning to face issues [due to reduced demand from Europe, the U.S., and other parts of the world.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already) In the face of this downturn, some may overcompensate in other direction and drastically cut back production to a degree that leaves those who require their products with no choice but to look elsewhere, or to go out of business.

Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corporation [recently noted that the impact of production disruptions in Europe on the U.S. economy will be even more significant than the impact of earlier disruptions in China](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/03/the-economic-wallop-of-covid-19-qa-with-rand-experts.html). He stated, “Think about this: China is a major trading partner, and its shutdown negatively affected a lot of U.S. businesses. But the United States receives only 15 percent of its imports from China and sends only 7 percent of its exports to China. We send 34 percent of our exports to the EU and receive 30 percent of our imports from the EU. Now those economies are shut down. Our neighbors Canada and Mexico are also major trading partners with us, so our economic health will depend in part on theirs as well.

Given the non-linear nature of supply-chain disruptions, there is growing worry that economic disruption from the virus will lead to major shortages of important goods, [including a possible world-wide shortage of food](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns). This is growing concern because workers in key food industries are [falling sick with the virus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/food-workers-getting-sick-is-the-latest-threat-to-world-supply). Close quarters and dangerous working conditions make many food factories and slaughterhouses especially dangerous environments during a pandemic. Government officials around the world are already expressing concern [about food riots](https://thewire.in/food/pronob-sen-karan-thapar-coronavirus-food-riots), and last week the Red Cross agency warned that the Coronavirus could [spark mass unrest among West's urban poor](https://news.trust.org/item/20200327134620-yc7e3). The U.S. elite are especially worried about their ability to contain this unrest, given that [police forces across the country](https://apnews.com/069d01bafbb1f15b1f6c4a4479ab1456) and [members of the military are falling sick](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/other/sailors-on-warships-like-uss-theodore-roosevelt-vulnerable-as-coronavirus-spreads/ar-BB11S7WV).

These are just a few example of the complex series of reasons that Trump and other members of the U.S. elite are pushing to get everyone in the U.S. back to work. The capitalists and politicians are of course concerned about the stock market and corporate profits, and it is important to critique them for [prioritizing profits over human lives and well being](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/capitalism-pandemic-coronavirus-covid-19-single-payer). This is an essential feature of capitalism, even during periods of relative stability. However, during a crisis the contradictions of the system intensify, and its logic is laid bare. It’s important to understand the complex dynamics at play and not oversimplify the situation. The maneuvers of the ruling elite not only show that they value profit over the lies of the poor and oppressed people—something which they have made abundantly clear long before this crisis—but also that they are deeply concerned about how this crisis will impact their power, both geopolitically and domestically. In other words, the U.S. elite’s response to this crisis shows not only their greed and callous indifference, but also the fragility of their rule.

Forex,MARKET OUTLOOK: Get Ready for More Volatility,"*March 30, 2020*

Stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities all experienced yet another week of astonishing volatility.

Investors and speculators alike are filled with fear, and that fear is playing out with chaotic price action in the markets. You need to prepare yourself for the fact that this volatility is going to stay with us for a long time.

The U.S. government passed the largest emergency spending bill in history – $2 trillion – but even with the Fed offering unlimited funding, I am quite sure it won’t be enough to fix the broken economy.

Today, I’ll explain what I see ahead for the markets in the current environment. First, some background…

## Total Shutdown, Start of a Deep Depression

Never have we experienced a total shutdown of economic activity through intentional actions, which in this case means telling people to stay at home.

It is not just the depth of the economic collapse. It is also the unprecedented nature of the collapse that will make the healing so difficult.

As we saw with the initial jobless claims of nearly 3.3 million people, many, many jobs will be lost. This is just the start of what will become a very deep recession, or worse.

Even at the height of the Great Depression, unemployment only reached 25%. We may see even worse in this cycle.

Over the coming weeks, we will see tens of millions of additional people losing their jobs. In fact, I expect an avalanche of jobless claims being filed before the end of this quarter.

The St. Louis Fed has just announced that they expect up to *47 million job losses* due to the coronavirus. That is 32% of the workforce.

Our country has never faced anything of this magnitude before, and the markets are clearly not discounting anything so frightening.

These unemployed people still have bills to pay, as do many small businesses, and accompanying these job losses will be terrible levels of sadness, pain, and fear. This will surely weigh on any sort of economic recovery down the road.

There will be unemployment benefits, and the checks from the government will help, but for how long? There are other protective mechanisms that have been put in place, but they are inadequate.

At the same time, shutting down the service economy absolutely needs to be done. Otherwise, we would be looking at an infection that could sicken between 60% and 70% of the population… and perhaps kill as much as 2.5% of the nation. This would create an unacceptable level of suffering which is totally avoidable.

Accordingly, the pain of a self-induced shutdown is worth it, but our government needs to do much more to soften the blow.

## The Impact on the Economy

The problem is workers and businesses need to be given the support to weather the shutdown and – once the outbreak is under control – help restart the economy.

Many business sectors will be crushed. Some of the obvious ones include tourism, commercial airlines, entertainment, restaurants, sports, energy, and many related service-based industries.

Also, the banks will need additional support as they will be pressured to be flexible with clients who have non-performing loans. The larger companies, however, are more likely to have reserves and credit lines which they can draw down in emergencies.

The small businesses typically don’t have these safety nets. Many of these businesses will fail without government help. Such a disruption will make it even more difficult to restart the economy once the outbreak has been brought under control.

Additionally, there is the uncertainty about how long it will take to defeat COVID-19… and businesses hate uncertainty.

This doesn’t even address the challenge of restarting businesses that have ground to a halt.

It takes time to start things back up, and the uncertainty and fear brought about by the economic collapse will likely create a dampening effect on the recovery that the authorities are so desperate to activate.

Over the past 20 years, service workers have become an increasingly large part of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing jobs, mining jobs, and semi-skilled office jobs have dried up, and it’s the people in these service jobs who will struggle the most.

They typically have low pay, few health benefits, and minimal or zero savings. They will struggle the most. They are vulnerable under the best of conditions. These are the worst of conditions.

Expanded unemployment benefits, payments of modest amounts of cash, expanded eligibility to gig workers and self-employed people, and hundreds of billions in liquidity to help businesses stay afloat are all welcome assistance.

Still, certain cities and certain regions will be hit very, very hard.

Cities such as Orlando and Las Vegas, which are very dependent on hotels and tourists, are among the cities that are particularly vulnerable.

Areas of Florida are banning visitors from New York and other states. There certainly won’t be any tourists in those places. Alaska’s entire tourism industry is being absolutely slammed. So are college towns.

The list of vulnerable towns and regions is long. The point is that the aid provided in the announced government programs is not nearly flexible enough to support the most vulnerable regions and towns.

Therefore, I stick to my view that the markets have a great deal of turbulence still to come. The artificially inflated stock market still has a lot of deflating to do.

The unlimited liquidity provided by the Fed may delay another dramatic sell-off in the stock market, but it won’t make the valuations any more sustainable.

In fact, to the contrary, printing funny money and then pumping it into the system only delays the final reckoning; and to some extent, it will likely make it worse.

The fiscal borrowing of the government and the subsequent spending of these borrowed funds on worthwhile infrastructure projects, however, is a very different matter.

Our country is in desperate need of modernizing its infrastructure, and this investment will pay long-term dividends in many, many ways.

High speed train lines, modernized seaports and airports, upgraded bridges and tunnels, and massive improvements in IT will yield immediate and long-term benefits.

There has never been a better time for the government to use its power as the world’s true hegemon and holder of the world’s strongest reserve currency to substantially expand its balance sheet.

It is time to put the entrenched partisanship to the side and cooperate for the safety and well-being of all.

## The Only Win-Win Way Out of This

I know that some very smart people disagree with my eagerness to embrace a massive New Deal. However, I don’t see another way out of this that could prove to be a win-win for all concerned.

This is far different from cranking up the printing presses and throwing unlimited liquidity at the financial markets.

Millions of people would be put to work. And the improvements in efficiency and modernization would make us by far the world’s most competitive economy.

We would undoubtedly see advances in technology as another positive by-product of this investment, and that would spin off still more benefits for all of us.

In the meanwhile, I don’t expect Congress to be nearly proactive enough. The size of the borrowing that we need is enormous, dwarfing the $2 trillion package that was just passed. It would balloon our balance sheet.

That will make many fiscally prudent people pause, so the most likely path for us will be to watch the government react to each new downturn, never getting ahead of the problem.

This means that to some extent we will be repeating the mistakes of the 1930s, muddling through because we aren’t bold enough.

## The Impact on the Markets

The impact of this strategy on the markets will not be friendly, so we should be prepared for perhaps even greater volatility to follow.

Many pundits greeted last week’s violent recovery in the stock market as a sign that the bottom is in. They advised their clients to load up on stocks, lest they miss the next bull run.

I believe it is way too early to make this claim. Even if the bottom is in place, we should have plenty of time before the bull run resumes.

Multi-year bull markets don’t finish their corrective process in a few days, or even in a few weeks. It takes much more time than that to work off the extreme overbought conditions, so we should be patient and wait for the further tests of the downside.

It is possible that the remarkably aggressive actions by the Fed will be enough to artificially prop up the stock market, and perhaps even help propel another strong rally.

However, I would much prefer to buy the stock market when it is driven by powerful growth rather than the Fed’s funny money.

An environment of low rates and strong growth would be a great combination, but we are far from a macro-economic environment of sustained strong growth. Only a v-shaped recovery could produce those results.

That said, even if a v-shaped recovery is going to come (which I doubt), I believe it is way too early for it to start.

## The Impact on Currencies

When I wrote last week about my expectation of a strong stock market recovery, I was merely expecting a violent technical reaction to an oversold market, not the start of a sustained rally.

We have gotten that sharp rally, but from the 2700 level in the S&amp;P’s, I am quite bearish for the time being.

Given how early we are in the battle against the coronavirus, I am now quite convinced that the market needs to probe lower levels and really test the bottom before we can have a sustained recovery.

In my most bearish scenario, we could drop another 30% to 35% from last week’s high. Even in my most constructive scenario, we need to probe the year’s lows again to test whether that base is truly solid.

In terms of currencies, I am still very constructive on the Japanese yen, and to a lesser extent, the Swiss franc.

We have had sharp technical recoveries in the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, and British pound, but I am looking for levels to go short these currencies against the yen.

We are not quite ready, but we are getting close.

Our recent trades in the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen have worked out just fine, and we will almost certainly be re-establishing short positions there once we get more comfortable with the technical outlook in the pair.",finance

personalfinance,0% gov't student loans,"I only have gov't loans, and my plan was originally to ride them out for the duration of my 10 year payment plan being that the interest rates were between 3.5-4.7% (I'm currently 2 years in).  However, now that interest rates are 0%, should I increase my payments to pay my loans off faster?

Riding them out means more cash on hand, as well as more to invest. However, at the same time, I feel like I should capitalize on the 0%

personalfinance,Should I take my defer option?,"backstory: Bought a car on 2-17-20 (kinda got screwed on timing, but oh well, the car i got rid of i had for 16 years, and was 21 years old total)

Credit score is great, however the history is too shallow, so i couldn't get a good rate. (5.5%)

Today:

I made my first payment last week. I have the option to defer 3 months (mazda capital financing, loan with Chase) So I'm not sure what i should do. I work in a pharmacy so i'm still working, only way i'll be out of work is if i catch the virus. I have more than 6 months saved up of expenses so i'm not necessarily hurting, but you make money by capitalizing on opportunity. 

What do I do?

Obviously I want to refinance this interest rate ASAP. However can't do that as the loan is too fresh (wait 6 months).

If I defer, my credit score isnt continuing to mature because i'm not paying the loan. 

If I don't defer i'm still paying at a high interest rate.

If i defer, but still make monthly payments, am i avoiding interest rates AND continuing to mature my credit?

any pointers would be much appreciated.",finance
investing,Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery,"The coronavirus is guaranteed to throw the world into recession, but economists are becoming less convinced about the potential for a strong snapback in growth.

The base case for forecasters is that a recovery, perhaps even a vigorous one, gets under way in the second half of 2020. But as the pandemic spreads through Europe and the Americas, and the wide range of knock-on effects comes into clearer view, caveats to that call are piling up.

relates to Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery Underlying all of them is the simple fact that economic outcomes hinge on something that’s beyond the professional competence of most economists to forecast: the trajectory of the disease itself.

“We have no certainty the virus will be gone by the end of the second quarter,” said Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York. If it “lasts through the summer, then all the effects will be amplified.”

Read More: Economists See U.S. Facing Worst-Ever Quarterly Contraction

Beyond that, there is an array of questions for economists to grapple with -- and those doubts increasingly undermine projections for what’s known as a “V-shaped recovery,” in which lost output is quickly restored.

Rather than sounding a decisive “all clear,” health authorities seem likely to advocate a gradual return to normal working life, so the behavior known as “social distancing” may stick around.

Along with financial blows sustained during the downturn, that is likely to damp spending on travel or spending at shops or restaurants -- assuming those businesses can stay afloat in the first place.

“It takes more time to get ‘back to play’ than to ‘get back to work’,” said Catherine Mann, chief economist at Citigroup Inc. This “underpins concerns for the trajectory for services-dependent advanced economies in the second half of 2020,” she said.

Note: Map shows rate decisions since the start of the year

Consumer caution is already evident in China, even though authorities say it’s safe to go back into the marketplace, and it could happen elsewhere.

That’s why Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, likens his forecast to a “Nike swoosh” rather than a V- or U-shaped rebound. He says U.S. output alone could plunge at an annualized pace of as much as 25% in the second quarter, bounce back by up to 15% in the third, then stall in the fourth with the economy “basically limping along.”

Much will depend on how fast businesses bring back jobs. The International Labor Organization warns 25 million positions may be shed, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on Tuesday it expected U.S. unemployment to soar to 15%.

Mckinsey &amp; Co. notes one quarter of U.S. households already live from paycheck to paycheck, and that 40% of Americans are unable to cover an unexpected expense of $400 without borrowing.

Stiglitz worries about what he calls “financial gridlock” in which households and companies can’t pay bills, forcing those they owe to into bankruptcy and default as well and so on.

That threat could be heightened by the scale of borrowing in recent years. The Institute of International Finance estimates household debt -- as a share of output -- is at record levels in several economies.

Who’s Borrowing? In many countries, households didn’t delever after the financial crisis

Source: Bank for International Settlements

Corporate borrowing has also hit a high in countries including France and the U.S. Those debts along with the collapse in earnings and slide in equities may limit the ability of companies to reboot after the crisis, with some also likely to be hurt by the collapse in oil prices.

“In any recovery, firms may need to sell shares or slash capex to reduce debt or repay government assistance,” said Charles Dumas of TS Lombard.

Keen to avoid an extended recession, policy makers have been taking emergency measures on a scale that likely exceeds even the response to the 2008 financial crisis. They’re extending credit lifelines to business, paying cash to households, and helping companies cover their wage bills so they don’t have to fire workers. Central banks have slashed interest rates and started new asset-purchase programs.

Read more: Understanding Recessions as World Heads Into One: QuickTake

The strongest argument for a rapid recovery is what economists call “pent-up demand” -- a label that applies quite literally in the current crisis.

Economies shuddered to a halt when people were forced to hunker down at home, so there should be a corresponding upswing when they’re allowed out again -- especially with governments everywhere injecting cash to speed the process.

“Assuming the outbreak peaks by April/May, this will likely set the stage for a recovery in the second half of 2020,” said Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

He predicts the global economy will contract 2.3% on an annualized basis in the first half of the year before growing 1.5% in the second half. Even that scenario means the U.S. and euro area won’t regain their pre-crisis levels of output until the third quarter of 2021.

Bond-Purchasing Programs The coronavirus pandemic has driven more central banks to buy bonds

Source: Bloomberg

At JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., economists led by Bruce Kasman are citing emerging markets as another source of concern. They’re being pinched by gains in the dollar and the outflow of foreign-held capital, pushing up local borrowing costs.

The most encouraging virus news for economists at the moment comes from Asia, which suffered the first outbreaks but appears to have gotten them under a degree of control.

China is cranking back into action, with numbers released on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March.

Demand in the domestic market is reviving, as lockdowns ease and consumers return to the shops or showrooms. Auto sales, for example, have been ticking higher for weeks, though they’re still down some 40% from last year’s level.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say... “If outbreaks in other countries follow the same trajectory, the world economy could be up and running again by the start of the second half. But that’s far from guaranteed. Past pandemics lasted years, not months. Scientists at Imperial College London are warning containment measures may have to stay in place for 18 months.”

-- Tom Orlik, chief economist. See {BECO &lt;GO&gt;}

International orders, though, may take longer to recover. Because other economies got hit later by the virus, they’re seeing a slump in demand for imports just as China’s export engine is revving up again. That feedback loop may undermine other recoveries too.

And in China, as in other countries, economics will continue to depend on epidemiology for some time to come. Even as overall progress is made toward containing the coronavirus and developing a vaccine, there’s no guarantee that the movement will be in one direction.

Instead there could be “aftershocks following the initial outbreak, with restrictions being re-imposed and lifted so as to manage the capacity of the healthcare system to cope,” said Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management. “In economic terms, this would lead to a double-dip recession.”

History also suggests reason to worry. A just-published study of pandemics and armed conflicts found such shocks typically weigh on wages and investment for years to come.

So now what if the GDP drops this year because the corona crisis bankrupts a lot of small businesses. As soon as the crisis ends we have a lower Y but a higher Velocity (people can spend again).

There are less Goods and services created, Y goes down

economy,One Turtle's Coronavirus Predictions,"I'm no Tooter Turtle (but watching that cartoon as a child taught me a lot of what I needed to know).   I'm not Mr. Wizard.  I'm not even a lizard.  Nor do I have a magic wand.  Poor Tooter, always getting himself into trouble.  But I've been thinking about the short, and long term changes the pandemic will bring to the United States and the World, so here are some musings and predictions, in no particular order...

\- Always make sure you have enough toilet paper squirreled away.  BTW, I do think the dearth of TP in the stores will disappear as quickly as it began, within the next few weeks.  The bottled water shortage seems to have already resolved itself to a large degree, so I'm confident that once people run out of room to store their TP inventory, the problem will vanish.  Unless the next pandemic is cholera.  I better stock up on Immodium, now.

\- Bet there aren't a lot of Mormons standing in line at Costco warehouses in Utah, trying to score bottled water, rice, paper towels or canned goods.  Maybe we can all learn something about preparedness from them.

\- Don't expect much in the way of professional sports, thru the end of 2020.  Maybe some spectator-less games, but I think the year will pretty much be a washout.

\- The stay-at-home and work-from-home orders many Americans are now following will have a profound, lasting effect on everything from commercial real estate (shopping centers, as well as office space), to the retail sector (as if the Internet hasn't already destroyed many traditional retailers), to energy prices (can you say dollar-a-gallon gasoline?), energy conservation, higher education, the travel industry, the automobile industry, etc., etc.

\- Expect computers, laptops, tablets, cellphones, etc. to be in short supply, as people upgrade/augment the technology they currently have, in large part fueled by the move to work-from-home.

\- With the newly accelerated move (thanks to the pandemic) to online everything, not to mention the ""Internet-Of-Things"", expect an even greater increase in cybercrime, phishing, malware, ransomware, and all of the other truly horrible things that dwell in the underbelly of the Internet, and which governments around the world still haven't figured out how to combat.

\- Expect U.S. hospitals to start seeking healthcare professionals in other countries to come here to help us, at least in the short term.  There is already a call for doctors and nurses in less-affected parts of the country to come and help out the hardest hit areas.  

\- Expect the National Guard to be called on to help bury the victims, who are already overrunning morgues in places like New York City.  Maybe even to assist police departments and other essential government agencies, if manpower shortages become critical.

\- Expect Amazon to be impacted even more than they have been already.  Expect the Postal Service, United Parcel, FedEx, et. al., to experience manpower shortages that will impact their ability to deliver stuff.  Expect a revolt by the 150 milllion Amazon Prime members who pay $120.00 a year for a Prime membership, but who can't get same-day, next-day or two-day delivery of almost anything in the Universe, either because Jeff Bezos had to enlist all of his Amazonians to help him count his money, or he just doesn't have the ability to keep things in stock, or get what he does have in stock delivered in a day or two.

\- Speaking of Amazon, expect the rise of new Amazon-scale online retailers, fueled in large part by the explosion of online commerce related to the Coronavirus.  It's OK, Jeffrey Preston.  You'll do just fine.  I digress, but does anyone else think Jeff Bezos resembles a turtle?  This is actually a desirable quality, if you know where I'm coming from.  A DNA test should end the speculation once and for all.

\- Expect a Coronavirus vaccine to become available within the next few months.

\- Expect the nation's cellular carriers to be laughing all the way to the bank.

\- Expect the nation's schools and colleges to stick with online-only learning, at least thru the end of the current school year, and maybe longer.

\- So far, the pandemic has accomplished what no mere mortal has been able to do.  It has eliminated rush-hour traffic, postponed the Olympics, lowered the crime rate, and at least at this turtle's residence, has all but eliminated spam phone calls, telemarketers, and robocalls (sorry, FTC's Do-Not-Call List, but you never really helped).  Our phone has been so quiet, we pick it up a few times a day, just to see if there's still a dial tone.  We also can't believe how quiet it is outside, at night.  The silence is truly deafening, and something we've only previously experienced during or after a heavy snowfall, when the novel blanket of whiteness provides a layer of acoustic insulation, damping down most all man-made sounds.  Really.  Go outside tonight and listen to the sound of silence.   Expect a certain Simon &amp; Garfunkel song to enjoy a renewed popularity.

personalfinance,Should I pay my credit card off in full even if it means I have to use it to get through the next month(s)?,"When I was about 18 I ended up losing my job.

personalfinance,"Tax arbitrage strategy for NY residents over age 59.5 who are eligible to make a deductible IRA contribution, but who were not otherwise going to do so.","This will apply to a very narrow segment of Redditors, but some of your parents may be interested.

The background for this post is that for NY residents who are over age 59.5, the first $20K of 1099-R income is exempt from state income tax (the [Pension and Annuity income exclusion](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/file/information_for_seniors.htm)).

So, if the following are all true...

1. Taxpayer is over age 59.5 and a resident of NY
2. Taxpayer is eligible to make a deductible IRA contribution in a given tax year
3. Taxpayer wasn't otherwise planning on making an IRA contribution
4. Taxpayer is not fully utilizing the $20K Pension and Annuity income exclusion at the NYS level

...then the taxpayer can make a $7K contribution to an IRA and then immediately withdraw said contribution.  This zero-cost strategy has no impact on federal income tax (because the deductible contribution offsets the taxable distribution; it also doesn't impact the taxation of social security, if applicable), but saves the income tax on $7K at the NY level.  This is because the contribution is deductible on the state income tax return, and the distribution is not taxable due to the Pension and Annuity income exclusion.

While the NYS income tax rate can technically be as high as 8.82%, most taxpayers who are eligible for this strategy will save between 4% and 6.85% on the contribution, which is as much as $480 for something that costs $0 out-of-pocket.  NYC residents would save even more due to the city income tax on top of the state income tax.

While this strategy may be morally questionable, particularly in a time where NY is facing a tremendous budget crises (due to COVID-19, but also in general), it is technically legal and reduces state income taxes significantly.",finance

personalfinance,Would it be prudent to accept an unnecessary $2500 subsidized student loan to contribute to a Roth IRA at age 19?,"Pretty much title. I opened a Roth a few weeks ago and am going to contribute $100 a month for now. Would it be financially wise to accept a student loan that I don’t need to pay for education expenses and instead dump it all into my Roth for 2020? 
 
I already have student loans from my very first semester, but haven’t taken any out since. The principal balance was $4750 which I’ve paid off to $3999. Half subsidized with an interest rate of 5.05%, (and it’s slightly lower now since I have automatic $10 monthly payments set up, which essentially cover the interest).
 
My thinking is the earnings in the Roth, especially since I’m so young, will far outweigh the costs of the loan. But, I’m 19 and don’t know what I’m doing. What do you guys think?
 
Edit: I’ll be 20 when this transaction potentially takes place, if that makes any difference. My portfolio is one mutual fund VAFAX. I’m not necessarily counting on this money to pay back the loan. My loan payments will be under $100 a month and I anticipate sufficient income",finance
personalfinance,Estate Taxes: when do you file K-1s and how do you fill out 1041-Ts?,"I'm filing taxes for the estate of a deceased person. It's a pretty simple estate that has already been closed (with all the assets distributed to beneficiaries in 2019), and this will be the final year of filing taxes for it. The estate did technically have income for 2019 (before it was closed) because it received some dividends and subsequently sold that stock, so I filled out the 1041. It looks like the estate owes $ in taxes so I'm planning on sending a check to the federal government when I send in these tax forms (by mail, as I am not bothering with getting TurboTax Business -- don't get me started). The payment will have to be via a personal check in my name because, like I said, the estate doesn't exist anymore.

I'm looking for clarification about K-1s as well as 1041-Ts:
1) Is it true that, no matter what, this being the final time the estate will file taxes, I must prepare K-1s for each beneficiary? Also, if I do have to prepare K-1s, do I have to divide up all the income that was outlined in the 1041 amongst the beneficiaries and list that on each K-1? Or would I only do that if the estate was not covering the payment itself when submitting the tax forms?
Note: technically the income received in 2019 was disbursed to beneficiaries in 2019, insofar as that's when the final estate distribution happened. But it wasn't like an annual discretionary payout or a payout based on the income received.

2) Can someone explain the 1041-T to me in simple terms? (Is there basically a tax benefit for a beneficiary who personally paid an estate's taxes?? If so, why? In my case, as I'm sure in many others, the estate was split evenly three ways and we're going to split the tax payment three ways so it makes no difference that the estate itself is closed, so I'm confused.) Regardless, is the 1041-T only something I should fill out if any of the beneficiaries are planning on itemizing their personal taxes?",finance

investing,Is the Fed acting foolishly?,"First off, I would like to emphasize that I am supporter and believer in hard money backed and redeemable in gold and silver at 100% as the only sound approach to "" just money"". Therefore, the current Fiat dollar  world reserve currency is in my judgment criminal, unfair, unjust, and more importantly, unsustainable.

However, the recent Fed intervention had been quite shocking to say the least. They have even aroused a great deal of criticism  among keynesians and all sorts of pseudo conservatives.
 The point is, the Fed has proported to engage in an ""unlimited"" QE policy aimed at supporting the US financial markets and economy in times of extreme duress and beyond. Gold and silver coins have been flying off the shelves, and many experts have claimed the beginning of the end to the US dollar hegemony. 

But is it the case? What do you think of it? 

My opinion. 

In the long term, there is no way out for the US dollar. We cannot possibly pay for all our obligations; the future of the US currency is Gold. How the authority will structure that system is another story. While I think we ought to return to a pre WW1 gold standard, the reality is that politicians as always, will try to fool the masses with a pseudo gold standard that still give them the necessary leeway to inflate and make promises for their constituencies. 

However, within the short term, the Fed, unfortunately, has enough room to navigate and increase its balance sheets by trillions increments as the world is, truly, dealing with a Shortage of USD. 

Most countries have been mirroring the Fed policies of low/negative rates while also expending their balance sheets to support their economies. In times of hardship though, investors are fully aware of the fragility of their local currencies, they thus run to the USD for stability at the expense of their own monies. Which logically strengthen the perception of of the USD soundness in relation to all the others currencies. Thus, the dollar shortage is today's Coronavirus hysteria and panic. 

 In an atmosphere of competitive devaluation, the Fed is the one seeing eye in a crowd of blinds. Until things change drastically, which often take a conflict or war, the Fed and the USD will remain the reserve currency and the demand for dollar will remain at worse constant. The Fed is aware of THIS; thus explaining their generous and almost historic expansion of their monetary base to bailout "" everyone"" and Wallstreet in particular.

investing,Question: Quantative Easement,"Now that 3.5 trillion dollars has been allocated by the government to loan to business, my understanding is large companies are using these loans to buy up their own stocks while they are low, with the idea to sell them back to investors and pay off loans in a year or whenever those expire. Is this correct?

My understanding is that stocks went up simply because the market was inflated in this process. Basically the same amount that something like milk would go up in price at the market if fed just printed and sent all that money to Americans. 

Assuming all of those loans get paid back, does this create a temporary inflation?

personalfinance,Start searching for a home in June or wait until December with a larger downpayment?,"1. We make around 170k combined and want to buy in a high cost-of-living area using a VA loan. We both have stable jobs. 

2. Our budget is going to be around 400-475k (the property taxes are low). 

3. We put at least 15% of our income towards retirement, and our only real debt is my student loans, which I pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness on. Right now, we only have around 10k in savings each (20k total). Credit scores are around 770 and 720.  

4. However, with what's going on with COVID-19, we're able to focus more on saving. I should be able to save at least 6k by November. My fiance has stock as part of work that vests in May and November. I'd estimate he could save up around 24k between vests and savings, but that depends on the market. So we'll go with 30k there. Plus my work offers a downpayment closing assistance program (matching grant/0% loan) that would be 25k in assistance. We can't use the program right now because they're are no orientations running due to COVID-19. That would be enough for closing costs and probably 10% down. 

5. So to sum it up, if we started our search in June, we'd only have maybe 15k (so basically just closing costs). If we waited until December, we'd have closer to 55k. However, our lease ends in July, and our rent is going to go up probably $400 a month due to the month-to-month fee and increases. Should we seek pre-approval in June and see if something comes up (and avoid expensive monthly rent), or wait until November, where we could have 10% and stretch our budget a little more?

TLDR: My fiance thinks because interest rates are (usually) low and our rent is going up so much ($400) we should seek pre-approval and start making offers in June. I'm wondering if we should wait until December, where we could scrounge up 10% down.

Here is my situation:
I have a mortgage on my property back in 2017 and the interest rate is 4.5%. As you all know, the interest rate has dropped and I would like to lower my interest rate as well.

Have anyone of you have any experience on this?

Thanks.

personalfinance,I do not qualify for a home refinance at the moment and have some questions about making it so I would or what waiting until next year would look like.,"I just applied for a refinance hoping to take advantage of the low interest rates. I did not qualify. 

My income is $50,000 a year before deductions and $27,000 after deductions. 

I am self employed and work from home. 

My ex husband also gives me $2,400 a month and has for years. It is not court ordered and he likes it that way. 

I’ve been told by every mortgage broker that if it was court ordered I can count it as income. 

I have also been making another $1665 a month ($20,000 a year) beginning in January so I do think if I wait I would qualify next year. 

I am putting that extra money in savings every month to be clear. 

I had a talk with him last night and he’s hesitantly open to signing a court order so I can get a better deal on my mortgage now. Who knows how this pandemic will pan out though. I think my having lower mortgage payments will benefit both of us and be safer. 

I’m fine with him paying me less as well because of it so I’m curious just how much he would need to pay me to still have me qualify. 

I owe $208,000 on my home at 8% interest. I have a private loan for obvious reasons. I had the money just not the work history/income. Overall my payments are very affordable and I pay extra every month. But they could be so much lower and more could go to principle especially if I keep paying the same amount I’m paying now. 

So Reddit what are your recommendations? What is the best way to navigate this? I am calling the family court now. I do have all my paperwork saying I have sole custody of the kids. He’s a great dad now but in the past he made some really dumb choices and I got sole custody. To be clear he’s very involved in there lives and we’re good friends. 

I have $3500 in credit card debt that will be paid off this month as one client pays me in chunks. 

I have $118,000 in student loans that are deferred for three years with zero interest at the moment. My plan is to focus on paying my home down now and when the three years is up focus on the loans. 

My concern with waiting until next year is who knows where we will be. My industry is essential and sales are good but if people are destitute they won’t be spending money. 

And what if banks aren’t lending? What if they raise the income ratio? Many what ifs. 

I do not think if things got bad that my private lender would care. If I had a bank loan there is more room for forgiveness through the government. 

Since I’m now working from home I’m thankfully spending a lot less and saving more.

This post is more to explain to people who either haven’t read or refute the PD instructions on this, or who want to understand why you should maintain an efund even in debt. The PD does not explain why it’s a good idea. If you already advocate for the 1k efund, great! You probably aren’t interested in this post. END EDIT

On this sub, when someone is making a budget and has a lot of CC debt, very common advice is not to keep an emergency fund at all. The reasoning here is that CC debt has a very high interest rate, and if you are paying off your credit card debt aggressively you should throw the money in that E-fund towards it. After all, you can just use the CCs for emergencies if need be.

I think this is an extremely flawed logic, and seems to be most often touted by people who do not have personal experience with credit card debt or for whom the emergencies never piled on. When I first came to this sub I followed that logic. I have since totally changed my mind and keep a $1000 E-fund, even though I am still paying off my credit card debt (About halfway there, woooo!).  Here are the main reasons why:

1. **Mental health. Using a Credit Card for emergencies when you already have debt causes more stress and anxiety.** If you are a person who has racked up CC debt, you already have anxiety about money and poor habits. By starting to pay off that debt, you take control of that anxiety. If you have to then add more debt to handle a car repair or unexpected medical bill, it feels like you walked one step forward and two steps back, *even if you are still in less debt that you started with.* It just feels icky. If you can pay that in cash, no icky feeling, and it feels more like you might need to pause to smell the roses (replenish E-fund) for a month rather than like you walked backwards.
2. **Surprises from the CC company.** Sometimes paying off your debt can have unexpected caveats. Right after vanquishing my e-fund and making a $1500 payment to my largest card, I needed to book a plane ticket back home for a family emergency. When I went to book the ticket, my card declined. When I called the company, they told me that they had recently reviewed my account and had chosen to lower my credit limit to ""help me maintain less debt overall."" They had lowered it to about $100 above my current balance. No matter who I talked to at the CC company they refused to reevaluate and raise the limit back. In this case the plan to not have an e-fund totally backfired, and I had to take a short term loan to get home.
3. **Emergencies can stack and CCs become a crutch.** The nice thing about cash, is that it is just there, and when you use it is gone. Often if you are someone with credit card debt, the rest of your life isn't that much more together. You might be someone who takes the car in to get a repair and the next day has an emergency tooth extraction. Or you go to pay your registration only to find you have $100 bill for an unpaid toll and it's late fees. Learning to budget is hard, and you will have unexpected expense after unexpected expense come up in the beginning. Learning to plan for those expenses with cash is a huge part of gaining control of your money. If you have to put these back on your CC, you will likely forget to pay them come paycheck time and they will rack up interest, just like before. If you have a cash stack you can throw at it, you at least only rack up interest on your past mistakes. ***This goes back to mental health***\*.\* If I look at a CC statement and my last transactions were from 6 months ago, even if my balance hasn't moved much I feel good that I haven't been using that crutch. If I see a transaction from that crown I had to get last month, I feel anxious about that looming bill, and have low self esteem that I still have to rely on CCs.

You'll notice I mention mental health and anxiety a lot. **Stress, anxiety, and overall mental health have a huge impact on decision making.** So while mathematically certain financial decisions don't make sense, if they have a positive impact on your mental health it is worth it, because it helps you make better financial decisions in the future.",finance

""They're too big to fail, right? If the govt bails them out they must be a great investment!""

Yea... maybe. Maybe not.

Actual text from the bill, regarding the Govt getting equity in exchange for loans:

\#####

(d) FINANCIAL PROTECTION OF GOVERNMENT.—

(1) WARRANT OR SENIOR DEBT INSTRUMENT.—The Secretary may not issue a loan to, or  a loan guarantee for, an eligible business under 5 paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (b) unless—

(A) (i) the eligible business has issued securities that are traded on a national securities exchange; and (ii) the Secretary receives a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business; or

(B) in the case of any eligible business other than an eligible business described in sub paragraph (A), the Secretary receives, in the discretion of the Secretary— (i) a warrant or equity interest in the eligible business; or (ii) a senior debt instrument issued by the eligible business.

(2) TERMS AND CONDITIONS.—The terms and conditions of any warrant, equity interest, or senior debt instrument received under paragraph (1) shall be set by the Secretary and shall meet the following requirements:

(A) PURPOSES.—Such terms and conditions shall be designed to provide for a reasonable participation by the Secretary, for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity appreciation in the case of a warrant or other equity interest, or a reasonable interest rate premium, in the case of a debt instrument.

(B) AUTHORITY TO SELL, EXERCISE, OR SURRENDER.—For the primary benefit of taxpayers, the Secretary may sell, exercise, or surrender a warrant or any senior debt instrument received under this subsection. The Secretary shall not exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock acquired under this section.

(C) SUFFICIENCY.—If the Secretary determines that the eligible business cannot feasibly issue warrants or other equity interests as required by this subsection, the Secretary may accept a senior debt instrument in an amount and on such terms as the Secretary deems appropriate.

\#####

What does this mean?

1. If the Govt takes equity, current shareholders could be diluted.
2. A company could choose bankruptcy over these terms.
3. Even if a company takes a loan, they could still go bankrupt later.
4. This will be decided on a company by company basis, and no one knows exactly how it will play out.

As for my current job, there is no reason to believe there will be layoffs, everyone is working from home for now, and we have been told we are by no means overstaffed, however, one person was let go last week (word on the street says it was for performance reasons), so I'm not in desperate need to find something else, HOWEVER, our clients are big hedge funds and investment companies, which means that if we start losing clients, lay offs actually might happen if this COVID situation holds on for too long.

I've been offered a position as an IT Risk Analyst by a recruiter that has been in contact with me for a bit, by a company which seems to be one of those industries that are actually doing fairly well during this crisis (evident by the fact that they're immediately hiring).  This would be a no brainer for me, if it wasn't for the fact that is a ""contract-to-hire"" position. I expressed my worries to the recruiter and he basically just said that everyone he has placed in that company has converted to full hire (some earlier than 6 months). As far as pay, it would be a 20% salary increase (lower than that, considering the staffing company does offer medical benefits but it's a little pricier than what I currently pay), and as far as job happiness, I would definitely be happier with something closer to computers (although not Computer Science) than what I currently do.

So my question is, how good/bad of a decision is it to take this opportunity? As I mentioned, it would be easy to decide if it was a direct hire, but I've never worked as a contractor and I don't exactly know how that works. If in 6 months I ended up not being hired and had to spend months looking for a job (depending on how bad the economy will tank), it could be devastating for me considering I have routine medical procedures that are only affordable through insurance.",finance

stocks,Gundlach: US stocks have not bottomed and this crash most closely resembles 1929,"[https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/04/01/gundlach-u-s-stocks-have-not-bottomed](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/04/01/gundlach-u-s-stocks-have-not-bottomed)

Some comprehensive thoughts from Jeff Gundlach on stocks, bonds, gold, USD and the economy. 

Some highlights: 

* He compared U.S. equities to Japan in 1989, Europe in 1999 and the emerging markets in 2006. Like those markets, “the U.S. will be a poor performer and it will not get back to its high on a real basis,” Gundlach said.
* The economy faces deflation. The drop in oil and copper prices has “devastated U.S. industries,” he said. Based on historical patterns of commodity prices, Gundlach said, there is no hope to think the economy will rebound in Q3.
* “When we go through this stay-at-home period,” Gundlach said, “we start to change our habits. The lessons we learned about commuting, working from home and not polluting the air sink in, and we may never go back to where we were, particularly the longer it drags on.”
* Our economy will be less globalized, he said, because manufacturing will come back to the U.S. The biggest winner will be the American economy, as it moves from outsourcing to self-sufficiency. Inventories will move away from “just in time” levels, he predicted.
* There is a “real shortage” of physical gold, he warned. Too many speculative securities are not backed by the physical commodity. If gold skyrockets in price, he said, there won’t be enough metal and “something bad will happen. There could be a huge failure in the gold market.”
* Negative interest rates have decimated banking stocks when they have been tried, like in Japan and Europe. Many analysts are saying they “love” the banks, according to Gundlach. But loan and credit card payments will suffer, given the forecasted unemployment, so he does not ascribe to that view.",finance
investing,Can the Fed really buy commercial and government issued paper to infinity??,"Ive been think about this a lot lately. Of course they would say they will purchase until the cows come home, but can they really? 

I think they are constrained by 1 of their dual mandates, inflation.  I believe this won't be changed because the powers that be, the elite Americans who hold the keys, would have their fortunes eroded should high inflation kick in.  At this point, the Fed would limit its buying paper bonds and limit funding.

1) since the deflationary pressures are currently very strong, this risk is low at the moment.

2) the Fed is heavily distorting the price of bonds. Especially private sector bonds.  Risk of default has increased dramatically, so naturally any lender would need a higher return to offset this risk....but instead, rates are dropping un naturally due to the FED intervention. As the spread of real versus artificial cost of this paper widens, many many companies will not be selling to any rational private person, so the FED will need to buy, rocketing up their balance sheet.

What happens when a lot of these companies go bankrupt? If it is real estate backed then over time this land can be auctioned back off to the public.

But what about companies whose equipment rusts and deteriorates, companies whose vaule is more intrinsic, etc....when companies whose value is not in land or gold, something that can't last 50 years....what then? 

Does the dollar get destroyed? How? Interest rates skyrocket?

Answer:  i think interest rates will skyrocket after inflation picks up and the Fed stops buying commercial paper and as much government bonds.  I think what will happen is the Fed will continue this program, but unlike 2008-09, as real demand has crumbled from underneath the feet, the cash injected will start to bid up the shrinking circle of areas that cash can be used to buy for investment. 

 Inflation begins.  If this happens the Fed has to cut back their purchasing and interest rates will sling shot up to the real world.  



So how long can this go on for? And what is the long term (maybe short) cost of what the Fed is doing going to be?",finance
economy,Is Paul Krugman misrepresenting source of stimulus relief?,"I was reading a piece written in the New York Times today by Paul Krugman, regarding the stimulus package.  When he comes to the piece on how it is paid for he says *""But why is borrowing so cheap? Where’s the money coming from? The answer is private savings that have nowhere else to go.""*      
The man is smart enough to know what money printing ""quantitative easing"" is.  And he surely knows that without money printing to purchase debt and put it on the books of the Fed, that the debt markets would hardly resolve to 0% with $2T chasing financing because of supply/demand dynamics.  The Fed had already announced that they would print and buy $500B of Trump's $1T deficit.   Now Paul want us to think that they want to place $2T in the debt markets, and think interest rates would stay at 0% while private purchasers and not the Fed buy the debt.      
I don't buy that this piece was honestly written.  There is nothing in there about QE, and absent such inclusion, that is a omission of a material fact by someone who has the expertise to understand its relevance.

personalfinance,PA Resident - Forced Mandatory Salary Reduction,"COVID Right?  


I am a salaried employee of Pennsylvania making less than 50k. My company instituted ""pay cuts across the board"" but obviously did not disclose what everyone was losing. I am losing roughly 29% of my salary. My rough math makes it seem my PA unemployment rate (based on my previous earning years) plus proposed federal assistance would have me considerably more whole than my new mandatory salary. 

They sent us a letter disclosing our new salary amount and have asked us to sign it. I have not signed it yet and was told by management that signing it is more an act of solidarity and I do not need to sign it. It's happening. 

I have also been told that I have 3 options. 

* Work at the new rate
* Resign
* Apply to the ""hardship committee""

The hardship committee is a confidential form I can fill out that apparently goes to the co-owners and I have to provide them with a reason I need more money than what they told me my cut rate is. Barely seems legal... What if I have an underlying health/addiction/credit issue. I don't think they're allowed to ask that? I have to disclose it and they will be making an equally confidential determination on my eligibility for this.

personalfinance,Which debt to worry about right now? Or is saving better?,"Hey y'all! IDK how to TLDR this to be honest, so here goes

so I'm currently under a garnishment, but that's about to end either my paycheck on the 18 Apr or 02 May will be the last payment. I have $53437.94 in federal student loan debt, which I currently have on Income Based Repayment (plus the current deferment from the US govt) with interest rates ranging from 6%-6.8%

I have a private student loan with an outstanding balance of $7,702.73 and an interest rate of 3.5% (yes that is correct, I've had folks be amazed at that. don't ask me how I lucked into it!)

Additionally I have 2940 in various collections (I've been dumb with money, I have no issue admitting that) 500 of that is about to fall off bc I just paid it to upgrade my internet so I can work remotely. One of these collections is 4 yr one of them is 3 years, I intend to save these for last since it's highly likely that given the amount I make (24k ish a year) it might take me until the clock runs out to pay it all off.

I have no savings, no emergency fund, I do have an HSA and a limited FSA that are more than my out of pocket max for health insurance, dental and vision. My work automatically sets us up a 401k and matches up to our 4%, I intend to keep that going, even during this financially difficult time, because when (hopefully) the markets rebound, I'd like to have that there already.

I am 31, intend to go to grad school sometime in the next couple years, but the options I'm looking at all involve either good scholarships, or special loans with special repayment terms (seminary, no/min interest accrual, work in a church as a pastor for 5 years and they'll repay 20% a year, so 100% of the loan)

Until I finish my grad school, I don't intend to worry about buying a house unless I magically come into money and can buy in a college town to rent out after I leave. I do want to purchase a car within the next year, I'm epileptic, and we've finally figured out meds that suppress my seizures and I've been seizure free for 8 months, so I'm comfortable planning on doing that within the year.

Give me advice, be frank and honest, I'm not looking for sugar coating here, I just want the real truth about how to better my financial situation (budgeting obvi) and credit and achieve my goals.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently sitting at -42% on Wells Fargo (WFC). I don't feel too terrible about the position but I have been considering selling it and immediately buying back into FNCL instead. FNCL is just a broad base finance ETF if you're not familiar (top 5 holdings: JPM, BRKB, BAC, WFC, C).

As I see it, owning anything in the finance sector at this point in time is basically a long term bet in high level gov/fed policy migrating back to a more ""normal"" realm within the next 3-5 years. Switching this position from WFC to FNCL seems like it would help emphasize that aspect of the thesis and reduce risk associated with any WFC specific issues that may or may not arise in the future.  

I definitely wouldn't expect either position to see great growth over the next 3-5 years but I do want some exposure to the space for diversification purposes if nothing else.

stocks,NLY and AGNC - good buying opportunity?,"With the recent massive selloff in mreit sector NLY and AGNC are now both historic lows. Noteworthy though is that both are heavily invested in agency MBS, which are backed by the government and have no credit risk (over 90% of their portfolios). 

This basically means the government will make all payments in the event of a default, and will also buy back these securities at full face value. 

I don't want to say it's impossible for these 2 to go tits up...but these two stocks literally can't go tits up. The risk of default is being priced into these two stocks when there's almost zero default risk, basically. 

What's more, due to the lowered cost of borrowing the business model for both NLY and AGNC have the potential to become even more profitable. This means they are likely to come out of the current recession with increased dividend payouts due to more favorable yields. Interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time which is favorable to the agency business model in general. 

At latest reported book values (which indicates fair market price), both stocks have at least a 100% upside over the next 1-2 years. Assuming they come out of this ok, they will likely net higher profits and significantly increase book value, for as much as 150% upside. This is not even counting the dividend, just the stock price. 

If you can snag these shares in a Roth IRA, you can further increase your profit with tax-free dividend payouts of 20-25% on current share price (though these dividends may be lowered in the short term).

personalfinance,[Q] Use credit card or savings to make a USD $15k purchase?,"edit: Solved, thank you all.

So, I'm looking at potentially purchasing jewelry at this price point. My credit card (BoA, Alaska) has a ~24% interest rate. If I pay that off in 12 months, I think that's around $1,700 in interest alone according to some quick Googling.

It'd be nice to get some credit card points, but for that price? An alternative would be to use savings to purchase the item with ""cash"". What's the smarter choice?

Or - is it wiser to use the credit card, then immediately pay it off using savings - would that work?

worldpolitics,To those who still believe the Trump administration hasn’t completely mishandled the Coronavirus crisis and think COVID-19 is no worse than the flu,"Firstly, there is no doubt that China (CCP) chose to cover up the crisis for their own agenda in the first few weeks (could be more than a month depending on sources). However, that doesn’t excuse the fact that no actual protective measures were put in place by the US government until it’s simply too late. The health impact and economic impact could have been significantly reduced if proper plans were put in place back in January.

There were plenty of information in January about the virus, but hardly any US officials took it seriously at that point, with Trump even publicly downplaying it’s seriousness until recently. Even today, many Americans still believe COVID-19 is no worse than the flu even though there’s clear evidence that the mortality rate is at least 20 times higher. (2-3% compared to less than 0.1%). [How COVID-19 compares to seasonal flu](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid19-flu-influenza/)

It’s not until March that Trump announced federal recommendations to practice physical distancing. In February, his position was that the coronavirus would just “go away” and “disappear” on its own, completely contradicting advice health experts.

When should the US have implemented steps and responses to combat the virus and limit the spread? After any of the below events:

Dec. 31: “Wuhan health officials confirm 27 cases of illness and close a market they think is related to the virus' spread.
China tells the World Health Organization about the cases of an unknown illness.”

Jan. 9: “China announces it has mapped the coronavirus genome.”

Jan. 13: First coronavirus case reported in Thailand, the first known case outside China.

Jan. 15: The patient who becomes the first confirmed U.S. case leaves Wuhan and arrives in the U.S., carrying the coronavirus.

Jan. 20: The first case announced in South Korea.
Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese doctor who is helping to coordinate the coronavirus response, announces the virus can be passed between people.

Jan. 23: Wuhan and three other cities are put on lockdown. Right around this time, approximately 5 million people leave the city without being screened for the illness.

Jan. 24: China extends the lockdown to cover 36 million people and starts to rapidly build a new hospital in Wuhan. From this point, very strict measures continue to be implemented around the country for the rest of the epidemic.

January 30: WHO declared a ""public-health emergency of international concern.""

February 9: The death toll in China surpassed that of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which killed about 774 people globally.

The point I’m making is that even though fingers can be pointed at China for not reporting it sooner. But it’s pretty clear the the Trump administration failed miserably in it’s handling and management of the crisis, and nobody else is to blame for that. The US had ample opportunities to tackle this issue earlier and could have drastically reduced the impact of COVID-19 on its citizens and its economy. It’s through the incompetence of the president and the government in general, that the US finds itself in it’s current predicament.",finance

personalfinance,Need help from EXPERTS on completing last part of finding AGI2018 info,"So because of the “human malware” that is going on around the world, I had to do my mom’s tax return this year online(she usually files it through a local accountant in where she lives) this weekend… I’ve done my through turbotax and it went well so far, just waiting for it to get deposited to my bank lol… But doing my mom’s so far has been nothing but a headache….

She filed her 2018 tax as married jointly, but this year I asked her what to choose and told me to file as single(as my stepdad passed away during 2019)…

So I believe I’ve entered all the necessary info, luncluding my stepdad’s forms that needed for tax filing…  
 

this weekend about an hour after filing, we receive a text message from turbotax that the federal tax got rejected and has to be resolved to continue filing…  
   
 

So the problem was that it got rejected coz the record that irs has did not match the one I entered for my stepdad’s 2018 AGI.. I googled how to find the agi and told me it was line 7 on form 1040 for 2018… I checked their 2018 tax form and entered it what was written on it, and around an hour later it got rejected again...

I got curious why and googled to see if its just a turbotax issue, and to my surprised several people had the same problem… one solution I found was that some people entered 0 and it worked for them… I entered 0 and it got rejected again..

So I went to irs website to create an electronic filling pin, so I can view the irs’ record of my mom’s 2018 tax forms, and this is where the headaches started.... I entered several stuff, including the ssn &amp; last 8 of credit card.. when it got to the mobile phone for verification, the irs website says it could not verify the cell number(which is sprint).. I tried the regular landline and same problem that it could not verify the phone number.. so did try again with the cell and the process got locked out for 24hrs(probably for security reasons).. I redid again this Monday and so far same problems with her cell number could not be verified… 

I called the toll free number 1-800-829-1040 and it was not of any help either as all the options led me to get the info mailed to us in 5-10 days.. I was able to google info on how to find a way to talk to a real person, but it led me to an automated message due to the “human malware”..

So now we are waiting for the mail to arrive from irs to simply find 2018’s tax forms, when we have it physically as well from what my mom filled from last year as well…

I don’t know why the info from the tax form my mom has is not matching up with what irs has… idk if its only an online issue thing or a turbotax thing….

The only thing we need to complete the filling process this year is MY STEPDAD’S 2018 AGI amount…

So can anyone likely give us advice on how to proceed???",finance

I have $22.5k in student loans which are currently at 0% interest, and the first payment will not be due until June. My initial plan was to pay these off as fast as possible, but seeing as they are at such a low interest rate I do not see the point as of right now. After the 0% ends they vary from 3.5-5.5% interest.  

We currently have about $26.5k in 2 different HYSA's. This includes our 6 month e-fund, and the extra that we were planning to put towards student loans, but have decided to hang on to for liquidity at the moment. I have a roth IRA with about $500 that I intend to max out over the course of the year, and starting in May I will also be contributing to a company matched 401k. 

The point of all this information is that even though my first instinct is to save the $1200 each, it would be better for the economy if we spent it. So how could I spend it to have the most positive impact?",finance
personalfinance,"I amended my 2019 return to find I owe money, I cant afford to pay right now. What are my options?","edit: someone reminded me about the stimulus check so I'm good! Thank you to everyone that responded

I go to amend my refund and I come to find I owe 700 dollars.

I don't think thats right first of all since I only make 60k last year and my refund was 2.9k...I did a tax refund calculator estimate for 3.5k

personalfinance,Dumping money into a savings account,"Hi all,

My mom has terminal cancer and isn’t doing so well so I’m helping her out with all end of life planning. I’m a finance noob so would love any advice (so noob that I didn’t know the latest interest rate cuts would affect the savings account rate...)

She currently has all her money in one local bank and wants to open a savings in another bank since she’s worried about the FDIC max coverage. 

Her suggestion was just for me to put it in a savings account - just dump $100k and leave it. I started looking into that. I personally have only used Ally and would probably choose that or something like Marcus. On the other hand, part of me feels like this is a waste, especially with the current markets, to have it be sitting in a low-interest savings account. 

TL;DR: is putting money into a savings account right now the way to go? What would you do with an extra savings of $100k assuming everything’s been paid off? Preferably nothing too risky (but open to hearing all of your ideas) because I’m handling someone else’s money.

Leftover money pays for credit card bills and food 

As of this month I’m moving and consolidating most of my money into fidelity brokerage account with spaxx at the core, and using their cash management account to pay bills and regular general spending if necessary.

I have 3K in a checking account earning 4% APY (up to 3k), I have another 4K in my another checking account earning .2% which Im moving to Fidelity brokerage to earn 1.5% (or I can move it to ally savings to earn 1.5% but I think it makes more sense to be in Fidelity because that’s where my jobs 401k is and I just prefer everything consolidated) The extra $200 in the other brokerage may also be moved to fidelity after I sell the stocks.

My credit card bal: $6000 of which is in a 0% balance transfer card, another 3500 is on a CC with an 21.49% apr (which I feel I may need to transfer but my credit took a big hit for opening a balance transfer card last month so I’m stuck paying interest on that 3500 balance until I figure it out where I can move it or pay it down fast as heck) and the other $1500 bal is split between another 0% card, and others cards whose balance will be paid in full by the end of this week so I will essentially have 3 credit card with a bal, (two of which will have 0% apr and 21.49%, so almost consolidated there)

Student loan interest rate is 5%

My Initial plan was to move most of my money into fidelity and leave the $3k in the 4% account as emergency fund and invest the other 3k in the fidelity brokerage account.....but then I learned about ROTH IRA which I can put the money in but it seems like I would still have to make investment decisions on my own inside the Roth IRA so I don’t know if it makes sense to maximize a Roth IRA vs Just fund a brokerage account im just lost....thoughts anyone?

personalfinance,Loan Consolidation and Refinance make sense?,"I don't know if this is too much, or not enough info to get reasonable advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Combined, my wife and I have three debts:

**Institution #1:** 10k (4.5% Adjustable 10 year HELOC -- 80k line of credit, just dropped from 5.5% 3 weeks ago to 5%, then 1 week ago dropped again to the 4.5%...  We only had this as a mechanism to avoid PMI with our main loan and have paid it down from 80k to 10k in 3 years)  \~$100 monthly payment

**Institution #2:** 396k (4.125% Standard 30 year fixed Mortgage on our *house*, 27 years left)  \~$2100 payment + $900 monthly escrow (taxes &amp; insurance)

**Institution #3:** 133k (4.875% 15 year fixed mortgage on our *land*, 13 years left) \~$800 monthly payment.  This was refinanced to a 15 year 2 years ago to lock in a 'then-low' rate compared to our original rate of 5.85% originated in 2012.

All these debts were for a custom-built one-off house in an established neighborhood, about 3 years ago, that cost us around 800k to build and is probably worth around 650k on the market (give or take 100k). The home has very very small (or negative) utility bills (passivhaus, solar, etc) so our ongoing costs are less.

We only have one car (paid for, used, with cash in 2011) and no student debt (finished paying off last year).  Other than over-spending on the building of our forever home, we live extremely frugally - almost never eat out (&lt;5 times a year), neither of us have any clothes less than 10 years old, DIY basically every single thing, no cable, no streaming services, no cell bills (work pays for mine), lowest speed internet connection, never go to bars, no bottled water, no coffee, no smoking, all movies are from library, no gym memberships (but plenty of team memberships), most gifts are us *doing* something for someone, no garbage collection (only generate about a bag a quarter... which I bring to work), huel for breakfast and lunch, free events in town as entertainment, cut own hair, vegetarian, coupons, etc, etc, etc.  Our life is effectively centered around our home life and our one main expensive vice is 'thowing' lots of parties at our home: \~10 a year with &gt;50 people and another dozen that are &gt;20. (pre-COVID)   **Our total debt load is thus \~540k** (\~$3000 in payments on said debt (+\~900 in escrow payments for taxes/insurance))

&amp;#x200B;

My salary from my main job and my side hustle is around 120k +/- 10k per year; 2018 was an anomaly at around 140k.  My wife does not work; we have 3 young kids - though she plans to return to work in the next year as the youngest head off to school.

Over the last 4ish years we have managed to save some cash money (\~60k in a Capital One savings account and checking) that is earmarked for a second car (kids are getting to the age that a single prius is starting to be a limiting factor for life), yearly IRA max contribution for wife any I, and a deck/porch/workshop thing and the rainy day fund... however, we are flexible if there is a massive reason to use that money otherwise.   We also have 529 that will be worth around 200k when kids are ready for college.  Won't pay for all, but will help them. Also have \~350k in life insurance on myself.

I save 5% of my salary through a matching 401k at work, we always max our IRA contributions.  This effectively results in a \~20% retirement savings rate.  Further, my work provides a retirement pension that upon retirement will equate to about 45% of my salary from retirement date until I die.  I am 39 years old and have been doing this since I was 18... leaving me a \~500k nest egg in my IRA and 401k already.  My wife only started her IRA when we got married 10 year ago and it's worth around 100k.  I only fill this in to point out that I feel somewhat safe on our retirement plan and my priority is gaining more 'now' flexibility with our funds and/or reducing our overall loan cost.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering:

1. Is it typical to merge 3 loans into one if those three are from differing institutions?  If I just contact a refinancing bank, will they handle it all... or will it be a logistical nightmare that I'll struggle to navigate?
2. Does it makes sense for me to do that?  I'm struggling to do the math and all the online calculators don't include consolidation.  Looking at this  [https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/refinance-rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/refinance-rates)  table...  It seems I could get a 30 year fixed on 540k for 3.590% APR... and my total monthly payments would drop from the current \~3k to 2.4k.   This *seems* like a no-brainer to me?  ... but I'm asking if there are gotcha's I've missed.  Just did a look and the bank I have my largest mortage with is offering 3.45% APR.
3. The 3.03 interest rates on the 15 year are enticing, but I'd hate to lose the flexibility by getting into a payment we'd struggle to pay.  Our frugality means there isn't much left to 'cut out' if things start going awry (though I can increase my earnings by \~10k year pretty easily if needed - at the expense of time with family).  Is there a massive reason to push for that vs going with the 30 year and simply paying extra whenever possible in order to pay it off in 15 years?  Calculators show about a 20k difference (total cost of loan) in a 15 year loan at 3.03 (15 year rate) and 3.59% (30 year rate).   If that's all it is, I think I'd be willing to pay that 20k premium to have the additional flexibility.  As I said, we generally are disciplined and frugal, so I think we could aim to pay it off in around 20 years and still meet our 'live life now a little more' goals.

personalfinance,Possible to refinance interest rate on HELOC?,"I opened a home equity line of credit (HELOC) on my home to help pay down some debts.

Given that the feds have lowered the interest rate to banks, would I benefit from this lowered rate? If so, how would I go about it? Do I need to contact the bank and see if the rate can be lowered or is it automatically lowered based on the prime rate?

Hey friends, long time lurker, first time poster. Bottom line- I want to know what I can do better to improve my financial situation in both savings/investing, and maximizing taxes in my favor. My end goal is to have a healthy mix of real estate and stocks to cover my income for retirement (target age 50). I am an Active Duty Air Force Pilot with just under 5 years left on my contract. I intend to separate from the service in Jan 2025 and fly for the airlines. I’m single, 29 Y/O, no kids, and do not intend on being married for another couple years. The last 2 years I have been fortunate to have large tax breaks from deployments, but I am moving into a non-deployable assignment this summer so assume full tax burden. Current Experian credit score of 768. Below is a breakdown of my financial picture and a snapshot of where I sit as of 1 April.

You’ll notice I have no taxable, non-retirement accounts. I’ve been stashing cash the last 2 years to enable me the opportunity to buy real estate if the opportunity arises. My current cash stash is there to allow me to buy a house at my next base without the pressure of needing to sell my current one before moving. Overall, I am pocketing $3-4k/mo after expenses, retirement, and discretionary spending. That money has been going direct to the HYSA. I’ll admit that once I was debt free and pocketing over 50% of my paycheck in cash, I stopped keeping a budget. I want to use this opportunity to turbocharge my investments and maybe retire earlier than intended.

**Paycheck/Taxes:**

Base Pay/Fly Pay: $6828.80

BAS/BAH: $1549.68

Fed Taxes: $924.10 (TX resident so no state tax)

SS/Medicare: $468.77

Take home (excludes TSP, IRA, SGLI): $6,984.61

&amp;#x200B;

**Accounts:**

Checking (includes business checking for rental): $8815.35 (fatter than usual due to being paid yesterday)

Savings (instant transfer for short term fires): $500.49

HYSA (Wealthfront, currently at 0.26% APY): $62.331.68

&amp;#x200B;

**Real Estate (triplex):**

Income: $2240

PITI: $877.30

Management: $190.41

Cash flow after reserves and repairs: \~$400/mo

I’ve owned this property for 13 months now, waiting to see how it affects my 2019 tax bill. Intend to hold long term unless prices balloon and I can 1031 into a larger property.

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement:**

Roth IRA: $84.440.62

Invested with Wealthfront with a 9.5/10 risk score. Fees are 0.25% annually. This account is maxed at $6k/yr.

Roth TSP: $9,323.61

Traditional TSP: $6,474.22

I put in 5% of my base pay into the ROTH, government matches 5% into the traditional. That’s $306.39/mo per account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses:**

House PITI: $1074.48

SGLI ($400k policy): $25

Food/Booze: $300

Phone: $44.79

Utilities: $300/mo avg

Car Insurance: $57.80

Gas: $80

Total: $1882.07

&amp;#x200B;

AMEX Platinum: Free to military. Use for perks, airport lounges, etc.

AMEX Blue Business: Pays for random incurred business expenses that cannot be deducted automatically from my business account. Paid in full every month.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I am thinking moving forward…this is where you tell me I’m off-base and give advice. All my current TSP money is in the L-2050 fund. Today I switched all future contributions to the S&amp;P500 fund due to it performing 3% better annually over the last 5 years versus the L2050 fund, as well as the discount the current market is providing. I am currently putting away about 12% between my ROTH TSP and ROTH IRA. That does not include the employer match. I am thinking about upping my TSP percentage to 17% (currently 5%), which would put my ROTH TSP contribution at just over $1k/mo, in addition to the $500/mo into the ROTH IRA . The employer match would remain at 5%. On top of that, I am considering putting about $1k/mo into VTSAX in a taxable investment account. That would still leave me $1-2k/mo in discretionary spending. As far as housing goes, I am selling my current place and downsizing. After selling my current home and buying another, I should come out about $10k ahead, and that will go into the HYSA for future real estate purchases.

I am open to all critiques, advice, criticism, and wisdom. My folks follow a more Ramsey approach to investing (cash heavy in times like this), but I see opportunity in the next 3-6 months to get ahead for my future. Hope everyone is weathering the storm ok.",finance

investing,Cryptos - is there a compelling argument?,"I’ve had 2 “eureka” moments about cryptos recently.  I sent $100 from one bank to another one overseas – and almost all of it was swallowed up in fees. Then I tried to send $10 to a guy for his IPTV service – and it turned into $16 after Paypal had taken their $6 fees. That’s 60%, geez! I thought I’d seen the light, so I bought my first batch of BTC. But I’m still confused. Its evangelists say it’s “digital gold”, a store of value due to its limited supply, and it will take over the world. But what’s to stop others coming in and creating more, blending all the best bits of those currently on offer? You can’t call it a store of value cos it’s limited and If anyone thinks govts and banks are gonna roll over and die they must be crazy. Not gonna happen! I think cryptos will have to abandon their anti-establishment mindsets and work with them. What’s more the US Fed Reserve is talking about creating its own crypto. So is Facebook. More will follow. If they create open-source cryptos, perhaps also with a maximum supply, they will not only have the establishment on their side but most of the mainstream public too. Can someone explain why BTC has a guaranteed future? I'll be eternally grateful. Thanks!",finance
investing,How to avoid bail ins?,"Seeing that between 2015 and 2019 most of the world has adopted bail in regulations (that is any deposits over the government insured amount are taken by the bank, anything below that gets frozen for undetermined time period), the risk of bail ins seems likely in the current crisis.

Lebanon is already talking about implementing it:  [https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1kwbrjj7pczrz/lebanon-depositor-bailin-39may-be-the-only-way39-to-save-the-banking-sector](https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1kwbrjj7pczrz/lebanon-depositor-bailin-39may-be-the-only-way39-to-save-the-banking-sector) 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this would provoke massive protest from the public, however the virus has created a situation that would make a bail in more easy to implement for governments:

\- Banks are closed, meaning people can't go to their local banks and ask for their money.

\- Withdrawal limits have been implemented in a number of countries, from what I hear Germany and US. In countries like Belgium banks are giving conflicting information if large withdrawals are still possible or not.

\- Protests are impossible, as mass gatherings are illegal and highly dangerous for any participators.

\- Police and military have emergency powers, allowing them to put down any protests (for whatever cause) quickly and by any means (that is lethal force).

\- Media blackout, for national security governments will likely block and punish the spreading of any fake news (that is any information that's not government approved for public consumption, regardless if say news of a bank run is true or not).

\- Cash money could be banned, to avoid the risk of virus spreading. This will keep people from taking out their money from the banks cash. The switch to digital payments will also make it easier for governments to control the fallout of a bail in.

\- Financial support for the masses. For example free money handouts, Thailand has already implemented this, I believe Malaysia is looking into it, the US certainly is. This system would allow governments to increase or decrease the income of its population at will. For a millionaire who just had his money taken by the bank $1000 is laughable, but for most people who would lose little in a bank bail in this would be a very generous income, and would offset any losses they might suffer, reducing the risk for them to riot. What is more, they would not want to risk losing this new source of income if they are caught rioting. Another aid being implement globally is to delay bank loan repayments, for most people getting free money and having their loan payments delayed is a huge boon, and they would even prefer this over bail outs (which would benefit the rich, rather than the tax paying masses).

&amp;#x200B;

As such the virus is creating a perfect storm for a bail in scenario: the banks likely are suffering heavy losses; they are by law allowed to confiscate the deposits from their clients; the public can't do much to protest such a move right now; government actions to limit the virus fallout will make take away the will or need for most people to protest the bail ins.

All in all, only a small number of people would greatly suffer from the bail ins (10% would actually lose money), while most of the middle class would be able to survive having their money frozen for a year, and for at least 50% of people it would be a beneficial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as this is r/investing where most people actually have money they'd rather invest than have it taken or frozen by the banks, how to avoid the bail ins?

\- Brokerage firms seem like the safest bet, since they have no banking license, and thus have to keep their clients' money separate from any liabilities the company might have. For example in 2008 not a single brokerage firm needed a bail out (except one, because the CEO broke the law and gambled with his customers' money). I did see brokers are now offering to spread their clients money over multiple banks, to benefit from interest rates without breaking the government guaranteed amounts, but I imagine this money could get frozen then.

\- Invest the money on the market. I don't know if assets on a bank trading account would also be bailed in, I think it will, since those shares are technically on the books of the bank, and not in the investor's name (contrary to popular belief).

\- Keep it cash in a safety deposit box. However with banks being closed getting to the box might be tricky, and risky when other people see you go in and come out with a big bag with Dollar signs on it.

\- Gold I think is risky because the banks will likely push down the value if people put their money in it, since banks don't like competition, and they've admitted to manipulation gold prices.

\- Crypto's I think are even more risky because it'll be very easy to make these illegal because they pose a danger to national economic security.

\- Cash might be safest, although many countries will likely ban larger bills, certainly Europe will ban the 500 Euro bills. Australia is looking to make large cash transactions illegal starting this year, likely other countries will do the same.",finance

personalfinance,Bank Account to Personal Income Spending Flowchart Crosswalk,"This is a draft crosswalk of what bank, retirement and investment accounts you need to open that follows the “Personal Income Spending Flowchart – United States” https://i.imgur.com/u0ocDRI.png  There is no one size fits all solution to this question, so do what works for you. It’s my attempt to give back and answer some questions about “what accounts should I have” that regularly get asked here. 

This NOT telling people what to do. If you have criticism please respond and I'll edit the content. 

About me. Years ago my finances were a wreck. I had an investment advisor that didn’t listen, money in different accounts, and was still drowning in credit card debt. Then I found this sub and my life changed. I read and listened to the advice here and my finances are in now in order. I do my own taxes, I manage my own investments and I learned the value of emergency funds. It took over four years to me to get this right, and I still come to this sub daily for advice.

Account management: One way to do it 

**Definitions:**
Emergency Fund: liquid assets that you can access immediately to pay bills or buy things.
Retirement: What you plan on having when you are old when you don’t work for a living.
Savings: Goals you are planning to fund with money not from emergency or retirement. 
Investments: Things you own like stock or funds or crypto that you have to sell to get cash.
Emergency funds, savings, investments, and retirement accounts are not the same.

This takes time. Its a marathon not a sprint. 

Step 0 Create Budget and set goals
-Need a good checking account at this stage. Quality bank that won't kill you with fees but go with what you got. Ideally at a bank with good savings account returns, but any will do getting started.
-Watch the ATM fees. Learn to take out a certain amount of cash and budget it.

**Step 1 Build an emergency fund**
*Open a savings account, hopefully with a decent interest rate. 
*Small emergency fund, shoot for one month's expenses
*Do a tax estimate to ensure your withholding is enough for the year. The new tax law makes this your responsibility. Make sure you check this as the year goes on. 

**Step 2 Debt and Retirement**
*If your employer offers a 401k match, contribute to get the match. This is doubling your money.
*If you have high interest debt (over 10%), pay that off.
*Decide on an investment strategy i.e. Booglehead 3 fund portfolio and then look at the funds offered in the account and make your investment choices. Some of the other subs can help with picking funds. 

**Step 3 Increase Emergency fund to 3 to 6 months
*Get three months in that savings account you started in Step 1
*Open a second checking and savings account at a different bank. Yes, do this. How many times do you see people post ""My account is Locked"" or the ""bank took out money” or I got hacked. Having a second set of accounts that you only use for emergency is a defensive measure in today's world. Ideally this is linked to a separate email address that you only use for finance, nothing else.
*In the second checking account put one months rent and utilities. This is the ""oh shit I can't pay the rent"" money. Don't touch it ever. 
*In the second savings account, hopefully high yield, stuff your additional two months of savings.
*Now pay off all remaining debt

**So lets recap at this point. You should have:**
Bank 1
*one checking account for everyday use
*one savings account with 3 months emergency fund
Bank 2
*one checking account with one month rent and utilities that you never touch
*one savings account with two months emergency fund.
401k
*one account from work with the max contribution your company will match
*an investment strategy
Debt
*All debt paid off (some will argue this point. If you feel you have a plan on paying off your debt and want to try and save while still paying bills then we won’t stop you. But we will see you back on this sub in six months trying to get out of more debt)

**Step 4 Retirement, Saving for purchases, Investing and other accounts**
This is where is gets the most complicated. So break it down into several areas.

Start with Saving for Things:
*Learn about time horizons. The time in which you think you'll need this money helps determine where you put it.
*Do you have large expenses coming? If so put that money in the savings account, or if you are willing to take on risk a taxable investment account. However, if this money is for something like a wedding and you don’t want to get married at Arby’s then put it in savings.
*If the time horizon is long you can think about things like Treasury bills or CDs
*The type of account you need will depend on your time horizon. I personally use a taxable account at Vanguard and purchase municipal bond ETFs for the money I using to save up for things. 

Retirement Accounts:
*Do a tax calculation here, again. You need to see if a Roth, traditional or a spousal IRA is going to help you with taxes or not. This comes off your income to create your adjusted gross income and lowers your tax liability. 
*You can also max out your 401k with your employer, but I do that last for two reasons. First, the funds my employer’s plan offers suck and have high expense ratios. Second, by taking advantage of the spousal IRA with 6k I create a secondary savings in case of emergency. (Which I used in 2018 when I ended up moving 3 times in one year from AZ to HI to NV to VA.)
*For Roth and spousal IRA's you are going to need investment accounts
*open 1 joint brokerage account (Vanguard, TDA, etc..) This will be the pivot account. 
    -open 1 Roth or IRA account depending on which option you need.
    -If you can max the spousal IRA then drop the money into the brokerage account monthly. I keep these funds in municipal bond funds or similar. When I do my taxes the next year I check and make sure the spousal IRA is going to save on taxes. (remember the tax estimate from step 1). Once I know it will help, then I move the money to the spousal IRA. If it can’t help you on taxes then you can choose to put it in the IRA or a Roth. Up to you at that point. But take the advantage of the tax savings if you can.
*Now max the employer 401k and further lower your taxes.

Other accounts
*HSA if you qualify (I don’t so I have no idea how to help)
*529 plan for children college savings

Investing
This is actually where everyone wants to go first. 
*Create an investment strategy to fit your goal
*Reserve investing for goals from 3 months to 5 years out, with a blend of stocks and bonds. The closer the time horizon the more bonds. The longer, more stocks. 


**Tl;Dr** Accounts to the Personal Income Flowchart

Bank 1
*one checking account for everyday use
*one savings account with 3 months emergency fund
Bank 2
*one checking account with one month rent and utilities that you never touch
*one savings account with two months emergency fund.
401k
*one account from work with the max contribution your company will match
*an investment strategy
*maxed 401k contribution if possible
Debt
*All debt paid off
Brokerage
*one taxable account
*IRA and/or Roth as required per tax strategy
Other
*HSA and/or 529 as needed
Savings
*Goals you are saving for and the appropriate account for those goals
Investments
*A strategy to invest for goals 3 months to 5 years out with money that is not emergency funds, retirement or a savings goal.",finance
personalfinance,Need to dip into Emergency Fund to Complete Refinance of Home,"Hi all,

Our appraisal came back a bit lower than expected during our refinance. I rate locked at 3.375% compared to our current 4.625% interest rate. In order to get back to a 95% loan-to-value status, I'd have to kick forward ~$11,000. Our mortgage payment would go from $3,050 to $2,700 p&amp;i, taxes, insurance, and pmi all included.

Between my fiance and I, we have ~$35,000, where ~$6,000 of that is currently tied up in a mutual fund.

Our desire was to refi, keep our payments the same, and help pay the house off faster. I was curious if you think I'm being irrational thinking to dip into ~33% of our emergency fund savings in order to get this refi done and help lower our monthly obligations. If I go through with this, I would redirect the extra mortgage payment amounts, plus whatever we can save during this quarantine, back to the emergency fund to plus it back up.

Thanks for any advice!",finance

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday’s open ahead of what’s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.

*****

&gt; * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week’s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month — before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.

*****

&gt; * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening’s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is “on track” with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the “ultimate game changer” in the fight to control the pandemic.

*****

&gt; * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a “very, very painful two weeks,” estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 — nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.

*****

&gt; * Boeing — whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year’s grounding of its 737 Max fleet — is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take “a few years” for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.

personalfinance,Is this the time to get IN to the market? How much?,"Hey PF, long time listener first time caller.

So I am very fortunate but also at a confusing fork in the road. Late last year I found stable, happy, well-paying employment. At the end of February I finished paying the last of my debts, thanks to some extreme miser-level spending.

My plan for the rest of the year, was to have stayed a miser and thrown 80-85% of my income into the stock market. The logic behind this was two-fold: I'm in a stage of my life where it's not socially-shunned upon to live kind of hermitically. I don't know how much my next job is going to pay (unlikely to be better), and so I want to live this stage of my life without regret of how much I stuffed away.

The problem I'm faced with now, is I've read that historically the 1929 great depression + ensuing global instability caused a stock market drop that took until 1954 to recover. I'm afraid that if I stick a bunch of money in the stock market that there is a real risk that it just keeps decreasing in value for 5-10 years before it comes back up. I'm not sure if in 5-10 years I'll be in a place in life where I don't ""care"" that I'm waiting for my investments to recoup their value.

In this case, is it a wiser decision to throw 20-25% of my salary into investments, and just keep the remaining 75%-80% in a lower-risk solution?",finance
personalfinance,I have a question about qualifying for a mortgage,"So I recently landed a job for a postal service (17.19 per hour) with a lot of overtime. I am estimating that I will make about 50k a year before taxes. Along with that, I collect a VA disability check that is $1200 per month (tax free). I do plan on going for the VA home loan, and I heard that lenders calculates VA disability at 1.5x the rate so that should count as $1800 or so.

Heres the thing, in the last two years since I got out of the Army, I didn’t have my shit together and financed a car with a high interest rate (and totaled it 6 months ago with no gap insurance). I was irresponsible with my money and managed to completely ruin my credit since 2018. Recently, I have got my debt under control, and expect it to go up real soon (credit score is about 500). I know that I can afford a house, but didn’t have this high of an income until very recently.  I read somewhere that I must be at the same job for two years in order to count that as income.

Once my credit score goes up another 100 points or so, anyone know any way I would be able to qualify for a mortgage without waiting 2 years at the same job?",finance
personalfinance,Buy or rent and student loans,"Hi, I hope this post is okay. Looking for advice on next steps as everything is crazy right now.

Currently still employed in a high demand area. Extremely low risk of losing my job. Net income is like 3900 a month. About 4k in savings. Mostly in a CD that matures in June but the bank would let me withdraw if needed without penalty due to the virus. 725+ credit score.

Car lease (183 a month) is done in August. I am not buying this car and will probably get another lease. There is a chance I can return the car earlier to get a better deal.

Renting a house (500 a month) with other people. Lease is up at the end of September, but they are thinking of breaking it to buy a house. If I were to rent an apartment it would prob cost about 1400 in my area (this includes utilities). I could buy something, way cheaper monthly, but the issue is money down.

32k in student loans, thankfully all federal, I want to try to attack these as interest ranges from 3.4 to 6%. 2k in credit card debt that I can pay off within 3 paychecks, maybe 2.

What do I do 1st?

personalfinance,Investing for the first time,"Hi all! Apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this post, but looking for some first time investing advice.

I have a Roth IRA and a 403b, so I guess these are stocks that are part of an index fund for a specific year/age of retirement. 

I'm a total beginner and have never invested in stocks before. With the market what it is now, I feel like it would be a good time to ""buy low."" Was looking at stock prices for companies in the vacation industry or retail industry and see they have hit a low point, and ultimately I believe will rise back up in the market. Since I've never bought stocks one off like this though, I have some questions about the best way to go about this:

1) Should I use the money in my Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund/Roth IRA and just buy the stocks through Vanguard and using the money in there?

2) Or would it be better to leave that in whatever it was automatically invested in through Vanguard and just use spending money in my checking account through an app like Robin Hood?

I probably have 5x the amount of money to play with in my Roth IRA than I do in my checking account, so not sure if that changes what would be the better course of action here?
 
Basically, I want to make sure that I'm not about to blow my money for retirement, but also I think one of the pieces of advice I read pretty often is that one of the mistakes millennials make is not investing at a ""young"" age. I'm in a financial place where I'm okay putting this money (realistically, it's not that much) in the market and leaving it there for 5, even 10 years to see returns and then ideally reconsidering then what my next best financial move is.

To reiterate,  I'm not an expert, so unsure if maybe I'm even asking the wrong questions or not looking at this the right way. I'm not trying to make beaucoup bucks, but moreso trying to get my feet wet and start learning by doing. Any help/advice is appreciated!",finance

I know this probably gets asked a thousand times a day, but with this pandemic going on, I'm torn on what to do. I am very fortunate to be receiving a bonus tomorrow of about $3,000 after taxes. I currently have a CC with a balance of $2,000 (all others are paid off). It is my only debt besides my car loan which has a very low interest rate thanks to co-signers. However, my CC interest rate is almost 25%. I currently only have $800 in my savings account. Do you think it would be a good idea to pay off the $2,000 debt with my $3,000 bonus and bank the remaining $1,000 for a total savings of $1,800? Or in light of current events should I just make regular payments on the debt and bank the entire bonus for a total of $3,800?

My company is starting a 2 year offering period for their ESPP on May 1st. The ESPP provides a 15% discount on the price of company stock. The stock price set at the beginning of the offering period, as well as my contribution percentage, are locked in for the entire 2 years.

I have a 3 month emergency fund ($6000 in a HYSA) as well as $700 in my HSA to help cover my deductible should I need it. My gross salary is $4,200/mo and I contribute 10% into a Roth 401k (company match is 100% of my first 6%).

Right now I'm adding $600/mo to my emergency fund, but would like to leave my emergency fund as it is and either invest in the ESPP or aggressively start paying down my debt. Which would you do? Are there other options I should be considering?

personalfinance,Update on that $69k CAD car loan I signed up for,"Here’s the link to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpxmox/is_negative_equity_on_a_car_loan_ever_worth_it/)

We did it guys! My fiancé and I managed to back out of this terrible loan, 5 days after signing. Here’s the full story of how this loan was unwinded if you’re interested:

The day after signing, we went in and told them we’d like to cancel. We expressed our regrets with signing without giving it enough thought. I even told them how debilitating my anxiety can be, which contributed to me succumbing to the high pressure they give customers. They denied the high pressure and said that there was no reason for me to be anxious. I fought that point a little but but ultimately told them it was a mistake and that we’d be so grateful if they could void the contract. The sales manager seemed disappointed but okay to see if he can make that happen for us. He left to talk to his GM and came back 5 min later, saying that he would cancel but cannot because the loan has “gone through” with the bank. Apparently, there was nothing the dealership could do. Bewildered, we gave the bank a call to see if it actually works that way. After a 2-hour hold, we got to a CSR who told us that nothing would have gone through in less than 24 hours and that it is 100% not up to the bank to keep this loan in place. 

We went back to the sales manager and told him this. There was a lot of back and forth (obviously they were lying to us) and the GM came into the picture. The GM was very contradictory, going from saying “we made it clear to you that there’s nothing in my power that can void this contract” to “legally I don’t have to do anything for you.” He also reminded us that he now owns the car that we traded in. He pointed out how great of a car we signed up for, highest trim, sunroof, etc. When we told him that it’s not about the car but about the loan, he tried to convince us that we were doing the math wrong and aren’t looking at the bigger picture (less interest payments). We expressed that we really don’t want it. He gave us a deal: pay him $5k to get your old car back and cancel this loan, or keep the contract but receive incentives such as $2000 rebate, free oil changes for life, etc. We told him we’d think it over and come back tomorrow. We did not take delivery of the new car.

The next day (Saturday), my fiancé went in alone cause I had work. Taking the advice from fellow redditors, we decided to go into offense mode. I had drafted a letter explaining our experience with them to be mailed to various consumer affairs agencies in our region. He went in with that letter. In the middle of the showroom, my fiancé told the GM that we are willing to take the $5k deal to get our car back (this was a bluff, just wanted to see where it would take us). He asked the GM if we could have this deal written on paper so that we can have it looked over by our lawyer and ensure that we will get our car back from this (we never actually had a lawyer). Taken aback, the GM said that he feels bad taking our money like that and went on to encourage us to keep the new car. By this point, my fiancé was getting pissed and raised his voice. He told the GM that in no way is this car deal good for us and that he’d like him to stop trying to shove it down our throats. He told him that a lower interest rate doesn’t mean shit if we’re getting ripped off $20k. He pulled out the letter, told him that we’ll be contacting these agencies and that we will be going forward with a lawyer. He also mentioned that all conversations since the day before have been recorded. The GM chuckled and told him to do whatever he wants (all this was happening in the showroom with many employees watching in silence). The GM kept saying “let me figure something out for you, don’t stress, man” and my fiancé stormed out. Outside the dealership, in plain view of the people inside, he took multiple photos of the new car and of a misleading ad sign they had for “one year of car insurance on us.” The GM ran out to him and said “I didn’t want to say this in front of them but I do want to cancel this for you. Just give me till Monday cause the banks are closed tomorrow. I gotta make some calls and pull some strings. Trust me, I’ll do what I can. Don’t stress”

Fast foward to Tuesday morning. We went into the dealership expecting the GM to make up another reason to keep us locked in. To our pleasant surprise, we were welcomed by their finance director who took us into her office and offered us two options: keep the car contract but with biweekly payments reduced to $371 CAD biweekly (from $389) with a slightly lower interest rate, or cancel the contract but pay $1200 CAD for the new car restocking fee and servicing that had already been done on our old car. We paid them the $1200 and drove off in our old car, taking that as the price to pay for our bad decision. 

It was important for me to write all this out for anyone in the future who finds themselves in this situation. There is hope and if you stand your ground, you have a chance to get out of a bad car deal. I think it helped that we initially acknowledged our responsibility in this instead of putting all the blame on them. This was a big life lesson for us and I’m kind of glad to have gotten that lesson early in life (we are in our early twenties). My parents saw nothing wrong with this car deal. That was a big eye opener for me. Many older adults just aren’t smart with money and I don’t want to be like that. We will soon be looking into refinancing our current car, pay it down and not even think about getting rid of it before we break even!",finance

Banking,Trump - Fed/Treasury combo,"Hi All,

I'm by no means a banker in any fashion, but I'm curious to see what most of you in the banking sector think of what is happening in the US currently, as I understand it, Trump has merged the Fed &amp; Treasury into one organisation, and is effectively in control of them under his latest legislation. 

Now my question is if Trump is now in control of the Fed, does that mean that all requests from all other central banks for credit is effectively now at the discretion of the President? 

I understand he has a desire to return to the gold standard, and this would lead me to think that he has a desire to drop fiat currency.

personalfinance,Should I file estimated tax payments for 2020 or not bother?,"Hey everyone, this is gonna be a long, multi-part question that's partially affected by COVID-19, so bear with me.

Some quick backstory: Last year, I was 100% a freelancer/self-employed. First time filing taxes as such. So a few weeks ago, I hopped on here to ask why I was getting hit with a $1 ""underpayment penalty"" even though I was paying the entirety of my annual dues well ahead of April 15th. Turns out, I was expected to pay quarterly. The $1 fine wasn't bad, though, and inadvertently spared me from having to pay the Feds every quarter.
  
So, question time:
  
1) I see the normal due date for first quarter estimated tax submissions is April 15th (I'll address the COVID date below). Assuming I want to be on time even during the pandemic, how would I avoid giving the Feds too much money? For reference, I only made a paltry $4250 this first quarter of 2020. Since I don't have any business expenses, I assume that's the grand total of it all. How do I factor in a standard deduction on quarterly estimates/arrive at the right payment number for this quarter with that number?

2) My income fluctuates wildly. For example, now that we're in the second quarter, I have pending invoices out that'll total up to $6630 if people pay within the next few weeks. And who knows how much more I'll make over the course of the rest of the second quarter, for estimated tax purposes. How do I estimate payments if income is this unpredictable? (I'm not a seasonal fisher or something, just a writer, so I don't think I can go *that* route)? How do I calculate this quarter's and plan for next's?
  
3) How do my four estimated tax payments get accounted for at the end-of-the-year tax filing? Do I really just go here: https://www.irs.gov/payments , choose ""Pay your taxes now/Bank Account (Direct Pay)"" (is that where estimated payments go?) and pray that the IRS will recognize my payments on April 15 2021 and not mistake them for random donations? Do I have to include a worksheet or something?
  
4) Given that I paid the entirety of my yearly taxes for 2019 way before April 15th of this year and got a $1 slap on the wrist, is it worth doing quarterly? Or can I keep skirting the quarterly rule and paying a tiny fine during my end-of-the-year filing? My tax bracket/income is almost definitely going to stay below $30K by year's end, as far as self-employment goes. Are there any serious risks to not doing quarterly?
  
5) Is it worth doing quarterly if I might get a standard W2 job later in the year? How would a W2 job complicate things if I've already submitted one or two quarters' worth of estimated payments?
  
6) Due to this COVID nonsense, I see the due date has been pushed to July. Is that just for annual filers, or for first quarter 2021 estimated payments as well? If the latter, how would that work? Would freelancers just pay quarter 1 and 2 at the same time, since July 15th is past the due date for quarter 2 estimated payments? This seems terribly confusing. How does this affect me?
  
If anyone's willing to take a crack at some, or all, of these questions, I'd be super appreciative. I just want to stay on top of my tax situation so I'm not surprised by anything like I was a few weeks ago when paying my 2019 taxes.",finance

I have approximately $145k in the 403(b) from my last job with a $7,700 outstanding on a loan against (with no call, the payment is $135/mo, 4.35%, and matures in another 5 years). Breakdown of Asset allocation is 6% guaranteed (at 4% interest for the next year with base of 3%, which is the collateral for the loan), 61% CREF Stock R3 (QCSTIX with expense 0.3%), and 33% CREF Bond R3 (QCBMIX at 0.27% expense).

I recently inherited a small non-spousal IRA ~$5,600, have around $3,000 in cryptocurrency that I'd like to probably move into something more traditional and less volatile, $500 in a couple of single stocks, and the upcoming stimulus check ($3,400).

My current employer's 401(k) sucks pretty bad. 25% match of up to 6% and match only pays out yearly. But, I do have Roth and Traditional 401(k) available to me, and have the 6% currently heading to my Roth 401(k). My effective tax rate is 8% federal, and no state.

Other debts include:

* $25k student loans at 3.5% ($360/mo)
* $18.5k car loan at 2.75% ($330/mo) [approximately 100% LTV currently]
* $230/mo car lease ending in December (currently saving to reach $8000 pay cash for replacement in Dec)
* $340k mortgage at 3.625% ($1900/mo)

My main questions boil down to, then, I guess, is do I:

* Do I cash out the inherited IRA?
* Do I pay off the 403(b) loan so as to rollover the 403(b) to Vanguard (or other broker) as a Traditional IRA?
* Do I leave the 403(b) alone, and put the money into Roth IRAs for last year?

personalfinance,Question on our Credit Card debt options - TIA,"Hello personal finance guru’s! Question for you on dealing with debt!

\-Backstory: We paid off our student loans and were just about debt free when we had a string of bad luck, and unfortunately, in our excitement to pay off student loans, we didn’t have any savings to rely on. Yes, dumb decision! Anyway, I had a severe concussion that restricted my work for a year, my father-in-law passed away and we took care of the funeral and all expenses, and the company my husband worked at had massive layoffs and he was out of work for 6 weeks. So, by the time we look up we’re in credit card debt, and can’t quickly get out of it. We’ve been making minimums and debt avalanching, but now with Covid, we’re concerned we won’t be able to make our minimums and are wondering how best to proceed!

\-Facts:  We have 40K in CC debt with Wells Fargo and BOA and a little PayPal, with interest rates between 7-24% (thankfully the 24% are also the smallest loans!)

We’re paying $1600/mo in minimums, and can usually afford another $500 towards principle - but we’re super unsure with Covid if we’ll continue to be able to do that

\-Options we’re looking at: Deferment (we’ve already applied for BOA deferment, but for Wells Fargo and PayPal we have to call in, and hold times are over an hour - working on it!)

Debt Consolidation: At this point we have about a 600 credit rating, $5000 in savings, and, while our income is $130K combined, out debt is $40K - Wells Fargo denied us for a loan, and I’m not sure of other reputable companies we could go with.

Debt Management Program or Debt Settlement Program: I’ve called into [Credit.Org](https://Credit.Org) and National Debt Relief, but I’ve read on how these programs work and I’m a little concerned! Any reputable companies/resources you would suggest for this? Experience in Debt Management/Settlement? I know you can also settle by yourself, has anyone tried this? 

And then the other option would be to continue paying, of course!

personalfinance,Mortgage Hardship options (Be Careful),"There needs to be a little more education on all these mortgage options going around. 

I think a lot of people are going to face a lot of issues at the end of those 90 days when they realize the only option they have is to pay pay those 90 day payments in full. 

And it looks like most banks are defaulting to this option (not just on federally backed loans) to pay everything back in full at he end of 90 days, if people can’t afford a new payment plan or modification.

Edit update: call your lender most people don’t even know their loans are federally backed. 

Or go to Fannie and/ or Freddie website to find out

Edit #2: The most sensible option would be to tag on the missed payments to the end of the loan. But many won’t have that option!",finance
personalfinance,I'm looking for Advice on what to do for my Finances!,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I’m looking to attempt to make my financial situation a bit more easy to handle, and I’ve put together my amounts to see where i’m entirely at. I’ve thought about getting a Balance Transfer to put some of my credit card totals onto 1 payment/location instead of 2-3. It wouldn’t really save me money I don’t believe, but would be nice to not have so many different accounts all over the place. I’m also looking into Savings Accounts, or where I should put any money that I actually do save? Any help would be great, and am mainly looking into what any better options could be? I’m also interested investing into things, but with where the world is right now, i’m not sure about how that could even go.  Thanks for any help/advice anyone can give!

With all of my totals together it’s around 1250-1300$ a month because my electricity total changes with usage, but with my job I make about $450-500 per weekly check, so about 1800-2000$ a month. A good portion of times I can make money on the side and in other things I do, but I won’t calculate that in because it’s non a consistent  thing.

investing,Short term Covid Recession or long term corporate-debt Depression?,"TLDR apologies, I might've been trapped inside for too long but...

I keep hearing on most media and among us retailers that the state of the wider economy will be bad for now but that the economy is much stronger than 2008 and the previous recession and we should get a quicker V shaped recovery. I'm confused by this narrative...

Global debt has nearly risen two-fold, it is now 85% higher in 2019 than 2008, as we have tried to pump up deflating economies. Inflation has stagnated, asset prices have ballooned way above wages and real-wage growth has reversed and has now been declining since 2015. At the same time we've seen incredible stock market growth, some 120% on the S&amp;P in the decade 2010-20, in my limited understanding in part due to attempted inflationary monetary policy like QE etc.

That lending increase since 2008 ,on the back of very low interest rates and next to no inflation, means it's very easy for large caps in particular to leverage to the sky. So the 2008 mortgage backed debt default warning seems to me to have gone largely ignored. Many companies of all sizes look ripe for bankruptcy due to pretty tenuous balance sheets after lots of spending on buybacks, lack of investment in growth and lack of protection against demand or supply shocks (like this one right now).

Ray Dalio (big fan) has been pointing out for years we are due a massive correction as part of a long running debt cycle and we should see a crisis the like of the great depression, drawing many parallels with the 1920-30's global geopolitical atmosphere and today. I would highly encourage delving into one of his longer interviews or one of his books on the crises (below) where he explains the historical and macro economic precedent and the reasoning he uses.

2018 interview explaining economic theory of the idea in which he predicts a lot of the corporate debt issues that are slowly coming out right now: [https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec](https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec)

link to his free open source book on the possible crisis: [https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf](https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf)

The Covid affects might be comparatively limited but the wider economic indicators are not so bullish and IMHO are not being talked about anywhere near as much as they should. I can't help but feel we're not headed for a 30-40% two quarter recession but that cyclical depression which could reset some of the global economic foundations and concurrently cause much greater market pain than many of us are thinking which will last not 6 months to 2 years but far far longer. The Dow took 29 years to reach it's previous high after the great depression (5100 points, 1929-58).

Thanks for the long read, please poke holes/ proffer solutions in the economic theory of the thing. I await any thoughts with much curiosity if you made it this far...",finance

personalfinance,Need help: Student loans &amp; car loans,"Current loans:
6.5k - Unsubsidized student loan at 5% apr
4.5k - Subsidized student loan at 0% apr for now, 5% 6 months after graduation
12k - auto loan at 4.1%

What I am planning to do / wondering is a good idea:

Get 11k more in subsidized student loans that won’t accrue interest for another 2 years (until I graduate + 6 months) and use it to pay off my unsubsidized student loan, as well as use the remaining 4.5k to pay off part of my auto loan. This is so I don’t have nearly as much interest adding up for the next couple of years.

I am pursuing a degree that will most likely have me at least 60k per year after graduation; so I most likely will be able to pay off the subsidized loan very fast- I have no problem keeping my expenses the same after graduation until I’ve paid off all my debt.

The only concern I have is that the interest rate of the subsidized loan after graduation is 5%, whereas the auto loan is 4.1% (plus the possibility to refinance it). However, I am currently guaranteed to pay 4.1% on 12k for 2 years, whereas if I take on the subsidized student loans instead, I’ll be able to pay off that same debt (4.5k of it) in the form of a student loan within a few months, ultimately accruing far less interest overall.

energy,"A conservative's opinion on California's ""renewable"" push","""Renewable"" is a code word for ""Produced in California"". It is CA's leftist version of Trump's rightist trade war.

California has much less fossil energy resources per capita than Montana and Wyoming. In a free market, CA consumers buy cheap energy from WY/MT via Western Interconnect grid, so cash flow out of CA into WY/MT.

In order to reverse the trade deficit, California employs renewable and carbon restrictions to exclude WY and MT coal electricity from competing, CA consumers now have to pay more.

WY and MT also have renewable, but the scale and profitability cannot be compared to CA, because CA has way more desert land that lack another use.

The same goes for CA's special formula gasoline. It's a scheme to favor CA refineries against refineries along Gulf of Mexico, esp. Houston. CA has #1 expensive gasoline in the union. It's not for the air. Every other state including NY,MA,NJ use federal formula and the air quality is not inferior to CA.

WY and MT need to fight back by favoring open source software, local IT services, local production of dairy and vegetables, and calling all people to block ads.

stocks,I think the bottom has already occurred,"I've seen a lot of post about how the bottom is yet to arrive. I think the bottom was Monday, March 23rd. The unemployment numbers and waiver of 401k withdrawal penalties don't scare the big-time market movers. They are scared by uncertainty and the inability to predict what will happen.

The uncertainty for them was the length of the Coronavirus and how Western nations policies of quarantining were going to affect the number of cases which predicts how long the economy will be shut down for. We could not implement policies like China and South Korea did by monitoring people's GPS data and credit card purchase history to track where and who they might have affected. And China's ability to essentially lock their citizens at home and bring them food and supplies without there being an outcry.

Italy was the benchmark. If Italy could essentially weather the storm with their quarantine policies, then just about every other major western nation would be able to do the same. Italy is still obviously bad, but the percentage increase in cases per day have come down and should eventually be negative soon. The market saw that trending down by the middle of last week and the U.S passed the CARES ACT which helped. We also forget the massive influx of cash the federal reserve has injected to help the markets.

personalfinance,29y/o feeling late to the party. Hoping to get things on track soon.,"Hello Personal Finance peeps!

I have recently been wanting to get more serious about my finances and do some planning/investing. I already feel like I'm a bit late getting started with this and would like to get things lined up asap.

I'm 29 years old, soon to be 30. I am fortunate enough to be debt free. I generally keep ~$5k in my checking account, after big expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, insurance have been paid. I have questions regarding a number of different areas currently relevant to me.

**Savings Account**

My account currently has ~$50k in it. This feels wrong. Safe to assume I need to take some money out of here and do some investing with it?

**401(k)**

This past year, I got hired on to a new job that offered 401k benefits; a first for me. I am putting in 4%, which is the max full match my company gives. I believe it is with Vanguard. Everything is in the default fund when I signed up; something like a Lifestyle/Pre-Mix/Target Retirement 2055...Should I re-allocate my investments for this? I recall someone suggesting that I should dump all of it into a large cap market like s&amp;p500. Is there some merit to that?

**EE Bonds**

I have a slew of Series EE bonds from the 90's that are currently valued at ~$15,500 as of 04/2020. The oldest ones are about to reach their final maturity date in May. The bonds issued from 1990-1994 all have a 4.0% interest rate. The remaining bonds ranging from 1995-1998 have interest rates between 1.48 - 1.57%. Hoping to get some advice on what to do with these.

**HSA**

Started an HSA through my employer's at the beginning of this year. It is with Bank of America. At the moment, I am only contributing $1000/year and my employer contributes $500 which is the max. I don't believe I've set up investments on it yet. 


Thus far, all my investing is via employer programs. I have no personal investing funds and am rather lacking with knowledge/best practices within this topic.  Should an IRA/Roth IRA be my first thing to look into? Should I start delving into something like Robinhood or Etrade and building a portfolio of individual company stocks?

I currently have a house but am buying a new one, closing is set for May. I will receive about $44,000 from selling my current house.

My salary is 75k a year. Between my bank accounts, I have about $40000. So between existing funds and the house, I'll have about $84000 to work with.

New house is $257000, no closing costs, so I just need to bring the down payment. 

I have a student loan which has 29k remaining with 3 years left. Interest rate for that is 4.950, interest rate in the mortgage will be fixed at 3.375. 

I am trying to figure out how much to put down on the house and what to do with the loan, while still having money left. Given COVID-19, I want to have at least a full 6 months or close to it left as an emergency fund. I expect the mortgage to be around 1390; that with other anticipated expenses **not including** the loan will put me at around 3300. Take home pay is about 4300/month.

Currently, I owe 815 a month on the loan. My initial plan was to payoff the loan in full and put 10% down on the mortgage. That would allow me to pay up front one time PMI premium of around 2200 and be done with it. However, now I am debating putting 20% down to avoid PMI completely, reilfinancing the loan (potentially dropping 9k or so on it first before doing so to lower the interest and monthly payment) and then just keeping the loan for now with the intention of paying it off within a year or two. The reason for thinking this is that the mortgage will last a lot longer than the loan so I'd prefer a lower mortgage payment. Student loans would also be easier to defer if I lost my job than a mortgage payment would.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this. I'd love to he rid of the loan, but ultimately feel I'd be better off in the long run by putting more onto the mortgage. Any feedback is appreciated, though.",finance

personalfinance,Why do they owe so much in federal tax ?,"Hello guys,   
 

I’d like your input when it comes to filing taxes for my parents. I have always filed taxes for my parents and they have always gotten a refund (filed married and jointly always) using turboTax. I went to file the Taxes this year and it says that they owe about $2.7K in Federal Taxes. How is that possible? I’m assuming the issue is my dad’s part time job but I could be wrong. 

My mom has always had 2 jobs. One full time and one part time.   
 On the full time one she made 17,694 in wages. Then she paid 8.03 in federal tax, 269 in medicare, and 1.150 in social security.

On the part time one she made 8544.84 in wages, paid 0.60 in federal tax, 123 in medicare, and 529 in social security.   
 

I think the issue is my dad’s part time job. He works for a company that owns 2 restaurants in 2 different locations. In one of the restaurants he is a full time employee, at the other one he is part time. At the part time one, he goes there always on Sundays for like 4-5 hours. Sometimes they tell him to go from the full time restaurant, to the part time one on the weekdays also to do some work there (maybe 2-3 hours). Both these restaurants are owned by the same company (owners). They only gave him one W-2 and my dad told me that he gets paid direct deposit by his full time job and the direct deposit includes the extra money he makes from the part time one. The only w-2 he got shows that he made 24,294 in wages. Then he paid $0 in federal tax, 352 in medicare, and 1,506 in social security.   
 I suspect the dad’s part time job is making them owe money because he started that this year, and this is the first year that both of them owe fed. Tax money. Can anybody explain to me why they owe so much in federal tax ? If additional information is needed, I can provide it.

I bought a car a little used.  It's a little over 30k.  Obviously all the issues of a car loan.  But I pay about 70 to 100 over what's owed every month.  640 a month.

My credit was destroyed from a prior relationship.  So, yes I know this isn't great.  But I needed the loan and I needed the car.  I have no credit card debt or student loans.  

What I'm asking is:

Do I save up (already have 3k) and pay off lump sum 401k loan (and save 250 a month to pay towards car) or just throw whatever extra money I have towards the car loan?  I'm at least 9 to 10 years from retirement from my profession.  But I'm still very young so I'll still be working no matter what because that's how I am.  Thanks for any advice.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

CryptoCurrency,Paul Le Roux,"Paul Le Roux is a fascinating character, whose story entails drugs, gold, arms dealing, North Koreans, Iranians, elite-level encryption, Somali pirates, women...and more women.

Let's get into it...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1/5 - The Early Years**

Paul Le Roux was born on Christmas Eve, 1972, in Bulawayo, the second-largest city in what was then called—by the white minority that governed it, at least— Rhodesia.

In 1980, Robert Mugabe became prime minister of what would now be called Zimbabwe, ending minority white rule in the country.

Four years later, when Le Roux was 12, the family relocated to South Africa.

Not long after the move, in exchange for washing his father’s car, Le Roux was given his first computer. After that, a relation of Le Roux states that he became ""completely anti-social.”

When Le Roux was 15 or 16, in the late 1980s, the local police raided the family home and arrested Paul for selling pornography. After that, Le Roux turned even more inward.

Although he was an excellent student, he despised the idea of learning Afrikaans, which was compulsory in South African schools, describing it as ""a dead language"" that he ""didn't want to learn.""

At 16, he dropped out of high school and decided to follow his interest in computers, taking a local programming course.

Family lore has it that after he spent one class explaining some technical fact to the teacher, he got a letter saying he no longer needed to attend. He then completed a year’s worth of material in eight weeks!

Accounts of Le Roux do indicate that he was exceptionally gifted, and people who worked with him described him as a genius.

After returning from a family holiday to Disneyland in the US, 17-year-old Le Roux decided to leave South Africa, and departed for the UK eight months later to work as a programmer.

He then moved from the UK to the US, where he lived in Virginia Beach.

After six months in the US, he followed his then-girlfriend Michelle to Australia in 1995. The couple married and Le Roux acquired Australian citizenship.

Le Roux frequented message boards and enjoyed trolling Australians. A typical post read:

""All of Australia could disappear into the Pacific and the only difference it would make to the World is the Americans would have one less pussy country to protect.""

His posts caused outrage on the board - someone even changed their handle to fuck @ you.paul

Le Roux would later declare that his correspondents had fallen for his ploy:

""Australians are east to provoke and your postings (including 2 death threats, numerous flames, and one guy who swears he has my address &amp; phone number) have provided me with hours of amusement.""

Of course, Le Roux did more than just troll Australian message boards in this period...

Le Roux had started building E4M - Encryption for the Masses - in 1997, releasing it at the end of 1998.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2/5 - The Turning Point**

E4M allowed users to encrypt entire hard drives, and to conceal the existence of encrypted files (such that prying eyes wouldn't even know they were there).

According to Le Roux, the software was written from scratch, with thousands of hours going into its development and testing.

As well as this, in the [Politics section of the E4M website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010408201122/http://e4m.net/pol.html), Le Roux published a sort of Manifesto, describing how ""governments are increasingly relying on electronic data gathering"" and how ""Strong Encryption is the mechanism with which to combat these intrusions, preserve your rights, and guarantee your freedoms into the information age and beyond.""

In the spirit of the open-source software movement in the late 90s, Le Roux released E4M for free and made the code available for other people to improve.

Therefore, with no income from his two years of labor, he was struggling financially. His marriage fell apart violently and the couple got divorced in 1999.

Le Roux first relocated to Hong Kong, then to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He married a Dutch citizen named Lilian, and they had a child shortly after.

In 2000, in order to monetize E4M, Le Roux launched [SW Professionals](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405063022/http://e4m.net/) in 2000.

Based in South Africa, the company offered offshore programming, including E4M customization.

One of Le Roux's clients was an Italian telecoms engineer called Wilfried Hafner, who had corresponded with Le Roux for several years about E4M.

Hafner had founded a company to create a commercial encryption product that would combine some of the elements of E4M with another piece of software, Scramdisk. The new company would be called SecurStar, and its product would be called DriveCrypt.

Hafner hired Le Roux to build DriveCrypt's underlying engine.

At the time, Le Roux was desperate for money - he drove a beat up car and worked out of a Rotterdam apartment small enough that, on the phone, Hafner could often hear a baby crying in the background.

Hafner on the other hand was living in the South of France, and Le Roux openly coveted the kind of success that he imagined led to such a home. He told Hafner: ""I am ambitious, I want to have all this.""

However, in the middle of the development work for DriveCrypt, Hafner discovered that Le Roux was still working on E4M and had incorporated some of his work for SecurStar into his personal project. As a result, Hafner terminated Le Roux's contract.

By October 2002, SW Professionals was now defunct and Le Roux was openly soliciting for work on the alt.security.scramdisk forum.

It was around this time that Le Roux received some news that ""shattered his whole world.""

In 2002, he travelled to Zimbabwe to retrieve a copy of his birth certificate.

On the trip, his aunt and uncle pulled him aside to tell him the truth, and it was then that Le Roux found out he was adopted.

Although many family members had known for years, Le Roux’s parents had elected to keep him in the dark about it.

It was the ""unknown"" part that hurt him the most.

Shortly after, Le Roux appeared on an another set of message boards - he seemed to be launching some kind of moneymaking scheme that required opening a company based in the U.S.

In 2004, a group of anonymous developers did exactly what Hafner had feared: they released a new and powerful, free file-encryption program, called TrueCrypt, built on the code for E4M.

TrueCrypt combined security and convenience, giving users the ability to strongly encrypt files or entire disk drives while continuing to work with those files as they would a regular file on their computer.

Hafner and his SecurStar colleagues suspected that Le Roux was part of the TrueCrypt collective but couldn't prove it.

As we'll explore in Part 5, TrueCrypt is an interesting part of this story...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3/5 - Money and Power**

After Le Roux's departure from the encryption world, at least under his own name, he entered the Internet-pharmacy business.

What Le Roux did next was combine two of America's favourite past times, popping pills and online shopping, and the results were sensational. He turned over around $300MM in 4 years.

In 2007, Le Roux moved his family to Manila, where he would base his operations. He also had call centres in Israel. This was a brilliant move by Le Roux, as the authorities were not looking at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as hot-spots for a large-scale organised crime operation...

Le Roux was moving serious volume during this time - his operation was once one of FedEx's largest customers.

A relative of Le Roux pointed to 2008 or 2009 as the point at which Le Roux snapped.

""I think the money got to him. I personally saw $100 million in his office in Makati. Cash, bud. It was fucking ridiculous. It was in wicker baskets lined up on the side of the wall in his office.""

Le Roux's appetite only grew, and not just in the literal sense (he was known as the ""Fat Man"" in the Philippines): he wanted to be a different kind of businessman, a lord of the real underworld, not just the virtual one.

An Israeli associate of Le Roux tells how ""Le Roux wanted to make more money, fast. Le Roux wanted to diversify, to be bigger. The only way to do that was illegal. He was living inside a movie, you could almost say.""

As well as this, Le Roux was notorious for his sexual exploits - he once wrote to his cousin, ""15-20 a week, sometimes 3 per night.""

A former call centre employee tells how Le Roux approached him with an assignment, which at first he thought was collecting women for Le Roux to open a bar. However, that was not the reason, as Le Roux explained:

""I'm going to impregnate them, and build an army of kids.""

Le Roux asked him to make a spreadsheet to track the women: their names, dress size, age, medical checkups. The operation was given top priority by Le Roux, who even sent his emissary to China to try to find women there.

It is rumoured that Le Roux has *at least* 11 children to 7 different women!

Le Roux's businesses expanded into logging, precious metals mining, gold smuggling, land deals, cocaine shipping, and arms dealing. These activities were spread across dozens of shell companies registered all over the world.

Of course, he needed to launder the money. Le Roux used paid muscle in Hong Kong to swap cash for gold bars, and then proceeded to stash the gold in warehouses in Hong Kong (this totalled around $50MM).

Speaking of paid muscle, Le Roux had plenty: ex-soldiers and mercenaries made sure any problems were dealt with force if necessary.

Le Roux was closest to ex-British soldier Dave Smith, who would act as the leader of the mercenaries and allow Le Roux to insulate himself and not have to deal with people. In fact, Le Roux once told Smith ""I live vicariously through you.""

However, things took a turn for the worse, at least from Dave Smith's perspective, as Smith stole $5MM worth of Gold from Le Roux.

Le Roux was furious. He then summoned Smith to his place in the country, and asked him to dig a hole as they needed to stash some gold. However, when he arrived, he was greeted by a South African hit-man. After the hit-man had finished shooting Smith, Le Roux then grabbed the gun and fired into Smith's corpse.

Le Roux then set about building an arms base in Somalia.

To achieve this, Le Roux called upon an ex-soldier from Europe, code-named 'Jack' to work for him on the ground in Somalia.

At sea, Jack had to bribe Somali pirates.

It was actually *this* activity in Somalia that landed Le Roux on the radar of the DEA, as he popped up in a UN Report on security in Somalia.

The DEA were now on his tail. Of course, his encryption skills came in handy - Le Roux's thick layers of encryption meant that the DEA needed someone on the inside...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4/5 - ""Well played gentlemen, well played""**

Le Roux was getting more and more paranoid about people in his organisation stealing from him. Without justification, he suspected that his self proclaimed 'Golden Boy' Jack was stealing from him - so he ordered a hit on Jack.

This was a huge mistake on Le Roux's part, as Jack then called a CIA hotline and went on the run. It was 18 months later that a DEA investigating Le Roux found Jack's message to the CIA. The DEA agent then called Jack. Scared for his life, Jack agreed to turn informant.

In the meantime, Le Roux then had a change of heart and apologised to Jack for ordering the hit on him. The DEA then asked Le Roux to go back to work for Le Roux - they now had someone on the inside.

To tempt Le Roux, the DEA devised a sting operation. They knew that Le Roux wanted novelty and excitement. So they fabricated the scenario that Jack had made contact with a high profile Colombian trafficker, and the Colombians wanted to bypass the Mexicans for their meth supply in the US.

Le Roux was hooked. However, the DEA needed to lure Le Roux out of Manila, as his network of corrupt officials would ensure he will never be arrested.

Jack needed to get Le Roux to Liberia (where the DEA had a trusted ally in Fombah Sirleaf, Head of Liberia's National Security Agency).

Jack achieved this by saying that they needed to meet a cartel representative to finalise the deal.

It worked, and Le Roux was arrested. Initially, Le Roux went into passive resistance - he was a big unit (hence the nickname ""Fat Man"") - and it took around 10 agents to get him on the plane to fly back to the US.

Well he settled on the plane, the first thing Le Roux said to the DEA agents was: ""Well played gentlemen, well played.""

He then said: ""If you're looking at me, then clearly you're looking at bigger things...""

The DEA agents were intrigued: ""No Paul, you're the prize - what could possibly be bigger than you?""

Le Roux responded: ""Nation states gentlemen, nation states.""

He then started to spew out extremely valuable information on North Korea and Iran.

Of course, this wasn't the only leverage Le Roux had...

The enforcers who were once on Le Roux's payroll needed to be held accountable for their numerous murders, and the DEA were desperate to get them behind bars. Le Roux was key in their eventual capture. But that's not all: a crucial piece to this story is Part 5...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 5/5 - TrueCrypt**

As we discussed previously, Le Roux was rumoured to be a member of the TrueCrypt collective.

In November 2012, a man with the online handle Cincinnatus decided to throw a party in Hawaii. The idea arose out of an email exchange with Runa Sandvik, a developer and expert on the online software Tor, which allows its users to mask the physical location of their computers on the Internet.

After she gave a Tor tutorial on Reddit, Cincinnatus sent Sandvik an encrypted message. Cincinnatus told Sandvik that he lived in Hawaii. Sandvik mentioned that she would be there on vacation the following month and could give a talk on Tor.

Cincinnatus suggested they host a “cryptoparty,” a phenomenon that had arisen around that time among technology- and privacy-conscious activists. The date was set for December 11.

Unbeknownst to Sandvik, her fellow party planner was hatching a much more elaborate education scheme. Four days after he contacted Sandvik, Cincinnatus sent an email to the journalist Glenn Greenwald. “The security of people’s communications is very important to me,” he wrote. In a series of emails, he suggested that Greenwald set up an encrypted means by which sources could contact him.

Cincinnatus organized the cryptoparty at a hacker space called HiCapacity, located in the back of a furniture store in Honolulu.

When Sandvik arrived around 6 p.m., Cincinnatus introduced himself as Ed and told her that he worked at the computer-hardware company Dell.

Ed kicked off the evening by welcoming the attendees, then invited Sandvik to give her presentation on Tor. When she was finished, Ed pulled out his laptop, plugged it into the projector, and began his own instructional talk about TrueCrypt. In Ed’s presentation, Sandvik later wrote, he “pointed out that while the only known name associated with TrueCrypt is someone in the Czech Republic, TrueCrypt is one of the best open-source solutions available.”

Six months later, in June 2013, Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras published the first of a series of articles that grew out of their contact with Cincinnatus.

In time they revealed that *his full name was Edward Snowden*, that he had worked in various capacities at the National Security Agency, and that he had downloaded and handed over a trove of documents from the NSA in an effort to blow the whistle on what he believed were egregious privacy encroachments by the U.S. government.

**Among them was a document revealing that TrueCrypt was one of a small number of encryption programs that had withstood the NSA’s efforts to crack it.**

**What Snowden and the rest of the world wouldn’t know for another two years was that Paul Le Roux, the man whose code formed the foundation of True Crypt, was at that very moment in the custody of the U.S. government. Le Roux was in a bind, facing the full force of a U.S. federal prosecution for any number of his extraordinary array of crimes. The only way out was to spill his secrets...**

investing,Fed balance sheet increases to record $5.86 trillion,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased to a record $5.86 trillion this week and the central bank reported greater use of some of its newly launched liquidity facilities, all part of its efforts to keep markets functioning smoothly amid heightened volatility related to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the three weeks since the Fed’s effort to limit the economic damage from the outbreak kicked into overdrive, the central bank’s balance sheet has mushroomed by roughly $1.5 trillion. It is now the equivalent of a quarter or more of the size of the U.S. economy before the crisis struck, and will certainly grow larger in the weeks ahead as the Fed keeps piling on assets and the economy likely shrinks.

The central bank continued to snap up Treasury securities, mortgage bonds and other assets, according to data released on Thursday. The Fed’s holdings of mortgage-backed securities increased to $1.46 trillion from $1.38 trillion. Treasury holdings rose to $3.34 trillion from $2.98 trillion.

Use of the Fed’s central bank liquidity swap lines, which allow foreign central banks to exchange their local currency for dollars, rose to $348.5 billion Wednesday from $206.1 billion the previous week.

Loan balances for the Fed’s discount window, its last resort lending program, dropped slightly to $43.7 billion on Wednesday from $50.8 billion a week ago.

Loans with the Fed’s primary dealer credit facility rose to $33.1 billion Wednesday from $27.7 billion the previous week. Use of the money market mutual fund liquidity facility increased to $52.7 billion from $30.6 billion the week before.

personalfinance,Belgium: Refinancing my loan. Would like some input on what is the best option.,"Hi guys,  


I asked my bank to refinance my loan and i would like some input on what the best option would be to take.  


I still have 18 years to go to pay my loan. 

  
At the moment i pay 747.67€ per month (3.202% interest on my loan now)  
And i would get refinanced in 3 years time for the first time cause i have a variable (15/5/5?)interest rate what makes my lone refinance itself each other 5 years to come now.

  
I called my bank to send me options to refinance it now and this is what i got:  


 [https://imgur.com/a/5Qv3dK1](https://imgur.com/a/5Qv3dK1)   


The cost would be a fixed 1220€ now to get any of these done.  


I would think its the best for me to take the variable revised yearly  +3%/-3% cause it would allmost get me 100€ of each month + it can go down to 580€ if rates keep dropping.  


I would love to get some input of you guys cause i really don't know anything about finance :/

worldpolitics,EU is the problem.,"Shocking accusation, and what kind of paranoid conspiracy theory will I invent to strawman this hogwash? None, I will only compare EU to America and what America could have been:

America is a federation of states, a federal republic that each state sends a member of congress to, each state is different, some are rich, some have a small population, but a representative from Wyoming isn't lesser than a representative from California, merely a representative from California will be drawn from a larger legal talent pool, the better a person is at law has the advantage in a rule of law system, not the person from the most glorious state.

This is the basis for America, if you want a law you have to build it, show it will not only work but mesh well with the constitutional principles the entire Union of States signed on for, if it doesn't then perhaps a state can apply it domestically but the federation won't impose it on all, if it does conform to federal guidelines it shouldn't bother any of the states to apply it, because that's precisely what they agreed to, and they benefit greatly from the Union as much as they may deny it.

The Civil War was about states that wanted to be free of the British but didn't want to just trade one ruler for another, they wanted independence and self-determination in of themselves, terms of the Union be damned, but it was mostly because a bunch of states were little more than a continuation of British and European aristocracy that came to the new world to do the same crap the new America was trying to escape from, slavery, oppression, frustratingly expensive tea, etc. etc. So big plantation states with a brutalized slave workforce supporting pampered proper dandies in their obscene privilege were willing to send idiots who didn't know any better to fight for the status quo rather than finally break the shackles of European feudalism, those idiots and their dandy benefactors lost and have been crying about it ever since, oh what a world, what a cruel and vicious world is that which tolerates the freedom of common hordes, oh deary me.

And frankly Europe hasn't changed much since then, Britain has but Europe, not so much, Britain became a constitutional monarchy, which is little more than ceremonial these days because its primary houses of law are a parliament seated by representatives, of the law, of the public, seeking decent law where possible, or it was that way until the EU botched things. I don't mean the nations of the EU, they aren't supposed to know, most of them never had a decent system so wouldn't recognize one if it slapped them in the face, that's like expecting Trump to know anything about anything, highly unlikely, you need experts to stand a chance at sorting stuff out and in this sense there hasn't been a decent mind sharing insight into how a system should function for decades, people have forgotten how the civil establishment works.

First rule of law is you need a geopolitical balance of power, if that doesn't exist then even the best system possible will be dysfunctional, so to catalyze that balance of power the U.N chartered terms of world peace, Independent Sovereignty, the domestic self-determination of nations. Okay, now we are getting super boring, but what does it all mean, Basil? It ultimately means each country is allowed to govern itself, no other nation is entitled to shape their laws, at least not directly, indirectly however we can apply Diplomatic Trade Relations as a bargaining chip to encourage nations away from authoritarian methods and towards rule of law methods, but ultimately that is still so they can shape their own law, just more effectively.

How does EU break this? Well, they say anyone can leave the EU, but can they? Really? Look at UK, they are trying to leave, what a forsaken mess that is, anyone even considering bowing out of EU only need to look at that shemozzle and realize, nah, they don't have a choice, they have to stay, even if they hadn't committed their currency to the Euro, nor had UK and yet dang son, if you believe the media it's worse than having teeth pulled in a Mumbai back alley. So they can't leave, what are their other options? Obey or take a leadership role, and to do the latter they need a system willing to do what America does for its states, measure validity by legal skills, not by power, wealth nor population.

So why is EU the problem? Because they aren't a Federation, they aren't a republic like America, they are mostly Unitary states still independent from each other and yet obey a proxy, and unofficial supranational economic union, a singular authority which has control over numerous U.N seats on the council, why does EU get 19-27 votes while America gets 1? There are 50 American states, why don't they get 50? Because America does the right thing, it doesn't exploit loopholes in that arrangement.",finance

I'm in the process of re-financing to get a 0.375% reduction in interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

My current lender is Freedom Mortgage.  They've been in the news in the last few days as they may be facing a liquidity shortfall.

How should I think about:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Going through with the re-finance (in process, locked at 3.25% for 30-yr, with less than zero in out-of-pocket costs), versus

\-Staying with Freedom, and holding on to the miniscule possibility that they continue to struggle through missed payments and deferments, AND they don't get any kind of bailout to survive, AND they go into bankruptcy, AND no other institution (private or federal) decides they want to take over their book of business, and therefore my mortgage balance gets massively reduced or even canceled.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is an incredibly remote possibility, but we're in unprecedented times.  If there's even a 0.01% chance that my mortgage debt could vanish, should I hold onto it rather than chase down a 0.375% reduction in rate?  Is the scenario I describe even a remote possibility?",finance

The suspension is active from March 13th to September 30th.

The Education department will be sending out letters to employers no later than April 9th ordering the garnishments to stop. Any garnishments that occur between March 13th to Sep 30th will be refunded to the individual directly by the dept of Education. 

Many employers, especially smaller ones, are probably unaware of this. The employer **does not need to wait for the official letter in the mail to begin the suspension**. They can being the suspension immediately. 

From the press release:

&gt; The Department must rely on employers to make the change to borrowers' paychecks, so it will monitor employers' compliance with the request to stop wage garnishment. Borrowers whose wages continue to be garnished after March 13 should contact their employers' human resources department.

From a [BloombergTax article on the suspension](https://news.bloombergtax.com/payroll/detailing-fine-points-of-student-loan-garnishment-suspension):

&gt; The Education Department, generally through its federal student loan servicers, must issue a notice to those for whom a federally-held student-loan wage garnishment has been automatically and temporarily suspended. The notice is to be sent within 15 days of the CARES Act’s March 27 enactment, under the measure’s Section 3513(g). 

&gt; The notice is not required for the suspension to take place. Rather, it is an additional requirement that advises of and helps to facilitate the wage garnishment’s temporary suspension, according to the CARES Act’s Section 3513(g) provision. It also is to include the option to continue with a wage garnishment.

Without the notice, employers will have to do a little more work on their own to verify that your garnishment is attached to a federally held student loan, and not a privately held one. But this is a pretty straight forward task, as they should have access to the original garnishment order from when it started. Most employers should be willing to work with you and put in that effort.

I should note that the suspension is optional. Depending on your situation and how much you would benefit from a temporary suspension of your wage garnishment, it may or may not make sense to accept the suspension. Either way, you should contact your HR department.",finance

Fiance knows basically nothing about the status of the loans so I pulled the free Trans Union report, but I don't know what anything means.

There are 11 student loans:

* 5 from Dept. of Ed/Nelnet: The remarks on these are ""Acct. closed due to transfer; transferred to another office"". Balance is 0 and it's closed.
* 5 from Fedloan Servicing: The remarks on these are ""Student loan perm assign govt; transferred to another office"". Balance is 0 and it's closed.

There are also 2 entries for collection agencies. One is marked paid in full ($350), the other is marked In Collection ($110). One of the problems is that I don't know how much is actually owed; the balances on all of the loans except Navient are 0, and the amounts in Collection are too small to be the student loans.

investing,What is the actual downside to the Fed's recent policy actions?,"So I understand that generally monetary policy has historically been more hawkish than dovish, and this has been unprecedented levels of quantitative easing by the Fed and raising their balance sheets. Buying tons of commercial paper, corporate bonds, etc. in most scenarios would probably greatly contribute to inflation of the USD since it is essentially printing tons of money.

What am I trying to figure out however, is what is the real downside to this in our current financial situation? It seems many other central banks across the globe are following similar monetary policy actions to prevent liquidity crunches, and as long as they continue to do so the USD should not really devalue much in relation to them. Add to that how it is already a safe haven in times of financial crisis, and this also should help to offset any devaluation. In addition, we have had historically low inflation for many years now as well, so will this really lead to problematic levels of inflation?

I currently have a 2014 car that I bought a little over a year ago and was dumb at got it at an absurd interest rate, 10%, I know this was very dumb on my part and wasn't thinking and learned the hard way. I currently owe 22k on the car and the car is value at around 15k if I were to trade it in.

I have been shopping around for different places to refinance and have been preapproved for rates between 5.5% - 6.3%, because the car is a 2014 almost everywhere is only offering those kinds of rate for car 2014 and older. My credit score is currently 700.

Because of everything going on in the market a lot of car dealerships are offering insane price cuts and financing deals on many different models. For example, many GM companies are offering 0% on new models for 72 months with 90 days of no payment.

The current term left on my car is 63 months.

I was wondering which option would make more financial sense:

* Refinancing my car at 5.5%-6.3% interest rate and most likely having to extend my loan to 72 months.

or

* Look for a new car &lt;$25,000 (assuming I get approved for &lt;3% interest, trade my car in for $15k leaving $7k left on my current loan, so the total loan for the new car would be $32k not including taxes and fees. Another thing to consider is the car will come with a bumper to bumper warranty so I wouldn't have to worry about any possible mechanical issues that I would with my current car as it is almost 7 years old.

or

* Look for a 2018 or newer used car for under $20,000, my bank is offering rates as low as 1.7% for cars 2018 or newer.

This might be really dumb and the choice is probably obvious but I'm not too sure which one would make the most financial sense for me.

EDIT:  

Other information that might be important:

$460 a month for the current car, I make around $2800 a month(but I will be graduating with my Bachelor's in May and have job opportunities lined up that will almost double my pay), have no other debts besides student loans but I do not need to pay them for another year as payments are deferred.

investing,The $260 Trillion disaster no one is looking at.,"Thanks to u/alexandros_christ for posting some good stuff at:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fu6dyj/560\_billion\_of\_investmentgrade\_corporate\_bonds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fu6dyj/560_billion_of_investmentgrade_corporate_bonds/)

I made some comments over there, but it made me want to put all the thoughts I've been having into one post. My background. Not much. I have a BA in Economics (which does not in the least bit qualify me to talk about all of this), have traded off and on since \~2007, manage all of my own retirement account (wow...so smart), and can generally understand numbers and complex things if given enough time to study them.

Every person in r/investing has been giving their 2 cents on the market lately, so I'll chime in with mine. Here are a list of issues I see developing over the next 12-18 months. They all go back to what is essentially a $260 Trillion dollar industry. That's the estimate of worldwide debt as of last quarter. We could have smashed through that number already, who knows. What I'm seeing in these following issues amounts to a ton of defaults and a freezing up of the thing that essentially makes the wheels of the global economy go around. If this pandemic and lockdown keep going, the price of the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are going to be irrelevant.

1. The Fed is back in the MBS game. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB) They have recently been piling into mortgage backed securities lately. They got up to a high of close to $1.1 trillion during the GFC in 2010. They upped it to about $1.5 trillion in 2015 and were just starting to unwind some of that over the last few years. However, within the last 2-3 weeks they have piled up over $100 Billion in MBS to stabilize that industry. With all of the other issues I'll mention later, you will quickly see how this whole thing could unravel and the Fed will reach an ATH in MBS holdings in order to try to stabilize everything.
2. The Fed as a whole has been extremely busy. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) I don't really even need to write anything here. Just look at that graph. It's terrifying.
3. Unemployment. We are basically 2 weeks into the numbers being reported, and they are absolutely awful. There's no telling when this will end, but with global leaders like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, this could be going on for a long time. The longer this goes, the more dreadful the numbers will become. Unemployment peaked at around 10% during the last crash, and if this goes on for another 2-3 months, we are going to absolutely demolish that number and get into the ball park of the 25% record during the great depression. This ties back into #1, there are going to be so many mortgage defaults and late/missed rental payments (which, in turn, also causes defaults from larger investors).
4. Check that link I posted at the top talking about corporate bonds being downgraded. In the simplest terms, when a bond is downgraded, it means it has a higher risk of default. A ton of players in the credit industry are limited to type of ratings on bonds they can hold. I honestly think this may be the domino that sets everything off. If a business can't produce/sell/operate, they can't pay off their loans. We were already at debt levels higher than we were in 2008 before COVID happened, this lockdown is just exacerbating an already pre-existing condition that was probably going to cause a mini-meltdown all on its own. If this lockdown stage goes on until mid-summer, I fully expect there to be at least one bankruptcy on the same level as Lehman Brothers, if not multiple.

I could go on FOR DAYS on this. There are so many underlying, systemic issues that this crisis is going to bring to the forefront. One thing that I'm terrified/interested to see unfold is the fate of the USD over the next little while. The Fed has basically gone through their entire playbook from the GFC. Target rates are already 0%, and they are going to blast through any amount of expansive policy that they ever engaged in 10 years ago. On top of an ever increasing ""supply"" of USD, there is a market that is going to see a dramatic drop in ""demand"" of USD....oil. If you don't know anything about the petrodollar, pop some popcorn, and fall down a youtube wormhole and feel the dread sink in. I feel like OPEC is gonna get their crap straightened out, and the price of oil is going to stabilize, but there are so many industries that are shut down right now that guzzle a ton of oil. On top of that, about 50% of the world is on a lockdown, and consuming a fraction of the oil they normally would. A decrease in demand for the dollar, combined with a dramatic increase in the supply of the dollar and an ongoing recession is a recipe for a nightmare I can't even fathom. Thankfully the USD is basically what the global economy relies on, so I don't think any government, no matter how malicious they may be, will allow it to collapse.

I want to finish this all of by saying that I ABSOLUTELY hope I'm wrong on every single one of those things. I 100% hope, pray, wish that a cure/vaccine/treatment were discovered yesterday. I've heard stories of how dreadful this disease is, and it makes me deeply sad to know that millions of people are going to have to deal with it before all is said and done.

TL;DR - The credit market is WAY more important than the equity market and much larger. Spend less time looking at the price of the S&amp;P 500 and look at the asset sheet of the Fed, bond yields, foreclosure amounts, etc.

Bonus. This is what my big ""gamble"" is right now. I've been rolling a bit of money into SLV (a ""paper"" silver fund). Just look at the price of silver in the early 80s. It was insane, and we are entering into some of the same monetary territory that we had back then. (Someone has made a great comment as to why the price spiked back then. Good read. It also reached around $47 in 2011 during the GFC)

investing,Bloomberg Article on 23rd of October 2019 about CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligation. Does this rings any bells from 2008?,"Here’s the link: 

(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/risky-loans-in-the-clo-market-could-be-trouble-for-u-s-companies)

Text:


The collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, is one of those funky creations of Wall Street wizardry that have been around for decades. Just like its close cousin, the much-castigated collateralized debt obligation, it’s a tool used to package a bunch of high-risk debt together—mortgage bonds for CDOs, corporate loans for CLOs—so they can be easily sold to investors hungry for juicy returns.

Unlike the CDO, the CLO made it through the financial crisis largely unscathed and has boomed in the decade since. Fueled by the unprecedented $3.5 trillion wave of private equity buyout deals during the past decade, and rock-bottom U.S. interest rates that only stoked investors’ willingness to gamble on riskier assets, the CLO market has more than doubled since 2010, to $660 billion. By providing abundant cheap funding to the less creditworthy end of the market, it’s helped grease the wheels of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. 

But as odds of a recession in 2020 grow, ratings downgrades could cause a stampede of selling by CLOs, potentially cutting off scores of companies from additional credit, preventing them from refinancing their debt, and threatening their survival. Almost 40% of issuers of junk-debt (which includes leveraged loans) are now rated B3 and lower, according to Moody’s, a record high..“If there’s no price support for lower-rated loans, that will be reflected over time in new issue and refinancing markets, which may mean the lowest-quality borrowers lose access to capital markets,” says Andrew Curtis, the head of Z Capital Group‘s credit arm, which manages CLOs and other funds. Volatility in the market could spill over into the high-yield bond market and even send ripples into the broader economy that could deepen or prolong any recession.

The heart of the problem is the very same phenomenon that fueled the growth in the market in the first place: those ultralow rates. A CLO begins with what Wall Street calls a leveraged loan—basically, a loan that piles more debt on a company’s balance sheet than most traditional lenders would tolerate. A few hundred of the loans can be packaged together into a CLO. The CLO then offers investors bonds with different levels of yield and risk, backed by the loans.

What makes it all work is investors hungry for yield in a world where interest rates have been at historic lows for 10 years and trillions of dollars of debt with negative yields. Now, the same low rates that have fueled the market are creating problems for it. The reach for yield has allowed private equity barons to load debt on the companies they acquire to boost returns on their buyouts. Corporate borrowers have loaded up on debt too. That’s left CLO managers with little choice but to buy riskier loans.

An alarming number of leveraged loans—29% by some estimates—are rated B- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or B3 by Moody’s Investors Service. For both ratings companies, that’s just one rung above CCC, the very lowest tier before default. Most CLOs are contractually limited to keeping no more than 7.5% of their money in debt rated CCC or lower. So, should the economy slump, as a growing number of analysts fear, and more leveraged loans are downgraded, the CLO managers will be in a bind: either unload that debt, and fast, or risk tripping ratings triggers that prevent them from making some payments to their investors.

CLOs own about 54% of all leveraged loans outstanding. With so much debt at the cusp of the triple-C danger zone, CLOs have already started avoiding lower-rated debt and—in the case of such companies as LED lightbulb maker Lumileds, inkjet recycler Clover, and video production company Deluxe Entertainment—selling loans that appear to be headed into triple-C purgatory. “There is no natural place for B3-rated loans when they begin to struggle,” says TCW Group Inc. Managing Director Drew Sweeney. “If a company is downgraded from B3 to CCC, you do see the market immediately react because CLO managers want to sell.”

Lee Shaiman, executive director of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, an industry trade group, isn’t concerned. “We do not see liquidity pressures emerging from CLOs,” he says. “They are not forced sellers of CCC loans. If CLOs choose to sell CCC assets, there is a large pool of willing buyers.”

Who are those buyers? It’s a short list. Money managers without the same constraints—such as leveraged loan mutual funds—might swoop in. But investors have withdrawn money from those funds for 47 of the last 48 weeks, largely eliminating what had been a reliable source of demand for corporate loans.


Even fund managers with cash to invest in distressed loans have been increasingly reluctant to step in, because an increasing share of corporate borrowers don’t disclose their financial performance publicly. In other words, when existing lenders catch wind of financial trouble at a leveraged loan issuer and move to sell the debt, the only potential buyers who can look under the hood to assess the condition of the company are their counterparts who already hold the debt. And they, of course, aren’t interested in buying more. “It’s like going online, trying to buy a car without being able to see if there’s rust in the undercarriage,” says Stephen Ketchum, chief investment officer of Sound Point Capital, an asset manager that sells CLOs.

The situation’s only getting worse as downgrades by S&amp;P outpace upgrades by the most since 2009. And the ratio for Moody’s isn’t far behind. Companies rated near or in the triple-C zone have $508 billion coming due in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc. shows just how quickly liquidity in the leveraged loan market can evaporate. A postproduction media services company for the film industry, Deluxe has struggled with a changing digital media landscape in Hollywood and an increasingly burdensome debt load. But with tens of billions pouring into the leveraged loan market and a CLO machine cranking out deal after deal, Deluxe and its owner, Ronald Perelman’s MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, had little trouble in recent years raising new debt to keep the company afloat.

Deluxe refinanced its debt in 2014, getting enough demand from investors that it was able to upsize its loan by $35 million, to $605 million, and cut its interest rate by a full percentage point. Two years later, the company returned to the market for an additional $75 million, and it tacked on $200 million more in 2017 to refinance some of its other debt.

But as Deluxe’s problems mounted, its cash thinned. After an unsuccessful effort to sell its creative services unit, it turned to its existing lenders, who agreed to back a $73 million loan in July. That’s when it got ugly. The news of the abandoned sale and new debt caused the value of Deluxe’s loan—with $768 million still outstanding—to plunge from 89¢ on the dollar to less than 40¢ in some 24 hours. Within about a week, S&amp;P downgraded its rating by three notches, to CCC-. The downgrade blocked some existing CLO lenders, bound by the 7.5% limit, from fronting additional cash. On Oct. 3, the company filed for Chapter 11. The existing loan now trades at less than 10¢ on the dollar. Deluxe said in a statement that “We appreciate the support we have received from our lenders throughout this process and look forward to completing the refinancing shortly.”

The world’s financial watchdogs are taking notice. The Financial Stability Board, set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis, is investigating. In an October letter to G-20 central bankers and finance ministers, it singled out CLOs and leveraged loans as an area for concern. The market’s heightened complexity and opacity, it said, make it “difficult to assess potential spillovers and risks.” —With Adam Tempkin",finance
personalfinance,Prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to college,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

I'm making this post today because I'm currently a senior in high school whose having a difficult time picking a college due to financial reasons. Here is some key information about my situation:

* I come from a pretty low income family (only my dad works and he makes around \~40k a year)
* I will have to pay for all of my net costs for college through private and federal loans
* I want to major in business, specifically Marketing, and my dream is to work in the fashion industry
* I think? I want to eventually go back to school for my MBA

I currently have three options for schools: School A is my cheapest option (in-state school), and my net cost is around $10,000 a year. School B is my most expensive option at $37,000 a year. I have not received my financial aid package from School C yet, but I predict my costs will be about $30,000 a year.

At first glance, the answer seems obvious: School A. However, I was rejected from business and only accepted for general studies. It's notoriously difficult to transfer into the major you want, especially business. In order to be a competitive applicant, I'd have to get a near perfect GPA, be involved in 3 organizations, hold a leadership position, and take on an internship during a break, all while also doing my work study. As much as I'd like to believe that anything is possible with hard work, I can't help but think that I'm going to fail. I don't even know what else I'd want to do if I didn't get in. School A also has basically no relation to fashion, so I feel like I'd be giving up on my dream. I think if I went here, I would just be absolutely miserable.

On the other hand, School B accepted me directly into their business school (a top ten 10 business school). I was also admitted to their honors college, as well as receiving benefits as a scholarship recipient. I've visited and loved the business program, and they even have an apparel merchandising minor I'd love to take. Additionally, even if fashion doesn't work out for me, I think a degree from this school would provide the best job prospects in other industries. However, even with a scholarship, I'm looking at almost $150,000 in loans by the time I'd graduate. All my friends have told me that School B seems like the best option, but I feel like they don't understand what the burden of such debt truly entails.

Lastly, School C is probably my dream school. It's located in New York City, so I think that it would give me the best chance at making it in the fashion industry. They have a ton of organizations that sound really interesting to me, so I could see myself getting really involved and growing my passion. I'm also not a huge fan of big school culture (like tailgates, games, rushing, etc.), so I think School C would be ideal. However, job security seems less stable as its such a specialized school, and living expenses would be extremely high. After graduation, I'd probably be around $120,000 in debt.

I'm going to call School B's financial aid office soon to see if they can offer me more aid, but I'm not counting on it. I'm also trying to find outside scholarships, but I don't know how much that is going to help either. I'm just completely devastated right now, and I feel like I'm stuck in a trap. Everyday I've been thinking of everything I regret. I should've applied for Questbridge, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I should've applied to more safeties, but I thought School A would take me for sure. I should've applied to private universities that give good aid, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I wish I could redo my senior year. I think I know that the best thing to do would be going to School A, but I just can't bring myself to accept it.

If anyone has read this far, thank you for listening, and any advice would be greatly appreciated because I am so lost.",finance

I recently switched banks, away from a physical one(ScotiaBank) to an online bank(Tangerine)

I got a chequing account setup at the new bank but was looking to setup two savings accounts as well. One regular savings account, and one Guaranteed Investment account.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want one regular savings account, which they offer two options for. [One is just a regular account.](https://www.tangerine.ca/en/products/saving/savings-accounts/savings-account/) The other is a [Tax Free Savings account](https://www.tangerine.ca/en/products/saving/savings-accounts/tax-free-savings-account).

Am I missing something between the two accounts, or is the tax-free just better? They both seem to offer the same interest rate, no monthly fees, but one is tax-free while the other is not?

personalfinance,2nd Thoughts for buying in Chicago Housing Market,"Hey all.  My home is already under contract and on track to sell by the end of this month.  It was my first, and I'm proud to sell it at a huge gain after years of hard work.  I'm also excited to be moving back to Chicagoland, though the timing of the pandemic has thrown a wrench in our plans.

Originally, my family was going to stay with my in-laws while we looked for a property in Chicagoland, but out of concern of my in-law's health and the pandemic's affect on us moving across the country, we've decided to get an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere for a month to see if things settle down.  I'm looking into the Chicago housing market, and learned it's been relatively stagnant for over a decade averaging 2% growth.

With such a low growth rate, is owning a home in Chicago worth it?  I'll be walking away with quite a bit of capital from selling my current house and am wondering if there's something better to invest in.  Please feel free to point out what I'm not considering.  It's worth noting that Illinois has the 2nd highest property tax rate in the nation.

Before learning of the low growth rate for home value in Chicago, I had some naive hopes of how the pandemic would play out.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Home values would hold through the appraisal process on selling my current home.
2. Home values would decline before we chose a new place to purchase. (giving us more bang for our buck)
3. Interest rates would be stupid low when we locked in a new mortgage.

The whole selling process also taught me that we should be looking for homes around 30k lower than our budget in the same neighborhoods we were already looking at.  A fresh coat of paint and a couple of grand on repairs is enough to mark the house up by quite a lot.  We would probably look for another fixer-upper.  How does that bode with a stagnant housing market?",finance
personalfinance,"Should I pay off my student loans, start saving, or invest?","In light of the impending global recession due to COVID-19, I'm wondering what the best financial move for me would be.

I'm 23 and I've been financially independent of my parents since 18, so their contribution is negligible. I graduated college at the end of 2017 and worked a few part-time jobs for about a year. I was able to get a full-time job in 2019 and now I make $60k/year. Thankfully, I was not laid off due to the coronavirus and have been able to work remotely.

Currently, I don't have a savings because:

1. I wasn't able to save much when I was working PT (I only made \~$1.2k/month).
2. Having had a parent with a gambling addiction, the idea of debt has always stressed me out. So when I got my FT job, I put any extra money towards my student loans (will go into detail below). I don't spend much on myself.
3. I'm pretty young and healthy, so saving up hasn't been much of a priority for me.

With the pandemic going on, I'm wondering if I should be putting this extra money into savings instead of my student loans. Being broke is probably much worse than being in debt at this point. Btw, I have no credit card debt, just student debt.

Here is a breakdown of my student debt:

I came out of college with $16.8k of student debt ($13.8k from Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan and $3k from Federal Perkins Loan). The interest rates are about 4% for the Stafford loan and 5% for the Perkins loan. I have remaining balances of $11.8k and $2.6k for each, respectively. Since government-funded student loans are so forgiving, I've just been making the minimum payments on these. Although I'm not in a rush to pay them off, I would prefer to do so ASAP just for my peace of mind.

In addition to my federal student loans, I took out a private $20k loan with an 11% interest rate in 2018 to attend a coding bootcamp. After getting a job as a developer, I started putting all of my extra income into paying off this loan. The remaining balance is now $4.9k. Also, none of my loans have early payoff penalties.

No matter what, I plan to pay off the private loan entirely in the next 3 months due to the high interest rate. After that, the rest of my federal student loans will take less than a year to pay off if I choose to prioritize that over saving and investing.

Tbh, I don't know much about investing. For the first time in my life, I'm in the financial position to even consider it, so it's just a totally foreign concept for me. When I talked to my bf about all of this, he said something about putting my money into mutual funds. What other types of investments should I consider? Is it a good time to buy stocks? If so, I would definitely start doing my research.",finance

Despite my father telling me over and over that he'll pay for what loans we had to take out, I'm treating them as my responsibility as well. I have about 45k, 3.8 average interest rate, currently throwing $100 at them a month. Is there any information on whether or not going abroad for graduate school puts federal loans into forbearance or a state of non-payment? Additionally, is there a ""maximum"" time period to pay off certain student loans? I vaguely remember one of my loans having an ""expected final payment"" date as being at least 6 years ahead of the ""payment deadline"" or something. i sadly don't have the loan statement in front of me, but yeah. 

Totally unrelated, but in the midst of jobs in multiple fields telling me they're on a hiring freeze until COVID19 ends, is putting money into stronger foreign currencies like the Euro or Swiss Franc a bad decision at this point?

personalfinance,Trying to snowball my credit card debt - do you guys recommend any particular personal loan/consolidation services with low rates or should I stick to 0%APR cards?,"For the past year I've been actively paying against my credit card debt. I'm embarrassed to say I had it up to $30k at one point (long story - combo of immaturity, lack of budgeting skills and quite honestly a depressive period where I felt defeated) but I've wisened up, learned a lot, and am on a written budget now. I've brought it down to $18.5k at this point with no frivolous spending, but it's been tough and I have had the Murphys Law setbacks, e.g. I switched to a cheaper car insurance policy but didn't realize it had to be paid in full for the entire year in cash, so suddenly my $80/mo insurance budget was an $850 bill. 😂 Then I had someone throw a rock through my living room window and had to shell out $350 for repairs... But that's life right? 

Anyway, the ""0% APR balance transfer"" cards I had transferred my two highest balances to will be ending in a few months. (they are typically 18 months.) once the promo ends the APR is ridiculously high, ranging from 24—30%.

I was considering opening more promotional zero APR balance transfer lines of credit, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate the remaining balances onto a personal loan/debt consolidation service. I think mentally this might help me (having payments spread across multiple cards makes it *feel* like I'm making less of a dent each month than if I could just apply bulk sums to a single balance) but there are also fees involved with the initial transfers. 

My credit score is around 760 iirc (I just had it pulled while refinancing my home for a lower rate and I was surprised how much it had gone up) if that helps at all, I wasn't sure if a debt consolidation service would be ideal in this case or if I would qualify for a lower rate loan through something like a federal credit union?

stocks,The real reason why Warren Buffett sold off a portion of his airline stocks,"I’ve seen a lot of posts wondering why Warren would sell Delta and Southwest when they are objectively undervalued. The reason is simple:

After the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government took control over the banks so that a situation like that would ideally never happen again. These “federal” shareholders do not care about profits rather they care about stability. That’s why a lot of people have stayed away from owning banks this past decade because they are essentially a federally distributed commodity. For instance, every year they go through a “stress test”, where every major bank’s balance sheet is put through various economic situations from slightly severe to extremely severe recession input variables. This causes the banks to need to have an insane amount of capital just on hand for a rainy day, instead of in the past, returning that strength of capital back to its shareholders.

(And before you bring up Warren owning banks this past decade, it’s because the banking business model is still objectively a very lucrative business and Warren knows their fat dividends are extremely safe.)

The same will now be the case for the airlines. If you remember a few weeks ago, there were many articles of airlines refusing the bailout money if it meant the federal government would now own equity. That’s because, as mentioned before, federal shareholders don’t care about profits. Therefore, these airline stocks will have no incentive to be a lucrative investment rather be a stable utility for citizens.

That’s why Warren sold, he knows the next decade or so will just be these airlines focusing on rebuilding their balance sheets and not focused on giving money to shareholders.

# **The stimulus boost has passed and now the stock market is focused solely on virus developments  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/the-stimulus-boost-has-passed-and-now-the-stock-market-is-focused-solely-on-virus-developments.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market enters a four-day week that is the lull before earnings season, but it’s the headlines on developments around the spread of the coronavirus that may result in the most volatility.
*****
&gt; Strategists say investors are now most focused on how the virus is progressing, what medical developments might help, and how long it could take to end the shutdown of most of the U.S. 
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a wait and see with a drift to the downside. I think if you look back to that three-, four-day rally we had in March, capping off the end of the month, I think a lot of that was reaction to the Fed, a lot of it was reaction to the stimulus out of Washington,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “There were good vibes coming off of that, but that was yesterday’s news. I think the Fed has done a good job. They have peoples’ confidence...One thing we now need is a decline in the number of virus cases in the U.S.”
*****
&gt; Oil could be a factor in the week ahead as OPEC and Russia hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss production cuts. Oil rallied 12% in the past week with West Texas Intermediate futures at $28.34 per barrel, its best week ever.  President Donald Trump sparked the rally when he said he spoke to Saudi Arabia and Russia and they wanted a deal to cut production. 
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were lower for the third week in four, as the market absorbed the latest shocking reports of layoffs, and investors worried about the duration of the virus related shutdowns. The S&amp;P 500 closed down 2% for the week, at 2,488.
*****
&gt; # Jobs picture
&gt; On Sunday, Trump extended the guidelines on social distancing to April 30, as the number of cases grew.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s report of 6.6 million new unemployment claims for the week ended March 28 brought the two week total of workers filing claims to 10 million. The biggest data report in the week ahead could again be that jobless claims number on Thursday.  
*****
&gt; “We look for 7 million new claims to be reported for the week ended April 4, though obviously the range of uncertainty around this forecast is wide, and a substantial decline is also possible,” noted J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
*****
&gt; Consumer sentiment is reported Thursday, and consumer price index inflation is reported Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday.
*****
&gt; “I’m not a big believer that investors gain a lot of information from single points of data and even less right now,” said Mike Swell, co-head of global portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We need the world to open back up. We need the global economies to open back up to have any sense of the lasting impact of this on jobs. The concerns in corporate boardrooms is how conservative they’re going to be when it comes to cap ex and hiring.”
*****
&gt; The Fed releases minutes of its last meeting Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “The schedule doesn’t matter anymore. What matters now is how the pandemic is playing out, the extent of the downturn of the economy, and then how capital markets are functioning,” Swell said. “All of those things together are going to drive what the Fed’s going to do, and they’ll act when they need to take action.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has flooded the markets with liquidity and is ballooning its balance sheet with Treasury and mortgage purchases. Swell said the Fed’s programs are helping the markets they’ve taken aim at including corporate debt, mortgages and commercial paper.
*****
&gt; # Earnings ahead
&gt; First quarter earnings season is scheduled to start in the week after next, and there could be more companies withdrawing guidance between now and then.
*****
&gt; “We’re all facing the realization [the virus shutdown] that it’s going to take longer, it’s going to go deeper and that alone is taking the wind out of the sales,” said Calvasina. “Then the companies are going to report , and they’re not going to tell us anything...companies are just withdrawing guidance. It’s not even like there’s a new lower bar. Are we going to come out of this with a bar or are we going to come out of this with no direction?”
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline about 5.5% for the first quarter, which saw the biggest impact from the virus in the final weeks of March. 
*****
&gt; Calvasina said she expects the market to retest the lows of March 23, in part because it does not seem investors have gotten negative enough. She said they do not appear to be factoring in the latest gloomy projections from economists of a more than 30% decline in second quarter GDP. She said the market could still have a ways to go before bottoming, and notes the financial crisis drop was 49%. A drop of that magnitude would take the S&amp;P to 1,727.
*****
&gt; Her own survey of clients shows that many investors still have a bullish view on the market with a six to 12-month horizon. “We’re seeing investors taking a constructive view. They like what the Fed has done.There seems to be a view about the economy that the damage is really going to be concentrated in the second quarter, and it’s going to be contained in terms of depth and contained in terms of duration,” she said.

# A Technical Look at Market Internals

&gt; Following last week’s more than 10% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Index is tracking toward another weekly loss, its fifth of the last seven. This has many investors wondering if a retest of the lows may be in the cards for US equities. As we explored in our How Markets Bottom post, two of the bear markets we believe show the most similarities to our current one did retest or undercut the lows after the worst of the selling.

&gt; “Whether or not we get a retest is an open question,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But we believe we’ve seen the worst of the selling, and we will be watching to confirm that fewer individual stocks are making new lows on a further pullback in the indexes.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-picture-4.3.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, although the S&amp;P 500 made its low on March 23, more stocks actually bottomed a week earlier on March 16, when more than two-thirds of the individual stocks in the index hit a one-year low. Regardless of the direction of the S&amp;P 500 over the coming days, we want to see this trend of fewer stocks making new lows continue.

# Road to Recovery Playbook Factor #1: COVID-19 Case Update

&gt; Factor #1 in our Road to Recovery Playbook is finding confidence in the peak of COVID-19 cases in the United States. At LPL Research we are monitoring this factor daily, and we wanted to provide an update into what we are seeing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, while the number of new cases in the United States has continued to climb, the number of new cases seen outside of the US has begun to drop in recent days. In fact, Italy, the worst-hit country in terms of total deaths from the virus, reported on Tuesday that new cases hit a two-week low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/picture-blog-cases-pandemic.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

&gt; The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

&gt; “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States. Investors have historically been rewarded for investing during these crisis events, and we believe the time for suitable investors to consider adding some risk to their portfolios may be approaching.”

# Can April’s Top-Month Record Extend Market Rally?

&gt; April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. The window for the seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. The unprecedented speed of the current market selloff and current bear market would appear to have made this year’s signal insignificant. This could be the case, but it is far too early to say if the worst of the bear market is over. Double-digit DJIA losses during the “Best Six Months” have only occurred three times (ending in April in 1970, 1974 and 2009) since 1950. In 1970 &amp; 2009 the “Worst Six Months” were positive while in 1974 DJIA slide another 20.5%.

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fourteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. This year, guidance will likely be the greatest focus, as first and second quarter earnings are likely to be disappointing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Historically bullish election-year influences (the second-best year of the four-year presidential election cycle) have the exact opposite effect on April. Average gains since 1952 are approximately half of the average gain of all years since 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Largely due to a 15.6% loss in 2000, NASDAQ’s typical strength in all Aprils since 1971 is transformed into an average loss in election years.

&gt; This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

&gt; The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle.

# Down Best Six Months Not Encouraging

&gt; The depth of this waterfall decline may be too deep for the market to rebound quickly. This bear market also put this year’s Best Six Months (November-April) at risk of being negative. The record of down Best Six Months is not encouraging and it reminds us of a salient quote from the Almanac from an old market sage, “If the market does not rally, as it should during bullish seasonal periods, it is a sign that other forces are stronger and that when the seasonal period ends those forces will really have their say.”— Edson Gould (Stock market analyst, Findings &amp; Forecasts, 1902-1987)

&gt; The table below of Down Best Six Month for DJIA since 1950 also suggests caution and patience is in order. Subsequent Worst Six Months (May-October) have averaged losses with only two decent years 1982 and 2009. The market bottom in August 1982 marked the end of the 1966-1982 secular bear market and came of the early 1980s double dip recession. Following the first back-to-back down Best Six Months since 1973-1974, the market hit a secular bear market low in March 2009. Market action in the rest of these years was rather grim.

# Sector Relative Strength

&gt; Over the past year, the Technology sector has been the most notable sector in terms of outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the charts from our Sector Snapshot below, the relative strength chart for Technology has been in a steady uptrend for the past twelve months without much interruption even while the decade long bull market was coming to an end. In fact, last week it was the first sector to exit oversold territory after every sector was oversold for 13 days. The other sectors have not been as lucky. During the recent sell off, the relative performance of most sectors, especially cyclicals like Energy, Financials, and Industrials, fell sharply (indicating even worse declines than the S&amp;P 500). Consumer Staples and Health Care, on the other hand, have seen much stronger performance than the rest of the market.

# Consumers Turn Bearish on Equities

&gt; Tuesday's Consumer Confidence report managed to exceed expectations, but as we noted at the time, the survey for the March reports cuts off on the 18th, so as economic conditions turned south, sentiment levels also likely declined. One area of the report where sentiment already has seen a notable decline is in consumer sentiment towards stock prices. As shown in the top chart below, the percentage of consumers expecting stock prices to decline nearly doubled from 21.7% up to 39.2% while the percentage of consumers looking for higher prices dropped from 43.1% down to 32.3%. In the case of negative sentiment, the percentage of bearish consumers hasn't been this high since late 2012.

&gt; Given the major shift in sentiment, the spread between bullish and bearish consumers has seen a major reversal falling from firmly positive (21.4) to firmly negative (-6.9). By this measure, the spread between bullish and bearish investors hasn't been this negative since February 2016.

# The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly Commodities in Q1

&gt; Very few assets have been winners recently, especially in the commodities space. As shown in the table below, no major energy or metal commodities (front-month futures) rose in March and gold was the only one to rise in the first quarter. The degree of those declines varied greatly. While gasoline and WTI futures (crude oil) were more than cut in half, gold and iron ore fell less than one percent in March. Considering iron ore's cyclical nature, that small decline is somewhat surprising but as for Q1, iron ore's performance was much weaker with a decline of over 10.5%. Granted, that is still a far better performance than copper which was down by more than twice that. Given the size of these declines, every one of the commodities highlighted below sits well off of its 52-week high. Gasoline and crude oil are the worst of these at 74.14% and 69.63%, respectively. As for where they finished the quarter relative to their 52-week lows, things are mixed. Gasoline, gold, and silver are off those lows by double-digit percentages while the rest are less than 10% away.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Table-2.png))**

&gt; As with many charts across assets, the technical picture of these commodities looks ugly. Almost every one has broken below significant support levels and safe-haven gold is the only one currently in anything other than a downtrend. Although it finished the month just off of the lows, crude oil fell all the way to its lowest levels since 2002 after crashing through support in February. The same can be said for gasoline. Natural gas remains a pain trade with the downtrend of the past several months still firmly in place.

&gt; Given its safe-haven status, gold has again been an outperformer approaching some of its highest levels of the past decade during the risk asset rout of the past couple of months. But it has recently been a more volatile trade. The yellow metal has yet to break above resistance around 1,700/oz and has even fallen to support around the 50-DMA. Despite also having the precious metal status, silver has been a serial underperformer to gold. Silver never shared gold's rally over the past couple of months as it fell to its lowest levels since 2009.

&gt; As for industrial metals, copper has been hovering around its lowest levels since the final quarter of 2016 after falling through the past year's support around $2.50. On the bright side, the technicals of iron ore have been slightly more constructive as it has still held up at support around $75.

investing,Investing/Saving Landscape - Low interest rates,"Just something that has been on my mind after checking in with my grandmother this past week....

I'm wondering if anyone else out there is starting to get worried about their parents and grandparents nearing retirement and not having enough saved to live off of their investments due to current market conditions. (i.e. near zero interest rates, high market volatility, geopolitical issues, COVID-19). 

We are taught to begin investing at a young age to be able to have a nice nest egg by retirement, and as we get closer and closer to retirement, it is often suggested that our asset allocation be weighted more in fixed income securities to provide stable/consistent income while retired. My concern is with interest rates being as low as they are, are retirees going to have to accept more risk in order to get better yielding fixed income securities? 

On another note, are low interest rates on savings keeping America from saving cash and building a cash reserve for times like these?

To be honest, I was a big fan of the interest rate hikes on the back end of Janet Yellen's tenure as chair of the  Fed. I thought it would entice more consumers to save money in regular savings accounts and be content knowing that they could get a good rate on their savings whether it was for an emergency fund or just for having a general savings account. With this is mind, consumers having more cash saved in a savings accounts would serve as a reserve in case something like the crisis we are experiencing now happens. I understand that the fed does take a more macroeconomic and global approach to their decision making, but I do feel that the hikes were beneficial for both the economy at the time and the consumer. It just felt like during these rate hikes, the economy and the consumer were starting to get back on track. (I'm sure there are many opinions on this, but I think a healthy consumer balance sheet, indicates a strong and robust economy).

Feel free to add your input, but this stuff has been pondering my mind for a while. I have friends who just have a checking account and no savings. They'll just let money pile up in their checking and just contribute to their 401k pretax, and also add to their IRAs. What does the saving and investing landscape look like for the next 10-15 years?

Looking forward to reading others' opinions on this.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan simulator,"Hey all,

I have 100k in student loans and 6.2% interest rate. I work in healthcare and am an essential employee. I want to take advantage of the interest freeze but also be fiscally smart. I’m looking to see if anyone knows about a simulator for student loans where you input data and it’ll visually show you how your payoff will differ based on your extra payments, specifically one that’ll reflect the frozen interest. 

Assuming I remain financially stable through this shit, I want to make a bolus payment towards the end of the 6 month freeze. Any suggestions?? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Paying off Student Debt and Investing,"Hi Everyone,  


I'm an international student, soon to be graduating from my Master's Degree( Fall'18 - Spring'20/4 Semesters) in May 2020 and got a job at Silicon Valley which I would be joining in July with a salary of $135K annually.  


For my Masters Education, I have 2 education loans,    
1. $42K started from August 2018 with 13.8% interest rate (from home country)  
2.  $20K started from January 2019 with 8.8% interest rate (from USA)  


The major mistake that I did was taking/withdrawing all the money at once ($42K) of which I only needed $17k in my first semester, and another mistake was taking out another loan ($20K) fearing off that my father was in a bad situation financially and wouldn't be able to support after $42K in panic.  


I also saved around $5K of the loan amount to fund my parent's trip to the US for my graduation ceremony, and due to the pandemic, it's canceled now. How can I leverage this money?  


What would be the best strategy to pay off this 2 student loans, in minimum time/avoiding interest rates.  
1. To live on bare minimum expenses for the first few years and continuing repaying my loans with the rest of the paycheck.  
2. I also heard, taking out a personal loan in USA with a very low-interest rate and repaying the existing student loans almost in full (with personal loan) and continuing paying off personal loan.  
3. Refinancing(another option that was suggested by a friend), I'm yet to look into it.  


I'm completely new to personal finance and have started reading 'I will teach you to be rich' by Ramit Sethi,   


Please suggest how could I repay my loan efficiently, and also when should I start investing (with repayment of debt or first clear my student debt and then start investing)  


Thanks in advance.",finance
investing,Inflation,"I see a lot of people talk about inflation and hyperinflation from the FED drastically printing money to prop of the economy.  Typically, no one yet has backed this up with core facts. While in absolute terms the FED is certainly printing huge sums of money, but relatively speaking, what is this as an increase in the supply dollars. Personally I think we will see an increase in inflation, but not to the extent of hyperinflation simply given the fact that demand wont go back to normal all of a sudden after the virus goes, I'm more for the belief that demand increases as a more gradual pace leading to a steady rise in inflation. Any thoughts?",finance
Bitcoin,The World is F'ed . This former Goldman Sachs fund manager suggest allocating 25% in Bitcoin,"\[It is behind the pay wall : [https://www.businessinsider.com/why-coronavirus-stock-market-crash-historic-not-finished-raoul-pal-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-coronavirus-stock-market-crash-historic-not-finished-raoul-pal-2020-4)\]

&amp;#x200B;

So copy / paste :

&amp;#x200B;

* **Raoul Pal, the former hedge fund manager who founded Real Vision, thinks the fallout from the coronavirus will have immense, far-reaching impacts on the global economy.** 
* **The duration and severity of the pandemic is something that Pal thinks hasn't yet been accounted for properly.**
* **Pal thinks a further 20% decline in stocks is on the horizon.**
* **For context, in October, Pal called the Federal Reserve cutting rates to zero and the US having negative rates. In late February, Pal said to buy bonds and that the impacts from the coronavirus would be ""meaningful and real.""** 
* [**Click here for more BI Prime stories**](https://www.businessinsider.com/prime)**.**

**""The whole world's f---ed.""**

That's what [Raoul Pal](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/raoul-pal), the former hedge-fund manager who founded [Real Vision](https://www.realvision.com/tv/home), said on the ""[Lindzanity](https://lindzanity.libsyn.com/)"" podcast when he initially learned the [coronavirus](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/coronavirus) was uncontrolled and spreading rapidly. 

""The moment the spread hit Iran ... and then Italy — that all happened over the span of three or four days — I was like: 'time to panic before everybody else,'"" he said. ""It's human behavior function. If the Chinese closed every single border and every city, everybody's going to do it.""

To bring you up to speed, Pal retired at 36 after quitting jobs at Goldman Sachs and GLG Partners. He lives comfortably on a 140-person island in the Cayman Islands and spends his days writing [market research](http://www.globalmacroinvestor.com/), which comes with a hefty price tag of $40,000 per year.

""I said: 'Listen, this is the biggest economic event of all of our lifetimes — and it's coming'"" he added. ""And that was, in retrospect, the greatest call I've ever had.""

But this isn't the first time Pal's nailed a prescient call. Back [in October](https://www.businessinsider.com/raoul-pal-breaks-down-terrifying-implications-of-negative-us-rates-2019-10), he said the [Federal Reserve](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/federal-reserve) needed to cut interest rates to zero and warned of [negative interest rates in the US](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/short-term-treasury-bill-yields-negative-coronavirus-pandemic-market-turmoil-2020-3-1029032092), both of which have materialized.

What's more, as the market was topping out [in late February](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-coronavirus-could-cause-major-selloff-raoul-pal-2020-2), Pal expressed his affinity for owning bonds — a trade that would've immensely rewarded investors who took his advice. He also warned that the implications from the coronavirus would be ""meaningful and real.""

That was before things really started to fall apart.

Today, Pal thinks the coronavirus will cause ""the largest insolvency event in all history."" And given his track record as of late, that's not reassuring.

""I think the balance of probabilities are that this is a much longer event — in terms of economic impacts — than anybody is pricing in,"" he said. ""I think it's a huge societal change that's coming from all of this.""

To Pal, the duration of the fallout stemming from the coronavirus is the key factor here — one that he thinks investors aren't paying enough attention to. In his mind, those who are a projecting sharp V-shaped recovery in the third and forth quarter are incorrect in their assumptions. 

""Isolation is going to be a real event for a significant period of time,"" he said. ""You've got a world that's going to be much more closed, and that's leading to complications in supply chains.""

Pal's prognostication echos that of billionaire ""bond king"" [Jeffrey Gundlach](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jeffrey-gundlach). In a [DoubleLine webcast](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1296855&amp;tp_key=6eb12e188d) earlier this week, Gundlach said ""we're going to be getting much more, less-connected to globalization"" and ""we're going to be bringing manufacturing back and thinking about things in very different ways.""

But the changes that Pal and Gundlach highlight don't happen overnight, which is why Pal thinks the fallout could worsen. Every day that the pandemic drags on is one less day without production and consumption. Then that, in turn, heightens bankruptcy risk.

With all of that under consideration, here's how Pal is positioning his portfolio to weather a deeper equity rout. Ideally, he'd like to get to the allocation below.

stocks,Contrarian Opinion - Dip them feet in,"I am a recent lurker in this sub and the popular opinion appears to be extremely bearish and in favor of being net short the market. This post will provide some reasons in favor of being long US equities if you are an investor for the next 2+ years. 

1) Fed funds rate is essentially locked at/near zero indefinitely. We saw how the market reacted when the Fed increased rates in late 2018. With debt levels higher than ever before, both federally and at the local government level (unfunded pension obligations going to balloon from market declines, costs up and revenues down throughout the shutdown) after this crisis subsides, there will be little to no appetite for raising rates anytime soon. It's more likely we go negative nominally than raise rates above 2% in the future.

2) We will see P/E expansion and it is likely to be material. Do not think of P/E on its own, but always consider it in tandem with prevailing opportunity costs and earnings uncertainty. We should really be always thinking of P/E \~\~ interest rates and earnings uncertainty. Within 2-3 years, the uncertainty risk will return to normal levels, but interest rates will not (see point 1). What people are willing to pay for a $ of earnings is extremely dependent on what their alternatives are at the time. If bond yields are extremely low once things settle due to the near zero rates and they are expected to stay there indefinitely, long term investors will once again have nowhere to go for yield and will be willing to pay a premium for equities. Since they project near zero interest rates will likely be indefinitely, we will likely see P/Es stabilize at a level we have never seen before. 

3) Even with the worst of projections, most would agree this crisis will not be much of a factor beyond 2 years from now. Vaccines are in the process of being developed, and in the worst of cases most of us will be exposed one way or the other within that time frame. This is NOT the great depression because the Fed has stepped in and to our long-term detriment (thinking 10 years +) has provided the market with limitless liquidity to significantly limit the contagion effects throughout the financial system. The earlier they act, the less of a ripple effect we will see. I believe this is a short-term shock at best and 1-2 year significant slowdown at worst. After those 2 years, the future is bright. If you try and time this market, you have a very good chance of missing out on one of the biggest opportunities in this decade.

Good luck to all.",finance
personalfinance,Unsure What Loans to Tackle First,"Hi everyone. Being in lockdown, I am having time to consider my financial situation and if there are any smart money moves that I should be considering in order to save long term. I consider myself to be in a pretty good position financially and manage my money fairly well/try to save aggressively. But I am the first to admit that when it comes to loans, interest rates, etc. I have a lot to learn. I'm trying to figure out what loan I should chip away at (make extra payments toward) first, and honestly am not sure.

I recently made two big purchases: my first home (a condo) and a new (used) car. 

1.) My home loan is a 30 year fixed mortgage was for $112,500. I only put 10% down toward the home, so I do pay $26.25 a month in PMI. My interest rate is 3.875% and monthly payment is $740.96 (includes PMI)

2.) My vehicle loan is 5 years and for $11,082. The interest rate is 5.79%. My monthly payment is $213.70.

My financial status is as follows: My take-home pay after taxes is roughly $3,100 a month. I also have a part time job for a little extra cash on the side, but it is currently on hold because of the pandemic. 

I have $15,400 in liquid savings and another $3,100 in my checking to cover monthly bills and expenses (I don't let this dip below $3,000). Of the $15,400 in liquid savings, I would say my 6 month emergency fund is $12,000.

My question for all of you is what would be what would your strategy be if you were in my position? I feel like I can start making some inroads on my debt, but I am not sure what the best path forward would be. Should I drain my emergency fund (leaving me with $4,000 roughly still in the savings account) to pay off my car? Should I put extra money toward my principal to get rid of PMI (what my dad wants me to do)? Should I look into refinancing my home to try and lock a lower interest rate with a 15 year mortgage (something else my dad suggested)?   


I am just not sure what the wisest move is. What I am sure of, though, is I want to be aggressively paying off my debt to avoid paying interest unnecessarily over the long term. I appreciate your input!",finance

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Question,"Question regarding private student loan debt. I’ve contacted my lender (SoFi MOHELA) about my consolidated private student loan debt. I am fortunate to still be able to make payments, but I checked to see what their options were in response to the federal loan provisions. They state I can go into forebearance, and that it is non-capping. (Does that means there’s no interest accrued during the forebearance as well...?)

So my question is, should I take the forebearance to delay payments (as long as no interest is accruing)? If so, are you still able to make payments during that forebearance to attack the principal? Or am I just better off sticking with the regular payment plan as-is

personalfinance,Confusion after Tax Withholding Estimator for 2020 W4,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I am married and file jointly with my wife (we both file under this status).

I make roughly 85k (started job in March so income for 2020 will be roughly 65K) and my wife 48K. No kids. Both pay a little into a 401K (both contribute around 2k/ year into respective accounts ). 

&amp;#x200B;

Per paycheck paycheck federal tax withheld: me- $442, my wife-$105

I have just started a new job (last month) and immediately have noticed excessive federal taxes being taken out. After poking around, I learned the the new 2020 W4 format and filled used the Tax Withholding Estimator. Essentially (as many of us desire), I would like a refund as close to zero as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

After inputting relevant info into the IRS tool, I see that if I change nothing we would receive a refund $2,600. When I adjust the slider down to $800, I am told to 

"""""" 

* Enter **$116** in additional withholding per pay period (Line 4 (c) on Form W-4 is already pre-filled in the Download button below)""""""

I have read in other posts in this thread that this 'additional withholding' is **different** than 2019 so that it doesn't meant that they are actually going to withhold an additional 116 dollars. That said since I have started this job in 2020, I would have no 2019 baseline associated with my account (in theory).

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone shed some light here? I have seen several folks reply to say that this is indeed what I should do([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/encn7k/w4\_2020\_withholding\_calculator\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/encn7k/w4_2020_withholding_calculator_help/)). However, I have also have seen people reply saying that when they made this change that additional money was indeed withdrawn from their paycheck.

I was looking at the value of gold in 1980, 2000, 2008, and now. The spikes in value seem to predictable. Why wouldn't I just buy something like GLD when times are good and then just sell when there is a crash. With the VIX you have to really time the crash because the value of your principle will decrease right? But with gold values it just seems like easy money and a good hedge. But people shit talk gold. Am I missing something? 

A lot of people are holding just stocks and bonds as a hedge for the stocks but what if we have rampant inflation like in 1980s and the fed fund rate goes up to fight the inflation, so both your stocks and bond prices are fucked.

personalfinance,"Married, doing well, how do we approach student loans?","**Some background**: my wife and I have been married for eight years and are currently 26. We both completed four year undergraduate programs and as well as grad school in that time, my wife has two masters’ degrees and I have one. We also have the debt that empowered us to do so. I currently have 161K in Federal student loan debt and my wife has 161K as well. 

While we were in school, we worked only as much as was necessary to cover bills and living expenses that fell outside what was covered by scholarships, financial aid, and loans. After she finished her second masters, my wife entered the workforce and last year (2019) was the first year we both worked and contributed to our income significantly. We started filing taxes in earnest in 2017 and have filed jointly although we both claim ""married withholding at a higher single rate."" 

**Currently**: we both have solid jobs and are living and working in Washington state. We are both fairly well insulated from the current climate, my wife works in education and I work in tech.

My wife brings in around $65K per year and I bring in around $105K with bonus. I've also started receiving payouts on some corporate equity I have that amounts to \~$10K per year. I'm also changing pay rates and will bump up to the low $120K range with an unknown bonus (call it $10K) on 4/15. In 2018 our collective income was \~$60K, in 2019 it bumped up to \~$110K, and in 2020 we will W2 around $180K. I also have a small amount of equity where I work that pays some small “dividends” each year I hold the shares. I’m told it’s likely that this valuation could increase significantly in the next few years although I intend to hold onto it.  

Presently, after taxes (no income tax in WA) we bring home around $8500 per month. We rent ($1560), have bills ($1100), groceries ($1000), expenses ($1000), entertainment ($800), student loans ($400), saving \~$2,500 per month. We’re saving for a duplex that we can use for passive income while staying close enough to work to limit our commute. My wife expects her salary to increase, according to a state pay scale, at roughly 8% per year. Based on the conservative end of Radford and the pay scale my employer subscribes to it looks like I’ll end the year with a contract rate close to $140K and will likely stay within 30K of that for the foreseeable future (excluding equity).  

**The Question**: how should we file our taxes this year to minimize our student loan payments next year?  Don’t get me wrong - we appreciate the loans and will gladly pay back as much of them as possible. We recognize that we’ve done well and aren’t looking to avoid paying back the government’s investment, just postpone it while we accumulate some savings and equity. 

We have a great chance to accumulate a good deal of savings over the next few years and we really want to take advantage of it. In 2019 I will W2 just below $88K (mid year promotion) and my wife will W2 around $23K (she started in August). Based on what I have read, it is very unlikely that I would be able to stay on an income based repayment plan beyond 2021. If our income was reported together then it’s likely that my wife would also be disqualified. Should we file our taxes separately this year to avoid this? Would it have any impact at all?",finance
investing,What are your predictions of economic future and lasting Impacts from COVID this situation?,"I’ve been reading/researching the markets a lot today.   I think the risk of a very deep recession is high.  And there is otherwise a lot of uncertainty.  Thinking of moving to mostly cash for a while.  I think it’s naive to believe we’re just going to “bounce out of this”.   I could be wrong of course - and will keep a toe in the water - but I’m certainly concerned and surprised at the level of optimism I’ve been hearing over the last few weeks. 

We do have unprecedented technology and federal reserve tools and action, but the size of the abrupt disruption in so many businesses (and general daily activities) is also very unprecedented, and I think it’s going to last a while.   I’m trying to think through he next 6 months and I’m having a hard time figuring how everything sorts out.  One thing I feel confident in - things will never be the same.

until two weeks ago, I had two w-4 based jobs, one about 2x the other in income but both combined, under 120k. I also have self employment income from w-9’s, not a large amount (less than 4k$)

I got laid off from the top-earning w-4 based job two weeks ago (3/21/20). I have since found another w-4 based job (hired 4/2/20) which will become the *new* top-earning w-4 based job. Do I still go forward with “3” jobs on the w-4 worksheet for the *new* job even though I’ve been laid off, and will only have the two w-4 based jobs going forward? 

The irs.gov/w4app seems to suggest that I still have to include the job that I’ve been laid off from, unless I’m mistaken.

I also filed for unemployment for the job I was laid off from, though since I got this new job fairly quickly, I was technically only “unemployed” for just shy of two weeks. I never received an estimate, much less a check for unemployment. 

Adding to the complication is that in light of the coronavirus-fueled federal &amp; state extensions, I haven’t filed for 2019 yet. I don’t have a great estimate for what to expect for self-employment income for 2020, either. Likely still a smaller amount (less than 4k$.)

stocks,Why I bet on airliners,"Airliners, the symbol of our connected world, have been hit hard during the current pandemic.  As more and more countries want to be disconnected from the rest of the world, the future for airliners grows darker and the risk associated with airliner stocks grows higher. 

The news that Warren Buffet sold approximately 15 million airliner stocks strikes fear deep in the hearts of many private investors raising the already sky-high risk notch higher.

“No one is going to fly, airliners can’t make any money”, “No one will be comfortable with flying in the near future, airliners are doomed.  They won’t last”, “we are in the 2008 crisis again”  are the common themes.  While these statements are true,  they are also blanket statements.  The problem with blanket statements is that they do not consider the finer details that separate one situation from the other.  


Let’s look at how airlines make money:

+ 60% of their revenue comes from tickets.  The other 40% comes from frequent fliers credit cards.

+ 35%-75% of their ticket revenue comes from 12% of their business-class seats.

+ Average income for their passengers is $60k/year.

+ Their fuel cost is around 0.5 billion/year for every $1 of an oil barrel. In 2008, it's around $110/barrel.  Now it's ~$28/barrel.


This recession doesn't quite hit the group with a $60k income (yet).  People who got hit the hardest are in the service and manufacturing sectors with an average income of $45k.

The people who got hit the hardest - and can't or won't fly anytime soon - are not the bread and butter For the airliners.  This is a major difference between this crisis and the recession in 2008.

As soon as a vaccine is developed and the lockdown is lifted, businessmen and businesswomen will get back to the sky.  The lower operating fuel cost helps offset many of the empty of coach seats.

This recession won't last as long as the 2008 recession for airliners because it has a potential U-turn (vaccine), the Fed is pulling out all the stops and banks are in much better shape.
With scientists working 24/7 around the globe, there is much hope that the vaccine will come out in Q1/2021. 

We have a clearly defined enemy this time so defeating it is just a matter of time.  We didn't have that back in 2008.  As we race toward the cure, the virus also has a tendency to mutate rapidly to less lethal strains.  After all, killing the host, and therefore killing itself, does not do the virus any favor.  The tendency for the pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time is a typical occurrence as first observed in the 1918 Spanish flu.  The 1918 Spanish flu lasted 8 months as the virus ran its course.  

While expecting all of the American big four airliners will survive the crisis is optimistic.  Expecting the two with the strongest balance sheets to come back in 2 years is reasonable.



Edit:  I have to be clear that I do not recommend anyone to invest in any airliner stocks especially with the money you can't afford to let go.  As always, the majority of your investment should be on something stable such as a combination of bonds and index funds.  Only a tiny percentage should be allocated for high risk/high reward bets.  A typical recommendation is 5%.  I bet less than 5% of my play money on airliner stocks and I considered myself a risk-taker.

This is a positive feedback loop. What about something like (sorry for the crap example, I cant think of anything else) a machine learning model for introverts that want to know the best spots to go to avoid people. Suppose it predicts that the local library will be empty. A bunch of people see this prediction and hence go to the library. Which invalidates the prediction itself. But worse yet, this data will get recorded and fed into the model. So the model is now more likely to think the library will be full of people, which now causes people \*not\* to go there and again invalidates the prediction.

personalfinance,Mortgage company blowing up my phone to refinance VA loan to VA’s Interest Rate Reduction Loan. Should I do it?,I refinanced my conventional loan to a VA Loan in June of 2018. The interest rate is 4.99% and my credit score at the time was ~750. My mortgage company is calling me constantly to refinance using the VA Interest Rate Reduction Loan program. My current credit score is ~ 772. My question is should I refinance using this VIRRL? What are the pros and cons should I decide to do it? Why would my mortgage company push this refinance without any solicitation from me? What is their gain?,finance
personalfinance,Advice for a first time home buyer,"My wife and I are looking for some advice after having read the previous threads on buying a home. Also more time has passed and we are deeper in this situation than we were a week ago.  We’re also overwhelmed lol (aren’t we all?)

My wife, 3 year old, and myself just had our offer accepted on a $425k home, with 5% down. Quoted interest rate 2 weeks ago was 3.5%.  How do we face the unknown given the information below? 

The other option we have is moving into my moms basement. Just until we get more information.  But we’d certainly lose this home. And probably have to find a way to afford a more expensive home 6-12 months from now, after having lived in my moms basement with a 3 year old. Somewhere closer to $475k.

Some background info:
We’re in our mid-late 20s, and not much savings. 

We bring in $165k  pre-tax per year, and looking at putting 5% on a $425k home.  Essentially we would use our savings as the down payment, leaving little left in our accounts.

As far as the outlook on our jobs, I think there is a little to no chance I will lose my job. I work in the manufacturing industry, and we are essential business. My salary is $90k (Pre 10k bonus).  My wife is in the fashion design industry, making $70k a year. There’s a chance she gets furloughed, who knows.

My mom, wife and I have a great relationship. And we’d have some child care help if we move in to her house.

I’m looking at the ARM options and Navy Fed has a 5/5 option for 30 that seems good. Is there any reason not to do it?

Im a HENRY if that helps, Based on current market estimates from the recent sales around me I have between 30,000 to 40,000 USD in equity right now.


Edit:
I would go from a 4.625% interest rate to a 2.625 with no points (I think.) 

I would also go from paying $223.xx on my principal each month to $320 with a lower interest rate.

Edit #2: All the numbers:
5/5 ARM: IR based on current loan to value, IR = 2.5%
Discount point: .25 = $450
Current Principal due as of 1 March 2020 = 172,146.88

Approx monthly payment = 679.61 = 680
467.13 escrow
19 months to pay back the closing fees

$324 in principal payment per month for first year
Current Principal pay for March 2020 was $277

Bank of America:  
$BAC  
Great balance sheet  
Best online presence out of the large banks  
Interest rates are already at 0 they could go negative, but will eventually be raised once again.  
Banks are trying to get out ahead of the problem by suspending buybacks early, and working with the government. They aren’t the problem this time as in 2008.  
Morningstar is bullish on banks  
""We remind investors a few bad quarters of earnings are not that important when it comes to the intrinsic value of a firm over its lifetime.

personalfinance,Refinance Option Help?,"Using a throwaway account for anonymity…yes, believe it or not, this question has created some unsolicited advice/opinions from family, and caused a great deal of animosity. Those family members are on Reddit, so in order to avoid more family drama, here we are.

My wife and I have been researching and exploring refinancing options since December of 2019. We really ramped up our search in late February/early March when rates went really low. While the recent events of the world have greatly muddied the waters on this, the following is our current mortgage compared to our current offer.

**Current Mortgage**  
Interest Rate: 4.5%  
Monthly payment: $3,812  
Original Loan $495,000  
Loan Balance $474,700  
Years Remaining: 27  
Total Interest: $ 407,913.22

**New Mortgage**  
Interest Rate: 3.49%  
Monthly Payment: $3,442  
New Loan Balance: $484,433  
New Loan Term: 30 years  
Total Interest: $ 297,709.26  
Cash to close: $4,537

Is increasing the balance on our mortgage for refinancing worth dropping a whole percentage point and lowering our payment by $370?

Our initial plan was to take that $370 in savings, and apply it as extra principal payment (i.e. continuing to make our same payment amount). By my calculations, the $9,689 balance increase will be covered in 26 months. However, if we need the extra cash for something, it

personalfinance,NRA Spouse and Tax Filings,"This is the same as a post in r/tax.

For a married individual with a TN Visa currently residing in the US (&lt;183 days per the substantial test) and the spouse is in Canada.  What do I do regarding the following:

1. Do I file 1040 or 1040NR as a non-resident alien?
2. For the regular 1040 and NY state tax forms, they request a ITIN/SSN for the spouse.  Is NRA acceptable in both documents? It is kind of explained in the federal tax guidance since exemptions are no longer allowed but not so clear in the NY state one.
3. For someone who has to file in Canada and US, do I need any other american federal tax forms?

The plan is to file married (separate) rather than joint. Based on the tax calculators on H&amp;R block, it is better to file separately.

I have contacted different tax agents including H&amp;R Block but everyone makes different assessments. One stated 1040NR, no spouse ITIN needed.  Others state to use the regular 1040 and get an ITIN.

We were hoping to deal with this in March but obviously with COVID19, a lot of places are now closed and even with the extension deadlines, COVID19 in NY doesn't seem to be settling anytime soon.

investing,"Economic Stagnation, Financial Corruption, Dying Industries, and a Need to Revolutionize.","Another week in the books, the more I learn, the more a clear answer seems to come into sight.

This week I'm going to stay away from commodities/ other currencies to ideally keep any convolution in my post to a minimum. (While the state of crypto/gold plays into the big picture &amp; the underlying concern of our fiat money failing in the coming months/years; For the time being we're going to assume that either -  our gov't simply continues to shaft the common american with the debts they're currently incurring, or opt for the gold standard which would effectively act as a bailout for fiat-currencies.)

Last week I had claimed that this market manipulation from the FED/Gov't would be enough to push our economy into a quick revolution in the short term expanding over the long term, which has become more and more apparent as simply too ambitious with the current 'drivers at the wheel.' The market manipulation has been enough to slow our decent, and I still stand by the claims that the gov't will come out on top following the crazy movements of the market;  but, it surely hasn't boosted investor confidence enough for me to continue to accept the notion that 'we found bottom' in late March (@ 2.2K on the S&amp;P, 18K on the [DJI](https://gyazo.com/5ae8d8006299cfeb5fe50669e454ccf2), &amp; 7K on the [NASDAQ](https://gyazo.com/6bc24a3a3610b7a4cea65aded9cf0844).)

Now, where do I view us economically on a Long-term, Macro-economic scale? [This chart](https://gyazo.com/b64c3894d8e0231eeb65f1b36d730091) is what I'll be referencing when discussing my PoV &amp; projections. \[The blue line - our LT productivity output, a basic trend-line that's drawn on the fundamental principle that over the Long Term our economic productivity increases. Green - This line depicts the extended periods of Expansion &amp; contraction that a can be seen on a LT chart above/below this productivity output trend line. Yellow - Depicts periods of 'Secular Bull markets' Purple Boxes - highlight periods of 'economic stagnation' (Essentially periods in time when the economy is buying into 'false hopes' rather than a true leg up in overall productivity.) Black lines - shows how the markets are legitimately at the same price point when they enter &amp; exit these periods of stagnation. Grey line - probably don't need to explain, but my rough/projected trend line for the Dow Jones going into 2021.\]

To begin answering the large overhead question I must do so in pieces for maximum clarity:

First, what exactly leads me to believe that we're in a period of 'economic stagnation?'  Well without explaining every time-period on the chart, lets first look at the secular bull market which came before these last two decades to clarify what the basis for a secular bull market is.. What changed in 1982? The mainstreaming of computer technology &amp; foundation of the 'computing revolution.' Computer Tech was front-lined not only commercially, but also more and more to residential consumers around this time; this truly boosted out economies production output significantly, a which boost lasted 18 years before productivity outputs began to visibly max out (growing revenues/expansions/number of successful companies.) Reaching our maximum economic productivity with the given tools in the economy is what opens the door to economic stagnation, and in turn this would mean that no improvement to these economic tools have been discovered/front-lined in the mainstream (Arguably, this is evident when dissecting the computing revolution &amp; somewhat relates to our current situation - computers were invented in the 1950's but weren't implemented &amp; capitalized on economically until the early 80's.) You may say, ""but haven't new inventions come out since 2000?"" Well, Yes and no; these innovations have primarily 'improved' civilian quality of life &amp; have fueled consumers to spend more. This taken into consideration, you can see that the last 5 years of 'growth' has truthfully been more of a bubble than anything. (I'll explain the specifications of this bubble more in-depth shortly.)

Our current bubble; quite literally could call it ""the trump bubble,"" well the trump bubble mixed with the repeated shit practices from our Banks &amp; NUMEROUS companies using excess revenues for stock buy-backs rather than holding it as cash-on-hand for times like these... To break this down, first I'll dive into what I'm addressing with the current state of our banks. Those that remember the 2008 financial crisis and the source of the collapse probably don't need the refresher &amp; can skip this paragraph, but those that were still in middle/elementary school during that time, like me, might be a bit more lost in the sauce so I'll summarize quickly. The financial collapse stemmed from the terrible practices of our banks, both small and large. Don't get the wrong idea; then was worse than now, but the underlying issues still remain. In the 2000's banks were handing out mortgage loans to pretty much any and everyone interested in owning a house, paying no mind to what the loaner's credit score was &amp; totally ignoring the overhead risk of the loan; stemming from their greed while looking short term profits being returned on these shit loans. As interest rates began to go up, more and more home owners began to default (unable to pay their mortgage payment, filing for bankruptcy.) Effectively leaving the banks with boatloads of debt &amp; their investors with massive losses with no way to recoup these loses (since the loaned money cannot be recouped as a result of the borrower defaulting/claiming bankruptcy/ asking for financial forgiveness which is a standard practice across the board.) The result, banks were bailed out by our gov't with 'printed money' and these debts were tacked onto the tax payers for the following decade. Faith was restored in our economy, people were able to start getting jobs and consumerism was put back into the spot-light.

Fast forward to 2016, the common Americans have finished paying these debts &amp; have totally forgotten about what has happened in the housing market; MIND YOU, most don't even understand the significance  or how it played in the global economic collapse.... Banks were able to silently return to their shitty process of presenting investors with shit investments; ones yielding such massive returns that it didn't take long for greed to kick right back in... Also step in trump and his campaign with a target set on the common population in our country... ""We're gonna build a wall because immigrants are to blame for the degradation of our economic integrity; they're stealing your jobs and I'm gonna give them back. Oh, and global warming is a LIE! I'm gonna boost oil productions to levels no president has ever dared to before!"" Well, this clown did exactly that, except it was FOLLOWING OPEC's first agreement on cutbacks.. Honestly, I don't question for a minute that OPEC is aware of the dwindling demand for oil on the horizon &amp; they're working to preserve the price of oil for as long as they can (Oil is the legitimate backbone of these countries, and they have quite an abundant supply; a supply which they want to maximize their return on, for as long as possible.) So of course when Trump boosted our output, it looked like our economy was expanding... While in actuality, this dude legit manipulated an agreement between nations, in efforts to make the US economy APPEAR more wealthy on paper...

Cue inflation of 'the trump bubble.' Conclusively, our economies LT production output was NOT improved upon what so ever in the last 20 years; in-fact we have continually failed to break out of this time of stagnation due to greed in the markets ';fueling our economic progress'.. If it still isn't clear how it previously could appear as tho we're making economic improvements while in actuality we're in a time of limbo? (Regarding the constant craze back in 16' when we broke to new highs) Easy - 1) Consumerism has been continually pushed into the spot-light &amp; the general market investors have failed continually to see the flaws that stem by front-running it &amp; over-inflating the sector, 2) Banks/creditors use this to their benefit and continually prey upon peoples desires for material possession, 3) Trumps manipulation of a dying sector. All three of these factors which have led to pretty much everyone believing that our economy has been booming, pouring their money into it &amp; pushing it to 'making a leg up.'

It's practically impossible to predict the markets movements over the coming months, so I'm rather focusing on potential interactions with support &amp; resistance levels. [A more aggressive path](https://gyazo.com/0fc2d51cbaa1af49b0192431e857ceef) \- US economy doesn't open on May 1st &amp; over the next months bankruptcies grow (This would be the ugliest of the bunch and would force our gov't into a hand towards economic revolution sooner rather than later; kinda funny when considering trumps tweet about reinforcing infrastructure.) Compared to [A gradual deflation](https://gyazo.com/8b449bdb5c5a4d0807e33e8cdfc9ad1e) \-  With the shameless market manipulation thus far, I'm much more so expecting movements closer to this projection and truthfully believe it could threaten a lower support beyond my low side projections listed next. (In both scenarios I'd project a bottom around 11-13K on the Dow Jones,  1.7-1.9K on the S&amp;P, and \~5.5K on the NASDAQ. These low side projections reflect a collapse to 2000's highs &amp; the earliest point of which we could say this period of stagnation has come to an end.) All things considered, our current administration in gov't has shown how shamelessly they will fight against this threat of the rapid deflation and I don't expect that to disappear in the coming months; playing this fucked market should be fun... I only hope that in the LT it can correct itself &amp; our drive for innovation outshines the big wigs shameless greed.

\*Edit: I made mention quickly of stock buybacks, yet didn't say how it contributes... Companies which have been 'reinvesting' in themselves have been doing so to increase EPS, decrease P/E &amp; effectively inflate stock price while locking up a portion of the floating shares.. When done in good practice, the buybacks are done with excess cash (or in other words, when you have enough cash on hand to act as a proper cushion. Companies haven't been doing so, and when the bailout isn't enough, these companies are about to dumb hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of shares into the open market to recoup equity as a last line of defense against looming debts. This would absolutely annihilate share prices...\*",finance
personalfinance,Student loans with secure jobs,"Want to start by appreciating how fortunate my position is and feel free to skip over to others with more pressing needs during this time. 

Wife and I owe roughly $150k in federal loans. 
We both have secure jobs for this time period as she works at the hospital in critical position and I am a critical employee as a power system operator keeping the lights on in a major city. 

We have an emergency fund fully funded. 

My question is how to approach our considerable student loans. Do we freeze our payments until September and put it all back in before interest starts back up and park it in HYSA until then?

personalfinance,Credit score dropped before closing day on mortgage,"I’m in a tough situation. We got approved for a loan on a house. We put 20% down and both of us had “very good” credit scores of 750. We got a great interest rate of 3.375%.

Long story short...I fucked up on a card payment and missed the first payment on a credit card. I found out that this payment knocked my credit score to 690, which is a “fair” rating.

I immediate paid this off and had the card company send to credit today. 

I’m not screwed out of this loan right? I mean surely not since I paid this off and have no other debt besides my current house? I’m hoping that the new credit score will lift me 10 points into the 700’s which is a “good” rating and this does nothing but life my interest rate.

My closing date is still a month away and with the card company sending this to credit today, I feel good about showing that the debt is paid, but am not sure about my credit going up from paying off the loan.

personalfinance,Opening HYSA for the first time. Marcus vs Ally?,"Hi there! I'm a recent college grad, and I only have $1000 I can comfortably put aside as savings. Currently, it's just sitting in my checking account, so I want to put it aside in a savings account so I'll be less inclined to spend that money. I've been doing some research and here are the parameters that are important to me:

* APY, obviously. Marcus (1.7%) is currently higher than Ally Online Savings (1.5%), but I know they frequently adjust rates according to the Fed and very little check-in would be required on my part.
* Minimum deposit &amp; monthly deposits. From what I can find, neither requires minimum initial or monthly deposits.
* Fees. Obviously, I want to keep fees as low as possible, and the ones I've been looking out for are account closing fees and transfer fees. Does anyone with experience with either Ally or Marcus have insight into how bad the fees can get, and if there are any other fees I should be aware of beforehand?

If I've missed a parameter you think I should consider as someone doing this for the first-time, please let me know! So far, I'm leaning towards Marcus because of the APY, but I've heard Ally has the option of a checking account with it and an ATM card? I already have a BofA checking account, so is there really any benefit to going with Ally? Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide!",finance

Bitcoin,7 Crypto Firms Targeted by 11 Lawsuits in New York,"Seven crypto companies have been targeted by 11 lawsuits that were filed in a New York federal court on April 3.

The suits were filed by Roche Freedman — the same law firm representing the estate of the late Dave Kleiman in the ongoing dispute with self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright.

Eleven lawsuits target seven crypto companies

The eleven putative class action suits name dozens of parties including cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, KuCoin, BiBox, and BitMEX and parent company HDR Global Trading Limited, and alleged crypto issuers Block.one, Quantstamp, KayDex, Civic, BProtocol, Status, and the Tron Foundation. 

Many of the company’s principals are named, including several leading figures in the crypto sector such as Changpeng Zhao, Dan Larimer, Vinny Lingham, and Brendan Blumer.

The lawsuit alleges that numerous exchanges have sold unlicensed securities without broker-dealer licensing and engaged in market manipulation. 

The plaintiffs also argue that many token issuers selectively withheld information from investors to ensure that it would not be apparent the tokens comprised securities until well after the token sale.

Bibox Token (BIX), Eos (EOS), Bancor (BNT), Status (SNT), Quantstamp (QSP), Kyber Network (KNC), Tron (TRX), Funfair (FUN), Icon (ICX), OmiseGO (OMG), ETHLend (LEND), Aelf (ELF), TomoChain (TOMO) and Civic (CVC) are among the crypto assets that the plaintiffs argue comprise securities.

Proceedings expected to move slowly 

Several non-US defendants will need to be served via the Hague Convention due to their location outside of the United States. Disruptions to the judicial system resulting from the COVID-19 panic will also have an impact.

The case is likely to invoke familiar discussions surrounding the jurisdiction of the court in ruling against parties based outside of the U.S., discourse concerning the efforts of exchanges and token issuers to exclude U.S. residents from their platforms and offerings, and whether the crypto assets in question comprise securities.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,20% pay deferment. I'm considering refinancing private student loans so that I can keep stuffing the same amount into retirement. Thoughts?,"Hi /personalfinance! 

The company I work for recently began deferring our pay by 20% (which will be paid back with interest) until further notice due to Covid19. No complaints here, as a lot of people in my industry are facing layoffs, so I am very grateful and fortunate to be where I am at. 

This brings me to thinking about the markets and my retirement accounts. I am a 27 year old male (worked for 4 years before going to college, and just got seriously about retirement investing in the past few years), with about $11,470 in my Roth IRA and another $35,850 in my 401k with the market being down. My goal has been to have atleast 100,000 saved for retirement by the time I'm 30. I have just about 2 years, as my birthday is coming up. 

As for my student loans, I have federal loans with a total balance of $11,572, with interest being paused for the time being. I plan to just keep paying the minimum payment on these loans (around $150/mo). I also have a private loan that was refinanced through Elfi Mohela in the last year, with a balance of $24,156, at a 4.99% interest rate with a monthly payment of $509. 

I will easily be able to continue putting $500 into my Roth IRA each month with this deferment. As for my 401k, I have been putting in 18%, and have been getting an additional 8% vested from my company. Before the deferment, I was able to put away $1,152 each month, along with an additional $512, for a total of $1,664.

With the pay deferment, I have estimated that I can expect to be taking home around $800 less each month. This brings me to my question that I would like thoughts and opinions on. Do you think it would be worth it for me to refinance my private student loan (in order to lower my monthly payment) so that I can continue to contribute the same dollar amount to my 401k during these times? I think about the markets being down and the dollar cost averaging that I could be doing right now if I was able to invest the same amount of money. 

I would likely refinance the private loan back to around the same monthly payment when everything gets back to normal. The problem is that I have no idea when that will be, as the deferment could last through the rest of the year. 

Thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: 20% pay deferment will prevent me from contributing the same dollar amount to my retirement in these times when the market is down a bit. I am considering refinancing my private loan to a smaller monthly payment so that I can contribute the same dollar amount to the 401k.",finance

personalfinance,How much will having my name on my parents mortgage affect my ability to get my own place?,"We just built this house and my name was on the loan and is now on the mortgage. The reason for this was three fold; To help establish my credit with something more than a car loan and credit cards, my credit was better than my parents so it got us a better interest rate, and this house is suppose to be mine when my parents pass. 

The issue I find myself in is that I want to move out before my parents die. I’m 24 and it’s time. What I am worried about is the mortgage showing up and hurting my debt to income ratio. Will it make it harder or even impossible to get a place to rent or even my own mortgage with this set up? I have good credit (low 700s) and soon I will be making decent money (40-50k) for my area. 

They have said that as soon as they are able to refinance then they will and can take my name off the house, that might be a few years though and I am not in a position where I want to spend the next few years living at home.",finance

worldpolitics,$2 Trillion in Infrastructure. Where should it really go to?,"I was surprised to see something on Fox Business the other day that I first thought was completely outlandish considering our times. The President was considering a $2 Trillion bill in infrastructure. I’m not saying that it’s entirely a bad idea, after all, we do have roads and bridges that need repair. However, why would we be focusing attention right now where it's not needed most? After all, federal resources need to be spent wisely.

Looking at the data and the increases, the best-case scenario of an economic shut down is indicative of a period of about three months.

If we open the economy for construction workers and construction businesses, wouldn’t we be leaving out the other healthy young people that don’t work in construction?

Since we don’t truly have an idea of how long the Coronavirus will be influencing our daily lives, we need to consider the lives of those who have lost a job and are under lock-down. The economic catastrophe for them is already and could continue to be severe. Rent and mortgage payments will be coming due once again. We could be talking about people and families without a home seeking shelter.

It would also be unfair to the rest of us for stimulus to go mostly to construction businesses where it’s more likely to stay than into the hands of the workers. Instead, one thing we could do is we could request a delay in the mortgage payments. There would be no funding for the mortgage companies, only for the the owners of rental proprieties. The mortgage companies would receive very low interest-rate loans, potentially the same low interest rate loans the federal government would receive to pay construction companies.

Apparently, Article I, § 10 of the Constitution states: “No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” A contract, which is what's signed when you sign into a mortgage agreement or a lease, is a Constitutional provision.

I'm proposing that just as our right to assemble without maintaining a six foot distance under the First Amendment has been hindered during the Coronavirus crisis due to the enforcement of medical guidelines, we should have business rights, such as the Contract Clause, temporarily suspended for mortgage owners, and rents subsidized by the federal government for those who run the risk of not being able to pay them here in the United States. The economic implications are extremely important and I urge everyone to consider them.

investing,The bull case,"So I want to make an argument as to why I think we're not entering a recession and the markets will rebound much faster than many think.

* The duration of the outbreak is relatively short. Italy shut down on 3/11 I believe and they've already peaked. Spain is peaking right now with a similar time line. Some states in the US will peak this week. The global economy can start to come back by May and be fully ""back"" by July. 

* Unemployment numbers are not nearly as bad as we think. Many of these claims are coming from PT workers, furloughed workers, and others who simply can't provide anything to the company during the pandemic. While some of these jobs will be permanently lost, we aren't going to see 14% real unemployment. 

* A lot of people will be better off financially after this crisis passes. I know, I know, it sounds absurd but hear me out. A large number of people who get unemployment will take a significant pay raise. Let's use my state (NJ) as an example. Someone who makes $600 a week will get 60% from the state ($360) + $600 from the federal government. That's a **60% pay raise**. You add on the $1200 check which is pretty serious cash for someone living paycheck to paycheck. You *then* add the fact that expenses for a lot of people are down significantly. You can't travel. You can't commute. Restaurant spending is down. Concerts, festivals, movie tickets, day trips, all of this discretionary spending is basically 0. You're about to see millions of Americans with $5,000+ in their bank account when they've never had more than $1,000. 

* This is going to lead to a massive spending boom after the quarantine ends. You know how many people haven't taken a vacation in 10 years and suddenly will be in the position to? My point is that I don't think a lot of people are going to use this money in the smartest way. They're going to consume like mad after this ends. 

* QE is doing something to keep the economy from collapsing, and it will do it's job properly. Remember, this is a short-term crisis. This will pass, and when it does, things will return to normal. The fed's spending is just to keep things afloat while we ride this out. 

I'm not saying that this won't have long-term consequences on certain businesses, and I'm not saying that it won't cause serious problems for our economy. But there are some silver linings and I don't think the damage will be as bad as many think. Will stocks see February highs by the end of 2020? No, I don't believe so. But I also don't think it's going to take years and years to recover from the coronavirus unless one specific outcome happens: coronavirus becomes seasonal and we can't develop a vaccine. If that highly unlikely scenario happens, we could see absolute catastrophe. 

If you disagree with something, please disagree specifically. For example, don't just say that people aren't going to be in better financial situations. Explain to me why increased income and lower expenses won't put these people in better financial situations.",finance

Forex,"I think a lot of people would be better off realizing that even if everyone said f*ck all, let the weak die and get back to capitalism, we’d still be deep inside a recession for years due to the fundamental weakness in the market prior to covid 19, for reasons not related to covid 19.","Covid 19 was a catalyst that drastically accelerated a decline that was fundamentally primed to happen for years due to broad, flamethrower polices, regardless of this event. It’s just a hell of a lot worse due to covid 19. Market cycles are natural, ups and downs are good. But if you have year after year, increasingly aggressive policies to bolster the economy you end up building a castle on sand. Most politicians here thought “What’s that? I can enact aggressive short term policies that would post pone an economic decline? Well we can’t have that while I’M in office.  Buy buy buy, sheep people! This is the new paradigm that will go up forever due to our endless spending and rock bottom interest rates.”

Then a fundamental event happens that stops the irrational growth. Could have been anything. But it ended up being a category fucking five hurricane named covid 19, and that did not treat that foundation of soft sand nicely. 

There’s a lot of talk about “getting the economy back on track ASAP, letting people get back to their jobs and giving them spending cash to stimulate the economy! Sure the old and weak die, but we free up trillions of dollars in pension debt while they’re at it.”

Even if the most cut throat, soulless policy was enacted to ignore covid 19, the economy would continue to spiral out of control due to the long overdue nature of this decline. It’s like the economy was a car in a marathon race. The politicians are driving and the car is running low on gas. So they decide to slam a bottle of 190 proof grain alcohol and piss in the intake for a nice little boost. Yeah, that won’t have any consequences. They won’t fall behind the pace! Not on their watch. 

The engine is fucked, if everyone pretended the engine wasn’t fucked and continued to piss in the intake, it wouldn’t help. In fact it’d make things far worse and you’d probably have to spend even more money than where we are to fix the engine down the line.

Forex,"Question about ""6 trillion dollar"" response by the US government regarding COVID19.","Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here. I'm having a hard time understanding something and i thought you might be able to explain this to me.

I'm not a very active trader but i observe markets and realize forex is going wild during this coronavirus situation, especially realizing the dollar is actually really strong even though very inflationary measures exceeding other countries have been taken. I also understand that it might be hard for me to put it in perspective so this is why i came here.

Even before the coronavirus hit i saw trump tweet [about spending 2 trillion on the military](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213689342272659456), now i see articles about the corona stimulus being  [""7 trillion and rising""](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/economy/global-economy-coronavirus-bailout/index.html) and if im not wrong there was even something else where i read (before corona) that there were another 3 trillion+ being created in addition to the 2 trillion for the military.

So if i add this up and pretend those 3 trillion where i unfortunately can't find the article for right now don't exist it will still roughly be around 10 trillion dollars. The US total debt is around 25 Trillion right now so it would mean that they added 1/3rd of their entire debt, which took them more than 100 years to create, on top in only a couple of months recently.

&amp;#x200B;

What i don't understand here is;

 \- How much got really ""created""

 \- Is this additional debt or just some emergency 'theoretical' money that hasn't actually been issued yet? I assume it is debt but also i don't really understand it.

 \- Who is the main lender? Is it the Federal Reserve? is it China?

 \- I read that China's response is something like [80 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/deb56f86-6515-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) but i also read something about 200 billion but i might mistaken that with the trade deal thing. 

 \- Where does one get detailed information about this subject? (US debt/obligation increase)

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope i can get some insights about this here! Looking forward to your replies!",finance

investing,Share Buybacks Only Net Source of Money Entering the Stock Market Since 2008,"If Companies Aren’t Buying Their Own Stock, Who Is? https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-companies-arent-buying-their-own-stock-who-is-11586079000

This is a good article in the WSJ about buybacks. There is a great chart in there that shows how out of hand they have been over the last 20 years.

Something to keep in mind about buybacks and dividends. Buybacks are made and dividends paid because companies have no better use of their excess cash. Or so they think. And this actually jives very well with the lackluster impact of zero interest rates and other stimulus measures over the last decade. US GDP has grown at a simple average rate of around 2.25% since bottoming in 2009. This is the lowest decade of growth going back to at least the 1960s despite record low interest rates and record levels of government debt, both of which are supposed to spur economic growth. 

Below are some quotes from the article.

""Corporate buybacks, in fact, have been the only net source of money entering the stock market since the financial crisis in 2008, according to Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at research firm Reynolds Strategy. Buyback programs, through which companies repurchase their own shares on the open market, can help boost share prices by reducing the amount of stock outstanding and lifting a company’s per-share earnings, though not its overall profit.""

""Since the beginning of 2009, Mr. Reynolds estimates, buybacks have added a net $4 trillion to the stock market. Contributions from all other sources—including exchange-traded funds, foreign buyers, insurers, mutual funds, broker dealers, pensions, hedge funds and households—netted out to roughly zero, he concluded, based on the Federal Reserve’s quarterly flow of funds reports. The S&amp;P 500’s market value is $20.9 trillion.""

""In the decade through 2019, S&amp;P 500 companies poured $5.29 trillion into buyback programs, according to data from S&amp;P. That was more than double the $2.59 trillion from the 10 years prior. Dividends saw a similar increase, nearly doubling to $3.53 trillion from $1.89 trillion.""",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Deciding One Tensor Input Vs Multiple Tensors Input for Neural Net,"Hello, Redditors,

I have been recently working RLBench(Robotics simulation for RL) to create different agents which use Neural networks to predict actions. 

Now while designing these agents/networks I wanted to experiment one how different ""number"" input tensors will influence the behavior of the agents after being trained using imitation learning. 

So to experiment this I trained 2 different NNs to solve the task of Reaching a Target. The NNs predict joint velocities for the robot and are trained on the basis of expert demonstrations. The NNs are as follows:

\- One \[Sequential NN\]([https://github.com/valayDave/rlbench-documentation/blob/master/models/SmartImmitationAgent.py#L19](https://github.com/valayDave/rlbench-documentation/blob/master/models/SmartImmitationAgent.py#L19)) whose input is one 10 dim tensor representing joint positions(7 dims) and final target positions(3 dims). 

\- One \[Different Network\]([https://github.com/valayDave/rlbench-documentation/blob/master/models/ImmitationMutant.py#L34](https://github.com/valayDave/rlbench-documentation/blob/master/models/ImmitationMutant.py#L34)) whose input is \`joint positions\` (7 dims) tensor and \`final target positions\` (3 dims) tensor. These tensors are inputs to different NNs whose output is concatenated into single tensor which I then pass through more layers. 

I trained these networks on 350 episodes (350\*30 samples of data). Where each network is fed all the data. Basically I don't consider the sequence of information.  The training is done using supervised learning where the output of the NN is the joint velocities.

After training, I evaluate the trained agent on the basis of its ability to reach goal position in less than 50 steps. To do this I ran the agents for 200 episodes in simulations where each episode is maximum 50 steps long. 

The final results showed a 34% convergence on task completion for multi tensor input NN vs 12.5% for single tensor with sequential layers as input. 

Now my main thought comes around this. 

If we have a single tensor as input our NN represents f(x)

If we have multi tensor input our NN should present f(x,y). 

On the basis of this, My questions are : 

\-  If the NN is f(x,y) then there should be an impact on gradient calculation and propagation right? Because of the chain rule of partial derivatives

\- If the Sequential NN was ""Infinitely"" wide then will it encoded all the information and basically mimicked the input distribution?

\- How do I make a decision regarding the creation of tensors for feeding to the NN?

I went in to drop this down by one to get a refund rather than needing to owe, and now the form is completely different.

So i guess my question is, would it make sense to just put in the deductions field the difference of my paycheck when i was set at an allowance of 5 to what I show now?

investing,Ways to protect against stagflation besides commidities/precious metals/TIPS,"I'm speculating that we will see stagflation, for many reasons:

- Shutdown production and businesses will  lead to contraction across many industries. Even companies that aren't directly impacted(ie tech companies that stay operational and work from home) will be indirectly impacted by weakening economic conditions and thus will face declining earnings

- There is an unprecedented amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus going out. The difference between now and 2009 is that in 2009, there was plenty of supply and everywhere was open for business, but demand was the limit, so stimulus could spur demand without running into significant scarcity that pushes up prices. Now supply of non essentials are scarce as non essential factories are shut down, and demand of essentials is high due to hoarding.

Possible assets to hold:

1. Holding cash or short term treasuries will get inflated away while yielding very low interest rates. Only advantage is liquidity and available to deploy to other assets.

2. Corporate debt is inherently risky given the circumstances, and also low yielding. If stagflation materializes, this is likely the worst investment.

3. Long term treasuries yield almost nothing, the yields are even worse than my savings account. They won't be a good investment  at this point unless long term yields drop to 0(which would likely require negative federal funds rate).

4. TIPS are safe and match CPI inflation, but after taxes are a negative yield after inflation. So best case scenario, you're losing money. Good investment for predictability, but guaranteed to lose you wealth slowly.

5. Silver/gold are inherently scarce, and don't go bankrupt. There's a history of them performing well during stagflation/QE programs. Silver is currently down YTD. That being said, you either need to pay high fees for an ETF, or risk holding physical metals that can get stolen. Additionally, inflation does not guarantee they will grow proportionally.

6. I think equities are overvalued at the moment, and the market is pricing this being over in a month, but I think this will continue until a vaccine is widely available(restrictions may be eased but then reinstated when further outbreaks occur). I think its possible QE could keep asset values up, but I just don't see any growth any time soon.

7. Real estate could be good. The problem is the easy way, REITs(not mortgage ones), are getting hit hard by tenants unable or unwilling to pay, and state/local government banning evictions. 

I've thought about buying a condo to start out that I could rent out when I decide to move into something bigger, but I'm expecting a steep decline in real estate prices once people's forbearance periods end(especially because my state has very high property taxes and a declining population), so I think waiting is better.

Only thing I can think of as decently safe REIT investments are datacenter and other commercial ones that aren't impacted by closures. But this might be priced in.

personalfinance,"Taxes and 401k, IRA. Which way to go?","I've been thinking about investments recently and I wanted to know which way I should go.

I currently contribute up to my 401k match and no more. Recently I've taken some savings and moved them into the stock market but I'm not sure if taking greater advantage of my 401k might be a better choice than going into savings then the stock market.

I'm considering putting more into my 401k and maybe opening up an IRA, HSA. This wouldn't put me in another tax bracket but it would allow me to invest pre-tax, but only to specific index funds.

The thing holding me up is that I want capital to be available before retirement and withdrawing from retirement accounts comes with a 10% penalty - IIRC. But that might not be so bad if it's only taxed federally and I can get around local taxes.

What do you think about this? Should I divert more of my income to pre-tax investments or do the greater investment options and liquidity outweigh that gain?

Edit:

So I did some excel and got these numbers

&gt;Invested = Initial income  
&gt;  
&gt;Tax Rate = Amount left after taxes levied ( I made R-IRA 6% higher for local taxes )  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth = Market return ( 7% for example )  
&gt;  
&gt;Penalty = Amount left after withdrawn ( -10% for 401k)  
&gt;  
&gt;Using Formula = ( Invested \* TaxBefore ) \* Growth\^(Years) \* Penalty \* TaxAfter

I am a 30 year old immigrant in the US trying to figure out a way to be able to go back to school and make it financially possible for me in my current situation.
I have an Art degree from Argentina which I never used while I lived there and honestly have no interest in using at all in the future, and now I find myself really wanting to go to Nursing school.

There is an accelerated program in my area that takes 2 years to complete and sounds like a good fit for my schedule, but it costs ~$50,000; and I am not sure if I can make it work while paying for a mortgage and starting to build a house next year. 
In addition, I work 36 hours a week in healthcare (3 days/week), but I can't go less than 24 (2 days/week) if I want to keep my health insurance and my husband's. 
I am looking for some advice, maybe personal experiences to give me hope, or knowledge of some sort of federal or state program (CA-NV) that may help with the situation. Unfortunately because of income I don't qualify for much in terms of FAFSA financial aid. 

I feel like I should have married a Canadian or European! 
All jokes aside, coming from a country with socialized education and healthcare, I find it very hard to understand how Americans are able to ""move up in the world"".

personalfinance,"Dad got screwed, Seeking advice to help my dad on possible refinance","My dad bought a house in California in 2004 in mid 500k range. My dad was affected by the recession in the late 2000s and had to get mortgage relief but he ended up getting screwed into what looks to be a 40 year mortgage which changed interest rates every so often to keep his monthly mortgage down. From what I can understand, he ended up with a mortgage of 417,000 in 2008 and now he hows about 350k with 30 years left at 5% interest rate. He also has a deferred balloon payment of 13k at the end of the mortgage. He also had to get a HELOC loan at the time(I believe to get the mortgage relief but not sure)  which is around 41k but I have less of the specifics about.  I do know he's paying about $60 in principal and about $160 in interest on the HELOC. 

In short, Dad has Mortgage of 350k left @ 5% monthly payment excluding escrow \~ $1900 (escrow about $800 if helpful, original loan amount $417k in 2009)

HELOC \~ 41k at unknown rate monthly payment \~ $220

The house is worth about $700k  and was wondering if refinancing at current rates could help him in the long run. He's 57 and nearing an age where he won't be able to work like he is now and I'd like to help him as much as possible. I understand he might not have been as financially responsible as he should have been when getting this relief but it was his only option at the time to keep his family in a home.

personalfinance,How much would be fair to deduct my roommates rent/bills by while she isn't here?,"Three people live in a 3 bed house and split everything perfectly 3 ways. Theres me, my bf, and my roommate. We each pay £330 and that covers everything (rent, bills, wifi etc).

Me and bf share the largest bedroom, roommate has the second largest room and the third room is used as storage for both, it has roommates suitcases and third sofa she got from a friend in along with some other bits. We have a chest of drawers in there with coats/jumpers stuffed inside. 

Roommate has barely spent any time here in the last 5 months. She comes home twice a month or so to spend a night and the rest of the time spends it with her bf at his place. Since lockdown happened she hasn't come back, and now can't come back until June. 

She's asked if she can pay less because she's not here using the utilities and wants to contribute to help her family (she's staying with parents rn). I'm totally on board with this! She's doing me and bf a huge favour IMO anyway as we mostly have a house to ourselves and pay less than we would do just us.

Neither of us however are sure what a normal/reasonable amount would be, and I think we've both been hesitant to make a suggestion incase it offends the other one. Rent is £650, council tax £155 and the rest is bills. 

The only reason I'd like her to keep paying anything at all is that we wouldn't have got such a large/pricey 3 bed house if we didn't need space for her items. Her furniture is everywhere so we cant really make use of bedrooms 2 &amp; 3 for anything, half the freezer still has her food in, her plates/cooking stuff in half the cupboards etc so we've got reduced space. 

Any ideas from anyone with experience what a fair amount would be for everyone?

Thanks!

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice both personal and professional!

One part I think was important that I missed out is that this roommate is also my best friend so to me it's worth paying a little extra for everyone to be happy. Especially since us splitting 3 ways even with her paying slightly less still works out better for me and my partner then if we split a 1/2 bed alone since those go for £550-600 in my area

I talked it out with bf and roomie and we agreed for her to pay £60 less. It only increases mine and bfs payments by £30 each which isn't budget breaking by any means and I know it really helps her out. It basically means we're taking over all utilities and roommate is just paying rent &amp; council tax. We're also condensing her things and taking up more of the house space/3rd bedroom since she's not using it anyway to make our lives a bit more comfortable.

She also pays the bills and deals with the monthly meter readings etc which is an invaluable service to me lol.

Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen thinks the central bank is not in a position where it needs to buy equities but thinks lawmakers should give it more leeway for the future. 

""It would be a substantial change to give the Federal Reserve the ability to buy stock,"" Yellen told CNBC's Sara Eisen on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I frankly don't think it's necessary at this point. I think intervention to support the credit markets is more important, but longer term it wouldn't be a bad thing for Congress to reconsider the powers that the Fed has with respect to assets it can own.""



Normally, the Fed is only allowed to own government debt and agency debt with government backing, Yellen said. The central bank has also received special powers during the coronavirus outbreak to buy other assets such as corporate debt through exchange-traded funds. The Fed has also cut rates to zero and launched an unlimited quantitative easing program to help stabilize markets. Still, the Fed would need additional authority to buy exchange-traded funds holding stocks. 

Other central banks — including the Bank of Japan — have been purchasing some of their countries' stocks to mitigate the recent carnage sparked by the coronavirus outbreak. 

""The Fed ... is far more restricted than most other central banks,"" Yellen said. ""Even with respect to owning corporate debt, the Fed is not allowed to directly own corporate debt and most other central banks are.""",finance

personalfinance,Should I not have claimed myself?,"TL;DR Should I fill out form 8962 and attach a letter explaining the circumstance, or just drop it and expect to hear nothing more from the IRS.

Hello,

I'm a recent college grad and filed taxes on my own for the first time; previously I used my family's accountant. I used Turbotax and everything went smoothly - I even got my CA tax refund. However, the IRS mailed me back asking that I fill out form 8962 for any credits I may be owed from the Health Insurance Marketplace.

As I went through the form, it became clear that this form is meant for the healthcare recipient and their dependents - which it seems, the Affordable Healthcare Act believes I am a dependent then. I made below the federal poverty wage (part-time college job, nbd), and then read this in the form's instructions:

""You do not meet the requirements under Estimated household income at least 100% of the federal poverty line if:

* *No APTC was paid for your or your family's coverage; or*
* *You, with intentional or reckless disregard for the facts, provided incorrect information to a Marketplace for the year of coverage. See Pub. 974 for more information.""*

At first, I thought not filing this form would just mean I don't get whatever credit they might've thought I was due. But after reading that second bullet point, could I be in trouble? Was I not supposed to claim myself on my form 1040 if my parent's had included me in their healthcare plan?

Basically, should I send a letter explaining that I claimed myself and am not part of my the ""tax family"" according to this Premium Tax Credit, or could that get me in trouble? Thank you for your guidance!",finance

personalfinance,Confused about retirement and tax filing,"Hey All,

I am ignorant on this issue, and I've run into some confusion filing taxes this year.  It's the first year we've gotten where we can max our retirement contributions, gotten our stuff together, consolidated old funds etc.  Filing this year, we're getting hit pretty hard and I'm lost as to why. 

Married filing jointly: My contribution, roth 401k maxed, W2 has AA in box 12a.  Wife's contribution, 18k Roth filed as D in box 12b.  Our accountant is saying that married filing jointly means your combined contributions cap at 19k, not 19k per individual (I thought it was 38k, 19k per person).  Wife's is being treated as taxable income and an excess salary deferral.

I'm kind of frustrated because we've been behind on our pace of retirement contribution and thought we had just figured things out.  Doing some googling I just found out about MAGI, and I guess based on our MAGI being above the 203k mark we were supposed to contribute zero?  Her company only offers Roth, no outright 401k funds.  They have an awesome match, and I'd hate to lose out on it.  What are our options here?  Do we open back door IRA's?  Stop contributing and throw it in mutual funds?  Throw the rest in the market?  

I asked my accountant if we need to do anything about with the feds, other than the fact that apparently we owe a chunk of tax on that money.  I feel totally clueless how to move forward on retirement saves now as a result of this, and I'm worried there may be more tax implications.  We're just trying to save!",finance
personalfinance,Question regarding student loan payments,"Hi everybody, quick question regarding student loan payments. I currently have federal loans serviced through a private company, and private loans that I refinanced through a private company to lower my interest rate and consolidate those private loans into one monthly payment.

Total federal loan balance is roughly $30k @ 0%

Total private loan balance is roughly $22k @ 5.5%

I've been using the avalanche method to pay back my loans thus far. I pay only the amount due on the federal loan, and pay the amount due plus whatever extra I can towards the private loan.

My question is: since this COVID situation has developed, I noticed that my federal loans have temporarily been placed into forbearance with a 0% interest rate until September. I was going to make my scheduled payment to that balance today, but since I noticed the rate has dropped to zero, should I take that amount that I have been paying and apply it to the private loan instead?

I feel like this would be the right move, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything glaringly obvious.

Thanks for your input!",finance
worldpolitics,$2 Trillion in Infrastructure. Where should it really go to?,"I was surprised to see something on Fox Business the other day that I first thought was completely outlandish considering our times. The President was considering a $2 Trillion bill in infrastructure. I’m not saying that it’s entirely a bad idea, after all, we do have roads and bridges that need repair. However, why would we be focusing attention right now where it's not needed most? After all, federal resources need to be spent wisely.

Looking at the data and the increases, the best-case scenario for reopening during the economic shut down for most areas is indicative of a period of about three months. Many areas could be shut down for longer than that.

The construction industry is more than just builders, there are also administrators, HR, engineers, drivers, suppliers, IT, and many others who would benefit if $2 Trillion in Infrastructure were spent through government expenditures. Also, once these people get paid, they will spend money in other areas, like restaurants and stores. A chain reaction would be created, and the entire economy would be positively impacted. But to what degree? With the immediacy of the planning, it seems as though this would probably happen while a large percentage of individuals are still on the precipice of survival, having to pay rent and afford food. Many families could still be impacted. We could even have families with kids searching for a home.

While the idea of spending federal resources on infrastructure projects is a good one, I would argue that now is not the time. After all, most of the money probably wouldn’t go to workers and those without jobs. We would have a portion of the federal resources spent on investments that probably don’t reach regular every-day workers like you and me. A portion of the funds would be spent on overhead. Propriety owners would be recipients of large portions. CEOs could potentially get the benefit of huge payroll checks and others higher up in the food chain would receive bonuses that are left out of the equation for other employees. The wealthy would benefit much more than the bottom percentage who are workers. There would likely be a trickle-down situation where the wealthy get to save more, while average employees unfortunately spend a higher percentage of their income per capita. This will not benefit and currently impact the economy from the Coronavirus as much as the other two options below and is more likely to be a political ploy more than anything.

Also, there would be a trickle out approach. While some administrators, engineers, and labor-force employees do receive a part of that $2 Trillion, each time it transfers hands the money will be taxed, it will go to investments that don’t reach regular everyday workers, propriety owners will receive a large portion of the funding, and business owners and CEOs would also be cut a large portion.

If we open the economy for construction workers and construction businesses, wouldn’t we be leaving out the other healthy young people that don’t work in construction?

Since we don’t truly have an idea of how long the Coronavirus will be influencing our daily lives, we need to consider the lives of those who have lost a job and are under lock-down. The demand for essential employment is high right now, with many people unemployed and many others that aren’t or likely shouldn’t be available for work due to old age or serious health conditions. The economic catastrophe for them is already and could continue to be severe. Rent and mortgage payments will be coming due once again. We could be talking about people and families without a home seeking shelter.

Instead of spending money on infrastructure, one thing we could do, is we could request a delay in the mortgage payments and rental propriety payments could be waived. We could cut down a large portion of the expenditures by only having stimulus from the federal government going to the owners of rental proprieties. The mortgage companies could potentially not receive, or receive much lower funding from the federal government, due to the mortgage payments being delayed until a period beyond the mortgage ending date. The mortgage companies would also receive very low interest-rate loans, potentially the same low interest rate loans the federal government would receive to pay construction companies.

Apparently, Article I, § 10 of the Constitution states: “No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” A contract, which is what's signed when you sign into a mortgage agreement or a lease, is a Constitutional provision. Big banks, mortgage companies and rental associations would be opposing a mortgage and a rent freeze. They would say that it is unconstitutional.

I'm proposing that just as our right to assemble without maintaining a six foot distance under the First Amendment has been hindered during the Coronavirus crisis due to the enforcement of medical guidelines, we should have business rights, such as the Contract Clause, temporarily suspended for mortgage owners and renters, and rents subsidized by the federal government for those who run the risk of not being able to pay them here in the United States. The alternative would be to receive additional unemployment and/or direct payments from the Federal Government. Either of those two options would be more equitable and would benefit the average tax payer and/or employee much more than that of infrastructure stimulus.

The economic implications are extremely important and I urge everyone to consider them.

investing,April 6 Market Analysis - Canadian Names Edition,"Tough making sense of these markets.  OPEC meeting postponed so oil down 8.4% while SPY was up 6.7%.  My guess is we saw some FED money flow in EOD to pump up price through resistance break.  Here is my analysis from Friday.  I’ll start with my plays and holdings.

**Bombardier** – I posted a chart that showed Bombardier held its $0.38 bottom.  As it was coming close to being out of the 4 hour Bollinger Band and near support I got in.  Some decent follow through bouncing to high of day of $0.44 until end of day smacked down on a MOC to $0.420 finishing up 3.7%.  The 4 hour BB is now getting real tight.  There were big asks at $0.44 and $0.45.  I will see what kind of asks are on tomorrow morning.  If I don’t see a break of $0.45 within first hour tomorrow I may take profit.

**Canopy**– On Friday I noted Ontario said MJ stores were closed.  SPY being so strong, canopy ran too fast and too hard up to resistance.  I entered puts on WEED around $20.20 because CGC was running into 4 hour and daily resistances at $14.32 and $14.59.  It was looking good as the price was dropping EOD until the money started flowing into SPY and raised everything with it. I will hold into tomorrow but given the short week I will not be looking to hold into Thursday.  

**Energy Companies** – this one confused me.  As noted, OPEC was postponed and oil took a dive of almost 9%.  Well looking at energy companies you would not have known.  The only red name was CPG down a measly 0.7%.  SU was up 4%, CNQ up 1.5% and CVE up 9.8%.  Only explanation I could give is that CVE is still playing laggard compared to the 50% bounces we saw on the other names last week.  Others not dropping a ton could be because SPY was so strong and every other name I have on my list was also green so that probably helped.  If SPY is weak tomorrow I would expect a pullback on these names.

**Gold Still Strong** – Seeing 5% to 9% gains across the board.  Although interesting note, most still have not broken the highs that I have been noting in my previous posts.  I have been adamant that after the size of the pullback we would not just break highs on the next bounce.  Some like BTO are knocking on the door but ELD, YRI, OGC still not there.  I will note that K and KL have already broke through this resistance and are the stronger names.  These are also bigger gold miner names and hold higher % in gold miner ETF’s.  

**Blackberry and Air Canada** up 7% and 4% respectively today.  Given general markets bounce, not surprising to see most names green.",finance

But if you have year after year, increasingly aggressive policies to bolster the economy you end up building a castle on sand. Most politicians here thought “What’s that? I can enact aggressive short term policies that would post pone an economic decline? Well we can’t have that while I’M in office.  Buy buy buy, sheep people! This is the new paradigm that will go up forever due to our endless spending and rock bottom interest rates.”

Then a fundamental event happens that stops the irrational growth. Could have been anything. But it ended up being a category fucking five hurricane named covid 19, and that did not treat that foundation of soft sand nicely. 

There’s a lot of talk about “getting the economy back on track ASAP, letting people get back to their jobs and giving them spending cash to stimulate the economy! Sure the old and weak die, but we free up trillions of dollars in pension debt while they’re at it.”

Even if the most cut throat, soulless policy was enacted to ignore covid 19, the economy would continue to spiral out of control due to the long overdue nature of this decline. It’s like the economy was a car in a marathon race. The politicians are driving and the car is running low on gas. So they decide to slam a bottle of 190 proof grain alcohol and piss in the intake for a nice little boost. Yeah, that won’t have any consequences. They won’t fall behind the pace! Not on their watch. 

The engine is fucked, if everyone pretended the engine wasn’t fucked and continued to piss in the intake, it wouldn’t help. In fact it’d make things far worse and you’d probably have to spend even more money than where we are to fix the engine down the line.

personalfinance,Moving Out Budgeting,"Hey everyone, I’m a 22 year old senior in college and have been thinking about moving out as soon as possible. I’m going to be working at a large publishing firm starting in August, making $55k/year as my starting salary. (They contacted me recently saying my start date may be pushed back considering the pandemic but if anything that gives me more time to plan.) 

I currently live at home with parents in Queens, but will be working in Uptown Manhattan. Of course a shorter commute would be nice but I am prioritizing being able to live alone in my own space over my proximity to work.

My biggest road block right now is my student debt sitting at around $30k. Most of the loans are low interest and because of the pandemic, federal student loans are currently at 0% interest and makes up about half my debt. Would it be unrealistic to move out after saving up around $10k and paying back a portion of my debt? I honestly wouldn’t mind moving outside of the city like somewhere in Westchester or NJ if it means cheaper rent, larger spaces, or being able to live alone. 

My main questions are, 
1. Is it unrealistic to move while still having ~$30k of student debt?
 2. Would it be realistic to live alone somewhere close enough to work off of my $55k/year salary? and
3. What should my savings look like before I move?

Thanks in advanced and if anyone has more advice for moving out for the first time, that would be appreciated. :)",finance
personalfinance,"Accidentally filed my own taxes, but parent's filed for me again. Don't know what to do.","I have a small part-time job. I don't work much (&lt; 10 hours a week) because I am a full-time student. At the beginning of this year, I filed through TurboTax to get my tax return. I didn't have much to file just a w-2, and I successfully filed before the end of January. During this time, my dad also asked for my w-2 and 1098-t, but I'm new to taxes and I didn't know this meant he would be filing for me. I thought that he needed my forms for his own taxes.

Around mid-February, my parents ask my sister about her taxes and I mentioned to them that I completed my return and got my refund check. They ignored me. 

Jump to mid-March, my dad happily mentions to my sister and me that he filed our taxes for us and that we are both independent now. I mention to him that I already completed mine, and he freaks out shouting at me - I don't get much say when he's yelling (Asian parenting) ... :) I try explaining to him that I already told him this,  but he didn't listen and told him that I only entered my w-2 and I only got federal taxes back. He said okay and pushed it aside thinking I did something else.
My sister received her refund check in the mail today, and my dad asked why mine hasn't arrived. I explain to him for the 3rd time that I've already received mine. He's furious and stressed out about his taxes, for reasons unknown to me because he doesn't explain what's going on. He only yells at me saying that we are going to lose everything and it's my fault I don't care for my parents - if it's because his numbers are different since he put me as independent but I filed dependent, I'm not sure. He called his accountant and I believe he said he's going to take my tax return to court, but again I'm not sure.

Now I'm not sure what to do, I don't even know how to file for unemployment because I'm not sure what my correct filing status should be. I grew up forced to learn and do everything myself because they would never offer any help. For example, every year I file my Fasfa, I need their tax return and general info, but I would get yelled at just for asking for something like their SSN because ""how are they supposed to know if I don't know"". So I didn't think filing with only a w-2 through TurboTax would be a big deal. I also did this for my 2018 w-2 (only worked for 3 months) and they never spoke to me about it then, but I mentioned it today and they were furious. I just want to know if everything will be okay and if there's anything we could do to fix whatever my parents need.


TL;DR: I filed my taxes through TurboTax in January. Told my parents, but neglectful parents don't ever listen. In March parents said they filed for me, I explain that I already filed. They freak out and now my dad says he'll talk to the court about it?? I just want to know if I did anything wrong, what to do, what could happen, and how to get out of a situation like this.

personalfinance,Should I get a loan w/ lower interest rates for CC debt?,"\*Made a new account to stay anonymous on this, so I apologize if I am delayed with responses to questions\*

I am currently sitting at \~$8300 in credit card debt. I have been attempting to get out of it as quickly as possible, but with medical bills, I needed to pay off and other externalities, I haven't been able to make a dent in it. I decided since I am sitting in my apartment all day every day and spending less money than normal, it would be a good time to really hunker down and make a budget to get this off the books as quickly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in sales which makes this very tricky as I don't have predictive income, therefore I am trying to base this off of solely my salary. Currently, I take home $1314.19 every other Friday after taxes and my expenses look as so:

Rent - $740

Internet and cable - $60

Car insurance - $60

Electric - $55

Groceries - $250

Gas - $150

Misc Bills - $35

A majority of the debt is lying on an AmEx with a balance of $7936.04 today and I will have to update this post to get the exact figure, but I believe the interest rate is \~27%.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process is that I can cut spending and pay it off over time, but barely making a dent in it will hinder my credit score from recovering. My thought process is to get a loan from a credit union to pay off the entire balance at a lower interest rate, have a fixed amount budgeted out to pay it off per month, then use the commission checks that I receive once a month to expedite paying that off.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no finance guru, so I'm honestly not too sure if that makes sense. I also haven't told anyone of my predicament as I am quite frankly ashamed and embarrassed that I got to where I'm at.

Banking,ELI5 For loan/CC interest calculation for members?,"Hi All, 

&amp;#x200B;

Loan Officer for a small CU in the northeast. I've had more than a few of my members ask questions on how the rates calculate out on their payments, and I've even had a few call me and say they've done their own math on the rates, only to be off when I tell them what our math is. Is there an ELI5 formula/calculation or something to give them? Something like, ""a 4% interest rate means that the lifetime interest is 4% of X, divided by payments"", or something crazy like that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus points for this one: Credit Card Interest. We had a member call in upset over how the cash advance interest was calculated (daily rather than monthly) but I'm the type that if I don't understand it 100%, I have trouble explaining it to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our wording for interest charge on Purchases is: 

 Method G -To avoid incurring an additional Interest Charge on the balance of Credit Purchases (and Cash Advances, if this Method G is specified as applicable to Cash Advances) reflected on this statement and on any new Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances) appearing on your next statement, you must pay the New Balance shown on the reverse side on or before the Payment Due Date. The Interest Charges for a billing cycle are computed by applying the daily periodic rate to the average daily balance multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle OR the monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances), which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances) any new Credit Purchases posted to your account (and, if applicable, Cash Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later) and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges. 

&amp;#x200B;

For Cash Advances, it is: 

 Method A - The Interest Charge on Credit Purchases begins to accrue on the date each is posted to your account. The Interest Charge on Cash Advances begins to accrue on the date you obtain the Cash Advance or the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, whichever is later. The Interest Charges for a billing cycle are computed by applying the daily periodic rate to the average daily balance multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle OR the monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance during the billing cycle, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance is determined by adding to the Previous Balance (the outstanding balance of your account at the beginning of the billing cycle) any new Credit Purchases posted to your account and any new CashAdvances received, and subtracting any payments as received or credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges.

personalfinance,Do I pay down student debt or invest in retirement savings?,"I've been a frequenter of r/personalfinance for years now, but never contributed any content of my own. So I was doing some personal budgeting as a result of COVID-19 and came across this decision. Essentially, it's the never-ending dilemma: ""Do I invest or pay down debts?"" Specifically, if my only debt is student loan debt, should I pay that down or invest?

TL;DR: It probably makes financial sense to pay down your student loan debt first even if your expected CAGR is higher by investing it. Theoretically, investing the money might yield a larger retirement balance, but it's likely negligible and not worth the sacrificed financial security of being debt free.

Before I dive into the math and assumptions, please feel free to comment and pick apart my ""analysis"". I mainly did this as a personal exercise, but then a friend suggested I post to reddit. I'm not a financial advisor in any capacity and this is not intended to represent any sort of financial advice. Do your own analysis :)

I always thought that the common advice given here in Reddit was wrong. The common advice I always see here is ""contribute up to employer 401k match, then pay down your debts, then invest after you're debt free"" and it's doled out almost indiscriminately. Then sometimes, I see somebody say it depends on the interest rate of your debt (read: student loans) and that if your interest rate is below a certain level (usually stated at &lt;4%) you don't need to make accelerated payments. However, I never understood why it even mattered. Of course investing up to the employer match was obvious because it's a guaranteed ROI, but the rest I didn't agree with. My assumption was as follows:

Compounded interest on a loan is based on a factor of the interest rate multiplied by the loan principal. I always reasoned that as you pay down the loan, the interest also falls as well. However, when investing in retirement, your interest is always compounding in the opposite (positive) direction. So, I always thought to myself that even if your expected ROI for investments is 7% and your loan interest rate is 7%, you should still invest the money and make the minimum payments (10-year repayment plan) on your student loans. This is because the compounding interest on the retirement money has a 40-year horizon versus the compounding of loan interest is a maximum of 10-year horizon. This is obvious right? LOL WRONG

Over the weekend, I (thankfully) decided to check the math and calculate the actual numbers in Excel. To my surprise, I was wrong in my premise and I'm happy to admit how wrong I was; the interest rate on the loan definitely matters. In addition I'll take it one step further, unless your student loan interest rate is really low (read: &lt; 3%) you probably should pay down your loans first anyways. This is just my opinion.

so here's the math:
Available monthly money to use for debt payment or investing: $2,000
Student loan balance: $40,000
Student loan interest rate: 3.50%
retirement horizon: 40 years, or 480 months (i.e. April 2060)
Expected retirement interest rate: 7.00%

These numbers assume no changes over the 40-year period of the calculation. This is obviously wrong because there will almost certainly be inflation/deflation, COLA adjustments to salary, and etc. However, in order to forecast we need to project based on what we know now; so we leave numbers constant. 

Three simulations showing a 10-year payoff term, 5-year payoff term, and 2-year payoff term:

https://imgur.com/pcxgiKD

in the most extreme case (2-year payoff term), after 40 years, you would have $73,903.20 LESS in retirement savings than had you invested more up front. This equates to $2,217.10/year LESS withdrawal rate (assuming 3.00% SWR). This further divides down to $184.76/month LESS.

So, in short (read: long), depending on the interest rate of the loan (and retirement fund growth), you could end up with more in retirement savings over the long run. However, it's likely negligible in and the financial security of having paid off the loans as quickly as you can afford might be worth the sacrifice of those lost gains.

I hope this helped anybody like myself that might have not done the calculations themselves. Please feel free to point out any errors in my assumptions or calculations.

However now that we have 0 interest till September, I want to know what the most effective way to pay these off is. My payment designated for these two loans is $610. I have a bonus coming in May that will allow me a one-time larger payment of $880.

My question is, should I continue the same way I have been and pay 100% to the 1st loan?

OR, should I split up the payment between the 2 loans to try and lower the 2nd one's balance so that it will accrue **less** interest when the interest comes back?  I hope that makes sense. This would obviously prolong loan 1's payoff duration, but if it will save me interest on loan 2 (which accrues a significant amount compared to loan1), then I can live with that.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I guess what I'm really saying is if you invest in the stock market (primarily the US market), the government won't allow you to lose money, even in the short term. So convince me not to remortgage my house and invest in the stock market? After all I have the support of the government who won't let me not make profit... So what's the catch?",finance

personalfinance,Is this a good time to refinance an auto loan?,"I'm currently paying off a car loan at 6.5%, I've made 8 payments so far. I don't know if the federal reserve's lowered interest rates affected car loans at all, but either way, I hear it's usually good to refinance as soon you have a good credit score (mines around 725). I also know I should be looking to keep the length of the loan the same or shorter to avoid an increased finance charge. Is there anything else I should know? This is a safe process right? I won't end up getting scammed as long as I don't take out a longer length loan correct?",finance
solarenergy,Need advice on buffer battery for portable solar panel,"Hey there!

I am making this post to get your help on finding a suitable product for my application using a portable solar panel.

Here's the story (TL;DR below): I've got a trip coming up this year where I'll be hiking for almost 2 weeks with very limited access to electricity. During that time, I want to charge some LiPo batteries for my multirotor (the DIY/racer kind, no fancy battery here, just some 6s LiPo batteries with a XT60 and balance connector).

For that purpose (and also to charge my phone and gopro with USB), I bought a **Powertraveller Falcon 21** that gives out 5V USB as well as 20V DC (somewhat regulated as far as I can tell, but quickly drops when too much current is drawn).

My LiPo charger takes 9-32V in so I thought  I could directly hook it up to the panel (which is the case!) but there are notable drawbacks:

* In order to charge batteries with the charger, I have to define a constant current that will be used
* The charger will stop charging whenever voltage drops below a certain threshold or is unstable
* The charger power cycles if it doesn't get enough power, and doesn't start charging again automatically

This means that whenever a small cloud passes over, or the panel moves (imagine if it's on a backpack for instance), the charger stops charging the LiPo and needs manual operation to begin charging again. Also, I need to manually find the maximum charging current that will no cause the solar panel's voltage to drop too low, and this depends on the light conditions.

**TL;DR**

All of the above means that I need a buffer battery between the solar panel and the LiPo charger in order to provide a constant wattage to the charger:

* This power pack should be able to charge with 20V/1A from the solar panel, because the USBs from the solar panel are limited to 3A, maybe even less for a single port.
* This power pack should be able to output 9-32V for my LiPo charger.
* The power pack should charge whenever the input power is enough, automatically
* The power pack should allow simultaneous charging and discharging
* The power pack should be allowed on a plane (&lt; 100Wh)

I found this product which ticks all of the boxes, but I cannot find it new in stock anywhere (I've actually got a defective one - battery is puffed - that kinda works but would never be allowed on an airplane):

Do you have any suggestions for a product that would fulfill the requirements and can be shipped to Switzerland?

stocks,"Today's Pre-Market Movers &amp; News [Tuesday, April 7th, 2020]","#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-

*****

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, April 7th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-7-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to an over 700-point gain at Tuesday’s open a day after President Donald Trump expressed hope about research for treatment of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it’s too early to determine whether that’s a trend. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remained in bear market territory — declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.

*****

&gt; * Trump, at Monday evening’s White House coronavirus briefing, said, “There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.” The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking “incredibly successful.” Fifteen other potential treatments are “advancing rapidly” toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, “Stay inside and let’s win this and let’s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it’s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.” However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered “normal” before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.

*****

&gt; * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.

*****

&gt; * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: “All Americans are praying for him, he’s a friend of mine, he’s a great gentleman and a great leader.” Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from “mild symptoms,” but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson’s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister’s duties “where necessary.”

*****

&gt; * Britain’s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.’s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy’s 12.5% death rate. Italy has the third most infections in the world at over 132,500 but the most deaths at 16,523. The U.S. has the most cases with more than 368,000. The death toll America rose to 10,993. New York state has the most U.S. cases, over 131,800, and the nation’s most deaths, 4,758S. Global cases topped nearly 1.36 million with 75,944 deaths and over 265,500 recoveries.

personalfinance,Default on Student Loan I never even knew I had,"I recently received a notice from a collection agency that they were hired to collect on an unpaid debt where the creditor was listed as my college. I was completely shocked because I have 10 federal loans that I've been paying for several years now. I thought it may be a scam. 

But after checking the FSA website (which I never use since my loans are handled by FedLoan) I found out that there is in fact a loan for the amount the collection agency stated which had a different servicer than my other loans. It is a Federal Perkins loan.

After doing some digging it turns out that the loan was definitely one I applied for. I was able to recover my credentials for the servicer site. From here I found two interesting things, 

1) I never completed the ""exit interview"" step for this loan which happens after graduation where they explain how to pay back the loan. They emailed a request to complete this step to my school email after I graduated and I was no longer checking that inbox. They used that email even though my registration with their site has my actual email as my preferred contact address. 

2) I have never received a billing statement, phone call, or email since that attempt to get me to complete the exit interview. The site had my home address and phone number and my preference for receiving statements was set to mail. 

So this thing has racked up an extra thousand in interest, fees, etc., because I didn't check an inbox I no longer needed and I forgot I had this loan (I assumed all of my loans were owned by FedLoan).

So I am wondering what I can do at this point. The collection agency wants the entire loan balance with interest and fees at once. While we could afford that from an emergency fund we would prefer not to given the current economy... Ideally we would like to just have all the BS fees dropped and start making the normal payments on the loan. It has a lower interest rate than some of my other loans so it doesn't make sense to prioritize this one yet. I am also on income driven repayment plans for my other loans, not sure if that applies here as well? 

Just looking for options before I contact the collection agency and agree to pay anything I shouldn't have to.",finance

personalfinance,Short-term Student Loan Payoff Plan,"My partner and I have been trying to aggressively pay off our student loans. We started with around 303k in loans combined and are now down to 237k after a year and a half of payments. We've been putting anywhere from 5k-6k a month towards the loans and have knocked off the majority of the smaller loans thankfully.

I think I know the answer to my question already, but I want to see if there is anything else I should be concerned with.

* Partner 1 - 78k in FFELP loans. It does not qualify for the 0% rate or administrative forbearance.
* Partner 2 - 158k in Direct loans. Qualifies for 0% interest and administrative forbearance.

We are planning on keeping the 0% rate loans on admin forbearance until Sept when the rates expire. This will free up the remainder of the 5-6k a month to put towards the loans that are still being charged interest. Doing this will allow us to pay off 2 loans that total around 27k before the other loans have to start being repaid again.

Neither of us is PSLF eligible. So that's not a concern. P2 is in Healthcare and has great job security. P1 is in the private sector and has average job security.

The only concern I can see is that P1 loses their job and then the money could have been saved instead of put towards loans. We have a 20k emergency fund, so it's not as big of a deal in my mind.

After the 0% rates are finished we plan to refi P2's loans and get a better rate. P1's loans will probably stay with the feds until the economy recovers for the loan protection.

**A:   It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.**  
**Q:   Where will the government get this money that they are sending to the taxpayers?**

**Q:   Is the government simply giving me back my own money then?**  
**A:   No, only a smidgen of it.**  
**Q:   What is the purpose of this payment?**  
**A:   The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a high definition television set, a new iPad or a new SUV, thus stimulating the economy.**  
**Q:   Isn’t that stimulating the economy of China?**  
**A:   Shut up.**  
**Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy with your stimulus check. Use it wisely:**  
**\*  If you spend the stimulus money at Walmart, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka.**  
**\*  If you purchase a computer, the money goes to India, Taiwan or China.**  
**\*  If you purchase fruits and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras or Guatemala.**  
**\*  If you buy a fuel efficient car the money will go to Japan or Korea.**  
**\*  If you purchase useless stuff, it goes to Taiwan.**

stocks,"This rally is a mirage, we are only in the beginning stages of this recession","TL;DR at the bottom

Hi guys, with the market rallying 20% from its ""bottom"", many people are expressing the sentiment that we should buy back into the market again because the ""fed"" or the ""government"" won't allow stocks to crash. 

We will for sure see unprecedented actions taken by the fed and the government because they have both the motive and the political capital to enact such policies. However, I think this is a misguided reason to believe the market is currently making its ""real"" rally.

I am not not a permabear nor am I a permabull. I just try to objectively analyze the facts, apply a healthy dose of margin of safety, and then see if my conclusions are actionable.

For example, I posted my thesis on why we will enter a serious global economic downturn on Feb 9th 10 days before it happened. At the time we were at the height of the biggest bull market in our history, and I had gotten a lot of attacks on my thesis leading up to me consolidating my thoughts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

I continued adding more thoughts on things like the potential efficacy of Chloroquine 2 weeks before Trump announced it in a press conference and the media picked up on it, the potential collapse of American oil producers before the price war happened, casinos going under, helicopter money, bailouts, etc all before they were announced or the markets priced them in here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fede69/continued_thoughts_on_the_global_economic_impact/

And finally I talked about an upcoming inflection point coincidentally moments before Trump first announced Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine and 2 trading days before the ""bottom"" of the market:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fleh7e/incoming_inflection_point_for_general_market/

So I'm perfectly happy to make bearish calls or bullish calls, they are dependent variables of independent and unbiased analysis. I hope I made a reasonable case for why I am not personally biased (although, for the sake of humanity, I do wish for progress and prosperity of course).

I think the market rally is largely a mirage, and we are not getting correct pricings. The rally is probably driven by two main sources:

- Capital displacement from monetary action

- Incorrect earnings modeling based on improper historic precedent.

So the capital displacement is relatively simple: If you're seeking shelter in ""risk free"" investments that has some yields, you're now competing with a buyer (federal reserve) that prints hundreds of billions up to whatever it wants. They're literally squeezing out capital from the finite treasuries.

If you want riskier high quality corporate bonds, the fed will be there.

If you want even equities, you're going to face competition for them in the future. At least that's what former chairwoman Jenet Yellen recently said about the possibility of expanding their powers to buy equities.

So money is getting squeezed into a smaller and smaller relative portion of the financial markets, and the artificial demand is driving yields down and prices up. I could write a whole thread about this, but let's stick with the explanation of price movement.

The second main reason for the recent rally is from institutional investors who are incorrectly modeling earnings/yield of equities. So the logic here is: trillions are injected into the economy (fiscal injections), those trillions will become earnings for companies at some multiplier of the original stimulus over x amount of time, and if we add this number to the unstimulated estimated earnings, we can model future earnings.

My issue with this model, is on two main assumptions:

The first assumption is the length of disruption caused by the threat of this virus.

This virus is not going to stop its serious disruption of behavior from economic actors. Especially not in a country like the US where the majority of people have a massive financial disincentive to seek out healthcare. Here's my logic:

For months I've been praising the governments and response of South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. With Taiwan being the absolute best at handling the virus. However, I have also been using them as my leading indicators for how the virus will progress and affect economic actors. What I have seen developing lately is not good.

Singapore is now calling for a shutdown, after they initially did a herculean job of containing their outbreak. I had hoped that they would develop procedures (that we can copy) needed to run an open economy while the threat of the virus looms in the background. But that is not what has happened. Instead, we are seeing growing numbers of new clusters forming, and quickly getting out of control. They are tightening and shutting down their economy rather than opening up more. This is our leading indicator. A government far more responsible and effective than us is resorting to shutting down. 

Taiwan is faring better, but only because of their prohibitive ban on almost all foreign travelers (this is obviously devastating to their tourism sector and broader economy). Their economy and society remains open, with many if not most people having hardly any interruptions to their lives (aside from mask wearing). They are one of only 3 countries where all children are still going to school. However, even their economy is faltering as they try to balance the prohibitive actions needed to contain the virus and the economic need to keep things open. They are proposing an unprecedented stimulus/rescue package to bolster their economy. And I think it's a safe assumption that if they ever do open up to foreign travelers again, especially with covid19 having proliferated as it already has, then they will have to deal with massive outbreak clusters all over their island.

South Korea, which has probably the relatable and relevant model for us to copy, has recently extended its social distance campaign. South Korea is a far larger nation than Singapore or Taiwan. They have a climate similar to Seattle/New York. They had a major outbreak in Deagu but didn't shut their country down. They never even banned Chinese travelers, yes, they had Chinese tourists in their country while the outbreak was happening. They were among the first to widely use Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine as a treatment for Covid19. They had among the lowest fatality rates. They contained their outbreak without shutting the whole country down.

Even South Korea can't truly return to normal and open their economy up.

So why, in our incredible American exceptionalism hubris, and far less competent leaders, do we believe we're going to come anywhere close to normalcy in the near future?

Let's look at the next assumption, that fiscal stimulus would end up as earnings for companies. There's no doubt some will end up as earnings, but only a small fraction of what is being modeled by those on Wall Street.

The average American don't even have $1000 in emergency funds, do we expect them to return to their normal consumption habits when they risk having hospital bills multiples of $1000 just from walking past the wrong person? Do you think Americans, as much as they love to spend, aren't going to put some of that stimulus check in their emergency funds rather than contribute it to the earning of some companies? Sure, there will be some ""forced"" spending of the money (food and necessities), but if anyone is modeling the multiplier effect from previous data, then they really don't appreciate how different this virus makes things. Even in the GFC, laid off people didn't really worry about the heightened threat of being hospitalized.

Finally, some investors believe the Fed and the government literally will do anything to keep the numbers up. If this is true, you should be buying silver (or gold), not stocks.

Monetary actions can be reversed relatively easily. They are far more dynamic tools. Fiscal actions are not. You put money in the hands of spenders, that money is gonna circulate. And you really don't have an easy way of reversing that. If we think the government is going to keep handing out stimulus checks, grants to businesses, and other fiscal stimulus, then the inflation predicted from the GFC will come true for this crisis.

The fall out of inflation will be difficult to truly understand. But I do think inflation will be disruptive enough to the economy that inflation hedge assets will outperform other assets at least in the short term. For example, if inflation goes to 5%, who's going to lend to companies for less than inflation? With costlier debt, equity yield goes down, and again, what investor wants yields less than inflation? Inflation is going to cause all kinds of disruptions. I think the disruptions will come down to less liquidity (credit will vanish with uncertain inflation) and higher economic friction (less efficiency).

So if the response to why the market has to go up is continuous fiscal (and some monetary) actions to prop up spending and earnings, then the question is how will fiscal actions be reversed? How do we get that money out after things go back to ""normal""?

I think if we see equities rise from here, it'll be reflective of inflation rather than inflation-adjusted earnings. Silver would be the play here.

I have a lot more thoughts on this, especially on the time it takes to turn the gears of the financial system and why the inertia is moving us deeper into global recession, not out of it, but I'm running out of time and must end here.

**TL;DR this is a fake rally, and if anyone really expects prices to continue rallying, buy silver instead**",finance

investing,Unlimited QE,"I'm not educated in finance.

I've been trying to figure out quantative easing and how it affects the markets. I probably don't understand it all that well, so I'm looking for some help in understanding how it should play out.

From what I've been reading, the Federal Reserve purchases mortgage backed securities (MBS) and US treasuries from its member banks.

I'm reading that inflation hasn't occured during previous QE periods because the banks used the funds to increase their holdings rather than increasing available credit, effectively pushing up their share price through dividends and stock buybacks.

I'm starting to figure out how the market stays buoyant through QE. Money is made available to financial institutions by the Fed purchasing their debt. That money is then used by those institutions to purchase assets instead of being used to make credit available. Inflation has so far been avoided because if the financial institutions had lent out money, businesses would have increased operations and hired more workers. This would have fueled demand, driving up prices.

With businesses unable to operate in this current climate, the Fed is effectively allowing the financial institutions to prop up the stock market by increasing their assets.

That's all good and well for the stock market for now, but what happens when the economy starts kicking in to gear again and the financial institutions start dishing out credit? The assets would need to be liquidated, no? Or are they so financially stable now that they can do both?

As for hyperinflation; how would QE kick that off? Is the risk that once the virus has a vaccine that business might pick up where it left off with a much rosier outlook due to beefed up financial institutions looking to lend irresponsibly?

I'm reading that the way QE resolves itself is for treasuries and MBS to reach maturity without purchasing more. Where does the debt go if a large portion of them never reach maturity?

What sort of event could occur where the financial institutions might required to hastily liquidate their assets and flood the market with cheap credit?

politics,Megathread: President Donald Trump Removes Watchdog Overseeing Rollout of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Bill,"President Trump on Monday replaced the Pentagon's acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to chair the panel overseeing the rollout of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed last month, Politico first reported.

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

The trillions of dollars that were to bailout the top richest people that caused the 08-09 crisis are still listed as assets in the Fed. In terms of the stock market, the bailout worked. This is still one of the longest bull run in history with a minor hiccup today that is undergoing some correction. The S&amp;P 500 just reached what was last year Jan 2019 and projecting upwards since the new money was injected into the system and nearly everyone will be receiving a check for 1200 dollars. Like 2019, this is looking like a lot like a V, and within a month everything stocks wise will look great again.

Banking,Denied checking accounts by multiple different banks.,"Throwaway for anonymity. 

Currently 23 and trying to get my life together after a single alcoholic, abusive mother tried to do everything to ruin it. Working a decent job at $15 an hour right now, and thought I'd open a checking and savings account finally, but I've had issues where every single bank I attempt to open an account with denies me, gives me no reason at all. Contacting them I'm told that due to federal law/banking regulations/etc, they cannot give me any information on why. This is with providing SSN, birth certificate, and a current Real ID that is less than two months old with my current address. 

I started off trying multiple mobile banks that I'd heard good things about.

Sofi

All of these denied me, again with no stated reason, while saying they couldn't give me any reason due to various laws/regulations. I then tried applying for multiple brick and mortar banks in my area, and all of those denied me and gave me the same response.

To my knowledge, I've never had a bank account in my life, and I don't owe anybody any money so my credit should be fine. Thinking however that my mother could've opened things in my name, I requested a ChexSystems report and did a credit report, and both came back showing no information, as though I've never existed.

So what's going on here? I'm at a loss, because I don't understand how having no credit and no banking history would cause many banks to deny me an account with no reason given.",finance

Here I would continue to pay my current mortgage rate of 615. 

Second loan is a 20 year 3.125 percent  with a 3.25 apr my payments would almost be the same 620.

I want to know if that apr is screwing me or not.  I don't quite understand the apr even after reading it.   Would that be effective interest rate or not.


I am calculating they interest paid as the 3.125 right now and would like to go with the 30 just Incase of any problems with the economy.  However if I am getting charged an extra .75 percent I am not going that route.

Assuming 3.89 at 22 years $53000

personalfinance,"My mom is $2,300 in credit card debt. I want to help her, but am not sure how.","Hello, I'm new to Reddit, have beginner level knowledge on finance, and I wish to learn how I can help my mom out. 

So a bit of background, as the title says, my 60 year old mom is $2,300 in credit card debt, and I'm unsure of the interest rate. My mom is on a very low fixed pension, and has quite a bit of health issues that's preventing her from working. She lives within her means (no cable, no cell phones, no unnecessary cosmetic expenses, doesn't go out, only gets items such as food and soap from the 99 cent store, basically lives off dried beans and potatoes, etc.) 

So recently she admitted to me about the credit card debt she has and said that this accumulated over the course of \~2 years, and it's all from her food expenses during this time (I had absolutely no idea about this until just recently). 

Since I have limited knowledge on how finance works, I tried to offer options to try to help her. I asked if I could perhaps just ask the credit card company if they could remove or reduce the interest costs if we just pay it all off in one sum so she could stop accumulating interest (I'd be taking this money from my own personal savings). My mom was very much against this because she said that ""then the credit card companies will get mad at you and hurt your credit reputation as revenge. I did this already with my old credit card and they said I wasn't good enough to reapply"" (that's basically word from word what she told me). So I'm confused by that.

So basically I honestly don't know how to even help her? What would be the best way to go about this situation?  For more context, my mom has literally zero savings, no outside family to reach out to for help, has already tried getting government help, etc. So those options are kinda not there. 

&amp;#x200B;

So me being in my early 20's in college, how do I help her without hurting her credit, hopefully help her improve her credit, and also not totally hurting my own finances? Do I just help her pay off her credit card each month while paying interest? Or do I do the lump sum ask to remove / reduce interest rate idea I had (would this be bad for credit btw? I'm kinda confused by that based off what my mom said..). Or are there any other avenues I could explore? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know much about credit cards. I basically know the bare minimum to just stay out of  my own debt. So I'd appreciate being able to learn more from this post, and hopefully get some more ideas / advice on how to tackle this situation to help my mom out without making anymore financial mistakes.

2. transfer that payment toward my other loans that still have interest for the next 6 months

3. save it for a rainy day (I currently have at least 3-6months of emergency funds saved up)

personalfinance,Building Credit Help,"Hi-

Before you TL/DR me, I want you all to know that this is my first post here... I graduated from a very expensive private university a little over two years ago. I'm 24 and live in LA, live with my parents so have no real expenses. I was unaware of how important credit is and repaying loans were. I made some money from my first real job- thought I was going to be able to not pay the piper and simply dug my head in the sand with respect to my student loans (private university loan and FedLoan loan(s)). 

  
After pulling my head out of my ass and trying to be financially responsible and being tired of dodging Fedloan and my school loans. I finally picked up and decided to confront my responsibilities. Literally nine months ago I entered student loan rehabilitation with my **university** and made accelerated payments to bring my account current. In doing this, my credit score shot up from 502 to 570, still waiting on Equifax to update their records as well...but should be in the same ballpark at TransUnion.  While I was rehabbing my student loans through my university, I brought my FedLoan current but having 2 missed payments amongst 13 loans equated to 26 late payments tanking my score in the first place (my fault...I get it). 

  
So now that my university credit report is golden, I've been trying to tackle my on-time FedLoan account and trying to either come up with a solution where they could remove my 26 lates from my credit report- making it seem as if they were never there. I've read about requesting a retroactive forbearance and also a Goodwill Letter to request to remove my late payments. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my lates removed with FedLoan?   


I understand that achieving a great credit score is a marathon, not a sprint- but I am trying and have made responsible decisions to get back on track!

personalfinance,Is this a bad or good time to find a new apartment?,"Our background and current situation is that my partner and I live in Washington where our rent is 1500 with pet rent and water every month. My partner is chronically ill and we’re trying to file for disability, but it takes a long time. I have recently been let go because of covid 19 and I’m filing for unemployment. I don’t think my partner qualifies for unemployment even though their illness makes them unable to work traditional jobs or most flexible jobs, but they recently applied to an amazon chat rep job because their new meds is working a lot better. 

We’re low on savings because of medical bills and our family is on the other coast. We found other apartments in west WA for about $600 to $700, half of what we’re paying now. But I’m unemployed now and my partner just started training for the new job. Can I use my unemployment benefits as an income source? I think I’ll get at least $800 (600 from federal), so 3200 a month. My partner’s job should be 2000 after tax. My partner has decent credit, 660 or 680, but mine is really bad because of previous family abuse I’ve had to move across the country for. My partner’s dad can co-sign and he’s working from home with everything going on and makes 70k+. I was also doing gig work and made 2k a month, and I expect to be able to find a job after covid (grocery cashier, deliveries, etc). I just can’t work right now because I would be endangering my partner. 

Would we even qualify for a new apartment if we can put three months of rent down or more? Plus security and maybe last month. We’re also expecting the 2600 from the stimulus bill. Our current lease is up in May and will go to month to month with no additional fees. We’re not sure what to do because we can’t move to my partner’s parents place because of covid 19 and we can’t fly or drive. (My partner is awake for less than six hours a day and only functional for a few so it’s unsafe to drive 3000 miles to NY).

investing,Why stay in a non-federal secured money market fund?,"When I opened my Schwab money market fund, it was paying 1.7% interest or ""0.17% really,"" right? It is now down to 0.07%.

I think the investor checking account was paying 0.03% last I looked a few months ago. I assume it's dropped further.  But it is federally protected.

Given the pathetic returns in the money market fund, wouldn't it be wise to just move my money market funds into the checking account, where just in case the entire financial system collapse (which I have been here arguing will NOT happen), I'll have the U.S. gov't reimbursing what is in the checking account?

I obviously have less than the federal limit in the combination of my money market and checking. If interest rates spike, no penalty taking it out of Schwab's money market or putting it back in.

investing,"“This is not a light switch that we can just flick on and everything goes back to normal,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Commentary on how the US economy gets back to work.","[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-governor-looks-to-antibody-testing-as-a-potential-means-to-get-people-back-to-work-2020-04-07](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-governor-looks-to-antibody-testing-as-a-potential-means-to-get-people-back-to-work-2020-04-07) 

Thought this was worth sharing. 

It appears the bulls' main logic (or at least the ones looking at a V-Shaped recovery) about their short term position is that the virus will have a limited impact on the economy since it's possible that once this will all be over, the US can simply return back to work, re-employ all the workers and we can carry on as before. This begs the question, how exactly does the US restart the economy without endangering everyone for a second wave and potentially a second lock-down? 

1. The first and most obvious way is mass testing, find out who has the disease, isolate them and then let the rest get back to work. However, this doesn't actually stop a second wave from occurring since the workforce that has tested negative can still potentially get the disease and restart the pandemic. 
2. The more effective way is to have antibody testing which will show who has already had the virus out of the work force (including the asymptomatic carries), now whether this actually gives you immunity from catching the virus again is up for debate as the article states, but it's logical and possible that this could be a large percentage of the population due to the large amount of estimated asymptomatic carriers. Therefore, if more people have this virus than originally thought, that percentage can possibly get back to work immediately and soften the blow on the economy. WHO estimates 80% of people with the virus are asymptomatic and studies coming of China (yes I know questionable) and Italy also showing approximately the same thing. So it stands to reason that a significant portion of the population have already had the virus or have it currently but don't know it. 

Great so what do this all mean, for the workforce to return to work safely without restarting the pandemic there will need to be mass testing for both the virus and antibody testing, and the accuracy of these tests needs to be to a high standard where we're not sending out people who are potential carries or false immune back into the work force. Now the question becomes, how long will it take to: 

a) Create an accurate test which can be mass produced and approved (in theory shouldn't be too difficult, China and Singapore are already using these tests). 

b) Mass produce the tests and actually test everyone to get them back to work. 

An extremely optimistic timeline for this would be 2 months from today (I'm quoting other articles I've read) at best before you can execute the plan and get some semblance of ""returning to normal"", i.e. fully functioning economy, malls, restaurants, stadiums full and consumption (70% of GDP) back to full steam. Why is this important? Because even if you send people back to the workforce before the pandemic has been solved, it will still significantly impact the economy. China and South Korea who are further ahead than the US have empty malls, restaurants, sporting events and significantly less consumption (still 70% of GDP). 

So it's imperative that the economy returns to full functionality asap. What is a more realistic timeline for this given how this government has handled the situation so far? 4-6 months or even longer is not out of the question. As Cuomo suggested we won't be able to just flick on the economy like a light switch and everything goes back to normal. Questions naturally arise about who will pay for it, who will have access to it and how is it distributed? 

Therefore, what exactly happens when GDP is impacted for 4-6 months? Or even in the optimistic scenario of 2 months? 2 months is nearly 20% of a year. 20% of nearly all GDP just gone and evaporated. 20% of companies revenues and earnings massively blunted. Unemployment naturally rises, consumer confidence and disposable income falls, bad debt piles up. This cycle builds upon itself because as businesses start to lose revenue, they have to cut margins or fail, this leads to further unemployment and further falls in GDP. Lower GDP = Lower earnings = Lower stocks. 

This hasn't even taken into account the fragile state of the economy due to the Fed pretty much using all their weapons to keep the economy afloat, how do you restart an economy that is already at zero interest rates and has significant sovereign debt as as debtor. What are the repercussions from the Fed using ""unlimited QE""? It may prop up the economy in the short term but eventually it will catch up on itself. Throw in the fact that the Shiller PE Ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is still fairly overbought (25.10 currently) and it has a significant way to drop before it goes back to a fair valuation, especially during a recession and you can see why it's far more likely there is huge downside in the near term than upside. There may also be huge downside long term which isn't explored here. 

What does that mean for your investments? Still dollar cost average in because it will eventually rebound and you will eventually be up (whether that's 2-5 years from now), but in the immediate term look for yields in high yielding corporate debt with strong balance sheets, potentially look into silver and gold to diversify against a weakening dollar and also consider building a short position through an inverse ETF or options until we reach another inevitable bottom.",finance

personalfinance,Shockingly low credit score vs credit reporting apps,"I'm in the process of applying for a home loan, and a credit report is an obvious part of the information loan providers require. After deliberately using my credit cards over the last couple of years to build credit, my Equifax and TransUnion scores are 750 and above. 

**However,** my potential loan provider hit me with a ""since your scores are below 700..."" He forwarded me the credit report that he pulled, and lo and behold, my scores are around 650-680. All three were FICO scores that put me squarely in the ""fair"" range, and it completely blindsided me, and it's keeping me from getting a decent interest rate on a traditional home loan.

I do have a delinquency on the report, and it does show that I disputed it. It came from a medical office sending a bill to an address that I told them *three times* not to send anything to (because I was staying there for a month), but they did it anyways and it went to collections. The only way I found out about it (November 2018) was through my Mint account. 

My questions are: 

* How do I raise and monitor my FICO scores without losing points checking
* Why are my TransUnion and Equifax scores so different from my FICO scores
* Should that delinquency still be on my credit report, even though it was disputed and resolved almost a year and a half ago?

I also wouldn't mind any suggestions for a home loan provider with good interest rates, especially if they look at my TransUnion and Equifax scores. I'm currently talking to Quicken/Rocket, but they can't lock in a rate at the moment due to COVID-19.",finance
personalfinance,I Quit My Job At the Worst Possible Time,"So I used to work at Fedex, but I only stayed for a month because frankly they were the worst employer I ever had.

Btw, I have a solid resume for my age, graduated high school and have plans for school in the Fall. I used to work at a major airline that's hard to get a job at, but after a year and a half I left on exceptionally good terms. I was going to have to quit for school anyway, and I wanted to try to find a full time gig so I could earn more before school. Fedex \*seemed\* promising...

Anyway I needed fulltime and joined the company because I was told I would get certain hours. I knew there would be some shorter days and early cuts, but this was just ridiculous.

I put my two weeks in and left on good terms.

That was mid-February.

I took a couple of weeks vacation, which I hadn't had the chance to do for years, and when I finished I started applying for jobs. Got a few calls back and an interview but ultimately nothing came of it. I just recently got a response from Target Distribution and they waited like a month before sending their rejection email. I like to think that at least some of the rejections were due to the virus and lowering hiring/battening the hatches. Again, I have a good work history and references, and have always worked hard.

Then all this virus shit happened, and I currently am on my last few hundred bucks.

Thankfully I'm not a breadwinner and have minimal expenses, for now. Still gonna have trouble paying my car loan, insurance, etc.

Not here to complain. I know that my situation is a cake-walk compared to the majority of you. I'm here for advice.

1. Looks like I can't file for unemployment, seeing as I voluntarily quit. Any work-arounds? I was applying for stuff before the lockdown hit, but I technically didn't have any solid plans to return to work. I did a little Doordash last month to take the edge off but in all honesty I couldn't keep being around people and delivering food. I have no reason to think I have the virus but idk if I could handle the stress of potentially infecting people. I may have no choice to return to Doordash though, I'd just have to be ultra careful. But anyway, are freelancers able to file for unemployment?
2. The stimulus package is one of my only hopes at this point. However, I accidentally marked myself as a dependent when I filed my taxes. I was 19 and not in school at the end of 2019, and this was my first time not being eligible so I didn't really give it any thought. My parents haven't filed yet, so I'm not actually claimed yet. I got an amendment started on TurboTax, but you apparently have to mail in any amendments, and it seems like they take months and months to be reviewed, at which point the stimulus package will be long gone. What are the chances I get anything from the stimulus bill, and is it even worth amending?

personalfinance,Getting real nervous about my student loan balance,"So here’s the situation:

I graduate my undergrad next year. I made a bit of a blunder and chose attending a name brand school in a big city, even though I was going to have to support myself. 

Normal cost of attendance is about $70k a year-despite financial aid and working all 4 years I’ll still graduate with about $100k in debt, $70k private and $30k federal. I’m a finance major-pre-corona graduates at my school were making around $65K a year so I’m hoping go be at the same assuming things get back to normal next spring. 

I’ve also managed to save around $20K-hopefully to go towards buying a small apartment building when I graduate. This will allow me to not have to pay rent, which I can use towards paying down my student loans considerably.

I have a couple questions:
1. How likely is it that I can refinance when I graduate, assuming I make $60k on graduation? My interest rate on my private loans is HUGE-up to 9.5% in some cases-because both of my parents have poor credit
2. Should I use the $20k to pay down some of my debt? I feel pretty confident I can get a higher return if I buy a place next year that allows me to eliminate a $1200+ rent payment, but just my total balance is freaking me out?
3. Am I screwed?

Edit:
Just to clarify, my plan is to buy a small apartment building, 3 or 4 units, with the $20k as a downpayment. I’ve run the numbers, and renting out the other apartments would allow me to live without a housing payment, including taxes and insurance.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage deferment vs. forbearance,"I'm not sure if this is a good place to post, but if there is a better place please let me know.

Basically, when all of this crap started I had called my mortgage servicer (Freedom Mortgage) to inquire about putting my mortgage on forbearance.  I was told that I could begin forbearance, but after 90 days I would be required to make up those missed payments as a lump sum...essentially requiring me to pay the equivalent of 4 months of payments all at once (3 missed payments + 1 month payment that is normally due).  That's obviously stupid and doesn't help anyone.  It would make significantly more sense to put the payments onto the end of the mortgage - essentially extending the term.

Then I came across this article today &lt;[https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised)\&gt; which calls out Freedom Mortgage for being misleading and creating more hurdles than are required.  I called them today to ask about putting the payments onto the end of the mortgage instead of the lump sum and was told they could not do that, and again the excuse was federal regulations.

Does anyone have any information that can help give clarity on the situation, and assuming Freedom Mortgage is in fact screwing over their customers is there a way to force their hand or at least report their wrong doing (if it is in fact wrong)?

NOTE: I am aware that interest wouldn't stop during the forbearance period, even if the payments are tacked onto the mortgage at the end of the term.  But, that is completely worth it compared to paying $1,200+ monthly when my income has stopped.",finance

I am an accountant at an independent resort in NY. We are closed, but I am still working. I used all my remaining vacation and pto to get through the second half of March so I could work the beginning of this month to close out March.

I think probably just playing ball here is probably the best move, unfortunately. My other options seem basically to be just quitting which would be bad long term or playing the FMLA card.

Can you imagine how much happier everyone would be if all basic, human needs were guaranteed as rights? Also, are you doing ok in this national emergency? Please DM me if you think I could help, even if it's just to listen. 

About me: I’m 32 years old, a government attorney, and a dad. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to my son’s life and his future. We have ten years to clean up our world and it’s now or never. My home will flood twice a month by 2035. A new gas pipeline is proposed a few miles from my house. The fossil fuel companies will not stop until every ounce of oil on this planet is burned. They have come for my family – and they’ve messed with the wrong father.

I support the Green New Deal to protect our homes and our families. The federal jobs guarantee will create millions of good jobs, even during national crises like this one.

For four years I’ve been a public servant, an attorney for housing justice, for New York State government. Last year I helped draft a law to protect ~200,000 people in manufactured homes, mostly seniors. We banned unfair evictions and banned fraudulent lenders. I also defend the Rent Stabilization Law in court. I support rent stabilization and housing for all because no one should be homeless.

As an organizer and activist, last year alone, one movement I volunteered for blocked wall street from purchasing up a local town’s water supply, and another required a local town to buy 100% renewable energy. I’ve learned that even small changes make a big difference, and every fight counts. But it takes armies of ordinary people to effect it.

The system is rigged for the top 1%. Billionaires buy elections, mega corporations crush out small businesses, they buy tax loopholes, they pay less tax than working people, and they get so many government handouts. The main reason our government doesn’t work is because of the money in politics. We have to ban lobbyists, ban private donations, and switch to publicly financed elections. If we get the money out, it’s the reform of all reforms.  

That’s why I’m committed to never take a penny of corporate PAC money, nor lobbyist money. One cannot have two masters, it’s either the money, or the People, and I choose the People.

I’m a New Deal Democrat. I want to guarantee you and your family peace of mind in a chaotic world with basic economic rights. Healthcare as a right with Medicare for All. A UBI (with no strings attached). We need to rethink our food system, ban factory farms, increase food inspections, indoor vertical farms for organic food at cost. We’ve got to end the scam of student loan debt, college should be free. I want to expand social security to be enough to retire on. I want to end endless wars overseas.

I'm running in the Democratic Primary for New Jersey's 6th Congressional District (Middlesex and Monmouth Counties) . 

The incumbent Democrat I’m running against, Frank Pallone, has been in office for 32 years, and he’s powerful. As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he could call a vote on almost any bill. He’s sponsored by millions from big pharma and insurance, so of course he blocks Medicare for All (HR 1384). He takes millions from fossil fuel companies, so of course he thinks the Green New Deal is unfeasible. Well, I think it’s mandatory. His “Clean Future Act” is corporate socialism–Americans would pay the price to build fossil fuel pipelines, until 2050. This is failed leadership and it’s 20 years too late. I’ve been waiting for real, meaningful change my whole life. The time is now.

I hope you join our campaign! We’ve raised about $25,000 from an average donation of $26, and we’re seeing our lowest numbers these past few weeks. So I really need your help!

I have about 15k worth of debt between my wife and I mostly on credit cards around 20% interest.  My credit is pretty good. Around 780.  We make pretty good money but I feel like the debt is really holding us back from moving forward from living paycheck to paycheck. 

2 questions.  With everything going on, would one expect personal loan rates to go up or down in the next 3,6,12 months?  Second, I got a quote from lending club and it was a little higher than I was hoping for at 13%/ 15.39apr.  given my almost 800 score I was expecting something a little lower. I'd really like no origination fee unless that means I automatically pay a higher interest rate? 

Any advice would be great!

investing,SP500 Futures Volume increases 350x Compared to Last Month. Thoughts?,"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history?p=ES%3DF

Looking at the link above, scroll all the way right to the volumes column. You can see that average volume on SP e-mini futures increased from around 3m per day to over a BILLION.

personalfinance,"As an expat, will foreign earned income change my adjusted gross income (AGI), affecting my IBR status/payment on my student loans?","So as the title says, I'm an american and have been living and working abroad for the past 2 years. My federal student loans are currently on the interest based repayment plan, which I had set up before I came to europe to study for a masters degree (which was nearly free here btw). Being that I had no income in the US and no income here as a student during this time, my AGI was 0, making my monthly payments $0 as well.

My concern/question now, is that now that I've been working here full time for the last 2 calendar years (2018 and 2019; I also worked the last 3 months in 2017, but the total income accrued during this time doesn't require me to file a tax return at all for that year),I was thinking of finally filing taxes (I know, I didn't do it for last year when I was supposed to, but I will do this retrospectively now).

According to the IRS website, I do qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion (FEIE) for both years. My question is, after filing taxes for both 2018/2019 with the FEIE (form 2555), will this offset my current AGI of 0? This would essentially mean I would have to start paying something for my IBR payment plan, which wouldn't be so easy for me, being that my income is not that high, and am already paying back private loans.",finance

stocks,Here is what we are staring in the face right now....,"I made the below post as a reply in one of the threads and i got replies asking to make a separate thread to have discussion. So here it is....

Here's what we're staring in the face right now......

SP500 companys have been in an earnings contraction for 7 quarters YoY now.

PMI indicators (and many others) have been in a downward trend since 2018

GDP growth has been in a downward trend since late 2018, that's when the market disconnected from the ""real economy""

Bond markets all over the world began approaching crisis levels long before the virus default rates and debt higher than in 2007

Record Govt/Corporate/Consumer Debt....levels higher than 2007-8....with defaults rising.

7 Million Americans are 90+ day behind on the automobile payments (Auto Loan Bubble) This is PRIOR to the mandatory global lockdowns.

Federal Reserve has ""pumped"" 40-100B \*DAILY\* this year into the financial markets thru REPO operations to keep this bubble propped up.....and Powell sat before congress two weeks ago and basically told them he was ""running out of bullets"" to keep this thing propped up. Today they pumped the highest all year 169Billion, yesterday 83B 3 day totol before that 330Billion (This is before they upped it to a Trillion a day recently during the meltdown)

25% of US GDP is govt spending (ie 1.1 trillion in debt), (Again, this prior to the Feb/March meltdown, and now we have a 2trillion ""stimulus"" package)

Corporate Debt now makes up 47% of our GDP.and deliquincies are rising ...it's why the bond market is in crisis. BBB's should rated ""junk"" at this point, and the smart money knows it. (Since the meltdown began, Credit Default Swaps have skyrocketed globally, smart money is betting on it to collapse at this point)

Consumer Debt now sits at 14 Trillion (it was 13 Trillion in 2007-8)...and defaults are rising

OIl/Nat Gas sector 600B-1T in debt (most of it subprime) and on the verge of collapse, they need oil at 70barrel to ""break even"", oils at 31barrel....layoffs began about 2 months ago, Halliburton, Apache oil, etc etc Only 10% of the sector is ""cash positive"", and only 5 shale co's can break even at 31barrel. This will affect slaughter regional banks when this pops, which is why the bailouts are inbound......JP Morgan holds something like 196B worth of ""subprime"" loans in the energy sector.

A 1.5 QUADRILLION dollar atomic bomb in the derivatives market...

Baltic Dry Index in crisis since September of last year.

Copper has been in a downward trend since Dec 2017

14 Straight months of contraction in the Shipping/Freight/Transportation sector....with more than 450 Trucking companies closing shop or filing bankruptcy in 2019

Here's some perspective. US Real GDP growth hasn't seen 3%+ since 2005 (even with bailouts and QE1-2-3-4), during the Great Depression of the 1930's, the US saw 5 years of 3%+ Real GDP growth....I keep hearing how strong the economy is....it's so strong we needed 3 rate cuts in 2019, $600B of QE4 since last October, Trillions injected into Financial Markets monthly through REPO operations since last October, emergency 50bp cut, aiming for negative rates like Europe/Japan, now a stimulus package, probably a bailout, and a payroll tax cut....got it.

The Virus is just the pin that popped the bubble......and the dominoes are now starting to fall...several were already falling prior to the virus

219 CEO's from the SP500 Co's cashed out and split in 2019...saw the writing on the wall. Those numbers haven't been seen since.....yep 2007-8.

On the bright side, at least we can take comfort in the fact that all these low interest rates have allowed corporations to prepare for a potential crisis and reduce their debt holdings instead of just adding more debt and blowing tax cut benefits on a bunch of buybacks at historic valuations.

Oh, wait.....

Business cycles matter...at this point in the business cycle, these companies should have their debt at extreme lows, and cash at extreme highs to be prepared for the economic downturn......oooops....they're not....this is going to be a bloodbath before it's all said and done......and I see a hard reset.....just one mans opinion, but if you peel back the onion with everything I've said, you'll find it to be truth.

I will post my thoughts on the virus in another thread.

investing,Where was the rampant hyperinflation post-2008?,"I'm seeing a lot of posts from Redditors who have insider knowledge of the upcoming hyperinflation.

**Some facts:**

* Post-2008, the Fed balance sheet quadrupled from $1 to $4.5 trillion. To get the same magnitude that $4.5 trillion will have to increase to $18 trillion. We're currently close to $6 trillion.
* Post-2008 inflation peaked at 3.87% (Sep 2011). Not quite hyperinflation, but close!
* QE didn't end after 2011. Fed balance sheet increased from $2.8 to $4.5 trillion by 2014.
* Unemployment fell to a 50 year low to 3.6% (Apr 2019)
* The US-China trade war had a negligible effect on inflation. The US imposed 15% tariffs on about $112 billion of Chinese imports - that equates to over 2/3 of consumer goods imported from China.

**But CPI doesn't account for REAL inflation!!!**

Inflation is a specific term. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods/services in an economy over time. Inflation means your USD purchasing power is reduced. Note: this has nothing to do with asset price increasing.

**But this time is different!!!**

Redditors like to bring up 1920s Germany. A war-torn country struggling to repay its debts. Meanwhile US bond yields are almost negative and at a record low, worldwide investors see the US treasury as a safe haven and the USD remains the world reserve currency.

**But Fed promised unlimited QE!!!**

The Fed's main aims are to avoid deflation, maintain liquidity in the financial system and to maintain investor confidence. It really surprises me that despite the huge risk of deflation during a recession, Redditors are instead scared of the complete opposite!

Why is deflation bad? 1) consumers avoid purchasing today to buy at a later date at a lower price 2) firms avoid investing today as the real cost of debt increases. Later when the economy is recovering and there is risk of higher inflation, the Fed will reduce their balance sheet. From 2017-2019, their balance sheet decreased from $4.5 to $3.7 trillion.",finance

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York bought $55 Billion worth of Treasury Coupons today.  With the unlimited QE from the Feds, SPY can continue to be propped up, and as a result, the majority of stocks will follow. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fwrpwf/april_7_market_analysis_canadian_names_edition/) is my analysis from yesterday. Despite some big jumps, most names traded sideways.  Analysis of day below, starting with my trades/positions.

**Air Canada** - There is an [Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/PZYRh1To/) playing out on Air Canada.  As the 4 hour is outside of the BB and we are coming up on resistance, I got puts for next week.  $21 PUT, $2.65 premium, expiring next Friday. I bought when price was $18.65 at around 1:15pm. These are generally bullish patterns but tend to see a rejection to create the right shoulder.  $19.26 is the resistance.  If we test tomorrow I will probably transfer money from WEED put over and double down on this play.  After bouncing x% today and 40% over past four days, I feel good about these (pending any surprise bailout). The puts were already looking great as the price pulled back to $18.30 but then SPY ran for 2 hours into EOD and AC bounced to HOD with it.

**Canopy** - I mentioned low volume on this names ties it to SPY.  Well Fed pump in SPY equates to similar gains.  Up 3%.  Short term this stock is just going with SPY.  Probably going to eat a loss on these puts.  Still think both SPY and Canopy are due for pullback but tough to guess timing right now.

**Energy Names, Gold Miners &amp; Banks** - I did make a quick scalp.  Oil, SPY and most names started bouncing so I entered Teck.B as it was a laggard.  I got a quick flip from $11.41 to $11.448 for about $116.  My goal as a trader is to do $200 a day on average because that is $1000 a week so $52,000 a year trading would be my ideal.   Otherwise not much to say, the majority of names were up 1%-3%.  Basically a sideways nothing day.  I’ll look for short term flips but otherwise I’ll wait to see which way they break.  OPEC meeting tomorrow so could have effect on broader markets.

**Bombardier** - double topped at high of yesterday of $0.49 and ended at $0.475.  If it tests and rejects again tomorrow, I would expect a 5% pullback minimum.

**Blackberry** - after they lowered their forecast I tend to not catch a falling knife, let it bottom, bounce, and then just play range.  It dropped from $6.03 to $4.40 on lowered forecast.  It has since then bounced to $5.45.  FIB retracement shows $5.48 as 62% FIB retracement bounce.  I’m of the same mindset it won’t just bounce straight through and break resistance.  $5.70 is about 78% retracement so if we do break $5.48, my guess would be a rejection of $5.70 and a pullback (if we even make it that far).

Any other names you want me to look at from a chart perspective, let me know.",finance
personalfinance,INFORMATION ON THE 600$ FEDERALLY BACKED WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT! ILLINOIS BASED BUT APPLIES TO MANY STATES.,[removed],finance
Bitcoin,Unpreparedness is the inability to save. A forced inability to save is slavery and condemnation.,"The degree to which individuals and society are ill-prepared for unexpected events is a testament to the understanding and value of saving.

In the modern financial era post-1900s, there has been a campaign against saving. So-called ""economists"" believed that saving causes money to sit ""unused"" and claim that this damages everyone's wealth. Truth is that these pseudo-economists were mostly businessmen, who were trying to figure out how to make more money for their own businesses. They need consumers to spend, spend, and spend. So that they can become rich.

Unfortunately, they found a way to force people to spend, and that is by constantly destroying the value of people's money. With the creation of the federal reserve, they had the infinite power to force people to spend. This is because, ""a penny saved, is a half-a-penny earned, and 1%-of-a-penny earned a few decades later"". Saving money became stupid due to these greedy businessmen acting as ""economists"".

We know this, but as saving money fell out of popularity, so did planning. Because the safety net of efficient saving has been replaced by the inefficient safety net of insurance, or no safety net at all. Insurance creates no wealth, adds no value, and simply acts to distribute to mitigate disaster by redistribution. It may be more helpful than no insurance at all, but insurance is a nasty and necessary middle-man when society cannot save.

Saving and planning are not feasible in this environment. Hospitals saving money for a rainy day makes no sense, when the money is worth 1% of what it was, decades later. Individuals can't do it either, with their savings rates at all-time lows. People live paycheck-to-paycheck, being swindled of their value as every second of every day passes. Forever enslaved.

Inability to save, is a form of slavery, as you are forced to work because nothing you earn will retain it's value. People are even FORCED to put money into the stock market, just to keep up with inflation. This is, again, extremely ideal for the greedy businessmen acting as ""economists"". They own these companies. They want people to buy stocks. In fact, ""401k"" has become a thing. A disgusting part of retirement planning, that only further makes them richer at the risk and expense of workers. When a 401k crashes, the businessmen laugh all the way to the bank, while blaming ""the market"". Meanwhile, the poor worker suffers.

As we see now, in the U.S. in particular, but around the world, people with a lack of savings due to these economic policies being starved, crushed by a global pandemic, it's more clear now than ever that a system that doesn't allow human beings to save for their future or save for disaster, creates an extremely fragile system. There was no ""coronavirus insurance policy"" everyone signed up for. If we simply HAD SAVINGS we could use our own cash as our insurance policy. The reality is, there are far more disasters possible in life, than any insurance will ever want to cover, or if they did, they would rob us blind in insurance payments, then deny our claims in court. This isn't safety. This is exploitation.

Savings is the absolute most flexible insurance policy possible. With savings, you can survive disaster.

We're feeling it now, and perhaps, this is our greatest opportunity to say: Make Savings Great Again.

Bitcoin,"If you buy into the political bent of bitcoin, aren’t you rejecting fractional banking and our whole system of money? Is bitcoin really better?","Maybe I just view bitcoin differently but I hear a lot of people that are obsessed with the idea that bitcoin is going to become the major world currency. However, to me, it seems that the growth of bitcoin in circulation is too slow to support the lending that is needed to support economic growth. Especially in the age of technology disruption, you need a system that can promote debt creation. That system has been fractional reserve banking and I believe it has done quite well. Why is bitcoin a better alternative? 

Also, a lot of people buy into the idea that the Fed, through its QE and other practices, can destabilize the currency. While certainly they can, even when currencies were linked to gold, you saw a lot of periods of destabilization. 

So why is bitcoin going to save the world? Personally, I don’t see the fiat money going away. Best case, bitcoin becomes like gold and is considered a flight to safety.

investing,Investing in Europe vs US during the Corona crisis: Opinions?,"I've been reading plenty of opinions on the current and future investment situation in this sub.

I wonder what this sub thinks about CoVid-specific investment opportunities and risks in Europe as a whole or specific European countries. I think this question is justified because plenty of US parameters discussed on this Sub do not apply to Europe as a whole/Europe's sovereign countries.

I'm usually only scheduled a few days a week at my coffee shop since I work mornings there and then every night at fedex before it became slow. I'm part time at fedex which in the ""contract"" states that I work around 25 hours a week, but I've only been getting near 10. Even the full time employees are having their hours cut and I wanted to know what the best way to go about filing for supplemental income in Colorado, would be. Is there a loophole where my employers can try to say that my hours aren't technically reduced but just smaller due to my part time roles? Do they have any role in whether I get approved or what can I expect as I try to do this?

personalfinance,Credit Karma error checking is terrible,"Edit: I just noticed I didn't put Tax Return in the title. Credit Karma's Tax Return is what I'm discussing. 

So ultimately I made the error, dropped a digit in the box 1 (say 50000 to 5000, not that obviously, just notional numbers) so we got a fat return we weren't owed. I know, I should have noticed but the Credit Karma site ran it's little checks, and I thought ""Great!"" A few variables made it the perfect storm for me - tax reform year and my wife went back to work (I told her to claim zero deductions to be sure we didn't underpay) so when our federal return went up about 30% the amount didn't shock me. Then, combine that with the fact that once you are past the W-2 page you are never shown these numbers again. Therefore, if you screw up like me and you trust the software, you're toast.

I only noticed today when I was filling out FAFSA paperwork and looking at my old return documents.

Again, my mistake, but this is still some really terrible tax software. What kills me is that every other field in the W2 was correct, so say the Social security wages (Box 3) was 50k, nearly 10x the Wages, tips, and other income (Box 1). How could the error check in the return software miss that? Dropping a digit can't be that rare of a typo and the coding logic would be pretty simple, so what was the error check even doing?

Also, I contacted support and there are not even any agents to verify info and look over for an amended return with a huge problem like this. Zero actual support. Not a shocker but it does add to the frustration.

I've read this forum before and I know, folks are very likely to remind me vehemently that this is my own fault, but still, I'd like to vent and I think it's important to get the word out that you need to be very careful entering your W-2s into Credit Karma's free tax returns. Our income dropped right around the time of the return in January so it's long gone and this is coming out of what is left of our emergency savings.",finance

Not sure how to format this the best way but here goes - looking for advice on where money should be prioritized:

**Savings:**

* 20K in a high yield saving account
* 8K in a regular account

**Checking:**

* 2K in a checking

**Job:**

* Work online tutoring + full time medical student
* Made 12K last year (self employed - minimal expenses) - projecting closer to 7K this year

**School &amp; Debt:**

* No CC debt, No undergrad debt, in medical school 2nd year
* I am worked extremely hard to apply to as many scholarships as I could and was gifted a decent amount of scholarship money, so for 4 years of pursuing an M.D, I'm looking at a principal balance of aprroximately 70K on 6.6% federal unsubsidized student loan.
   * First year was 43K (out of state tuition)
   * 2-4th year is 8K (in state + new scholarship)

**Investments:**

* 5K in ROTH IRA (contrib in 2018)
* I didn't contribute more to this this year - though I probably could

**Spending:**

* I live off campus, and only pay for $40/month for internet and about $15 in other subscriptions. My rent and electricity are paid. School covers insurance.
* I'm working hard on cutting my spending because I spend too much eating out, airfare going back home, helping sister out, and other materialistic things.
* Average credit card bill for one month \~ $800

**My thoughts and concerns:**

* I feel secure with my emergency fund at 28K
   * *is this too much? should i take some of this money and contribute to my ROTH?*
* After medical school residency will be around 55k/year, and I'm planning a maximum 4 year residency after which as an attending I will be making anywhere from 200-300K.
   * *Given how much I will end up making later on, is it worth it to work on paying my loans now while I still am in school?*
   * I'm unsure whether I will go into underserved health care and if I do most hospitals have programs that will wipe out debt for new physicians, I'm just thinking its not wise for me to start paying off my debt now when I'm still in school and working a side job if down the road I can get my debt forgiven as a primary care physician.
* My credit card bill is too high at $800 and I'm trying to cut down spending so that I can have more left over from my side hustle, what should I do with this extra money?
   * *pay off debt? keep save? invest? something else?*

**TLDR:**  Have 28K saved, will have 70K medical school debt but will be working as an MD making 200K, work 8K/year, not sure if i should pay my loan first and cut down my spending and live more frugally, or just spend what I have &amp; invest and just make sure not to gather more debt.

\- I am eligible for the Federal Electric Motor Vehicle Tax Incentive ( $1,875 ) (No state tax incentives)

\- My Company requires us to obtain a certificate through Kelly School of business which means I'm enrolled in one online class per Trimester (Started Nov 2019)

\- I live in an apartment and pay rent

personalfinance,Need help with several mortgage and mortgage closing questions on an offer I made with a VA loan.,"I need help and I am not sure who to turn to as I get very close to closing on an offer I made on a house.

I am a first time home buyer, with a pretty steady job, who has been looking to get a place since January, and made an offer in mid-march. I received the loan estimate today and I am very confused.

On my loan estimate it is several thousand dollars higher than previous estimates for closing costs. My mortgage broker said they have had to change the company doing the loan, which is I guess where the change came from. However, the amount of money the estimate says I need to bring to the table does not match the cash to and from borrower amount on the Form 1003.

Also, on the form 1003, there is a entry h. Discount (if Borrower will pay) that is a negative number, and it is decreasing the amount of the total costs. However, my loan estimate has me buying down the interest rate. 

My questions are:

Is it common to have h. on the form 1003 be a negative number? Is this a typo (I've noticed two others) or is it something else? It was as if a magic number should up to get closing costs down somewhat.

Is it possible to get money back for closing with a discount but then in a different section turn around and decrease the interest rate by buying points that bring the rate down to what it was originally? I am being charged nearly a point in the loan estimate closing costs.

This is a VA 30-fixed mortgage, so I don't know if they are trying some kind of accounting trick to get around VA limits. Also they gave me three loans on the paper work they sent me but I guess all of them have me buying down the rate. The paper work certainly doesn't have the loans with no points on them, and two of the loans have the exact same information on it. 

The closing costs on my loan estimate are about 6.8% not counting the VA's 2.3% funding fee. (this includes prepaids, title stuff origination charges and escrow). Is that high for a VA loan?

On the form 1003, if the negative number is correct, it looks like the closing costs are 5.8% not counting the VA funding fee. It is higher than my last estimate but I could maybe swing that. If they are wrong then it's more like 7.9% not counting the VA funding fee, and it is much higher than the original estimate and I don't think I can put together that much cash before closing.

There are six categories on my loan estimate. The homeowners insure estimate for prepaids seems way low. Is there a specific way they should estimate this? The title services seem extremely high. They are like 1.3% of the closing costs. It says I can shop for these, how do I even start with that?

I feel like my mortgage broker and his out of state support staff are not very helpful. However, I screwed myself, because I went with the broker my realtor suggested, instead of somebody independent. Worse, my realtor is also the manager for the apartment I rent from. I realize now that was a mistake. 

The rate doesn't seem too bad (but it is slightly above the rate listed on Bankrate's 30-Year VA rate page). 

I have decent credit, but not too much cash. I was trying to stop renting, but now I have signed an offer, I feel like my mortgage broker is barely contacting me, has not sought any input, and is basically just inputting numbers that are thousands of dollars higher than what I originally discussed.

What are your thoughts and advice? Sorry this is so long. I just feel like this is going south, not even counting the economic implosion happening as well, which is also keeping me up at night.",finance
business,Dilemma: PPP vs. Unemployment (x-post from /r/smallbusiness),"I have a friend who owns a salon shuttered by Covid19. I'm helping her run some numbers, and it looks like half of her employees will actually be **worse off** if she takes PPP money. Is my math correct? If so, what's the best approach to dealing with this?

She has 15 staff. The salon is completely shut down and everybody was furloughed.

About half of her staff made $15/hour and work full-time. So she paid them $600/week. On unemployment, they now make $288/week from New York, plus $600/week in federal relief. So they are making about $288/week **more** on unemployment than they were while working full-time.

The other half of her staff made higher wages. These staff are making between $200 and $300 per week **less** on unemployment than they were making before the salon was shuttered.

If she uses a PPP loan to pay these folks as employees, the $15/hour employees will be worse off. But the higher wage employees will be better off. If she turns down PPP money, her lower-wage staff will be better off, but her higher-wage staff will be worse off.

Of course, if she takes the PPP money she can use part of that for rent and utilities. So it is in her personal interest to take the PPP money - so long as she can maintain her staffing level and keep it forgivable. But what if some of the low-wage staff refuse her offer to return to her payroll? Will she lose forgiveness?

Is anybody else seeing this same conundrum with your employees?",finance

personalfinance,"Question Regarding Federal Student Loan Payments (Should I Pay Small Accounts in Full, Or Keep Them to Boost My Total Number of On-Time Payments?)","Hello everyone,

I'm in my upper 20's and earn roughly 60k a year. I want to buy a house but I have a rough credit history. I've had a few collections accounts and thanks to missing six months of student loan payments, I have 60 missed payments on my credit history. If you have federal loans, you know your monthly payment goes to many different loans, so missing that one monthly payment means you've actually missed a bunch of payments. This is what happened to me. These missed payments are from 2017 and 2018, since then I've made all my payments on time and will continue to do so. I've also paid off my collections accounts this year so there's no collections accounts on my credit history anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to buy a house, but my credit score is stuck in the 550 range. Those 60 missed payments have really hurt my credit score, with Credit Karma reporting that I've made 79% of my payments on time. My question is, how should I move forward with paying my student loans?

&amp;#x200B;

In total, I owe about 25k which isn't an astronomical amount. It's 10 total accounts, and many of them are small amounts of $500-$1000. I can easily knock those off in full, one by one, and be down to just 3-4 of the larger accounts by the end of the summer. However, I'm wondering if it's better to keep those small accounts and continue to pay the minimum on them, since I want to raise the % of on-time payments I've made? Please tell me if this sounds stupid, I'm no finance whiz, but if I my credit score relies on the **percentage** of on-time payments, and I have 60 missed payments on my account, should I be keeping those accounts active since I want to offset those 60 missed payments with as many on-time payments as possible? Would I actually be slowing the rate by which my credit score goes back up if I quickly pay off those smaller loans, since it means less on-time payments in the future? Starting in the fall I'd only consistently be making 4 on-time loan payments each month instead of 10, which may take longer to offset those 60 I missed two-three years ago? Or would my score go up because I've paid off those accounts in full and have less total active accounts?

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully that makes sense to everyone. The goal is to get my score over 600 by the end of this year and maybe even 700 by the end of the following year. Not sure how realistic that is with the 60 missed payments on my account but I'm doing my best. Thanks for the help!!",finance

Use Tax is pretty much the last item in the tax software and appears to only be affecting the tax payment/refund, leaving any credit carryovers unaffected; however, I know that tax software often uses last years State information to prepare the next year's Federal return. Should I amend the 2018 return before submitting my 2019 return?
2. Will the taxes paid need to be reported on my 2020 tax return? I vaguely remember tax software questions that ask about payments made in the current tax year.

Also gonna be a little long I’m trying to get as much info as possible, I have no help outside this sub so thank you!! 

When I was 19 (now 21), I didn’t have a car and after my 3rd car broke down I was so over it I decided I was gonna buy as new of a car I could “afford”. I went to a local used car dealership and found a car I really liked. I know NOW that I definitely should have looked at other places, etc. but at the time I was desperate (I’m also doing all this alone I dint have any close family to help). I talked to the salesman and I ended up getting the car, and since I was 19 at the time I didn’t have very good credit and I didn’t have very much saved up to put a hefty down payment on a car. I told the salesman I really didn’t want to go over $300 a month $350 at the max for a car payment. At the time I didn’t realized it but he really didn’t treat me with 100% respect I’m guessing because I’m a female. Well he gave me my options (he said my only options) and the cheapest financing company I could go with I’d have to pay $381 for the car. *note: I only brought a $500 down payment and the car was 2017 with 50,000 Miles on it which now I know was a lot.* And the car after financing was over $17, 000! I felt so pressured I ended up going with that company but he said my problem was I needed to have at least a $1500 down payment. I told him all I had was $500 and he was like “you don’t have a credit card or anything?” And I did have one which is how I had a little credit and he again was like “ just use that!” And naive me really wanted the car that day so I did it. Fast forward until now, I’m stuck with a $380 car payment and STILL trying to pay off my credit card. 

I really want to refinance my car because the large payment is really the only thing that’s stopping me from moving out. My interest rate is so high (15.5) so hardly any of my payment is going towards to principle! And I still owe $16000 for it. 

I went to a local credit union who was promoting a special? They were having about refinancing your car and I talked to them, my credit score is ALOT better and they calculated my new payments would be $100 less and my new interest rate would be 3.4 % but the problem is I have “Negative equity” on the car so the only way I could refinance it would be to pay $2200 for the negative equity since they can only pay so much percentage for the car. I have the money to do it but it’s taken me so long to save the little I do I have I just don’t know what to do. 


I guess I’m asking if it would be a good idea to refinance it and just start my savings almost over or to just keep saving as much as I can and continue to pay the high interest rate for my car?

stocks,First Post on Reddit! I'm trying to make sense of the market and the world. Would love your feedback and thoughts.,"I'm trying to make sense of the world and market and would love your input and feedback. After extensive reach, I'd like to share what come to understand about the market and our current situation. Before diving in, I'd like to set some baseline facts about the stock market:

1. Computers and math control the market, not people.
2. There are complex algorithms which calculates the stock price and take many factors into consideration such as economic, social, political, business, etc. facts.
3. Stocks are forward looking calculations calculating variables tied to interconnect events. A simple example... layoffs increases unemployment numbers and reduces consumer spending. This going into some formula: x + y \* z = stock price (grossly simplified, but you get the idea).

What's unique about our current situation is that, I believe, our government gamed the system and effectively decoupled the stock market from current events via unlimited QE, a drop in interest rates and the stimulus package. A long technical read, but here is a research paper that explains the relationship between unemployment numbers, interest rates, bond rates, and stock: [https://www.nber.org/papers/w8092.pdf](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8092.pdf)

TL;DR for this paper: low interest rates and high unemployment in a growing economy makes stocks go up.

Given the fact that we were already were in a large expansion cycle, by feeding the computers low interest rates, when unemployment numbers came out, the machines are trading as if our economy entered a short recession and then jumped straight back into an expansion cycle right after the drop. Smart move, because now the stock market thinks we are in another expansion given low interest rates and high unemployment. Additionally, unlimited QE allows the government to control the interest rates and set them at a limit to allow the computers to believe that we are still in an expansion period.

In short, the stock market has already priced in the current reality, is trading as if we are in a new expansion cycle, will only act on news that deviates from the current variables and reality it's trading in.

Extreme volatility will begin when corporate outlook and financial forecasts are announced in Q2 for Q1, Q2 earnings release in Q3, and GDP announcements in September covering Q2 ([https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule/full](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule/full)) does not match up with calculated signals that we are in an expansion. Additionally, now that people can take money out of their 401(k)'s, more stock sell off will ensue. Factors that will impact all this include:  


1. Length of time Coronavirus will be in the media and, once calmed, when it will resurface
2. Length of time until people go to physical stores
3. How much people will have until unemployment goes back down

Coronavirus was the trigger that threw off all existing calculation assumptions and at this point and with much of the calculations redone, the main unknown variable is time which will ultimately impact all the announcements.

The next stimulus package could continually game the system, but the government kinda jumped the gun and has already thrown the kitchen sink at the market. What will they do? Who knows? 

TL:DR - We were in a long bull run, COVID-19 created FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in the world, that triggered a massive domino effect on the economy. Government proactively gamed the system by feeding the right numbers into the computer. Now the stock market is operating in a completely disconnected reality (bull run in a bear economy).

personalfinance,Student Line of credit - Canada.,"I currently have about ~14K of credit card debt and ~10K if student debt at the moment. I’ve managed to get my finances together this year and have made good payments and consistent payments on a previous history of no payments. With my recent tax return I have he ability to I think make a better situation. 

Credit card 1 = 1,400 @ 19.99%
Credit card 2 = 3,200  @ 19.99%
Credit card 3 =‘9,900 @ 21.99% 

With my most recent tax return I’ll be receiving about 3.4K. As well this month I just received a full time employment contract. While still being a student can I apply for a student line of credit. 

MY PLAN: Consolidated my credit cards to the  interest rate of ~ 5 - 7% and the bank will take in consideration my liquid cash in bank and full time employment. Although the one thing carrying me down is a low credit score. I believe around 600-650. 

What is you option in what I should do. Will I be able to get it?",finance

personalfinance,FIRE 32 y/o First Time Investor Portfolio Review,"First time investor here; read Millionaire Teacher by Andrew Hallam a few months ago and it changed my life.  I’ve always been in demanding salary jobs and I’m looking to reclaim time in my life.  I’m in my early 30’s with zero baggage and I’m looking to potentially retire before 40 by moving to a much lower cost of living location somewhere in the world and travel around, plus take on a lower paying lower stress job just as supplemental income only.  Also looking to get into out of state real estate for additional passive income.  I’m not planning on kids, or settling down in one area.  I need freedom.  This virus is the perfect time to invest but I need a little guidance; no one in my network invests.

&amp;#x200B;

New annual Contributions

$5K annually invested Betterment 401k (Zero employer match)

$0 IRA/Roth IRA

Questions:

1. For the Fidelity 401K, it seems to make sense to dump the FBGRX, and purchase a zero/low cost passive mutual fund to save .8% fees.  How about FNILX (Fidelity ZEROSM Large Cap Index Fund)?  Any suggestions for a bond fund that would complement this for the 401K?  Does it make sense to sell it all off and then buy in now?  
2. Does it make sense to annually max out my 401K given my retirement goals?  I’d like to be able to pull money only if it’s absolutely needed but there’s still a chance it could happen.  The penalties seem high for early withdrawal.
3. I’m stuck on choosing between ETFs and passive mutual funds, and it’s really holding me back from diving in.  I will buy and hold for several years, but it seems like the tax efficiency of ETFs may be worth it especially if they do dividend reinvestment.  Both Betterment and Wealthfront both use ETFs.  Does Fidelity offer dividend reinvestment plans on ETFs?  
4. Can you give me feedback on the proposed allocation and funds for the taxable account.  I listed out options for either ETF for MF depending on which is more advantageous:
   1. 40% US S&amp;P500 fund: 
      1. Mutual fund opton: FNILX (FIDELITY ZERO LARGE CAP INDEX; 0%); FXAIX (Fidelity® 500 Index Fund; .015%)
      2. ETF option: VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF; .03%) including many other similar ones
   2. 20% mid and small cap US fund
      1. Mutual fund opton:FZIPX (Fidelity ZEROSM Extended Market Index Fund; 0%), FSMAX (Fidelity® Extended Market Index Fund; 0.045%) 
      2. ETF option: VO (VANGUARD MID CAP ETF; .04%); maybe others
   3. 20% US bonds: 
      1. Mutual fund opton: FMBIX (Fidelity® Municipal Bond Index Fund; .07%), FLTMX (Fidelity® Intermediate Municipal Income Fund; .35%), FMNDX (Fidelity® Conservative Income Municipal Bond Fund - Institutional Class; .25%), FCRDX (Fidelity® Conservative Income Municipal Bond Fund; .35%)
      2. ETF option: any recommendations?
   4. 15% international stocks
      1. Mutual fund opton: FZILX (Fidelity ZEROSM International Index Fund; 0%), FSPSX (Fidelity® International Index Fund; .035%), FSGGX (Fidelity® Global ex U.S. Index Fund; .056%), FTIHX (Fidelity® Total International Index Fund; .06%)
      2. ETF option: any recommendations?  
   5. 5% domestic REIT: should I even do this?  If not, I will use this for individual funds
      1. Mutual fund opton: recommendation?
      2. ETF option: recommendation?

personalfinance,Random Returned Check Fee?,"(Too Long, Didn't Read Below) Hey everybody, the other day I checked my bank account and noticed a ""Returned Check Fee"" of about $31. Weird thing is, I have written one bad check in my life and that was back in January. In January I was given the normal fee and fixed the situation on my end and re-sent a good check. Since then, I have not written a single check, nor have I received a bad one. In that time I have only received one check, and I was paid over the course of the next 2-3 days and I definitely received all of the money. This was end of February - early March. As it stands, my current account is definitely low on funds (College student, whole pandemic goin on, I'm broke to say the least lmao) Not sure if this is something I should investigate in terms of calling them up, my check book is also safe and sound so no theft has occurred to my knowledge.

Either way I keep putting off calling since I do help my dad at work and have very little time, the fee occurred nearly one week ago and I tried googling it and found nothing. Any advice is greatly appreciated, I am sorry if this is a dumb question haha.

TL;DR: I haven't sent or received a check in over a month, only one bad check ever back in January, received a fee for that check already. Received a ""Returned Check Fee"" a week ago with no checks received or sent, very confused. Thanks!

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday’s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank’s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street’s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday’s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.

*****

&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It’s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.

*****

&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won’t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on “Squawk Box,” the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world’s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That’s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state’s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday’s news conference the outbreak could “stabilize” within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.

*****

&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That’s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.

US Jobless claims has another record week, 6.6 million new jobless from last week. Continues jobless claims now at 7.5 million, the highest number in history.
At the same time the FED announced over 2.3 trillion dollars of main street lending to boost the economy, another unprecedented move.
Economic data from Europe was positive, at least for February, as Exports, Industrial production and Manufacturing were positive, higher than expectations. This is good news for Q1 GDP, since March will be highly affected from the outbreak.
Markets around the World are neutral to positive. Asian markets were slightly higher with China up 0.5%, South Korea up 1.5%, while Japan was neutral.
Europe is still trading at this time, 8 30 AM ET, and all markets are in the green from 0-1%. The British FTSE is leading the way, up 1.0%.
US futures were all over the place, up over 1.5% during the night, than down 1% before the unemployment news and now back in positive territory. After the FED announcement at 8 35AT ET they are +0.5%.
Oil is up again during the night, trading around 25.80$, up 3.5%. All eyes will be on the OPEC meeting today on the possible 10 million barrel production cut.

For today’s trade, if you did not get in yesterday, oil is still a great way to make money. It jumped 2$ just in the last 12 hours and it will go up even more. Oil under 35$ is not sustainable for most US producers and oil under 50$ is horrible for Russia and Saudi Arabia who’s budgets deeply relay on oil money for their economies to function.
As for stocks, I will be waiting for the afternoon avoiding the early morning trading. The last hour will be good for Buying and making a quick profits since a lot of short sellers will cover their positions. With the outbreak stabilizing and the FED and Government pumping enormous amounts of money in the economy will drive the market upward and many short sellers today will be wondering whether to cut their losses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth “sharply negative” in 2020, triggering the worst fallout since the 1930s Great Depression, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a far bleaker picture of the social and economic impact of the new coronavirus than even a few weeks ago, noting governments had already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $8 trillion, but more would likely be needed.

She said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would then need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid.

“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,” she said on Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings.

“Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.”

If the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse.

“I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,” she said.

The IMF, which has 189 member countries, will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.

The novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December has raced around the globe, infecting 1.41 million people and killing 83,400, according to a Reuters tally.

Georgieva said the pandemic was hitting both rich and poor countries, but many in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at higher risk because they had weaker health systems. They were also unable to implement social distancing in their densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums.

She said investors had already removed some $100 billion in capital from those economies, more than three times the outflow seen during the same period of the global financial crisis.

With commodity prices down sharply, emerging market and developing countries would need trillions of dollars to fight the pandemic and rescue their economies, she said.

“They urgently need help,” she said, estimating hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be pumped in from outside sources since those governments could only cover a portion of the costs on their own, and many already had high debts.

Georgieva said it was encouraging that all governments had sprung into action, enacting some $8 trillion in fiscal measures and massive monetary measures.

To ensure a future recovery, Georgieva called for continued efforts to contain the virus and support health systems, while averting export controls that could slow the flow of vital medical equipment and food.

“The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery,” she said.

It was critical to provide affected people and companies with “large, timely and targeted” measures such as wage subsidies, extended unemployment benefits and adjusted loan terms, while reducing stress to the financial system.

Coordinated fiscal stimulus was critical, and monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation remained low.

“Those with greater resources and policy space will need to do more; others, with limited resources will need more support,” she said.

The IMF was created for times like these, and stood ready to deploy its $1 trillion in lending capacity, Georgieva said.

The Fund’s executive board had approved doubling its emergency funding to $100 billion to meet the requests of over 90 countries, and staff were racing to process those requests.

The IMF was also looking at ways to provide additional liquidity support, including through creation of a new short-term liquidity line, and solutions that would allow lending even to countries whose debt was unsustainable, she said.

The IMF was also looking to increase its Catastrophe Relief and Containment Fund, which provides grants for the poorest countries to cover IMF debt service payments, to $1.4 billion from around $200 million, she said.

To further aid the poorest economies, the Fund and the World Bank were urging creditors such as China and other countries to temporarily stop collecting debt payments on their bilateral loans.",finance

personalfinance,Move for job to pay off student debt in one year?,"Hi PF - My first post on this sub. I have a hard decision I am desperately searching for some advice on for my wife and I. As I lay this out, we have two main considerations: 1) paying off our mountain of student debt, and 2) quality of life. Here goes...

My wife and I are originally from the Midwest. We moved to a major east coast metro for her medical school, knowing that it was the most expensive option. We paid for school all on loans, to the total tune of **$200,000 (federal) student loans**. I currently have a good job, bringing in just over $130,000 per year, **with full ability to work remotely full time**. The only thing we paid for with loans was tuition, all expenses including rent, etc. are covered by my salary. Of note, I feel like we can't adequately save as much as I would like, given the extreme cost of living. 

Here's where the decision is coming in: My wife has been offered two positions:

* Position 1: here in the major metro area, making about $140,000. Combined with my salary, we'd be looking at $270,000 per year in income, but would still have our very high cost of living (rent is $2.2k for a bad 1-bed, groceries more expense, etc.; I've run the numbers and really moving anywhere else/further away in the area is all a wash once factoring in additional costs we don't pay now) to contend with. Realistically, we would plan to devote her entire salary to loans and whatever from mine we can do, but we're looking at about 2.5 years of payback accounting for taxes.
* Position 2: back in the Midwest (albeit a different state), making $200,000. Combined with my salary (which would not change going full remote) we'd bring in about $330,000, coupled with a much lower cost of living. So, the opp cost of *not* going is $60k - and to boot, after taxes, we would be able to pay off the loans in less than a year, given her salary and the savings from a lower cost of living.

Purely numbers-wise, I know what the right decision to make is. I guess I am looking for some advice on the intangibles. For example, here in the major metro, we have a good group of friends and community (though, family is far away). We would be leaving all of that to start new. Fortunately, my best friend lives a couple hours from Position 2's location, so that could help dampen the blow. I am not super worried about making new friends (we're young, have no kids, getting a dog), but it's a consideration. 

On the flip side, the Midwest area simply isn't as nice as it is here in the major metro. (The Midwest area isn't tiny, though - it's still about 100k population so there's stuff to do.) *But*, going to the Midwest would give us the ability to live much less constrained by the monthly budget than we do here in the major metro.

If I had to assign priority, I'd say that paying off loans is my first goal. However, I do want to enjoy life, which is a close second. We are comfortable here in the major metro, and very well could be back in the Midwest, I guess it boils down to $60k being a good risk premium or not.

I do realize there's more to life than money, I am just having trouble deciding what the best move for us it. Personally, I think we are both indifferent - which leads me to believe the right decision is to move. After all, we can always move back to the major metro after a year (her field is super easy to switch jobs.) I like the idea of being able to pay off the loans and then just hoard cash for a bit - and if we decide to move back, great. I guess I just worry that I might regret leaving the major metro.

Any advice - whether purely numbers or also accounting for intangibles is welcome. TYIA!",finance
stocks,Do Not FOMO!,"Just as one would say that most of the negative news was baked in during the steep decline, the opposite is currently happening. Positive news of Covid slowdown, possibility of opening up, Feds printing more money and oil deal is becoming irrationally exuberant. The fact that no definitive treatment, no vaccination, terrible company earnings/guidance  and that business will not be able to turn a switch on and immediately and be back to pre-pandemic level will have this economy in a tailspin for may months to come. It may not get to March 23 lows but this rally is definitely getting long in the tooth. Good Luck to all.",finance
personalfinance,Should I have taxes taken out of unemployment?,"Unfortunately, I got temporarily laid off from my job because of COVID-19 but am expected to be rehired when this all settles down. Because of this, I am able to collect unemployment which turns out to be \~$900 a week which includes the $600 from the federal government. 

I got married in 2019 but haven't updated my W-4 yet and I was claiming ""single with 1 allowance"". My wife has not updated her W-4 yet either and she claims ""single with 0 allowances"". We filed our taxes married &amp; joint in 2019 and received about $2900 back (federal and state combined) largely in part to paying student loan interest. She is still working and is considered an essential worker so I am assuming she will continue to work throughout this pandemic.

I can opt to have my taxes taken out of my payments if I choose to but am worried that I might need the money later on. Because of this, my wife suggested that we open a separate savings account online and label it our ""escrow"" account. She thinks I should not have taxes taken out but instead transfer 20% of my unemployment each week to this new account. Then, we have the money if we need it throughout the crisis but if we don't, we will have the money set aside to pay a tax bill come next spring. 

Do you think this is a good idea? We do currently have an emergency fund set aside but it is not as large as we would like it to be. If you were in my shoes, which option would you choose? Thank you in advance!",finance

financialindependence,Forbes Article: Cashing Out Your 401k To Pat Off Your Mortgage Can Make You A Bundle,"I came across this article from an economics professor that basically goes into more detail on the topic I used in the title. I’m curious as to everyone’s feedback on this idea because it seems to combine the two things typically advised against the most: taking money from your 401k and paying off your mortgage. 

The author proposes using the latest 401k tax adjustments from the CARES Act that waives the 10% early withdrawal fee, but also claims it would be savvy even with the fee.

Do these rules continue to hold strong and this is a doubly bad idea or would unprecedented current events make you reconsider?

I thought this was relevant to FI because housing costs are typically the primary concern for many. If paying off a mortgage earlier rather than later allows you to focus on additional savings and financial independence, is it worth it? Especially if you plan to stay in the same house for the next 10+ years and have another 20 or more left in your career. Personally if our mortgage were $500 a month, we would have a lot of freedom to decide what comes next and not necessarily take the highest paying job. 

[Read the article here. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/08/given-current-rates-cashing-out-your-401k-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-can-make-you-a-bundle/#6ef7ed24b09b)

Under the act, loan limits have doubled from $50k or 50% of vested balance (whichever is lower) to $100,000 or 100% of your account balance (whichever is lower) total without the 10% early-withdrawal penalty. 

I am by no means an expert on how the CARES Act work, but there appears to be two kinds of applicable benefits in terms of your 401k:

1) Withdrawal - under the act, you don’t pay the 10% penalty normal to individuals under 59 1/2. Additionally if you replace the money within 3 years, you are able to recover the federal and state income taxes that apply to the withdrawal according to the American Retirement Association.

2) Loan - To qualify, the loan must be made within 180 days after the act was passed. The participant won’t owe income tax on the amount borrowed from the 401k if it’s paid back within 5 years according to the American Retirement Association.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Forbearance payback,"My wife and I both have about 10k in student loans. Our income currently is very stable and looks to be reliable through the crisis. I am exploring strategy with paying back loans based off of interest rate.

Here is my thoughts on it:

* Loan 1 -- 2500, 6.8% interest
* Loan 2 -- 4300, 4.2%
* Rest of loans(8 in total) are &lt;2k and less than 4.2% interest

My thoughts for the next 6 months is to throw the normal amount of payment we would make to the assortment of loans can be paid only to the 2 largest balance highest rate loans. At the end of the forbearance the 2 loans will be much lower and the interest that will start accruing again will be on a vastly lower total balance overall.

The new job is a significant salary increase (although I am staying in the 22% tax bracket), but obviously I am kind of nervous about being the newest person to my department, considering the current climate. It feels very risky to take my emergency fund and put it in a Roth, and since my plan is to start maxing out my Roth contributions from here on out (2020 onward), I am wondering if it will make a big difference in the future if I get another $6k in now, or if I should be more conservative considering that this will wipe out my emergency reserves in the short term. It will likely take me at least 3 months to rebuild my emergency fund.

My only debt is federal student loans that are currently in forbearance because of the CARES Act. My goal is to pay off this debt by mid-2021. I have a 401K that is not as robust as I'd like, although I had been contributing 16% of my salary for the past two years- I paused contributions beyond match at the end of 2019 to focus on paying off student loans.

I also don't have access to an HSA, but I will once I start my new job.

Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT- I saw from another post that the deadline to max out 2019 contributions is now July 15! That's good news for me, as now I can wait to decide. Even so, would love to hear what you all think about my general question - should I use an emergency fund to fund a Roth considering my retirement timeline? Thanks again.",finance

personalfinance,House refinance no brainer?,"Ok, so a bit about my situation. I've been in my house for 2 years. I'm a veteran with a VA home loan. About 10 months ago I did what's called a VA IRRRL interest rate reduction. This cost me a couple thousand dollars in VA fees and it reduced my rate from 5% to 3.75%. After all was said and done my mortgage went from $2900/mo to $2400/mo. Yes, I started the 30 years over again with fees tacked onto the principle but the rate reduction alone was a no brainer and the interest rate alone will save me more than the fees by a long shot.

Now to my current situation. I'm in a position to do the same thing again, this time my rate will reduce to 2.75%, it will cost me about $2000 in fees and I will start the 30 years over again. My mortgage will go from $2405 to $2135/mo and my total loan amount will basically be what it was a year ago. I think this is a no brainer but I can't think of all the possible ramifications of such a move. Seems to me that the rate reduction alone will be worth the fees and starting over given how new my mortgage is. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

investing,Wall Street firm dangled up to 175% returns to investors using U.S. aid programs,"A New York investment firm pitched wealthy investors in recent days on a way to make returns of 22% to 175% using U.S. government programs designed to help Americans keep their jobs and boost the coronavirus-stricken economy, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters.

Following questions posed by Reuters, Arcadia Investment Partners LLC, which has about $1 billion under management, said it had put its plans on hold.

The idea was in “formative stages” and the firm was not “presently moving forward with this strategy given reasons that include uncertainty surrounding the regulations,” Dahlia Loeb, managing director at Arcadia, told Reuters in an email on Wednesday. She did not elaborate further.

The firm had sent the pitch as recently as this weekend to “a limited number of sophisticated investors,” according to the marketing materials, which are dated April 4 and marked confidential. In an email sent Sunday, and seen by Reuters, Loeb wrote it was a “highly time sensitive opportunity” and had offered to discuss it with investors that day or early in the week.

Arcadia’s pitch offers a glimpse into how some private investors are looking to quickly take advantage of the unprecedented government intervention after the novel coronavirus brought economic activity to a screeching halt.

Under Arcadia’s plan, which has not been previously reported, the firm would have raised money to finance loans to small businesses guaranteed as part of a $2.2 trillion government aid package, the marketing materials show. It called the new vehicle the “Paycheck Protection Program Fund,” named after the government initiative for small businesses launched on April 3.

Arcadia proposed to juice profits by borrowing 90% to 95% of the money from funding markets that were backstopped in recent weeks by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

‘DESIGN FLAW’

The small business lending program has had a chaotic start, with banks and companies saying more crucial details need to be worked out. Under Arcadia’s plan, the actual loans would have been made by online lending platforms. Some such lenders said they are yet to be approved by the government to make the loans.

Had Arcadia proceeded with its plan, its investors would have profited handsomely from a virtually risk-free investment. Arcadia typically generates returns to investors of between 8% and 12%, depending on the type of investment, according to a March regulatory filing. The potential returns would also be far above other options available to investors. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note, for example, currently yields around 0.77%.

Lucian Bebchuk, a corporate governance expert at Harvard Law School who reviewed key assumptions of Arcadia’s pitch for Reuters, said that the potential returns, assuming they are estimated correctly, “suggests a design flaw on the part of the government’s program.”

A spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment, while a representative for the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.

In the past, large-scale government intervention has engendered fierce debates about whether they create perverse incentives and lead to unintended consequences.

ARCADIA’S PLAN

Founded by former Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette banker Kammy Moalemzadeh in 2001, Arcadia makes investments in areas such as private equity, real estate and distressed credit funds, according to its March regulatory filing. It said its investors include investment funds and wealthy people, including hedge fund managers and chief executives.

In the marketing document, the firm said it would work with an unidentified asset manager on the plan. That asset manager, which Arcadia said has $17 billion under management and was founded in 2012, has experience financing small business and consumer credit through online lending platforms, with more than $6 billion dedicated to that strategy.

If the small business borrowers use the money for employee payroll and other approved expenses, the U.S. Small Business Administration would forgive the 24-month loans in as little as three months, Arcadia wrote in the document. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1%.  The remaining loans will be repurchased within 24 months, according to the Arcadia materials.

In its document, Arcadia did not give the size of the anticipated fund. But it noted that investors would contribute 5% to 10% of the equity of the new fund. The rest would initially be borrowed from the repurchase agreement, or “repo” market, which the Fed has backstopped in recent weeks.

After three months, the fund would borrow from the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, another funding initiative launched last month to help the economy.

Investors in the Arcadia fund would pay no management fee but would be charged 20% of profits, the document shows.

I just wanted to provide my humble POV in the midst of all this chaos. Full disclosure: I am no expert of stock markets nor a chart reader but as the saying goes If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck...

So let's look at our current situation and ask yourselves this one question. Is it really probable and possible for the market to rebound within a few weeks without any repercussions after the entire world was shut down? Just think about that for a minute, the whole world's economy was essentially shut down. This black swan event was a paradigm shift in our life, an inflection point that will forever change families, businesses, habits, health care, etc. We haven't even begun to comprehend the secondary and tertiary impacts this global event will have and our markets are acting like this was a little cold and it'll be business as usual just weeks/months after we come out of this. Not to mention the fact that we still don't have a vaccine for this bug. There is also a strong possibility for this illness to resurface come fall just like the common flu (except no vaccine for this strain).

To my BULLS: I say in the long term yes we will surpass this blip and the market will be soaring again. Please practice caution, especially with the Feds artificially propping up the market, there will be consequences later down the road (inflation, stock bubble, etc.). But no doubt I believe in America and in the long run we will prosper.

To my BEARS: Don't panic and buy into the bull rally or have FOMO of missing the bottom. I refer you back to the duck analogy. Our instincts and logic tells us something is not right, how is it that when the negative data is released about unemployment or the illness that markets behave irrationally. The Feds are doing their best to keep the market artificially inflated. But this is a massive boat called the US economy, with holes forming on a daily basis. Yes the Fed will plug as many holes as they can but they will miss some. That will be your opportunity to get back into the market when that happens.

investing,"BIS did a nice write up on the deterioration of credit markets, for those of you actually looking for an explanation as to why central bank action was necessary.","https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull02.pdf

There's a lot more than just this but here's some highlights: 

* For a two-week period in mid-March 2020, government bond markets experienced uncharacteristic turbulence, sometimes selling off sharply in risk-off episodes when they would normally attract safe haven flows

* Orderly markets rest on buyers who are attracted by low prices to enter the market, so that price declines in the absence of fundamental news are cushioned by purchases. However, from time to time, the demand response can become perverse, where price declines may beget more sales. One example is when an investor has borrowed money to purchase assets. When the asset price falls and threatens the investor’s solvency, the lender will call in the loan, forcing the investor to sell. In this way, a price decline can lead to further sales, not purchases. Without dealers who can absorb sales and stabilise prices, a feedback loop may develop where price declines beget more sales, leading to further price declines

* Unwinding of hedge funds’ relative value strategies. As volatility picked up and margins surged, particularly at the long-end (Graph 2, right-hand panel), liquidity in futures markets deteriorated sharply (Graph 3, left-hand panel). Futures-implied yields dropped more rapidly than bond yields, imposing mark-to-market losses on relative value investors who had sold futures and bought cash bonds. One facet of the ensuing price dislocations between bonds and futures was the fact that the implied repo rates of the cheapest-to-deliver bonds in the futures contracts rose markedly above market term repo rates (Graph 3, centre panel). In frictionless markets, the implied repo rate that an investor would earn by buying the cash bond and delivering it in fulfilment of the futures contract should theoretically be equal to the actual term repo rate. The breakdown of the relationship suggests severe strains at the time in relative value trades. Once the funds were no longer able to meet variation margins, their positions were unwound by dealers/futures exchanges, pushing prices lower. This in turn gave rise to a classic “margin spiral” (à la Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)), whereby the cycle of illiquidity, price dislocations and tighter margin requirements fed on itself

* **Dealer balance sheets under pressure.** Under normal circumstances, dealers would be able to alleviate market stresses by absorbing sales and building up an inventory of securities. But, dealers’ treasury inventories had already been stretched, especially from 2018 onwards, as they needed to absorb a large amount of issuance. With inventories already bloated, dealers faced severe difficulties of further absorbing the unwinding of investor positions in March 2020, particularly at the long end


* Knock-on effects on systematic funds. While the locus of initial market turbulence largely involved relative value investors, de-risking quickly spread to systematic funds, .... including so-called CTA/momentum funds, volatility control funds, risk parity funds. During the Covid-19 crisis, the dislocation in the treasury market meant that bonds no longer performed as a hedge or delivered desired exposure in either type of strategy. As the funds scaled down leverage, this led to a dash for cash, exacerbating declines in both equity and bond prices

* More generally, there are important lessons on the importance of the composition of the investor
base, and the related policy issue of the provision of liquidity by central banks. **Given the importance of
the government bond market as a benchmark financial market price, any dysfunction has far-reaching
detrimental effects that ripple through the rest of the financial system and the real economy.** 

* Recent events also illustrate how the authorities may need to absorb sales directly rather than doing
so indirectly by lending to dealers, especially when funding is not the relevant constraint. This may also
explain why, on this occasion, the Fed’s rapid purchases of securities out of dealers’ inventories (to the tune of about $670 billion) appeared more effective in stabilising the market than the provision of liquidity via repo operations, where take-up was relatively subdued.",finance

We need some advice on investing money. Before I give my background, I have read several how-to-invest articles and reddit posts before writing this. I still have not found any advice on my particular situation though. 

We (married couple in early 30s) have finished creation of a emergency fund for 6 months. Our earlier goal was to save 20% (\~45k) for a down payment to buy a house (which will be just less than 3 times our income)  since we keep reading about ""throwing money away by renting"".  Also, from our paycheck, we put the maximum employer matched amount of 10% into our retirement account. 

Couple months ago, we decided to not buy a house immediately (since we might be moving to a different state in a couple of years). Hence, I (in a very rushed, don't know if it was wise, move) invested about 20K in 2 CDs (with 1.98% return and 2.4% return, please don't ask why I didn't put all in the 2.4% account, I feel very dumb about it!) that will mature early next year. 

With the tax return pending, we will have about 20K that I can further invest. But I am very confused whether we should or not. We do not envision any big expenses (such as buying a house or having kids) in the next 2 years, but we would like to buy a house in the next 5 years at least (hopefully) to ""avoid throwing money away by renting"". 

Additionally, some suggestions on other posts are about being debt-free. We do have car debt where we pay about $500 each month (but the interest rate is 1%), so we thought it is not worth paying that off right now. 

Should I be investing in stocks/mutual funds right now? Or should I be keeping them in online savings accounts (where, as you know, the return is very low nowadays)?  

Also, if you suggest stocks/mutual funds, should it be in another retirement account? (with the thought that we again start saving for the house from now)

Both GA lots are now zoned commercial, and in an area that is developing at a steady pace. One lot has a loan against it that replaced the home mortgage (could not keep a home mortgage when house was unoccupied, zoning changed to commercial, and highest and best value is bare land). The other lot is free and clear. Value of the two lots is about 900k and they on the market. However, commercial bare land sells when it sells, and it might be six months or a few years. Loan is about 185k. 

House in fl is waterfront, has existing mortgage of 275k and a value of about 450k (recently appraised). We have very good credit, over 800. Interest rate on both loan and mortgage is about 4%. 

I just retired - turned in all the paperwork right before the stock market went south. We had about $900k in various mutual funds, now more like 650k. We want to draw down as little as possible on the general theory of ""buy low, sell high"", and now is low. 

We need to replace a dock that was destroyed in the hurricane a year or so ago. We had planned to draw down the mutual fund for the 30k or so we need to do this, but are reluctant to do so now because every dollar we pull when values are low counts hurts more than when values are high. But, if we do not repair the dock soon we lose the automatic/no cost approval to do so as simply repairing the hurricane damage. 

If rates are low enough right now it might make sense to refi the FL house and pull money out in order to do home upgrades (the dock) that add at least that much to the value of the property. However, I do  not know if it's even feasible to get a refi now that I live on social security and the disbursements from the investments. I don't want to have hard credit pulls if it's clearly, obviously, not possible. 

Also, is it a good idea at all? We were thinking that our 15 year average on the mutual funds (even now) is about 12% growth, and it is likely to be higher than that over the next couple of years. If we can get a loan of around 3%, it's better to borrow at 3 and leave the money in the IRA until it comes up a bit. Then, evaluate whether it's better to sell stock and pay down a loan.

(Yes, it would have been nice to have moved more of the IRA to stable value before the crash. But, we figured having half in several different mutual funds and half investment real estate was reasonably diversified. It's true in the sense that the real estate values in the GA area have not been hurt much, but real estate is not very liquid.)",finance
personalfinance,"Using Series EE Bonds for Retirement: How to get a government-guaranteed, tax-flexible 300% return on your initial investment.","TL:DR: This post will show you how to turn an initial $100,000 into a government-guaranteed $400,000 for retirement using Series EE bonds, which can be purchased through [treasurydirect.gov](https://treasurydirect.gov).

*Before you ask:* no my family does not personally have $100,000 to spare, right now or in the foreseeable future, or even the \~$417/month I'm going to suggest below for this, but I think the numbers I'm using show the benefits of the strategy I'm going to suggest. Thankfully, you can try this strategy out with as little as $25 if you're in your 20s or 30s and want to turn that into a government-guaranteed $100 by the time you retire or want to show younger people how to do the same.

[As I've written before](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/78uroy/okay_reddit_lets_talk_about_using_series_i_bonds/), I don't think enough people think about, or are aware of, the benefits of government-backed individual savings bonds. I think this is in part because there are no big power players that benefit from them. The only folks that benefit are the folks the individuals that buy them (and this could be you!). Are they the silver-bullet savings vehicle for everything? No, but I do think there are significant benefits to them that are often overlooked.

While every person's situation is different, I'm going to argue below that Series EE bonds, **after 401(k) matching and a maxed-out Roth IRA**, should not be overlooked as one of the best places to save over time. This is because of both their tax flexibility and, of course, for [that government-guaranteed \~3.5% annual percentage return](https://outline.com/59KPtJ) for folks that are able to hold them for their 20-year guarantee, or even better as I'll point out below, laddering them over two 20-year periods for retirement.

**To get to the point:** Here's how you turn $100,000 into a government-guaranteed $400,000 in your retirement years:

* **Early years** (20s and 30s): Start with an initial investment of $5000/year in Series I-Bonds over 20 years ($100,000 total initial investment or \~$417/month)
* **Middle years** (40s and 50s): As initial $5000/year in Series I-Bonds matures into $10,000/year, re-invest that back into Series I-Bonds ($100,000 initial investment grows into $200,000)
* **Later Years** (60s and 70s): Start cashing out $20,000/year in Series I-Bonds using them for what you need during retirement. ($100,000 initial investment grows into $400,000)

That's the simplest way I know how to write out this strategy, but **I hope folks can also see the flexibility of it**. As an example: maybe you can only save $2500/year in your 20s but you make up for some of it in your 30s, supplement into your 40s, and then not buy as much into your 50s.

The tax-deferred advantages of savings bonds might inspire ways to make this strategy work for you, too: they're exempt from state income taxes, and **they're federal income tax-free if they're used for qualified educational expenses**. In other words, if you're able to time the bulk of the redemptions when someone might need money for college, that's another way to take advantage of this strategy.

*Important caveats*: Most experts estimate the stock market will return more than 3.5%/year over a 40-year period, so I'd personally still recommend prioritizing any contributions you're able to make to a Roth IRA over this, mostly because of its stronger tax advantages and flexibility. It's also hard to say what Series EE or Series I Bonds might look like in 20 years so it's not guaranteed you'll be able to re-invest in your middle years.

Still, **a U.S. government-guaranteed 3.5% is hard to beat**, especially in this low-interest environment. So if you're willing and able to commit some money over 20 or 40 years, I'd strongly recommend considering even putting just a little aside for this. Minimum purchases for bonds through treasurydirect.gov start at $25. If you put that aside that every month -- using the numbers and strategy above -- you could turn an initial investment of $6000 into $12,000 in your middle years or $24,000 in your later years, for whatever you might want to use that for.

**If you're older and this doesn't feel like it's for you**, consider setting something like this up and teaching it to younger generations you might be looking out for. It's never too early to learn different ways to save.

investing,Why the stock market is going up... and it's not because the Coronavirus is going away,"I think I know why the stock market is up... and it's not because the Coronavirus is going away.

It requires some macroeconomic and finance knowledge, but maybe, just maybe:

* Fed actions (buying assets) are lowering risk premiums
* Fed actions (lowering rates) are lowering asset yields overall
* Both of these actions lower stock yields, which increases stock prices
* Lower stock yields = longer duration for stocks (dividend discount model)
* Longer duration + lower stock yields = less overall sensitivity to the lower expected earnings for next 12-24 months due to Coronavirus
* Plus... a maybe.... maybe long-term inflation expectations due to printing money = higher earnings (in pure dollar terms) for cash flows 5-30 years from now

Run those things through a discounted cash-flow model, and you get higher stock prices.  Near-term earnings become less important to the overall picture.

The absolute weirdness of finance.

**EDIT #1:**  The spreadsheet doesn't tell us what S&amp;P 500 is going to be.  That is NOT it's purpose.  It shows us how Fed actions can increase stock prices, all other things staying the same.

^^ Look at the spreadsheet and don’t take it literally... it’s a demonstration of yield change, not a market prediction... ^^

____________________________________________________

**EDIT#2:**

ELI5:

US Government actions are making it less risky to be in the stock market.

US Government actions are also making it harder to make money in bonds.  Stocks now pay much better than bonds.

The logical conclusion is that yield-chasers are buying stocks, and they believe we will solve Coronavirus before the Fed runs out of ammo.

* It doesn't tell you if the Coronavirus is going away or not.
* It is not a substitute for sound financial planning which is completely outside of the scope of a single reddit post
* It is not an indication of where I think the market is going

investing,"White Swan came, Black Swan's a comin'","Like many here, I'm trying to come up with an investment thesis and a strategy for these uncertain times. I'm currently Bearish - have gone largely to cash, but want to invest in defensive plays because I see much more uncertainty ahead. So this long and rambling post is going to try to play with some ideas I've been having about the future. For the record, I've been investing for 8 years, was primarily an ETF buy and hold investor, and am Canadian, with a background in Political Science. ( I mean, I've got an undergraduate degree and a long-time interest, I'm no expert or nothing.)

I've read Nassim Taleb's *Incerto* series and have been mainly convinced, I think, and am surprised at the number of people who are calling this a Black Swan (BS) event; there's a post from today where a guy points out that it's not, and that Taleb himself says it's not and he got downvoted to hell. So first off: the Covid-19 pandemic was not a Black Swan.  The Covid-19 pandemic, or one like it, has been predicted by damn near everybody for decades. The Obama administration even used a similar pandemic as a war game to get the Trump administration up to speed during the transition, Bill Gates called this years ago, we had a similar outbreak in SARS and H1N1, etc. Even if that wasn't the case, C19 would only be a BS for China - as a bunch of media sources have pointed out, there were US intelligence reports as far back as December saying this would be a huge deal, which were ignored by the administration. So all the suggestions that this is a BS event are really just pointing out how *bad* many governments, markets, and corporations are at predicting the future - they're unable to predict or prepare, or respond appropriately for a predictable event and only capable of reacting (with the exception of some countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Germany...)

Now with the market rallying the bulls are all saying ""it's priced in, you can't fight the Fed, etc,"" and I'm thinking: 

1) The emperor has no clothes; the US government is clearly incompetent. It couldn't even listen to it's own experts about the likely extent of the pandemic, had no plan or even seemingly the ability to be at all proactive. For example,  an aircraft carrier had a port call in *Vietnam*, during the middle of a pandemic that started in Asia. Then, completely predictably, it had an outbreak of C19 and it's capabilities were badly damaged and the administration couldn't even properly help it's own ship, nor manage the public relations fallout that resulted. I mean, do you have any idea how *insane* it is that that ship was allowed to dock during a pandemic? One of the most powerful military devices that ever existed got taken off line cause the administration couldn't understand it's own intelligence.

This incompetence isn't limited to the US of course - the UK handled their initial response badly and had to switch horses mid-race, Canada lagged badly responding as well, Italy and Spain mismanaged their response - but I'd argue that the US, given their advantages in intelligence collection, should have been best positioned to deal with this crisis so I focus on them.

2) Because of this, I think the odds of a real Black Swan event have gone up considerably, and if one does occur, it will occur when the US is historically divided and weakened and where it's economic system is out of ammunition to deal with a second crisis. I'll explain:

We have been living at at time when major geopolitical disruptions have been absent - while proxy wars and minor terrorist attacks still occur, there's been no wars between great powers for some time, and I think many have come to see this as natural; that the unipolar world will continue. But Russia is resurgent, China has a 50 year plan to grow its economy and eventually take a place as a hegemon, which may be entering end-game, and much of the  Western international community has grown uncomfortable with US leadership, given the American tendency to elect incompetent Republicans. So we're likely entering an era of uncertainty and increased instability as the contenders vie for status in the new international order.

This doesn't mean war or open combat - it's  become a cliche that the new wars of the 21st century are economic ones, and, given nuclear proliferation that's likely to continue. And I think we're more likely to see significant economic combat in the next 6 months than at almost any time during the last decade, because: 1) Trump is incompetent (and here I should stop just shitting on Republicans... the Dems have picked a 77 year old half senile fool to go up against him. I mean, looking at the two guys contending for the leadership of the most powerful country that has ever existed, it's hard to come away thinking that this is the sign of a healthy political system.)

2)America is weak (relatively speaking obviously, they're still the undisputed big swinging dick) and divided.

3)Because of C19 hits to economy, Trump may not be re-elected. I suspect that if it looked likely that he's re-elected, China at least would be content to sit quiet and wait for 4 more years of dumbasserry to take its toll on US hegemony - similarly with Russia. But if it looks like he'll lose come November, they'll take advantage.  

What would that economic war look like? Lots of options that I see, and I'm curious if you guys see other ones. I mean, what would it look like if China dumped treasuries over the next 7  months? Or what would happen if China and Russia, or even OPEC+ decided to trade oil in non-US dollars? Or what if China leverages foreign aid to African and Asian countries hard-hit by C19 for long term trade deals designed to damage US interests? Iran and North Korea are additionally wild cards, and if either one is hard hit by C19 could go down flailing with unpredictable results. Any others I'm missing? Curious to hear other's ideas.

Now, note I'm *not* saying that odds of economic war with China or any other US adversary are *likely*; I'm saying if the odds of a geopolitical Black Swan were usually 5% in any given year of the last twenty, I suspect the odds of a major BS have gone up 4 or 5 fold - so like 20-30%. And I'm wondering, given unlimited QE, zero interest rates almost everywhere, central banks everywhere supporting stock and currency markets, etc -- what a defensive portfolio, preferably one that's still exposed to positive black swans like a sudden cure, would look like. Is it gold or silver? Cash? Bitcoin? I've already got enough guns and bullets and a bunker... just kidding about the bunker.

But seriously, I'm thinking something like 10-20% PMs and miners, 20% cash, 20% bonds and the rest equity ETFs of some countries likely to benefit from a stronger and more dominant China, like South Korea and Australia. Given Chinese dishonesty and the opacity of the financial system, investing directly in Chinese companies makes me nervous, though I've been considering a stake in BABA. Canada, it seems to me, is too joined at the hip with the USA to do anything other than follow where it goes.

Anyways, if you stuck with me through all that, thanks and I'd love to hear other's thoughts. I'm absolutely not a prepper nor prone to panic -- I just think we're living in real interesting times and the times are likely to get interestinger in the near future.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice / strategy regarding my mortgage,"Hi all,

I'm asking here, because good luck getting through to the bank right now... plus, maybe they would not want to tell me what I want to know ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 3 year variable-rate mortgage.. right now, the effective rate has plummeted down to 1.65%

I noticed that my payments which were about 50/50 interest and principal, are now 1/3 interest and 2/3 principal. I think by confluence of circumstances, my bank is getting screwed a little here, because the terms of the mortgage are set in stone for another \~2 years.

My mortgage allows additional payments (up to a certain amount), and if I understand correctly, these payments are in the same proportion as the regular ones? Ie, I cannot say ""here's $2k to principal only"", the bank will take some for the interest and some for the principal?

So, my main question is -- is this a good time to try and make extra payments, while effective interest rate is so low?

I looked into re-financing the mortgage, but the clever banksters have jacked the rates higher than my original one, even though the prime rate is way down!",finance

investing,The great stock market rebound,"https://imgur.com/8Qihx4Y

It's one of the biggest and fastest stock market rallies in living memory. In the 12 trading sessions since its low point on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied by 25%, with its component companies increasing in value by more than $4.4 trillion.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is now higher than it was a mere 6 months ago: If you bought it at the beginning of October, you'd be sitting on a profit right now.
The intrigue: Any move of this magnitude naturally elicits the question ""why?"" I spoke to NYU professor Nouriel Roubini to answer that question and came away with 6 main reasons for the rebound:

**Technical**. At the market peak, a lot of investors had leveraged long positions. They faced huge margin calls as the market fell, which forced them to dump even their safest assets at discounted fire-sale prices. When the forced sales ended, fears of a major financial crisis receded, and prices bounced back up.

**Epidemiological**. The rate of hospitalizations and deaths is no longer growing exponentially, and in many parts of Europe and in the U.S. seems to have plateaued or even started falling. New York's status in particular, while terrible, is not as bad as forecasted.

**Fiscal**. Trillions of dollars of government money are flooding global economies, and investors expect some significant part of that money to find its way into the markets, or at least help to support corporate revenues.

**Monetary**. The Fed is pumping unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the bond markets, depressing yields and causing a search for higher returns in the stock market.

**Tactical**. Stock market indices are capitalization-weighted, with the biggest companies having the greatest weight. Those firms are also generally the companies with the strongest balance sheets — the ones best placed to weather this storm. If the crisis wipes out their competitors, very large companies could be some of the biggest winners from the crisis.

**Fundamental**. Some investors are betting on a V-shaped recovery, with corporate earnings quickly rebounding to their pre-crisis levels.

Why it matters: The rise in stock prices does not mean that we've even reached the end of the beginning of the crisis. But if the market does shed these gains and start hitting new lows, there's a good chance it will do so slowly, rather than dramatically.

worldpolitics,Food for Thought related to What We're Experiencing,"I’ve been reflecting on where we are today as a society and what we are all being asked to endure during this crazy time of COVID-19. First, I’d like to start by saying that I understand how serious this virus is and how scary it can be for so many that have health issues or are fighting this virus. Yes, I call it a virus NOT disease. This is because a virus is a microscopic parasite surrounded by a protein shell that must attach to a live organism to survive. In a nutshell, this is the reason COVID-19 is able to spread – human beings are the live organisms the virus is attaching itself to in order to survive. Because I believe in talking factually, you will see links to several articles where I pulled the data I’ve identified below. In order to put my thoughts into perspective I want to share some of these important statistics with everyone.

In 2017, the U.S. had 2,813,503 deaths (.9% -- less than 1% of the total population). 74% of all deaths in the U.S. were from 10 specific areas: **Heart Disease** (647,457), **Cancer** (599,108), **Unintentional Injuries/Accidents** (169,936), **Chronic Lower Respitory Diseases** (160,201), **Stroke/Cerebrovascular Disease** (146,383), **Alzheimer ’s Disease** (121,404), **Diabetes** (83,564), **Influenza/Pneumonia** (55,672), **Kidney Disease** (50,633), and **Suicide** (47,173) ([https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929)). 

In addition, the CDC reported that in the 18-19 Flu season that 35.5 million people had the flu, 490,600 were hospitalized, and there were 34,200 flu related deaths ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html). While there were a significant number of deaths related to flu, we must recognize that **more than 35 million people recovered** from the flu.

Now we layer in deaths related to AIDS in the U.S. The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that since the onset of AIDS, more than **32 million people have died** from this disease with over **74 million being diagnosed** with the disease itself. In 2018, 770,000 people died from AIDS ([https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-people-have-died-of-aids-48721](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-people-have-died-of-aids-48721))

In comparison, to date, U.S. COVID-19: Currently 439,725 cases, 15,769 deaths, **24,504 recovered** ([https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)). I highlight the recovery numbers as these seem to be left out of many of the news reports we are seeing today. The media seems more interested in sensationalizing this virus then the public the good news and reporting on what might be working with those that recovered.

COVID-19 is scary because we don’t have a surefire way to treat those that are affected by the virus; however, even when we have ways to treat viruses – people still die. Whatever the reason may be, comprised immune system, going to the Dr. too late, other health issues that make it difficult for the body to fight off the new virus, whatever the circumstances, people still die from viruses.

The difference with viruses of the past and this virus is that I have never in my 55 years, seen or heard of a government shutting down entire industries, preventing people from working and making a living, or dictating to individuals where they can and can’t congregate. **This is not a mindset we as Americans subscribe to as a whole.** We believe in freedom – freedom to move about freely, freedom to congregate in places of worship, freedom of enterprise. These freedoms have basically been stripped from us as a result of fear and, I believe, a desire for power and control. The federal and local governments have all but crippled industries, shut down small businesses that will never recover from this, and handcuffed individual freedoms and liberty. In addition, these actions have created a self-made economic collapse unlike anything we’ve ever encountered before.

Given the fact that viruses and diseases come, and go my 64,000 dollar question is – **why are we allowing this virus to dictate our freedoms?** Governments that take over society begin to do so by stripping individual freedom and liberties. **These processes often start with fear.** Fear of death, fear of resource scarcity, fear of the unknown. My concern (fear) with how the government is reacting to COVID-19 is that we are under an attempt by those with power to strip us of the very freedoms and liberties we as a nation fought so hard to possess.

If we as a society settle into this mindset of waiting for another government aid package to send us money then we are slowly slipping into a society that will be reliant on government handouts to survive. Thi**s is exactly what many currently holding government offices want today** – a society that is dependent on the government in order to survive, not a society that thrives and has freedom and independence over a dictorial type of leadership – one that tells us what we can and can’t have what we can and can’t do. This is not want I want for my country.

Yes, I know this reads like a conspiracy brief and that is not the intent. My intent is to tell people to **WAKE UP!** Do not go blindly along with what you are hearing in the media, do not allow the federal government to dictate what you as a U.S. citizen can and can’t do. It is not the government’s job to dictate to us how we live our lives. We should be focusing the great work researchers are doing to **find a vaccine**! We should be focusing on the number of people who have **recovered** from this virus! We should be focusing on **restarting our economy and getting people back to work**!

We are responsible citizens of the U.S. and we should be living our lives as we normally do – going to work, enjoying the company of our friends and family, traveling freely around the world, etc. Compare COVID-19 to other viruses and ask yourself, **were you asked to give up so much with the flu virus to simply “flatten the curve”?** Common sense should prevail in this situation and the government should stay out of how individuals live their lives and focus on getting people back to work and allowing researchers to find a vaccine for this virus as they have for so many others in the past.

And of course, ***wash your hands and stay home if you are sick!*** (Common Sense)",finance

I was wondering if it would be a good idea for me to use a home equity loan to pay off roughly $31,000 in credit card debt.  around $12000 of the debt is currently on 0% balance transfer cards that terminate in a year, but the other $19000 is on high interest rate cards (15-20%).

To be clear,  the home equity would be my mothers house.  She trusts that with the money I make I wouldn’t miss any payments and I honestly don’t think i will either,  but my concern is whatever risk factors go into a home equity loan.  I can’t see myself ever missing a payment,  but I want to limit any and all risk as well.

I make a good amount of money and am generally speaking pretty responsible with my money.  The debt has accumulated mostly from recent spending on big life events (buying an engagement ring , buying a house, and getting married) all within the last year/year and a half.  Before that I never had debt in my life.  My credit score prior to buying my home was 770, and is now around 690-700.  I've never been late on a payment, and typically pay more than the minimum amount every month.

I make roughly 90k a year, and my wife makes around 25k a year, and she will make more once she gets her doctorate in a couple years.

I make enough monthly to comfortably pay my mortgage and credit card payments, but the high interest rate feels daunting.

Would a personal loan be a smarter option?  I think my APR would be higher on a personal loan but less risk since there’s no home equity involved.  I’m new to this stuff though so I’m really not sure.

Thanks for all of your help!

personalfinance,Cash out Refinance on Mortgage,"Cash out Refi scenario

Looking to get multiple perspectives on my plans and what y’all believe the best course of action is.

Our current mortgage: $150,300 left on Principal. 3.875% interest rate. I have 26 years left as of this Month. $1090/mo for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and Lender Paid Mortgage Insurance (cannot be removed since it was financed/rolled into the Loan on my first Refi in April of 2016)

Current debts:

Vehicles - $850 month of our income in Car Loans tied up at the moment. $506 monthly (2.95 interest) vehicle #1 (26 months remaining, $12,650 principal) and $344 (3.85 interest) on vehicle #2 remain (51 months left, $16,500 principal). 

Home - See above

Credit Cards - Roughly $4K left in credit card debt (intend to pay off this debt in a few months with our work income, not going to use the Cash out From Refi). 

My short term to mid term Goals:

Purchase a Home when prices are lower and be ready with at least 15-20 percent down payment and some closing costs.

Pay off 1 or 2 Vehicles (figures above)

Rent out our current Home (we plan on keeping this until Retirement at the very least)

That said, we’re in process of Refinancing our current  Mortgage. The Refi will be 30 year term, 3.25% interest, roughly 75% LTV, borrowing $188k (pulling out 32k to pay either both cars or at least the Vehicle #1 @ $506 Month and save the rest in a high yield savings account to use for Down Payment on the next home and possibly splitting 50/50 to an IRA as well.

Our Emergency Funds are good for 5 months with current expenses and will extend to be 8-9 months after we Refi (payments will be almost identical and we free up $506 a month immediately with one car paid off)

Our DTI (debt to income) (Mortgage, Cars, Cards basically anything a credit pull would show is roughly 25%)

My original thought was pay off both vehicles and free up $850 a month in debts. House payment will be within $20-$30 of our current mortgage since we’re removing Mortgage Insurance and lowering our rate 3.875 to 3.250 and going below 80% LTV. 

Our current home is a great starter for 4-5 people max (1200sq ft, 3bd 2ba)z The home is in very desirable neighborhood and we feel we have no problem renting it out when we leave. I would be renting it for $1400-$1500 a month netting us $300-$400 a month (I’m confident this is competitive and reasonable when I looked at other posts in my area for the same size rental homes)

After thinking through our next home purchase, I want to be ready for a percentage of closing cost and a 15-20% down payment. The money we will be pulling out our home with this Refi got me thinking to just pay off Vehicle #1 and keep paying Vehicle #2 for the full term (for now). Keep the $17k-$18k that was going to be used to pay Vehicle 2 off to use for Down Payment on next home.

With the money we will be saving on vehicle 1 we want to split it 50/50 with credit card debt pay off then save for IRA to max out yearly then up our savings for the house when we max out the IRA.

My wife and I both have great in demand careers. Health care (RT) and Cybersecurity Analyst (IT) for stable companies. 7+ years employed at our workplaces.

I’d like some feedback and any advice on how I can let IRS know if my intention to do this and possibly not get taxed as much. I’m new to this Refi-Cash out process so any input is appreciated! I’d like to hear some thoughts on our plans as well and what you would do.",finance
personalfinance,Currently have $20k of fed student loan debt; Enrolling in Master's in Accounting program that costs about $80k (inclusive); What are my options?,"Hi all,

I have a BA in Economics from a top 10 state school. Unfortunately, I have not had a lot of luck finding a lucrative career with my BA. I plan to enroll in the master's in accounting program at the same school, and eventually get my CPA license. It is only a 10-month program, but will cost about $80k total, and I already have about $20k in federal student loans. I qualify for about $20k additional in federal loans, and have not had much luck with scholarships. It seems my only option is to finance the rest (\~$60k) of the program through a private student loan. Does this seem like a terrible idea?

Additionally, my max salary with my BA has been about $42k. Accounting firms directly recruit from the program with a 98% employment rate in the field. Average salaries out of the program are $54k for first year and at year 5 are $105k.

I filled my taxes in February of this year. I used Turbo Tax because it was a standard tax return and received both federal and state money. I'm 23 and last year I was able to make $35k which was enough to sustain myself financially.

With everything that's been going on here in the US, I decided to double checked my tax return and realized I didn't file as independent like I had intended to. I said I was being claimed as a dependent by my mom.

I was talking to my mom and she just filed her taxes about 2 weeks ago. Because I live with her, she thought I still wanted to be claimed as a dependent. My mom is against me doing an amend because she thinks she will have to pay a penalty.

If I do end up making an amend, will my mother have to pay any penalty? Or should I even bother to make an amendment, since I said I was a dependent and my mom ended up claiming me?",finance
investing,April 9th Market Analysis - Canadian Names Edition,"Man what a day.  So much to talk about.  So many moves made.  [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fxdnpp/april_8th_market_analysis_canadian_names_edition/) is my analysis from yesterday.  There were two big things that happened today that adjusted my game play multiple times.  At 7:30am I look at US pre market and everything going according to plan, SPY red, Canopy red, should get the pullback expected.  US jobless numbers up….and then rule #1 again, don’t mess with the FEDS.  Another $2.8 Trillion economic relief package.  Up goes SPY, up goes Canopy, up goes Air Canada above resistance.  Layer on an OPEC meeting and crazy oil price action.  So here is my analysis of day starting with plays.  

**Canopy** – I had Canopy puts expiring today.  As I watched it next to SPY, I noticed a bearish correlation.  Basically what this means is that for every step up SPY made, Canopy only took half a step forward.  With this, I knew that a pullback on SPY would lead to a bigger pullback from canopy.  As it began to pullback I kept raising my ask on the put.  I got too greedy because SPY kept holding up and eventually bounced to a new HOD.  I looked over at Air Canada which was up 15% on the day and knew I needed to average down ASAP because there was no way it was going to hold up.  So I sold my put for a loss and immediately transferred money into AC put.  Weed did have bearish correlation and when SPY pulled back so did it, finishing day down about 2%.

**Air Canada** - I said yesterday I expected it to reject from $19.48 and begin pulling back.  That is tough to do when you open up well above resistance.  I watched it go to $22.  As I mentioned there was no way this wasn’t pulling back based on technical so I doubled down (16 contracts at $1.15) on my $21 puts when the price was $21.60.  Good news is that the price pulled back to $20.08 and with implied premium I could sell the puts for profit.  Two things of bad news for me.  One, we finished above $20 so that will act as a psychological support and $19.48 now acts as temporary new support.  We tested once today, hit $19.46 and bounced back.   The 1 and 4 hour timeframes cooled off a bit but we still are riding the Bollinger band pretty high and any weakness in market should equate with a good sized pullback.

**Energy Names** - Let’s talk about pricing in.  Oil ran big over past week on the assumption of a supply cut.  Expectations were 10-15 million barrels a day cut.  Haven’t seen anything finalized but rumour is they only got 6 billion.  Queue the sell off, 9% in 52 minutes to be exact.  So I watched oil and energy names fall.  I set up a buy order of MEG Energy Corp at support.  The oil flush was strong and we broke through support.  The positives is that by end of day we finished near my entry.  I do a quick search of names if I am holding into the weekend.  They have 55% of their 2020 inventory already set to be sold at agreed price of $59 WTI so I’ll take it.  Alberta government also going to double down on support for economy so I’ll hold into next week and adjust.  The con is that it’s an ugly daily candle as we had a high of day of $3.44.  Has a triple bottom support of $2.63 which will be crucial to hold.  Most names were down between 1% to 10%.  Not surprising with oil down 9%.    

**Gold Miners** - Gold miners are interesting to play because Gold continues to trade after our markets close.  So Gold has a push to resistance overnight/pre market and opened with a break of resistance.  This caused a big gap up on all gold miner names.  Most finished up 3% to 8%.  Most of the names broke their daily resistance and have room to run.  The only thing that I would caution is that we are outside the daily Bollinger band.  Doesn’t mean we can’t continue to run, but I am always hesitant to buy outside of the band on the upper end.

**Bombardier** - I got a nice 10% move on this but looks like I could have gotten 25%.  Ran to high of 53 cents before finishing even at $0.475.  That is an ugly daily candle but still holds hourly uptrend.  Personally, still looking for lower $0.4x re-entry.

**Blackberry** - Nice bounce from bottom but pulled back from high of day of $5.59 and finished at $5.25.  Anything above $5.05 maintains hourly uptrend so we’ll need to see if it holds next week.

**Aritzia** - someone asked yesterday for me to cover this.  Yesterday in the comments I said “$13.53 was old resistance and will act as new support short term”.  Today low of day - $13.55, finished at $13.97.  Technical analysis at work.

**Restaurant Brands International** - Someone asked about this yesterday.  I said “equilibrium, expect bounce to continue to $61-$63 and then pullback for equilibrium”.  Wasn’t dead on but high of day was $64 and finished $61.50.  It has a base of support at $60.  Short term, could test $64 again.  If it rejects I would expect the pullback to begin.  I would play rangebound between these two numbers.

Any other names you want me to look at let me know.",finance

personalfinance,"Student loans, CARES act, and the opt-out forbearance: pay attention to capitalization!","If you were not already aware, the CARES act instructed loan providers to automatically apply an administrative forbearance until Sep. 30th for all federal student loans. See ED's information page [here](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus). The information page makes no mention of interest capitalization (except in relation to consolidating non-ED managed loans). If you are not familiar with the concept of capitalization, here is a [policy recommendation](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/04/08/policymakers-should-consider-impact-of-growing-student-loan-balances-on-borrowers-and-taxpayers) from Pew Research that explains how it affects student loan borrowers. Basically, when capitalization occurs, any interest you have accrued gets applied to your principal balance. You then begin accruing new interest on the larger balance.

After the CARES Act was passed, there was very little discussion about the issue of capitalization. Some people [did identify that it](https://ticas.org/affordability-2/whats-in-the-cares-act-higher-education-student-debt/) could become an issue:

&gt;It is also unclear how unpaid interest accrued prior to the interest waiver will be treated once the waiver period ends. Determining this will be important because if that interest is capitalized it can create significant increased long-term costs for borrowers.

My provider is Great Lakes. I received an e-mail this morning notifying me that my federal student loans have been placed into administrative forbearance until Sep. 30th and that I am accruing 0% interest. Their [public website](https://mygreatlakes.org/educate/covid-19.html) does not include the details they shared in their e-mail to loan holders. Their e-mail includes the following statement:

&gt;If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance.

I have about $7k in outstanding interest from pre-March 13th when the rates went to 0%. I called this morning and specifically asked whether or not my existing interest balance would capitalize, and Great Lakes verified that **it will capitalize when the forbearance ends.** Therefore, I worry that many borrowers may be misled by the statement in the e-mail that there is no advantage to opting out of the forbearance.

I have heard from friends, anecdotally, that their providers have told them that their interest will NOT capitalize. If you are affected by this automatic forbearance, you should check with your provider to see what will happen to your existing interest balance.

If you plan to utilize the PSLF, this may not impact you. The months in forbearance will count towards your PSLF payments if you're still in a qualifying job and capitalized interest will not affect your monthly payments, which are income based.

**TL;DR:** If you have federally held student loans, your provider will be putting them into an administrative forbearance. Your provider may or may not capitalize any existing interest you have at the end of the forbearance.",finance

personalfinance,How to take advantage of student loan forbearance?,"So because of the virus, my student loans have been automatically put into forbearance until November and are not accruing interest. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for how I should take advantage of this as someone who has not been affected financially by the situation (thankfully).

For some background - I graduated and started a salaried job last year. I have about 13k in student loans (about 3% interest) and a car loan at about 15k (\~5.5% interest). I have about one month's worth of expenses in an emergency fund. I would like to have more saved in case anything happens, but up until now my goal has been aggressively paying off debt (focusing on the car loan).

So what would you do if you were in my position? Keep paying the student loans to knock off some principal while they're not collecting interest? Pay off the car loan instead, since it is accruing interest and has a higher interest rate? Orrr spend this time beefing up my emergency fund? Appreciate any input!",finance

personalfinance,How would you do this? Here’s my idea,"Okay so me and my girlfriend of 4 years are about to move into our first home together.  I bought it through a VA loan (interest rates are stupid low right now) anyways we now have that part of our expenses figured out (within -100 or so depending on insurance and tax fluctuations) we have sat down and figured out all our debt with her school, my new vehicle, Credit cards on both sides and have even considered with the new home that getting things to fill it with this could also keep our expenses in one spot.

With that being said 35k is the amount needed to knock the debt out. 

Bills we could think of (Excluding what will be gone with this loan) 

Mortgage- 1130
House Bills - 400 (50% increase in our worst month in our apartment so worst case) 
Car insurance - 200 ( Will drop when car gets paid off with this loan) 
Phone Bill - 210 
Her health insurance - 135 
Misc monthly subscriptions- 100 
Food and Gas - 575 (outlandish?) 


-2750 a month 

I work for the post office made 50k last year 
She’s a nanny right now at 28k but going to school to become a dental assistant -38k for a year for 2-3 years while she finishes to become a hygienist at -70k a year.

But as for now as far as take home we bring home. 

-4500 a month 

So leaving us 1750 a month left over to take care of this new loan.



I know a lot but 

1.) Good idea? Bad idea?
2.) if a good idea was your answer what sort of options would be best for the 35k

personalfinance,"How should I allocate this ""extra"" money?","Okay so first - the money isn't really extra, it is money that would be going towards debt anyway - but I'm not sure if it would be better to leave everything the way it is or temporarily shift some stuff around.

The details:
Both my husband and I work and are currently considered part of the essential workforce so our income has thankfully not changed since all this crap started. Also we are both able to work from home so our exposure to getting sick is minimal.

We do have quite a substantial bit of debt due to bad money management in the past, but we are working to pay it off. We are using a combination of the snowball and ladder method. Paying off high interest rate debt (anything above 10%) first but starting with the smallest balance.

Things changing within our budget:

Our morgatage payment is going down roughly $90 a month due to our escrow adjustments. (I'm rounding for easy math) For one year this will be about $1180 extra dollars going towards the principal if we continue to pay the same rate we are paying now.

With student loans being frozen we will have around $440 a month going towards just principal while everything is in administrative forbearance. That will be $2640 of student debt gone within 6 months! woo.

So my question is this: what is the best way to allocate this money?

1. Don't change anything and just pay everything like normal.

2. Take the extra money and move it into the combination method and use it to pay the high interest debt.

3. Leave the morgatage payment the way it is, but take the student loan payments and direct it to the smallest balance and pay that off.

4. Take all the extra money and put it towards the student loans

5. Take the extra money and buy something nice for myself! (this one is a joke)

Bitcoin,Thanks for the taxes. We don't give a fuck about your business,"This is an all-too-familiar sentiment from government to Canada's startup (specifically bitcoin-startup) community.

On March 27th, 2020 the Prime Minister proudly announced a $40,000 government backed loan.

""For small businesses, there's a $40,000 loan of which $10,000 will not have to be repaid if they meet certain conditions. There are many things we're doing out there with low interest or no interest loans to help businesses get through this, but the wage subsidy and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people who lose their jobs are going to be there to make sure that we come through this strongly."" ref

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference while in self-isolation at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa Friday, March 13, 2020. (Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press)

I, like many small business owners, let out a sigh of relief as we have all seen revenues vanish over the previous weeks following the necessary public health measures put into place. That $40,000 meant one more payroll run. Maybe it made up for the payables or rent that was coming due in 4 days. A $40,000 injection of ""worry-about-it-later"" money would mean breathing room. The equivalent of a pool noodle while wading in the middle of the ocean. Enough to keep you thinking ""you can do this"".

Banking is hard to come by as a bitcoin/fintech startup. We are not ""welcomed into the traditional banking atmosphere with open arms"" regardless of our balance sheets or longevity. Even the bank for Alberta's Entrepreneurs (which promotes their ""blockchain friendliness"") refuses to work with businesses that touch cryptocurrency.

Hi Adam - hope all is well. What is wrong with the markets and BTC as a safe haven ? You did mention a few months ago that we will see sub $6k soon and I wasn't sure how … well you were right. You are an Oracle.

Regarding banking - When me and \[redacted ATB employee\] met you, we extended the offer to help out and support your retail banking needs. You decided not to take it. I just heard back from our Compliance team that their Pause extends to all retail accounts as well. Basically, anything that touches crypto / even personal accounts is not supported right now.

Unfortunately, I can't help and I am sorry. Hopefully, if the markets turn positive / and pause is lifted / I can try to seek support for your retail and business needs. For now, it is a full stop.

I am also moving to a new role at ATB this week and not sure who would manage the crypto portfolio. I will keep you looped in.

best,

\[redacted ATB employee\]

So forget ATB, I thought SURELY the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) would be there to lend a helping hand during this unprecedented economic and health crisis. The fact that our revenue dropped nearly 70% week-over-week with the onset of the pandemic, and the fact that I have paid well into the six figures in provincial and federal taxes last year would mean that, during these hard times, Canada's Small and Medium Sized Business savior wouldn't be as prejudiced. I was wrong. One week after my application went unanswered I was put in touch with a rep through a personal connection of mine. Within minutes a chipper response pinged my inbox:

Hi Adam

Hi Adam

I just reached out to our Tech Finance Manager and unfortunately we are unable to Bitcoin clients as our board has deemed them ineligible due to potential money laundering. I am very sorry - this is news to me. Being a Crown Corp we have very strict rules. I think you can still access some Federal support though via some of the links I sent earlier.

Best Wishes to you and yours,

Potential. Money. Laundering.

You'll notice he does not ask for my documentation (FINTRAC Registration as a Money Services Business) which should be the first step to verifying that our business goes above and beyond to prevent the money laundering that they claim to be concerned about. Despite sending him our industry-leading policies and FINTRAC Registration the final response was polite but stern:

Morning - Thx for the info. Policy such as this are from the Board of Dir's and Minister of Industry. But things change - I now have hemp clients. It will take time though. When we get to the other side, I would love to have a beer with you and \[redacted personal connection name\] and learn more about your biz and future. I personally believe crypto will be a important solution in rebuilding the world economy.

Best,

And that was apparently that. However, you don't get to be one of Canada's leading Bitcoin ATM companies without a little bit of grit and resilience. So I tried again through conventional channels. This time the response was just as useless but even more robotic (you'll notice they spelled my last name wrong…)

Dear Mr. O\`Brian,

Thank you for submitting a request for financing. After examination of your application, we regret to inform you that BDC is not able to provide financing for your business.

We understand how deeply the COVID-19 situation is affecting. However, we are unable to respond positively to your request that does not meet the eligibility criteria.

An evolving situation

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, BDC's response is evolving as well and we are working closely with government, financial institutions and our partners.

Ensure that you have spoken to your primary financial institution to see if they are able to help with financing:

As you may know, additional measures to support entrepreneurs have been announced by the Government of Canada, including anew Canada Emergency Business Account as well as a SME Loan and Guarantee Program. As these programs are not administered by BDC, your primary financial institution is best suited to assess if you may benefit from these relief measures as they get deployed shortly.

For the latest updates by the Government of Canada on COVID-19, visit Resources for Canadian businesses: COVID-19.

Thank you,

This response left me frustrated. How could it not? How could our small, innovative, and incredibly compliant business not be within the ""guidelines"" set out by Mr Trudeau last week? My response was heated:

This is extremely frustrating.

The fact that I am denied help, despite paying 100s of thousands in taxes, is discouraging. Why do you take my tax money, but then deny my eligibility based on ""crown rules"". The eligibility criteria of BDC should be companies that are striving to employ local workers with cutting edge business practices and revolutionizing the world. All of which we do (and have been doing for 7 years)

I know you will cite ""compliance"", and yet refuse to look at my compliance manual. A policy that was written by a previous compliance officer from a schedule 1 ""big 5"" bank. A policy that has been approved by 2 third party auditors. A policy finalized by my Chief Compliance Officer with 10+ years as a compliance master who has prevented millions of dollars worth of fraud AND played a key role investigating.

It is disappointing to see you promoting the narrative that you are ""for entrepreneurs"" when in fact I have found it to be quite the opposite. We are a licensed money service business and I personally spend my time working with local authorities educating them how to prevent fraud within this space. Yet somehow I've been labeled ""ineligible"" for assistance when I really need it. What is the point of innovating? Is ""the first guy through the wall gets the bloodiest"" really the narrative you support? ""Don't think outside the box because we don't like that?""

The prejudice of the BDC towards alternative financial companies is disappointing to say the least.

I would appreciate your response, though if past experience has taught me anything I know better than to expect one.

Perhaps the Canadian business environment is not one that is as friendly as you promote.

Stay healthy,

Adam

As you might have guessed this went unanswered (though the robots did manage to regurgitate the exact same original message) and here we are. My initial sentiment from the most recent response to the BDC remain. What is the point of innovating? Why do I spend tens of thousands of dollars every single year to ensure that our compliance is industry-leading? Why do I spend hours and hours working (for free) with local authorities to educate them about Bitcoin and how to prevent fraud? Why do I stretch my hand out so far only to have it slapped when I am looking for the same support everyone else is getting? I've endured years of prejudice from the traditional banking industry. I've built an incredibly successful business that exclusively employs local labour even though it would be all too ""easy"" to off-shore the work. We've paid our taxes, donated to the community all without the help of the bank's lending products, but being denied support relief during this unprecedented crisi due to ""potential money laundering"" is as prejudicial as it gets.

All of this to ask, Mr. Morneau, will these subsidies affect my taxes? I understand the economic cash injection. As a whole, I am onboard with the injection to help stimulate the economy. But we all know who will end up paying for it. We all know that money doesn't grow on trees (it's printed dummy) and that it will eventually have to be paid back in some capacity… which will eventually be through increased taxes. Taxes that hard-working citizens continue to pay every year. If only you knew how much you were contributing to Bitcoin's adoption…

Finally, dear reader, I beg you to think. Listen to my story and ask yourself ""is my industry next?"" ""Can I trust them with my taxes… can I trust them with my money?"" I fully believe what I am experiencing is a direct extension of the reason Bitcoin was created. Bitcoin exists to give its owners choice. A choice that doesn't exist with fiat money, printed at will by a centralized body of power. Right now the majority of ""industry"" is getting help, the government is listening to their people. I am unfortunately in the minority. My business is too edgy. My business is too ""risky"". My business doesn't deserve help. Will your industry, your business, your pension, your family be next?

personalfinance,Student Loan Forbearance... what to do?,"**tl;dr: Do i put $523/mo into my 0% interest student loans for 6 months, or do I put it into an S&amp;P 500 Fund?**

I just received notice from my federal student loan servicer that my interest rates have been adjusted to 0% and automatically placed into forbearance until September 30th. 

* I owe $43k and my monthly payments are (were?) $523/mo. I have no other debt. 
* I have 3 months in (savings) cash on hand (HYS) and an additional 3 months in TIPS. 
* My job is relatively safe (I'm a consultant and my current client is a big pharma company - business is actually very good for my team right now, and I'm an SME in a high-demand area right now.)
* I max my IRA (evenly over 12 months)
* I max my 401k (evenly over 12 months - the full amount, not just the match) 
* I live in Manhattan, so anything along the lines of ""it could be a nice chunk towards a down payment on property"" or anything like that doesn't really apply to my situation. 
* My SO is in financial services, so between my job and her job, i'm banned from trading in individual equities or derivative products in Financial Services, Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare or Tech Media &amp; Telecom.

Over 6 months, that works out to $3,138 to either put directly towards principal (minus 11 days of accrued interest at the end of March at a weighted 4.03%) or invest. 

On one hand, reducing my total debt load by ~7.25% in six months sounds nice. 

On the other hand, I'm relatively new to investing, and most of my retirement funds were contributed at the peak (over the last ~24 months) and it could be nice to average down and reduce my cost basis. 

My total income and my short term savings is mostly irrelevant for the purposes of this conversation as we're talking specifically about this $523 x 6 months only. But if it helps, I don't live paycheck to paycheck.

Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general -  private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.

JPow's cover story for buying junk bonds is that he is helping corporations so they can keep American jobs intact. That is a total lie. Corporations will get all this free money and then lay off people anyway during the summer. All the free money will go to the wall street elite and billionaires.

Edit: Let me make it even simpler. Shadow banker (evil blood sucking parasite of wall street) gives money to company XYZ and company XYZ gives a high yield bond aka junk bond to the shadow banker. Company XYZ loses all revenue because of corona. Mr. shadow banker is now holding a worthless bond because XYZ went bankrupt and cannot pay the interest payments anymore. Mr. shadow banker very sad and maybe going broke too. Oh wait, here comes JPow with his unlimited money printer. JPow buys this bond from Mr. Shadow banker who gets saved from his risky loan and mr. shadow banker gets all his money back. The fed now owns this risky bond on the back of the American tax payer but this bond will likely be worthless since company XYZ can never pay back the loan. JPow saved the shadow banker, question is will JPow save you when you are homeless and starving?

Edit: Some people saying, you just don't understand this stuff. It's too complicated. Don't worry the billionaires know what they are doing. Well you know what, if its that complicated and confusing it probably shouldn't be happening.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Clearly the big boys are already buying in, and most of them have already lived through a bear run about a decade ago. If it dips again, what makes you think they won't just continue to buy more and bring it back up, establishing a new bottom?  With interest rates like they are, aren't stocks pretty much the only play right now?

On March 23rd the vast majority of stocks were either at or near the level they were at before the bull run these last few years. The market dropped because they had no idea what we were in for. Now it's becoming quite clear. Social distancing has been somewhat effective at keeping the initial spike mostly under control, as the number of daily novel cases has topped out, and the deaths likely will too within the next week or so, at least for this first wave.  People are dying in droves but we expected that, and I'm sure pro traders did too. I live near the epicenter of the virus in the US, and yes hospitals are strained, but not necessarily utterly and completely overwhelmed, and the initial peak of infection has passed. Although we'd obviously be screwed if everyone started going out/working again all at once, sooner than later people will begin to return to work bit by bit, likely based on gradient levels of ""essentiality"",  This will lead to further spikes of infection, but now that we know what we're dealing with and will be continuously producing PPE/supplies/etc. for the foreseeable future to deal with it, hospitals will likely already be revved up, constantly resupplying, and relatively ready to handle a constant flow of coronavirus patients for the next year or so. Eventually pretty much everyone may end up having the virus except for newborns, and many (maybe even most)  will not be severely symptomatic.   A year or two down the line we'll probably have a vaccine to keep the newborns and next generation safe too.  In fact, two years from now we may not even think of coronavirus on a daily basis anymore.

To me, the key is that although a lot of companies are going to miss out on a lot of presumed sure-thing income from this quarter and the next (and potentially beyond), little by little we're going to start producing again, albeit with some very predictable road bumps like higher unemployment in light of the portion of companies that will inevitably go out of business after 2+ months with no income, along with a temporary decrease in consumer and commercial spending and a somewhat marked increase in mortgage/rent defaults/delinquencies temporarily.  Yet no professional investor is going to be shocked by ANY of the bad news coming out any time soon, barring a severe novel mutation of the virus or something like that, so it seems likely to me that literally the only surprises will be if there is any GOOD news (e.g. higher than expected earnings, faster-than-expected unemployment decline, etc.), because everyone already knows the economy is going to crap temporarily. I think we don't see gigantic dips due to upcoming bad earning reports, but I think we do see positive spikes/green candles for the equities with exceptionally normal/high earnings reports.  I think it's likely that most pro investors are just giddy that they got to take part in the fire sale of the decade this past month. This is all speculation, and I don't really care if I'm wrong because I have investing plans either way, but it doesn't seem completely impossible to me.

personalfinance,Mortgage Forbearance Question,"Hi guys - throwaway account here. My husband and I have applied for a mortgage forbearance through our loan company. We actually have personally not lost our jobs due to COVID-19, however, both sets of our parents have completely lost their businesses and we have already been needing to send them money, as we knew we would - which is why we applied for it. Any remainder of the money that would normally go to our mortgage I plan to put in our savings until we know what we are doing at the end of the forbearance period. The repayment options our loan company has given us are as follows: 1) total reinstatement (pay back 3 months of our mortgage in full); 2) repayment plan (slowly pay back in increments what we owe in conjunction with our normal mortgage over the following 6 months); 3) loan modification (this is what we wanted to do - extend our mortgage for 3 months); 4) short sale; 5) deed in lieu of foreclosure (last 2 not relevant to us).

Like I said above, our plan was to tack those three additional payments to the end of our loan term and extend our mortgage by 3 months. However I see that involves mitigation and I have seen/heard people talk about mitigation or similar forbearance situations in 2008 and how people ended up getting screwed over - even if they chose to immediately pay back the money. I’m nervous something like that is going to happen to us. Can anyone explain what happened in 2008 and do I have cause to be concerned? If we do go through a loan mitigation process at the end of this, what does that entail - are we at risk of our interest rate going up, etc?",finance

These highly leveraged operations know they can gamble with other people's money because the Fed will bail them out when things turn south. A core part of true capitalism (that much of the world no longer supports) is Darwinian: The strong survive. The weak do not.

investing,Rational for likely followup market crash,"First of all, markets are pricing in perfect V recovery right now. SPY281 high yesterday is same as SPY 281 on 8/5/2019. Is our future global economic outlook/future profits as good as the outlook 8 months ago pre-COVID?

And more factually, 2nd order economic effects. With exception of travel and oil industry, right now job losses mostly focused on low paying service/manufacturing jobs that can't wfh .

Now with much larger sample size for COVID mortality rates, Trump and other democratic country politicians can't claim ""the cure is worse than the disease!"" 21% mortality among closed cases or even 6% mortality is unacceptable to voting public (assuming the 1.1mil active cases, many newly infected, all miraculously survive.)

Closed Cases 452,411 Cases which had an outcome:

356,673 (79%) Recovered / Discharged

95,738 (21%) Deaths

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

With no working cure or vaccine or even conclusive proof antibodies recovered COVID patients won't get reinfected again, the whole world is forced to lock down long term because each time a region loosens up, a new wave of COVID breaks out. Example: Hong Kong closing bars last weekend and China closing movie theaters after 1 week open despite them taking preventative measures against COVID since Jan, three months ago.

If USA and the world lock down for longer, esp past 2-3 months, 2nd order effects mean even with Fed QE, most industries will see sustained long term operating losses, which means mass layoffs of high paid workers and closure of small/medium cash strapped businesses, which will hit consumption/consumer debt defaults even harder, leading to vicious cycle of more layoffs/closures, more corps losing money, more layoffs just like 1929 or 2008.

We all know it's the high income folks who provide the bulk of the high profit margin consumption in the global economy, especially China new rich show offs buying up luxury markets.

And there's no escape for globalized SP500 corps, because whole world is shut down, there's no profitable region that can help lift up sagging regions.

This will also pop the new tech bubble momentum Unicorns such as WeWork, Uber, Lyft, Softbank Vision fund, AirBnB, SPCE, and \*gasp, maybe even Tesla. This will kill momentum retail and private equity buying sentiment.

And democrat controlled congress forcing companies taking bailout money to ban stock buybacks and very likely stopping dividends will simultaneously eliminate huge equity buyside support and increase selling pressure because the jobless former high earners can't depend on dividends for cashflow anymore but is forced to sell low to get cash to live or service debt/margin calls.

Oh, in 2008, bailed out GM/Chrysler/Bear Sterns/Merril Lynch/WaMu equity holders took 90-100% haircuts. It was the bond holders and workers who go saved. Any bet's this will repeat again, esp with a democrat controlled congress?

Fed right now is willing to buy up to 20% of Investment grade and junk (old or newly downgraded) bonds. But if or when long term lockdown 2nd order effects kick in, can Fed prop up entire breadth of USA economy long term? Even after stimulus funds run dry?

And even if Fed manages to prop up USA indefinitely through infinite QE, what about rest of world? Majority of developing countries can't borrow infinite money like USA/Western Europe to replace jobless worker's paychecks for even short periods of time.

Example, look at China consumer lenders saying they have 20% delinquent consumer loans already. China hasn't announced a paycheck replacement program despite being 3 months post lockdown even though Chinese/developing countries have non-existent unemployment insurance benefits, especially for the masses of migrant workers. If China goes back into lock down, China's debt bubble may finally pop or at least deflate super quick. Best case, no more fast artificial China growth propping up world economy, worst case China economy implodes and takes down developed countries' economies even faster.

SP500 has so much international exposure, especially to former fast growing developing countries (looking at China again along with tourist driven SE Asia and oil shocked OPEC+), this will kill a big part of 2019's priced in profit growth/current profits.

USA Stimulus already at $3t and is aimed at patching 8 weeks of service/travel/oil sector work stoppage. So 15% of last year's annual $21.4t GDP. And each additional month/round of stimulus is another $1.5t/8% of GDP. And this is just propping up the average income workers. There's no way Democrat controlled congress will allow high earner incomes to be backstopped via stimulus. Look at the $75k-99k income phaseout of the $1.2k checks.

TLDR -I see three outcomes:

Fast leg down: If China has a 2nd wave anytime in next several weeks and is forced to freeze their economy again, investors will panic knowing same pattern will repeat for rest of world economy and we'll sell off fast.

Slow leg down: If China successfully maintains their quasi zombie soft lock down they have now, once investors see there's no V recovery back to old normal and developed countries' lock down keep getting extended because we can't clamp down as hard as welded doors China, markets will bleed out slowly.

Full recovery: If we miraculously discover a cure or vaccine in next 2-3 months, sooner the better before permanent econ damage is done, we'll get our V recovery and markets will shoot to new infinite QE inflated ATHs.

Edit 4/11:

I wanted to add some more thought's on the Fed and recent equity market movements.

The Fed is working toward their dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices, targeting 2% inflation.

[https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)

The sudden unemployment of 20%+ USA's economy overnight wacks the Fed's employment alarm buzzer.

Then flight to cash as revenues of masses of business slam 70-99% lower trips the Fed's mega deflation alarm buzzer too.

In early to mid March there was rampant liquidity crunches everywhere, hence virtually all companies rushed to draw their lines of credits to max 100%, and the violent selloff of even safe haven assets like treasures, gold, money markets etc.

Both red alerts going off at the Fed explains their unprecedented emergency moves to inject liquidity into the market to fight deflation and bond market completely freezing up with no buyers at any price. This might also explain the vast $2.2T - $3T CARE act passing so quickly, another first precedent for USA giving universal income for everyone and small businesses (for 2-4 months).

Side affect of Fed resolving the liquidity crunch of March 2020 is liquidity in the stock market got restored, maybe to even higher than previous levels (remember the Sep 2019 repo market troubles which the Fed had to rescue?), hence our melt up and market buying on both good and bad news. 

IMHO, last three week's melt up has been a relief rally on the Fed/Stimulus bills at least temporarily fixing the deadly liquidity crunch and maybe also combined with relief rally on Saudi/Russia calling off their MAD mutually assured destruction oil price war.

Now the market needs to do price discovery on the economic damage of the COVID and the resulting lock down. Given there's no firm dates for the lockdown (target dates constantly being pushed back don't count) to be lifted throughout most of USA or Europe, I doubt the market's price discovery is complete. The sentiment reversal of last 3 weeks from pessimism to irrational exuberance might be making too light of the COVID's wealth destruction.

China seems to have gotten off lighter than Europe/USA if China's COVID government data is to be believed (I'm in the skeptical camp). 

If China's economy has trouble jump starting and coming back to life despite their lighter than Western countries' COVID damage, this might spell very stormy waters for the USA equity market, especially given the S&amp;P500's global exposure.

personalfinance,Are the announcements about Student Loan interest a total sham?,"When covid started getting bad, first we were told that no interest would be charged on federally held Student Loans. I was excited to see my monthly payment drop by about 80% for a few months. My wife are I (her loans) are in a decent position through this, so it's not do or die for us. but I know how critical it would be for hundreds of thousands of Americans already suffocating by loan debt to get a small amount of cash flow relief during this time.

So daily for several weeks I checked my fed loan website to see what would actually come to fruition. Well the site said no interest would be paid for several months, however the payment stays the same, all going directly to principal. While this is nice, it does nothing to help those struggling to make payments. This was as of approx 3/15/20, all payments after I believe 3/8 we're supposed to have this in effect (my dates are a bit fuzzy).

Well fast forward to today, we made our March payment at the end of the month, the full amount we've been paying for years. I checked through my statement to make sure my payment all went to principal. Sure enough a ton of it went to interest in the normal proportion, and to top it off, the site is showing that all of our loans are delinquent even though we've never missed a payment (I'm assuming it's a glitch and I plan to call and ask about that).

I guess my point in all this is to point out how the government is trying to claim things are going with great with relief efforts, but in my experience in the case of student loans, things are literally worse than if they would have done nothing at all. I still paid a full payment with normal levels of interest, and at least before my loans weren't showing as delinquent.

I'd like to hear from some of you all to see if your experience has been any better than mine. when it comes to the promises made by Washington as far as I can tell, it's 100% hot air.

investing,Trying to assess the current investment environment,"Hi, I've been trying to analyze what's gone on over the past few months in order to find a prudent investment strategy going forward. I'm hoping that people smarter and more experienced than me will tell me where I may be wrong.  

To begin, I'd like to assume that all major players are intelligent, rational and acting in the best interest of those that they are responsible for, rather than speculate on wild conspiracy theories and nefarious puppet masters. 

With respect to the stock market, it seems that the biggest immediate questions are:

1. Will the Fed get involved in purchasing equities near term?

2. Is there some sort of coordinated short-squeeze happening in order to setup the next leg down in global equities?

3. Is there something that would make the major US indexes test their highs or lows near term?

4. What about equities outside the US?

---	
For 1), I just don't see it in the immediate future. While purchasing IG and HY debt makes sense (questionable in terms of the tenets of capitalism and prudence in long term prosperity) to keep businesses afloat until the economies restart, there's no point to the Fed purchasing equities. 

Assuming that Donald Trump cannot walk into a room and say ""make the stock market go to all time highs so I can get re-elected"", no one benefits from this. We were already at the end of a credit cycle and likely headed to recessionary conditions even without Coronavirus. Who are going to be the incremental buyers? 

Trump already looks like a hero for recovering to these levels, he wouldn't even need any more juice. For those saying that ""they are bidding it up so his cronies can get out"" that's pure rubbish. If there truly was a coordinated effort between the administration and outside players to conspire there are many derivatives and other vehicles they could use instead of bidding up the entire equity market. Trump is smart enough to know that jobs are more important than stocks (for his base in particular) so he'll focus there. 

People also point to the example in Japan during the lost decade (gov't purchase of equities) but it's not remotely similar. The same level of speculation doesn't exist in the U.S.. Sure it's a bit frothy but it doesn't seem like a bubble that needs to be gradually deflated.  

The only condition under which the Fed would step in would be if things got very ugly and crashed hard and they needed to intervene because equities were being severely mispriced to the downside and capital markets completely dried up. Private investors would leap at this opportunity. No way this happens. Again, assuming that the Fed is being run by prudent actors, they would only purchase things on behalf of the public if was in the best interest of the public and under no circumstances would buying overpriced equities be part of that. 

---

For 2), maybe, I don't know. While I can see algos making short-term decisions to run stops and front run trades, this level of ""signalling to other algos"" and coordinating a massive leg down seems far fetched but perhaps the AI and coordination is there now. 

It seems more reasonable that various funds and these algos are consistently adjusting weighting based on risk premiums and are bidding up equities because bonds have skyrocketed and there's no other investment vehicle that provides yield. The risk premium has plummeted. During the initial crash in Feb/March, everyone could see that a recessionary environment was going to crush businesses and they still had reasonable (relatively speaking) yields on bonds so they flooded that market. 

Even if there was further bad Coronavirus news, there's nowhere to go. USD and bonds have spiked huge. What options are there for them other than ride lower yields for the foreseeable future across the board? Sorry for the doomsday put holders but I can't see another massive equity crash with everything rebalanced like this. 

The problem with this viewpoint is that it doesn't explain the initial crash in Feb/March. If the market players are truly great at reevaluating value in real-time, why the huge drop and rebound? I don't know but the simple answer would be that the algos and funds didn't know how to initially react to Coronavirus and, as time passes, they are getting better at pricing things accordingly (resulting in lower actual volatility ahead). 

---

For 3), I can't see anything that would push up the market much further and I can't see anything that would make it drop significantly. Large companies have a Fed backstop now on debt so zombie companies (at least for the short term) will be a thing. If retail investors started liquidating their financial assets to pay bills because the helicopter money isn't reaching the consumers fast enough, I think there would be institutional demand. Plus I think that the helicopters have plenty of fuel and payload. 

---

For 4), We're in the global economy and these markets will get bid up for the same reason that the U.S. ones are: There's yield there that will be driven down (higher stock prices) to adapt to the new norm of low-return investing. Perhaps certain economies will tank but that's likely already baked in and there's probably more money to be made trading sovereign debt instead?

---

So, where are the real investment opportunities for the average Joe like me? 

a) Small or micro-cap equities that are outside the focus of the algos and funds? Possibly, but they face the headwind of a recessionary environment and I'm not sure if they will see the benefits of easy credit in the same way that larger businesses will. I don't know how VCs and Angels will change their approaches for investing in private companies. Relatively speaking, perhaps this is a good asset class for stock pickers. Investors may be able to get more equity for their money. 

b) Medium/large company stocks? I can't see how. These have already been priced for incredibly low yield and there still is some risk of a price drop-off. So many people believe that a massive sell-off is still coming which may make it a reality. Where's the reward for the risk? 

c) Gold? I own Gold and I don't really know why. It doesn't make sense why it rises but it does. It should sell off like all commodities but it doesn't. I will likely be long gold for the next few years because historically it does well in this type of environment but I don't know why and I hate it. It has no place in the modern economy and it will crash again one day but likely not soon. 

d) U.S. dollars? The USD has a massive advantage in that no country wants to see it tank. It's the same reason why DeBeers hoards all the diamonds. If the reality of its worthlessness was every truly embraced, everyone would lose, so it's not going to happen. And given that we're likely going to see deflationary pressures from unwinding credit, this seems like a logical choice. For those that predict an impending inflationary environment, I don't see how. Money velocity is dropping, there's a demand drop that will be around for a long time, and inventory will build with little supply side problem. Factories in China and other countries aren't going to slow down, or at least at the same pace of decreased demand. 

e) Selling option premium? VIX is still pretty high, but again this is very risky because who knows what could happen? You'd really have to believe in this thesis. 

f) Shorting certain stocks? Maybe. I'm not good enough to know what to short to make up for the risks. Maybe China? 

g) Patience and wait to purchase real assets? Real estate and other hard assets may come down significantly over the medium term. I think preserving capital and looking for buying opportunities for distressed assets may work. 

In general, it seems like investment yields are going to be extremely low for a long time with no great options. I'd love to have a discussion about this stuff for anyone interested. Thanks!",finance

I got an email this morning, saying that my federal student loans were put into administrative forebarence thanks to the CARE act. 0% interest, no payments due until October (or presumably when this coronavirus thing ends), and auto payments stopped. 

I'm still employed and will be for the foreseeable future, so my initial thought was cancel for the forebarance and let my payments resume. Currently paying 300ish monthly, with roughly 125 going towards interest, so this would net me an extra 750 over the 6 months going into my federal loan. Then I thought about it more..

I also have private student loans that are still in active repayment. I could take that 300ish I'm deferring in federal loans and put it towards my private loans. That would knock off 300ish * 6 months off the principal on that loan. 

Then I thought even more.. I have a couple credit card debts that I reeeeaaaallly would like to get knocked down. 300ish over 6 months would just about knock one out entirely, and either most certainly has a higher interest rate than my student loans. 

I am assuming that my best option right now would be the credit card debt, but wanted to get a second set of eyes on the situation. Thoughts? 



Off topic, I loved how they phrased part of the letter
&gt;Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept. 30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not&gt;

There's an obvious advantage to opting out, if you can do it... You lower your amount owed. And you aren't paying interest on top of it, so double win.",finance

Coronavirus Crisis Legacy: Mountains of Debt https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-crisis-legacy-mountains-of-debt-11586447687

""Many economists believe low interest rates will help the nation manage the soaring debt load. At the same time, they say high levels of private sector debt could lead to a period of thrift, slowing the recovery if businesses and individuals try to rebuild their savings by holding back on investment and spending.""

It should be basic knowledge that taking on debt is borrowing from future consumption. So far we've managed increased debt loads by lowering interest rates to soften repayment burdens and actually encouraging us to borrow more to consume more. But rates don't have much further to go before they hit zero, so how much more debt can we be encouraged to take on before we start paying it back?

Paying it back will negatively impact consumption and economic growth, savings rates, employment, etc. The only way this doesn't happen is if the Fed can somehow stoke material inflation, which means we all get big raises so we have money to not only pay down our debts but also continue spending. But this is a hope and a dream because wage growth has been declining since the late 1970s. Do we now expect a reversal in this trend? If not, how do we right our wrong balance sheets.",finance

investing,IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: The Stock Market is NOT The Economy,"You are probably wondering why the stock market has had any rallies at all, let alone ones this big, considering how bad things are looking. And obviously no one can tell exactly where the market should/shouldn't be. Nothing really makes sense now. But here are just some things to consider.

&amp;nbsp;

**First, the stock market didn't drop JUST directly because of Coronavirus infection count / death count expectations, and expectations of bad earnings.**

There were several combined factors that stacked on top of each other, kind of like a chain reaction.  (This isn't an exhaustive list)

Easily Predicted / Expected Results: 

* People greatly reducing spending and staying in
* Much Less Revenue for Companies
* Drop in oil prices / Energy usage
* Some kind of stimulus
* Poorly situated companies going bust

Not So Expected / Surprises: 

* Saudi / Russia oil fight
* Extreme stress in credit market / corporate bonds
* Liquidity crisis
* Western world being effectively *forced* to stay home
* The fact that all this happened so swiftly at once


I'm NOT saying we have / haven't already reached the bottom. BUT, I will say, I think the initial drop was so big and so fast, not because of the virus, but because of all the ""surprise"" factors. And a lot of these issues are being, or have been solved. 

* Saudi Arabia and Russia reached an oil deal
* The Fed pumped massive liquidity into the market, and bought not just investment grade, but junk corporate bonds (notice how the 'bottom' was the day the Fed announced the massive liquidity injection)
* We are at least *talking about* returning to work, even if behavior will be different for a long time


**So my point is,** yes, the market could go down further over the next year. However, I believe this recent rally is because we have at least solved the *current* major unexpected surprises. All of these things were causing increased uncertainty, which couldn't be priced in, so everyone just sold everything. The market is always forward looking, and people know this isn't going to last forever. It can price in bad or even terrible earnings, but it can't price in what it doesn't know, and *I think this recent situation was a rare instance where everyone knows just how much they don't know*, and that caused a huge spook in the market. With so much uncertainty being relieved, we're basically just having to deal with how bad earnings will be going forward, but not all the other stuff (of course, there could still be surprises).


&amp;nbsp;


Going Forward:

**Bear Case:** The market isn't saying that's the bottom, just that it was too premature before the shit *really* hits the fan. We'll see more negative surprises and this will last longer than people think. Everything was already overpriced, so we have further to go.

**Bull Case:** We're still far down from the top despite the rally, and with so much liquidity, when we eventually get out of this, companies they will have even more firepower and cheap money to borrow to grow, possibly being in an *even better* position for the ones that survive.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: I think the rally from the bottom is not because the market believes everything is fine now, but rather because it is adjusting to reduced levels of current uncertainty.**",finance
personalfinance,Why 401K before 3-6mo E-fund on the flowchart?,"I have been doing a cross between Dave Ramsey baby step and YNAB method.  Just found this reddit and wondering why 401k contributions are ahead of high interest rate debt and 3-6 month emergency fund on the flowchart?

personalfinance,"Graduate School: Take out a loan, or just pay the cost?","Hi all,

I'm enrolling in a Masters program come fall. It's a fairly expensive one, and I have a bit of fellowship aid, but that still leaves about $50k total cost over the two years to be covered.

Now, I'm lucky enough to have a war chest of inheritance tucked away in investments, currently valued around $750k. Generally-speaking I don't touch it, it's intended to send my kids to college or as a down payment on a house. In stabler times I'd just skim $50k off the top to pay for grad school, but since the market is depressed right now, I'm hesitant to sell the stock at a loss. 

My financial adviser recommends I take the loan, but of course he'd like the investment account to stay as high as possible, since that's how he makes his commission. I'm coming here in the hopes of getting some unbiased opinions on what will serve me better in the long run. 

The FAFSA loan I've been offered is $20,500/year at a rate of 6.079%, with an origination rate of about 1%. Another consideration is that interest rates might be much lower next year, so I've considered paying out of pocket for year 1 of the program and taking the loan for year 2.

investing,I can explain why the market isn’t lower,"I’ve seen way too many posts and comments over the last few days from people who can’t understand why the market isn’t lower. I’ve seen a lot of cynical comments about government action “propping up” or “inflating” the market. There are a lot of variables involved in the recent rally, but I think we can explain a lot of the rally over the last few weeks with a couple of them.

Let’s say that we have an equity index that paid $3.00 in dividends last year. That $3.00 was expected to grow by 5% each year. Let’s assume a 7% equity risk premium and a 2% risk free rate. The value of the index would be ($3.00*1.05)/(.09-.05)=$78.75. 

Now let’s imagine a pandemic strikes and reduces earnings and dividends to zero for two years. At the end of those two years earnings will resume their prior trajectory. The index value would be $78.75/1.09^2=$66.28. 

We could use a more extreme example and assume that after two years of zero earnings, dividends and earnings return to their prior levels but increased debt reduces their growth rate to 4%. In this case the index value would be (($3.00*1.04)/(.09-.04))/1.09^2=$52.52. 

So a complete loss of two years of earnings and a permanent reduction in growth only leads to a 33% in the present value of future cash flows generated by the index. 
 
Now we also have to lower the risk free rate used in these calculations to reflect the lower interest rates we have now. Let’s assume zero earnings for two years, a permanent reduction in the long term growth rate of 1% and a reduction of the risk free rate from 2% to 1%. That produces a fair value for the index of (($3.00*1.04)/(.08-.04))/1.08^2=$66.87

This represents just a 15% decline in the index. The 1% decline in the risk free rate offsets a lot of the decline in future cash flows. Those of you predicting 50% declines in major indexes are essentially saying that you believe earnings will decline massively and not recover for a decade. 

I know I’m omitting a lot of important variables here. This is just a simple dividend discount model. I know that there are serious concerns about inflation, deflation, FX volatility and their effects on earnings and the equity risk premium that we could discuss all day. I think these concerns are what caused the initial 35% decline in markets and the DXY surge to 102.5. However, the Fed has made it very clear that they are conscious of the shortage of dollars and are using swap facilities to remedy this. I can link articles supporting this if people get too riled up in the comments about it. 

TLDR: Even if earnings decline to zero for two years and long term earnings growth is reduced substantially, a decline massive decline in equity prices is unwarranted. If you believe otherwise, the burden of proof is on you to provide the combination of variables that explain that scenario.",finance

So right now I am 23 years old, and I’m trying to come up with a plan to purchase my first house, or at least move out of my parents home, the right way. I have done my research, and feel like purchasing property is better than renting an apartment, especially since interest rates are so low at this time. 

Currently I have $7,000 in savings. I work 2 part time jobs, one to cover bills and one that goes directly into savings. I also have a side business that brings in an additional ~$700 monthly. So roughly, my monthly income is $2,200. 

I’m not looking for anything fancy at all. In fact I’m really looking at a mobile home. My budget is $100,000. 

The main issues I keep coming to, are:
1.	Most mobile homes won’t be financed
2.	Most will require a lot of work
3.	Most other homes in my area start at $140,000

I also know mobile homes depreciate in value, but the grand plan would to eventually move out of it and keep it as a rental property in the future. 

Lots of ideas here, but what’s the best course of action for me? Any feedback will be helpful.

personalfinance,Need Mortgage Lender Advice,"I am a 26 year old male that will start as a resident physician on July 1st of this year. Since I will be living in a cheap cost of living city for the next 5 years minimum I decided to buy a house. I have good credit (\~750), about $180k in student loans ($300 minimum monthly payment), and will be making about $55k next year, increasing by around 3k or so a year for the next 5 years. I am going into a field that is consistently one of the highest paying medical specialties.

I recently went under contract on a house that I love that costs $220k, and am trying to compare the options I was given by 3 different mortgage lenders and figured some of you here would have better knowledge and insight than I do.  My girlfriend will be moving up with me in the next couple months as well and will be contributing to at least half the monthly costs (she is a PA with 6 figure salary). I have enough in savings to live comfortably for a bit, but not enough to make a sizable down payment so I am utilizing a physician loan with no down payment and no PMI. I reached out to 3 lenders in the area to compare rates and they are as follows:

Bank 1: offered me a 3% interest rate on a 30 year, 5/1 ARM with 2/2/5 caps ($955 monthly payment interest + principle)

Bank 2: offered me 2 options, a 15 year fixed 4.4% interest rate ($1671 monthly interest + principle), or a 4.59% interest rate on a 30 year, 6/1 ARM  ($1180 monthly interest + principle)

Bank 3: offered me a 3.75% interest rate on either a 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 ARM all for 30 years, with the ability to reduce the rate by .1% if I switch my bank account to them ($1018 monthly interest + principle for 10 year, not sure on other options yet)

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what the pros and cons of some of these would be in terms of building equity, overall rates, etc. I plan on most likely selling the house in 6-7 years, so would like to build as much equity as possible since it is in an area that should appreciate $20-30k in that time based on past data (I am aware this past data can't predict future growth, but is the best predictor I have at the moment).

investing,WSJ Exclusive: Boeing Considers 10% Cut to Workforce,"Boeing Co. BA 3.38% is considering a plan to reduce its workforce by about 10%, people familiar with the matter said, as the aerospace giant grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

The plan could involve buyouts, early retirements and involuntary layoffs.

The potential labor cuts at the aerospace giant, which globally employs about 160,000 people, were expected to largely target Boeing’s commercial arm, these people said. The unit is under tremendous strain due to turmoil in the global airline industry.

No decision on cuts was imminent, one of the people briefed on the matter said, and the potential 10% reduction was among scenarios under consideration. Boeing is aiming to shrink its workforce through buyouts and attrition before turning to involuntary layoffs, this person said. It wasn’t immediately clear how any cuts would affect Boeing’s defense and services arms.

Last week, the plane maker announced it would offer voluntary layoff packages, but hasn’t released details, including how many employees would be eligible. Boeing has said it expected several thousand employees to take advantage of the offer.

Boeing hasn’t said whether it plans to apply for government loans provided under a new $2 trillion federal stimulus package enacted in late March. Conditions for some of the aid would require certain loan recipients to maintain at least 90% of their workforce through Sept. 30.

Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun, in announcing the voluntary layoffs last week, said the offer “aims to reduce the need for other workforce actions.” Mr. Calhoun has stressed the need to protect Boeing’s workforce so the plane maker will be ready for the airline industry’s eventual recovery.

The commercial arm’s customers have parked much of their fleets around the world as governments close borders and order would-be passengers to stay at home. Airlines are considering deferring deliveries of airliners or paring back orders. Boeing’s European rival Airbus SE has said it was slashing production by about a third amid the airline industry’s woes.

A number of Boeing suppliers and customers have moved to reduce their labor costs. Last month, General Electric Co., a major Boeing supplier, said it would cut about 10% of the U.S.-based workforce in its jet-engine business. Up to half of the division’s maintenance and repair staff would be furloughed for three months, the company has said.

The plane maker, which is expected to report first-quarter earnings later this month, hasn’t disclosed any changes to its jetliner production rates.

investing,"On the Topic of Bailouts, Why is Everyone so one-sided about it? Extending a bailout can help the gov't too, if the price is right","Bailouts have become a hot topic in recent weeks, and I think people are missing a key point.

This has turned into a ""rich corporation vs little guy"" debate. It really doesn't have to be. Giving a bailout can be *amazing* for the government too. Just charge Boeing 12% interest.

You know when a Bailout is horrible? If you charge a measly 1 or 0% interest.

I honestly am pretty annoyed at how binary everyone's making this entire situation. It's not about the ""rich corporation getting away with murder."" Honestly, no one could see a flood like coronavirus coming. Yes, they made some mistakes with the Max and with buybacks. So, charge them 12% interest! Boeing's happy because they have a loan which they couldn't have got elsewhere, and the government's happy because it loans $50 billion and probably gets back \~$70 billion in 3 years.

Buffett did something similar on his Bank of America deal. $5 billion in warrants, which were eventually worth $17 billion. There is *clearly* a path to do something similar here. The gov't should tell Boeing-you want to be bailed out, fine. Make sure we get a giant return, and you have a deal.

This isn't a binary ""MUHHHHH BaIlOuTs ArE bAd"". I'll be the first to admit that a bailout at 0% interest rates would be horrible. If the U.S. gov't gets a high enough interest rate, there's no better way for them to spend 50 billion than to loan it to Boeing.",finance

For those who aren't familiar, I Bonds are a directly-purchased government bond capped at $10k/year/SSN which adjusts semi-annually to keep up with inflation. Your money is locked up for the first year, then subject to a 3-month interest penalty for redemptions for four years after that. But, all interest can be deferred until the end of the 30-year period, so this is a nice way to hold bonds outside of your tax-advantaged account space without incurring taxable income during your peak earning years.

I Bonds are about the best risk-free return you're going to find and, for people maxing out their 401ks and Roth IRAs and otherwise at the end of the steps in [How to handle $](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and still have $10k+ to spare, I Bonds may be a good fit.",finance
Chainlink,"US digital dollar coming soon? Chainlink, Swift, Federal Reserve, ISO20222, and The Clearing House serving as pieces of the puzzle.","This is my first Reddit thread, so please feel free to contribute your thoughts.

I believe the US digital dollar will be making its debut very soon, which could very well likely be the next One World Currency. I've included a timeline of public releases/announcements that fall in line with my theory.  Bear with me, there are lot of moving parts.... There may be some details or insights missing so please feel free to enlighten.  I believe this will, in time, lead to a New World Order with one global currency.  I would like to be proven wrong.

First things first, there are 3 big players: The Federal Reserve, The Clearing House, and SWIFT with ISO20222 system.

What is CHIPS? The Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) is an electronic payments system that transfers funds and settles transactions in U.S. dollars. CHIPS enables banks to transfer and settle international payments more quickly by replacing official bank checks with electronic bookkeeping entries. As of January 2002, CHIPS had 59 members, including large U.S. banks and U.S. branches of foreign banks.

This led to the *2015 Strategies for Improving the Payment System* paper, in which the Fed recommended that the U.S. develop a strategy for adopting the standard. Since that time, the Fed and The Clearing House (TCH) have worked together on plans to adopt ISO 20022 for Fedwire and CHIPS.

stocks,Feds and Market,What are the real consequences of the feds introductions trillions of dollars into the economy? One can’t just simple introduce trillions of dollars into circulation without any real consequences.,finance
investing,The case that we are in a new bull market and the bottom was reached,"To preface this. My gut had been telling me we are going to drop below the Mar 23 lows again with all the bad news still coming, record unemployments, missed mortgage and lease payments etc.
**But my brain is now telling me will not revisit the bottom again related to the pandemic crisis** (what i mean is the lows will be hit again only if we have another black swan event, like a sudden nuclear war or impending asteroid impact)


1.) Government action was lightning swift and aggressive compared to the GFC. The pandemic occurred well before the upcoming elections, which means Congress didn’t need to wait for months to act like in 2008. The first round of 2 trillion dollar stimulus was passed on March 27. Second and FURTHER rounds are upcoming, and even JPow has encouraged it in statements made yesterday: 

&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday said it would ""absolutely"" be a good idea for Congress to pass additional fiscal stimulus to support a U.S. economy frozen by nonessential business closures and social distancing guidelines implemented to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

2.) As everyone knows now, yesterday the Fed is also going to expand their plans to buy up junk corporate bonds and give out money to midsize businesses, and state/local governments to the staggering tune of 2.3 trillion. 

3.) Yesterday also JPow indicated the Fed will likely bailout private company mortgage servicers such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage Corp etc:

&gt; “We’re watching carefully the situation with the mortgage servicers,” Mr. Powell said in an interview with the Brookings Institution, hours after the Fed announced new programs to provide up to $500 billion in credit to state and local governments and $600 billion to midsize companies.

&gt;Mr. Powell on Thursday noted that the mortgage companies make up “a key market that does support households and consumer spending, really, which is of course 70% of the economy.”

4.) COVID deaths are lower than expected and peaking earlier than expected. Markets are assuming high probability of reopening the economy sooner than anticipated 

5.) On March 15, JPow slashed interest rates to ZERO. The equity risk premium has shifted much higher. Why should institutional investors buy treasuries that are yielding less than the rate of inflation, when they can jump into stocks for the comparatively juicy dividend and increased ERP?

6.) Smart money and institutions have realized far far earlier than you, that the record unemployment right now is much less impactful than the trillions pumped in by Fed and government. Why? Well thanks to the massively insane income/wealth inequality in this country, if you look at the 16 million record unemployment claims and add up the total income lost, they are comprising only 0.3% of the total personal income. That’s right- ZERO POINT FUCKING THREE. Markets don’t give a fuck that POOR people in the restaurant, travel, and retail industries lost their jobs.

7.) When you look at the 1987, 2002, and 2008-2009 crashes, whenever the stock market had recovered 50% of the losses, it was already well on its way to completing the next high of the new bull market. If we close above 2792.69 on SPX, it will be confirmation that the bottom had already passed. And if you also look at the prior crashes, recovery to 50% takes about half the time it took to crash. 
We fell for six weeks, and now 3 weeks from the march 23 bottom we are already closing in on 50%. 
It also takes three times the duration of crashing to reach ATH if you look at the prior events- meaning we could be SPY 330 before September or October.

8.) In every recession related crash, markets have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE jobless claims PEAKS. They have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE consumer sentiment bottoms out. Waiting for fundamentals to get better means you missed the lows long long ago.


9.) Finally. Institutional investors and pensions have been selling at the “highs” of the market throughout the last two years. Retail and households were buying heavily during that period (see table in  https://m.imgur.com/a/LLE44va) Stock buybacks were propping the market up in 2019. You can now bet your bear ass that institutions were and are still pouring the cash on the sidelines right into the dips and recent March 23 bottom, while you, the horrified retail investor, either sold at the low or are currently staying short and are now flabbergastingly foaming at the mouth sputtering “BuT It HAs to Go dOWn”",finance

investing,Tool to bet against southern european government interest rates,"Hey everybody, as mentioned in the title, I'm trying to make up a list of all the possible derivatives I could use to profit from a significant rise in interest rates for southern european government bonds. I want to make sure I don't miss one type of opportunity so I can make the most informed decision.

If you wonder why, simple : The debt/GDP is already gigantic with a structural deficit and an incoming drop in tax revenu and explosion of spendings to relaunch the economy.

Why South Europe ? Simple : The ECB said very clearly their mission is not to reduce the spread between Germany and other countries.

personalfinance,Financially illiterate &amp; looking for guidance...,"I know there's no excuse not to figure it out, but I just cannot wrap my head around financial planning and understanding what is right for me. So I'm hoping you kindhearted people will give me some advice and withhold judgement on my ineptitude :) If I use the wrong language anywhere, I apologize!

Any resources other than hiring a financial planner that I can't afford are appreciated, and I've already read through the wikis :)

I'm in my late 20's and I have had 3 jobs in the past 12 months- it sounds bad but it's not really. This is one of my main points of confusion-- what do I do with my 401k earnings? I expect to be at this current job for a long time and luckily, my employment status is not impacted by COVID-19, as I am pretty essential. I also don't know what to do with my savings. Here's a general picture of my finances:

Salary: $71k. Bonus could be up to an additional 10% but is mostly determined by annual company performance, so with COVID-19 it is probably not all guaranteed.

Checking Acct: Anywhere from $2-4k. If it's under 2k, I pull from savings to be safe, but this usually only happens when I have insane expenses like travel, large bills(usually from medical expenses or travel), etc.

Savings Acct 1: $2.5k. I don't contribute, it doesn't earn much in interest, I think maybe .5%? This was supposed to be a travel fund but I kinda just left it alone forever.

Savings Acct 2: $84k. This is the account I have always direct deposited from my pay checks. I try to put in at least $1000/mo but with my new job I took a pay cut and it's gone down to about $750/mo. This is what I pull from if my checking acct gets below $2k, or for large expenses like travel.  This is where I feel like I should make the most adjustments- 84k in savings seems like it's too much just sitting around. In my head it's my designated house/wedding + emergency fund. None of which are happening in the next 2-4 years. What do I do with this? High interest savings account?

Loans: Car loan, about $9k left. I pay $280/mo and am in my 3rd year of the 5 year loan. I just tried logging in to get specifics but their website is down. Will update when I can.

Debt: Other than the car, none.

Credit Cards: I have a Discover credit card that I never use because the benefits are never good/useful, and then the Chase Sapphire Preferred that I am putting a lot of purchases on to earn points. I have 4 weddings coming up at the end of the year that I am attending, 3 of which are out of state/country, so I'm trying to fly for free to at least one. I have excellent credit and never carry a balance.

Cost of Living: Roughly $1400/mo.. 50% of my monthly income covers about 95% of this, 90% of the time. I am not sure of the exact amount yet because I haven't gotten a paycheck with my benefits taken out of the pre-tax amount yet, so it's a rough estimate right now. Some months I do spend more on ""fun/misc"" than others and maybe twice a year I break even due to gifts, medical expenses, donations, travel, etc. usually always around the holiday season. I try not to stick to a strict budget because it gives me extreme anxiety, but I just try never to touch my savings.

CD: 2 year CD at 1.5% interest with about 30k. I consider this retirement savings I guess, and try to just get the best interest rate every time it vests. Should I do something more aggressive with this?

Roth IRA: $2k. it used to be way more until COVID19 :( I contribute $50/mo. Probably a stupidly minimal amount to contribute. Should I get the $ to contribute to this from somewhere other than my checking acct?

401k from Job #1: $19k. Not contributing, no longer with the company.  I am thinking about rolling this into my Roth IRA but then I will have to claim all $19k as income...or should I invest it in mutual funds instead? What option is ""more worth it""?

401k from Job #2: $5.5k. Not contributing, no longer with the company. Leaning towards rolling all of it over into my current 401k.

401k from Current Job: 50% match on up to 6% of my salary. I am contributing 9% right now. Is this too much? Should I just contribute 6% and take the other 3% into my Roth IRA?

I really appreciate any suggestions!!",finance

I am a 24 y.o male living in BC, Canada and I make 50k a year pre-tax. I take home \~$3200 a month after taxes. No student debt. 

I live at home, no bills to pay except a car I bought off my parents and my phone bill which is $61.60 per month. Roughly about 5k left on the car that I plan to pay 1k per month to them. Will know how much I have to pay on insurance once we renew it with the new ICBC rules.   
The only things i spend money on are food when going out with friends, badminton, and the occasional steam game. Other than that I just dump roughly half of what I earn into my TFSA account first.  

Right now all my accounts are with TD Bank. I've been with them for years so I've stuck with them.

1. $3k in my chequings account (minimum balance otherwise there's a $10.95 fee per month)
2. $1k in an everyday savings account in case I need something. 
3. $21k sitting in a high interest TFSA savings account. 

So what I want to know really is what options do I have in terms of investing? I know I can purchase GIC's but those don't really seem too enticing. Should I switch banks with a higher interest rate and invest in mutual funds or bonds? To be honest I don't really know anything about either of those.

**Why Rally Might be temporary:**

1. analysts are projecting very mild earnings impact (analyst is currently projecting [\-0.1% revenue decline and 8.5% earnings decline](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_040920.pdf) for Q1)
2. Recent strong performance is largely contributed by certain stocks being short squeezed (e.g. cruise lines, hotel chains and airlines)
3. Economy does not recover within the expected timeline of 3-6 months

**Why Rally might not be temporary:**

1. High unemployment numbers incentivize further stimulus package
2. Existing stimulus package is enough to help businesses to weather through the storm
3. Increased investment in safe havens --&gt; lower long-term interest rate --&gt; making weak / uncertain earnings to appear attractive

**Other factors affecting market:**

1. Whether OPEC+ negotiation reach sufficient cut to balance oversupplied oil market (currently, market expects &gt; 10 mbpd)",finance
personalfinance,Need advise on what moves to make next.,"Hi everyone. 

I'm finally getting kind of financially stable in life. No more living paycheck to paycheck. I want to move forward making smart moves. 

I make about 35k a year. My only debt is my car loan I have about $12,000 left on it, with an interest rate of 12%.

 I utilize my credit card minimally so that's easy to pay off every month. 

I'm going to be moving in with my boyfriend within the next month and paying way less rent than I am right now.

I have about 7k in savings right now.

I am stuck on what I should do next to get towards my goals. I would like to buy a house within the next year or so. The housing market for purchases should be really good for buyers after this epidemic. So I am feeling really rushed.  I'd like to save up as much money as I can for a decent sized down payment.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Should I dump my savings to help pay off my car right now?

personalfinance,Alliant Credit Union - Payee list vastly lacking in Bill Pay? Ally Bank any better?,"Evening everyone,

Every Payee I've tried to setup so far all say ""Not found"" when doing a search.

Can anyone confirm the following:  Union Savings Bank of OH / Navy Federal (to pay the Amex), Penfed?

I only see very large banks like the Typical Wells Fargo, BOA, etc. that get any hits when searching for Payees.  I hate to think I've spent this time setting up this account looking for really speedy ACH transfers and here the most important payees are all ""paper check"".

FWIW - Navy Federal and Penfed find every Payee I have and they're all electronic.  I must be missing something - this can't be right.

Before I get an Ally account - can anyone check to see if Union Savings Bank of OH / Penfed (Visa or Credit cards) / Navy Federal (credit cards) can be setup as payees?  I would appreciate it so much.  Maybe I've been spoiled?",finance
personalfinance,COVID stimulus check? (US federal tax question),[removed],finance
personalfinance,Credit Union pulled my credit report and mortgage isn’t considered on report.,"I recently inquired about refinancing my auto loan since my credit has jumped significantly in the last year after purchasing my first home. 

Current loan was a $21,000 used car purchase last year with a 5.7% APR for 72 months. 

My latest credit report when I refinanced after 1 year with my mortgage showed my credit was around 780-790. This was in September, and since then I have not opened up any new credit cards, new loans, etc.

When the credit union refinancing my car pulled my credit report, they ran a hard inquiry from Experian (and only Experian) and told me my credit was only 740. 

The rep told me they only use Experian reports and when I asked him about what showed up on my report, we concluded that the report didn’t show my mortgage history. This difference in credit was the difference between a 3.3% APR and a 4.7% APR on my new auto loan, and naturally he re-assures me that it wouldn’t effect how much interest I pay over the life of the new loan - $13,000 for 48 months. 

Payments aren’t my concern, just how much I’m paying in interest before my car is paid off. 

My question is: is it really worth delving deeper to get a interest rate difference of 1.5% APR on a $13,000 loan? I always pay heavy on my payments anyway, and I paid off $8,000 towards principle in a little over a year. 

Any advise is greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance
investing,This is why the market is not dropping further right now. And market indicators to look for.,"You’ve seen it said before, “the data isn’t in yet”. There is actually a lot more truth behind this than many think. Savvy investors do not make major sell moves without having data supporting indicators of a pending recession. 

I have been redesigning my own long-term investment strategy (which was posted earlier, but I plan to post later with major improvements), based largely on Business Cycle investing theory. There are several key market indicators savvy investors use to help understand where we are in the business cycle, and conversely, whether they should buy, hold, or sell. 

I took the key indicators from the TSP Allocation Guide website and modified the descriptions in a way that makes more sense to me and is easier to follow. I will paste it below. Follow the links to look at the key indicators and you will realize the data is not yet sufficient to say we have reached a recession. Keep an eye on these though, because once the numbers come out people will likely start making larger moves one way or the other.

Indicators Explained
Copied from TSP Allocation Guide and modified for clarity (source at end of post)

(1) Employment Numbers: no indicator has more closely tracked the business cycle than labor force participation rates (which is the ratio between employed workers and all people in that age range), and the unemployment rate (which is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force). To make it very simple, as long as the unemployment rate is declining, that indicates to me that we are in the early recovery/expansion phase. When it flattens out, we are usually in the prosperity phase. As unemployment starts to increase, even a little, we are generally well into the late prosperity phase. And when unemployment increases dramatically, we are in recession.

Unemployment: https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm#
               
(2) Money Supply Growth Rate: this is an index of deposits at commercial banks and other institutions which accept deposits and is called M2. The growth rate corresponds well with the growth rate of GDP, and is generally available more quickly than GDP so it is a more timely indicator. Declining M2 and GDP may indicate a pending recession.
M2: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2
GDP: https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product

(3) The Stock Market: the market generally anticipates movements in the economy – in recessions profits and earnings are down so stock prices should begin to fall as soon as a recession is anticipated by the market. Every post-World War II downturn in the economy has been at least matched, if not anticipated, by the stock market. The problem is that there have been several downturns in the stock market which didn’t turn into recessions (the October 1987 crash, for example, which was followed by several years of continued growth). This should not be the only indicator used.
S&amp;P 500: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx Premarket Data: https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets/

(4) Yield Spreads: the difference between yields on long- and short-term government bonds, and the difference between yields on high- and low-grade bonds. Both of these have been useful in predicting downturns in the economy historically, but actions taken by the Federal Reserve to artificially hold interest rates low for extended periods of time (as it is currently doing) can throw the predictive value of these spreads into doubt.

(5) Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI): monthly surveys of private sector companies which measure both sentiment and hard numbers. Important for projecting are the trends indicated by comparing the current numbers to those from past months.

personalfinance,"If you are in the US and have student loans, if you can keep paying them during the next few months, you should.","All federal student loans are temporarily interest free, this means that any payments towards them go entirely to paying down your principal and this will save you money in the long run.  So if you still have a source of income I would highly suggest paying them down during this period.  


Edit: as the responses have poured in, I have realized that this is only the optimal strategy for some people.  It would be better to consider if you have other higher interest loans that could benefit from slightly higher payments for the next few months.  Just consider what you can do with the money that would otherwise be going to these loans and figure out what is best for your particular situation.",finance
defi,Will Defi eventually allow people to be their own banks?,"Is it possible for Defi to let people become their own banks? Can it even happen now? 

I'm trying to wrap my head around the world of defi. And I'm sure what I am saying sounds obvious but I am ultimately interested in how this can be done and if it could even be done now. 

Lets say for instance, someone got paid Dai directly from their job into a wallet. A smart contract automatically takes that Dai and purchases some form of interest gathering asset on a decentralized exchange. This could be something such as compound loan for a higher interest rate than a stable coin or  tokenized real estate. Another smart contract gives a person a percentage of their asset's value in a credit line of a stable coin. If the person uses the credit line, they pay whatever interest on the credit line which is hopefully less than the interest gathered from their collateral so they are basically gathering high yield savings on what is essentially a checking account (ie 10% interest on tokenized real estate vs a 2% interest loan in dai gives 8% interest on very liquid assets) This credit line could even be connected to a bank that offers it in a visa card (not an easy task though). 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to allow people to use their money to invest in assets much like a bank does and then still be liquid with their money. A liquid savings account that people can control very simply where their money goes. Issues I see are fluctuation in the collateral price. That's why I think tokenized real estate is good. Also I believe bonds are being tokenized so maybe that could be a stable form of collateral. Maybe it would be economically impossible for someone to get a dai loan with a low interest rate where this makes sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Is this possible? Is this already happening? Where am I going wrong? I need someone to help talk about this with.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay credit card or save money. It as simple as you might think.,"I have $14,400 in credit card debt. I live with my parents and they don’t charge me rent because I do things for them. And I don’t have student loans. Since my Dad doesn’t drive anymore he has let me use his car in the time being. Though it doesn’t mean he won’t use it again. And like many I got shit canned from my job. The company I was with was already in bad financial shape and I have every expectation they will cease operation this year even if the economy re-opens.

I want to take advantage of the low interest rate to pay this debt off. I have $5,000 in an online savings account. But this money was meant for a cheap new car because I know I will need one. Or any other major expense like a down payment for a home if things pick up again. 

The problem is my credit card is through my credit union and if I do not make payments they automatically take the payment from my account. This is why I moved my savings to a separate online bank. But if I have no balance in my account the credit union will overdraw my account to pay the monthly due. Or they’d add the amount onto to my credit balance increasing the card balance. 

So if I give them the $3,800 savings, and even the Trump bailout of $2,400. That will take out a good portion of principal, but then I’m left with the remaining balance of $8,200 left to pay on this card. And if I can’t they’ll just charge the balance right back up and that money gave me no value. 

I also thought about freezing my credit to see if that prevents the auto charging for payment. They claim they do this “because that way payments are never late.”

I also have $1,000 I dropped in the stock market. I wanted to use my bailout money to seek an opportunity there. 

What would be good? I am looking for work, I’ve been trying to get a new job since 2017. But even before this event employers weren’t hiring, so now it will be a long time before I have steady work.",finance

personalfinance,Does never buying a used car still apply in my situation?,"EDIT: Title should say never buying a NEW car.  Also some formatting edits.

Hi everyone,

I currently drive a 2003 Honda Accord.  It still runs, however it is starting to show its age (driver's window and radio no longer work, constant rattling).  I have the opportunity to stack several incentives in order to purchase a brand new car.   

These include:

Replace Your Ride Incentive (9,500 off a EV, 7000 off a hybrid, or 4000 off a used vehicle with high MPG)

Federal Tax Credit: (7500 tax credit for an EV)

CVRP: (4000 rebate for EV)

Misc rebates: 1000 back from SoCal Edison, Up to 2k to install charger.

This puts me up to $22,000 off of a brand new EV, however Teslas are not an option anymore due to lack of participating dealerships.  The only caveat is that I must purchase a vehicle within this year, since my MAGI will exceed the limit by 2020 tax season.  I would like a vehicle with good cargo volume, reasonably quick, and low maintenance. I currently drive about 50 miles a day for work, in California where gas is about 2.75 a gallon or so.

Here are my financial stats:

I currently have about $10,000 saved up. I make approximately 90,000 per year, with an additional 20,000 or so from a part-time job on the side in a secure job in the healthcare industry.  I have been maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA since I started working in January.  I take home about $4000 a month, of which $1000 is spent on monthly expenditures.  I also owe my parents approximately $20,000 interest-free, with no rush to pay for it.  I plan on setting aside approximately 1,000 a month for that.

I would love to buy a 2020 RAV4 Hybrid, but unfortunately it does not qualify for the Replace Your Ride incentive. The cars that best fit my needs seem to be the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro EV respectively, which come out to about 16,000-18,000 after incentives and before taxes and fees.  Cars that I am also interested in are the 2021 RAV4 Prime and 2021 Kia Soul EV, but there isn't even a guarantee if they'll be released this year with Covid-19 delaying productions.  Is there anything else I should be considering when making this decision?

personalfinance,No closing cost refinance advice needed.,"The pandemic has messed up the refinance plan that I had set for myself. 

Credit score (via credit karma) is roughly 730

Interest rate on my home is 6.125% (had bad credit at the time and needed an fha loan)

Home value is roughly $147,000 and my current principal is $134,000.

Only about $2000 in savings 


My plan WAS as follows:

Wait for about another year which would help increase my credit score (age my accounts and inquiries would fall off. Never missed a payment and never go over 8% credit utilization and no delinquencies). 

Was hoping interest rates would fall in the meantime. 

Was also hoping my homes value increased some. 

And was trying to save up at least $15k to do a cash IN refi to get my ltv to below 80% and avoid PMI. 



My main goal is to get my payments as low as possible. I also do not ever plan on moving. 



So then corona comes along. Income wise it has not affected me at all. Me and my partner are essential and our jobs would compensate us if we were to catch the virus (city government and healthcare employee respectively). 

Normally I would continue along with my plan but I am absolutely terrified of another housing market crash which would theoretically lower my homes value AND raise refi rates.

Which brings me to my question. 

Considering how low refi rates are now and how uncertain the future is, is a no cost closing cost a bad idea? Or should I wait and see what the future holds?

I do not have enough in savings to spare and my credit score isn’t high enough to get optimal rates, but the rates themselves are historically low and I do not plan on moving. I wouldn’t have the ltv to get rid of the pmi but I could get rid of that eventually and as it stands with an fha loan I cannot. 

I appreciate any and all advice.",finance

investing,"Based on this simple calculation, the stock market is currently very cheap","The implied earnings of the SPX index if it were a stock was about 155 before the coronavirus kicked off. I'm assuming a 2% growth rate in earnings annually. Fed rates were 2%, I'm also adding a 4.5% risk premium on top of that. Assuming earnings grows 2% a year, and summing up the next 100 years of earnings discounted at 6.5% annually brings us to about 3400 which was roughy where SPX was before all this began.

Now the coronavirus hits. I'm open to hear other people's guesses for what impact this will have on earnings over the next few years but I'm going to assume 0 earnings for 2020, a 50% discount vs 2019 for 2021, and then back to normal in 2022 followed by a resumption of 2% annual growth. If anything, I would say this is aggressive. The impact of this is a new fair value in the SPX of 3150, or an 8% drop vs this years high.

&amp;#x200B;

That's already far above where we are now, but its leaving out a key element. Interest rates have dropped substantially. This makes equities worth more. If bonds are yielding 2% a year, then a stock that earns 7 dollar a year might be worth 100. When bonds go down to yielding 0.5% a year, suddenly that stock earning 7 dollars a year looks a lot more attractive and might be worth 125 now.

Instead of assuming that future earnings are discounted at 6.5% (2% fed rate + 4.5% risk premium), lets instead assume they're discounted at 5% for the next 10 years (0.5% implied 10 year yield + 4.5% risk premium), 5.5% for the next 20 (1% implied 30y yield + 4.5% risk premium) and then again 6.5% after that.

Plugging this in with our new earnings estimate gets us to a fair value in SPX of 3500... higher than before the crash and 25% above where we are now!

The problem with the bear case is that treasuries are yielding close zero, safe corporate debt yields are lower than they were. For institutional investors with lots of money to invest, equities just look far superior to everything else and actually look quite cheap right now. Bad short term earnings don't matter too much as long as they recover within the next couple of years.",finance

*****
&gt; Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.
*****
&gt; Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson &amp; Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.
*****
&gt; “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.”
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.
*****
&gt; “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’”
*****
&gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.
*****
&gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.
*****
&gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.
*****
&gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.
*****
&gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.
*****
&gt; ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan.
*****
&gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.
*****
&gt; “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.”
*****
Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.
*****
“The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.
*****
Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.”

# Big Annual Declines Are Rare

&gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.

&gt; “A positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”

&gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?

&gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.

&gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.

# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After

&gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.

&gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.

&gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.

&gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.

# Gold Up, Dollar Down

&gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**

&gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.

# All or Nothing Days on the Rise

&gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.

&gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**

&gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.

# Volatility Remains High

&gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.

&gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.

&gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**

&gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**

&gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.

# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market

&gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.

&gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.

# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders

&gt; Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**

&gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.

personalfinance,Repaying a 401k loan while the market is down?,"Hi everyone

I took a $50k 401k loan when we purchased our new home to use towards renovations. 3.42% interest rate for 10 year that auto deducts from my paycheck every 2 weeks $175 and change. 

I am curious how it works if I want to make additional payments now while the market is low. When paying into it does it buy back the funds it was invested in at the new market price? If that is how it works is it smart to put money back into that faster knowing that it will eventually turn around? Or is investing in other mutual funss in other mutual funds outside of my 401k a better use of my money right now. 

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,It's been 8 weeks since I sent my federal tax refund out. IRS has no record of it. Should I resend?,"Been using the ""Where's my Refund"" page on the IRS website and it always says they have no information for me. I went into my TurboTax account and was able to check the status of my refund. TurboTax has no information on my federal refund, but it says my state refund was filed on Feb.12 by mail.

I know for a fact I dropped both those envelopes in the same mailbox at the same time. Did that tax return get lost in the mail or do you think something else is holding it up? I claimed a solid student tax credit this time around, not sure if that would increase the processing time.

My current plan is to just resend my papers. I would efile but for the life of me I can't find that option right now on TurboTax's website, and I remember running into some sort of issue trying to do it the first time around. The website just keeps congratulating me for filing. How ironic.

Just looking for a little advice to get my head straight. Not sure if sending again would screw things up if they actually did receive. Thanks everyone for reading",finance

investing,"Algos move the market in the short term, not retail/institutional/pension funds","My title of my post is the statement I stuck too from the very moment this selloff started. I've stayed consistent with this belief the entire time, whether we go up or down. If you just wanted any more proof, take a look at the Twitter link, as an additional piece of evidence. It's the same case in the recent up moves (the futures are contributing to the majority of the recent up move). 

https://mobile.twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1248368169091239937

Retail, institutional investors, pension funds, etc. - they don't trade overnight futures. However you know who does? Stat arb algos as well as option trading firms/hedge funds/prop trading firms/bank risk-mitigation algos. For example if a hedge fund was put into a dicey risk situation, they turn on these algos to offload risk overnight. If they can't sell credit risk, they have to do it elsewhere like in ES futures. If an option market maker is short gamma and realizes oh crap, this is gonna cause me to be super long tomorrow with this move in ES, I've gotta hedge and turn on my overnight algo to sell first so I get less long deltas overnight. 

So when you guys want to ask ""who in the world is even selling"" as we sold off and now ""who in the world is even buying"" as we go up, it's the algos. You are right, not many actual people are buying these days. It's the algos, and when I say algos, I mean the risk/liquidity algos.

Do you want to know why the algos are buying now? It's simple. Jerome Powell said he's buying credit ETFs. If you are a market maker, you have to sell these ETFs to them. Now you have to find a beta hedge. What's the best way to find that beta hedge? Buy ES futures. This then causes SPY to open higher. Now, if your algo was fast enough, you could have front ran the FED by buying HYG and JNK (this is why their NAV is trading at a massive premium), but if you weren't, well you get desperate as you get picked off from being short credit, so now you have to buy ES, SPY, and anything else you can. You might have to then buy SPX/SPY puts with it since you then have to protect your now new ES/SPY longs (which you didn't actually want to buy but were ""forced"" to buy),, which is why VIX hasn't dropped that much relative to how much SPY has gone up. It's all an algorithmically driven market. 

This is why the entire market, on BOTH the down move and the now up move, has decoupled from the economy. So no, you guys may think people are FOMOing in. That's not true. Most investors aren't FOMOing in right now. The algos have just gone out of control on both the down and up moves and it's all technical. 

Correlation (with other assets like credit and bonds), positioning (short squeeze and forced liquidations), option gamma (short gamma makes moves bigger), and short term stat arb strategies dominate the market short term. Retail and even big firms like Blackrock or Berkshire do not. Fundamentals win out long term. It may be months for SPY, and it is years for individual companies. No short term movement is ever controlled for by actual people wanting to put on a position. 

As I said a month ago when we were selling off, if Citadel and Renaissance Technologies wanted to hold up the entire market for a day, they easily could. They may not want to if it's not in their favor, but they easily could. Two firms. That's enough. That about sums up this market. (EDIT: this part may have been extremely confusing due to my bad wording, but if you read some of the posts below with like me, MasterCookSwag, and ArseneWankerer, I try to clear up my meaning)

Another interesting and true fact? If options trading was ELIMINATED, the market would NEVER have sold off to 220 and it would have never skyrocketed back to almost 280 now. You may ask it's the same fundamentals right? Yes it is, the fundamentals of the economy and virus are the same, but elimiate options, and actually the entire market changes.

Finally, to add one more thing, if this wasn't clear, there needs to be a catalyst for the first wave of selling and buying, but everything after that is purely technical. For example, the catalysts would have been the virus and the oil shock in the wave of selling. The catalyst would have been the Fed in the wave of buying. However, the catalyst in itself shouldn't have produced a very large move. For example, imagine we go from 290 -&gt; 270 as an example. The catalyst, if only traded by itself, should have moved it from 290 -&gt; 285. However, the algos, with all the technical details I described above, then moves it from 285 -&gt; 270. This is what I call ""forced selling"" or ""fake selling,"" and I've alluded to this in my other posts. There is also ""fake buying"" in the reverse. However, ""fake selling"" is usually more powerful because on average people leverage up to be more bullish than bearish in an average market environment. So yes, the initial catalyst is important, but it's not the reason for the majority of short term moves. 

I worked in the industry so I know this. You can call it a dirty secret, but hopefully if you see some actual statistics (see the above link on Twitter), you'll understand too. Fundamentals eventually will win longer term, but you know that saying about how the market can stay irrational before you stay solvent, well that's literally true because the market is algo driven. And as we progress into a state of better technology and even more options volume (think about how many people just recently started trading options) and other assets, this will be more and more true. One of these days, which could be like in 20+ years,  if some black swan catalyst happens in conjunction with all of these technical factors I mentioned, you literally can see a 20% triple circuit breaker day immediately and like 90%+ of that drop would be all technical.

I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability.

EDIT: So for the people who are pointing out I don't understand what a MM is, let's do a easier example with NFL betting lines. Vegas acts like a MM in this regard.  When an NFL line closes, is it 50/50 on both sides of the line?  Nope.  Vegas is still subject to risk.  That's why sometimes they win or lose a lot of money depending on the outcome of an event, even though they are a ""MM"" too.  Yes, Vegas will adjust a line based on some order flow, but it has their OWN MODELS TOO to determine what is fair, so they will adjust accordingly to the toxicity of the order flow. They will not just completely change their line so much so simply based pure order flow to keep on capturing 50/50.  If you really think an options MM for example goes home every night flat every Greek, you are kidding yourself.  

The point I was making above is a firm such as Citadel does so much volume that they have a huge impact on the market, whereas if you take them out of the market for say a month, the entire market microstructure changes in options and equities.  Notice in my original post, I clearly said that these firms may not actually want to do this in their favor, but I am using them as an example saying they do so much volume they can IF they wanted to (in options you are more likely to do so than equities). I was emphasizing this point to show you guys how algos play such a large role in the market. It's similar to Vegas when they act as a MM to betting lines.  They control the betting line at the end of the day.  They aren't always 50/50 on both sides with no risk.  Of course, Citadel and SIG in options will adjust their vol curves based on some order flow, but at the end of the day, they control most of the options vol pricing, which indirectly also affects equities in a big way when we have massive short gamma moves.

Similarily, apply it to sports betting.  Let's say we shut down Vegas for a month and let only DraftKings price all the betting lines.  I bet you the lines would be different and the volume would be different.  Would they be completely different (like a -3 to a +3 line)?  No, it wouldn't be that extreme, but it would be different and volume would be different and reaction to order flow would be different. Just think about it like this and apply it to trading.

EDIT2: this was also my post like ~3 weeks ago when we were like ~230.  Too bad r/investing deleted my context of my post (since it relates to a lot of what I said below), but you can still see my title and my comments, so you know what I was calling.  Yea sure, you can say I got lucky, but I wasn't wrong.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjtkzh/we_are_very_close_to_the_bottom/

Addressing the above link, it's the type of logic that I am using in my below posts to probabilistically call bottoms like this.  I'm never 100% sure (it's impossible to even be like 70%+ sure imo), but if you put some of this together (like when does the forced selling for the risk/liquidty algos stop?), you can actually call bottoms a bit easier than just winging it 50/50.  Notice that this also coincided with March options expirations, as I mention, options are a big part.  It also conincided with Jay Powell saying he's going to ""alleviate the risks"" (this is the forced selling from algos risk) he sees in the repo and now credit market.

EDIT4: ok last edit but https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp is just a quick example of one phenomenon that happens due to options and market makers.  There's not going to be many articles you can find online on about what I'm talking about, but this pinning the strike phenomenon is a well-observed effect that's actually writen about of what market makers can do in terms of controlling price action due to their risk.  Interestingly, what we have in our case the last month is the opposite of this in which rather than strikes getting pinned, strikes get blown through to cause the huge moves (since we've been in short gamma the last month).  The article isn't super detailed, but can give you a general idea of one effect.

EDIT5: sorry I'll add one last edit...I do realize maybe my wording was not the greatest in my post, and after reading it again, it does sound a bit ""forceful"" at times, so I apologize for that.  This was meant to be more informative, but please don't take it as I am trying to force any one opinion on anyone.  Apologize for that!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice for Best way to pay off 50k Debt,"I am on my phone , hope post looks readable enough.

During a divorce I inherited extra debt on top of what I had. 

Debt in total: (amount/description/interest rate/mo payment)

26k / student loan / 5% / 360

15k /CC / 10% / 300

9k / personal loan / 8% / 430

2.5k /irs tax / I think it’s 5% / 400

———-

Total 52k debt 

Monthly payments: 1490


Few months ago I thought of taking out 50k in my 401k loan at 5.5% to consolidate all my debt and literally 10d later market depleted which is not an option imo. 


I opened a new CC with 0% interest for 21 months and I thought to put the 9k and 2.5k on it pay $600 to avoid interest repayment and then the extra 230 to pay the CC so about $500 a month. 


I still think that paying CC is worst because $500 won’t gain much and take longer to repay. Except maybe 21months later I could pay that $600 towards it and pay $1100 . 


What are some of my different options I could go with? There is some lyndl advisors that sent me offer for 50k at 3.9% but that’s just too good to be true? If that would be a possibility I would pay least amount of interest and be debt free in 4y. 


What other options am I looking at? I definitely am not taking the loan against 401k in this situation as it would be my emergency in case I am out of work for 4-5 month although i can find work within 2-3 weeks. 


Thank you for your suggestions in advance but I really would love to do best and be debt free as fast as I can. Also to note I am not adding anymore credit and slashed my expenses to bare minimum.

personalfinance,Federal Taxes Under Withheld From Paycheck,"Either there is a bug in the system that handles paychecks or I don't understand federal tax rates for paychecks. I assume it's the latter. Can someone sanity check me and fill in the gaps?

Here is some background information.

* Live in the US
* Single
* No dependents
* No other source of income besides the 1 job
* W4 federal allowance is 2. 1 for ""yourself"" and 1 for being ""single"". The federal tax withheld per paycheck is incorrect.
* State personal exemption is 1. The state tax withheld per paycheck is correct.

Here is a table of the 2019 federal tax rate I got from Turbo.

If taxable income is over— | but not over— | the tax is:
---|---|----
$0 | $9,700 | 10% of the amount over $0
$9,700 | $39,475 | $970 plus 12% of the amount over $9,700
$39,475 | $84,200 | $4,543 plus 22% of the amount over $39,475
$84,200 | $160,725 | $14,382 plus 24% of the amount over $84,200
$160,725 | $204,100 | $32,748 plus 32% of the amount over $160,725
$204,100 | $510,300 | $46,628 plus 35% of the amount over $204,100
$510,300 | no limit | $153,798 plus 37% of the amount over $510,300

I thought the amount of federal tax withheld per paycheck would increase as my year to date (ytd) earnings increased similar to the federal tax rate on taxable income above. The system knows my federal allowance too so it should be able to adjust the federal tax withheld accurately so I should owe the government a very minimal amount of money, if any, when I file my tax return. That was not the case.

The system withholds the same percentage for federal tax per paycheck regardless of my ytd earnings and only changes when I change my federal allowance from 2 to 0 and even then, the tax withheld is not correct. It keeps under withholding so I end up owing the government more than I should if it was accurate. How does federal tax withholding really work?",finance
personalfinance,Amend 2019 tax return for IRA&gt;Roth IRA?,"I made 25k gross last year and on tax return, the refund with a traditional IRA gave me a refund of about $450 federal and $500 state CA.  
Then running the calculation with a Roth IRA gave me a refund of $400 Federal and payment of $200 state.

Approximate numbers but **I know the difference was $755** which is 12.5% of $6,000. Which is a great tax rate even if I will be a very frugal retiree pulling out of traditional IRA.  
I also learned about the Savers Credit which would reduce the $200 tax payment to $0?

I have a car currently, I owed $8,600. It's a Ford Focus Titanium. The catalytic converter is out and with other minors things like the sparks plugs and stuff, I'm out like $2400. It has 95,000mi.

What should I do in regards to getting a new car? I have excellent credit and when I first got the car I didn't have any credit so my interest rate wasn't great but wasn't horrible.

Should I get a new car, trade-in my car and take the rest on with the new loan?

Should I get it fixed, sell it and then get a new car with any outstanding debt from the old one on the new loan?

Should I sell my car with its issues, and then figure out the new car?

personalfinance,Preparing for student loan repayment.,"Hi there! Long time lurker here, who somewhat recently finished all courses requirements to graduate. (Digital graduation due in May, yay.) I wanted to ask advice from all of you on how I should tackle my student loan repayment once grace period ends. Currently I owe ~$40,000 on fed loans and ~$60,000 on Sallie Mae. (I know, that’s a huge amount for a bachelor’s degree, but I honestly couldn’t have gone to uni otherwise.) For my federal loans, I’ve decided to do an income based repayment. For SM, however, I am at a loss for what to do. I’ve taken out three loans from them that add up to the given total, and I found out a little too late on the website that consolidation and refinance are not provided options. (Please be considerate when addressing this bit, I literally am the first in my family to go to college in the US, and didn’t fully understand the consequences at the time. All I knew was that it was a way for me to get my degree since all the scholarships I tried applying to strictly required that I be a citizen.) SM also notified me recently how much I will be owing per month for each loan, and they range between ~$270 to ~$350. I calculated it and I owe about $890 per month. 

Right now I'm working two jobs, one at $16/hr full-time and one at 10/hr part-time. Due to Covid-19 however, all my hours are wonky and I'm working 32 hours for my full time job and only 10 hours for part time. That said, I'm earning a total of about $1100 per paycheck. Including what is about $200 a month that I will owe fed loans, I'm literally going to lose a whole paycheck a month to student loans. (These are the values I'm going to run with because I'm putting in the assumption that this pandemic is going to affect work all the way to September which is a few months after I will have entered repayment period.) This means by the time I'm done paying all my other bills and purchasing necessities with the second paycheck, I will have about $300 for myself. 

My question is: is there any way I can knock down the amount I owe for loans that I probably overlooked? If not, what is the best approach in terms of budgeting? I'm currently also looking for a better paying job since I know I'm being underpaid for my degree right now, but as you can see I'm preparing for worst case scenario. 

I beg you, please help me crawl out of this hole I stupidly dug myself in. Thank you &lt;3",finance

investing,Invest in Bond ETFs for alpha in 2020?,"Whether it actually happens or not, I believe it's reasonable at this time to assess the recent upsurge in equities as emotional / technical, rather than based on economic fundamentals, which could / should push stock prices lower from here during the remainder of 2020. 

Given the \*assumption\* that stocks move lower, should investors with excess cash 1) stay out of the market, or 2) deploy cash into a diversified -- or even concentrated -- position in bonds during the drawdown? Do you believe a new investment in bonds right now produces absolute gains (&gt;0% ROI) during the remainder of Q2+? What are your arguments for and against?

For example, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (ticker: TLT) is up \~22% YTD, and is yielding \~2% at the moment. Do such ETFs have further to run up if we retest the March lows, or will they move in conjunction with equities, as we might infer from the March 16 - 18th period, when they appear to have dropped as well?

Lastly, my understanding is the Fed is buying bonds directly from the market to bolster credit and add liquidity. Does this action provide a tailwind to lift Bond prices significantly regardless of stock performance in the next Quarter+ ?

personalfinance,Roth IRA 2019 Deadline,"I created a Roth IRA through Vanguard a while back but haven't done anything on it other than link my bank account. I just noticed that the 2019 contribution deadline is April 15. I have enough money in my checking to max out my contribution for 2019...


My questions are (since I know next to nothing other than I should max 2019 out):


Is it wise to dump 6k into the account even though I haven't set anything else up? It looks like I'm defaulted to contribute to the federal money market fund (VMFXX). 


I tested the waters by adding 20 bucks, so it looks like I can do something with VMFXX once I contribute at least 3k. That being said, am I correct in thinking that if I add that 6k it will sit there unless I specifically choose to put it in this account? Or will it automatically go into VMFXX since I currently only have this account/fund? Additionally, if the money isn't automatically sent to this fund, am I correct to think I could put 3k into VMFXX and then find a new fund to put the other 3k into? If I added that money but did nothing with it during 2019 (within the next 4 days) will that affect anything I contribute for 2020? Or will it just sit there, unaffected by any market changes, and be added to my 2020 contributions until I decide what to do with it?


I'm 30 years old, and would definitely like to put this money in now. Obviously things are pretty messed up right now, but if you also have any suggestions or thoughts on where someone my age should generally put money it would be much appreciated. I think at the moment I would/should go like 90% stocks and 10% bonds.


Again, thank you


Edit: I just want to make sure I got this part down; when you put money into a fund, you're buying shares right? Regardless of share price, the more the better, making this a good time to put money in right? Say I bought 50 shares of something for a total of $500 bucks, the markets get worse, I lose money, but since I hold those 50 shares, once things get better, they could potentially be worth more (in the future), right?",finance
personalfinance,Excess IRA Contribution - how to fix through Vanguard?,"Posting in case anyone can share their tips. 

In early 2019, I made a $6000 contribution into a Vanguard IRA (VMMXX). I also got married in summer 2019 and it turns out that our joint income makes my IRA contribution ""excess"" when filing taxes through Turbo Tax.  

We have two options listed on Vanguard 

a)  Move my holdings in kind to my nonretirement brokerage account. 

b)  Send the distribution via check or directly to a bank account I have on file. 

If I select option 1, it asked where to withdraw the funds from (I select the roth IRA account). It also asked for the receiving account - the only option listed is my brokerage account. However, the page also states that  ""If the excess is being removed from a Vanguard mutual fund account, the in-kind transfer can’t go into a brokerage account.""

Option B does not work for us it wants to withdraw the excess funds from the federal money market settlement fund balance of $1.25 and does not connect to my bank account (I verified that Vanguard still have my bank account on file by initiating a fake transfer). 

I know that I can call Vanguard, but they won't be open until Monday and I expect the line to be busy. Any tips? Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Best loan to pay down right now?,"Hello all,

Amidst everything covid-19, me and my wife are in a very fortunate position where we aren't being financially impacted by everything, and have been working regular hours from home. If anything, we're currently saving money being stuck in our house.

We want to use the savings we're accumulating and the stimulus checks to pay extra on some of our debt, but we're having trouble picking which one is the better one to put a dent in.

**Loan #1** - is a federal student loan which of course has the interest on pause, so all payments right now go directly to principal. Another kicker to this is her employer actually makes an additional payment of $166 towards this loan every month as long as we pay at least the minimum. The $166 is taxable income, whenever the loan is paid off she will stop receiving the $166.

Amount remaining: $23,282.

Interest rate: having trouble right now finding the exact number but it's about 6.5%

Minimum monthly payment: Currently 0, but was $132.01

**Loan #2** - Is a big purchase we made last year. It is a 10 year loan that we've already been paying extra on.

Amount remaining: $16,145 (original $17,351)

Interest rate: 14.5%

Minimum monthly payment: $274.65, anything additional goes directly to principal

So what do you think is the better choice? Taking advantage of the 0% interest on the student loans and paying directly towards principal? Or bringing down the higher interest one?

personalfinance,$2000 CERB fund (Canada). Morally wrong to claim it if not in need?,"If you aren't aware, the Canadian federal government is giving $2000/month to people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic .

Here is my situation: I was working part-time at one job. My time at that job was supposed to end in late April, as I spend summers working a different seasonal job. Due to the virus, my part-time employer and I agreed that it was too risky to expose ourselves to each other for the minimal hours I was working (16hr weeks). I stopped working late March. I am starting my other seasonal job early May. But I am eligible for 1 month's worth of CERB, which is $2000.

I don't need it. I am able to sustain myself with my current financial position. And i wasn't even going to make $2000 if I had kept my part-time job.

Is it morally wrong to take the CERB money? One of my thoughts was to take the $2000, earn 0.9% interest on it for a year, then donate the $2000 to a charity. By making a $2000 donation, I figure I would gain nearly $700 in tax credits. The $2000 CERB is taxable, so say I have to pay $400 in tax on that, but I earn $18 in interest and $700 in tax credits, I end up being $318 positive.

I am just concerned about the morality of taking a government hand out when I don't direly need it. And would going the charity route be a more morally right way to use that money?

THE HOUSING MARKET IS SCREWED!  The bear case:
1/3 of people lost there jobs.  Of those remaining, their savings which are invested in securities just lost a big chunk of a potential down payment on a house.  Despite low interest rates, no one can afford a house right now.  In fact people will be looking to convert their existing house into cash to weather the storm.   Housing prices will fall with oversupply.  
ALL IN FTW, HOUSING IS ABOUT TO BLAST OFF!  The bull case:
Before the ‘crash’ it was a sellers market with pent up demand due to very low unemployment and possibly due to increased VRBO and air BnB participation.  Some of that demand has withered but there are still buyers out there who are ready to take advantage of whatever Fed is offering.  People are sick of their in laws and parents and they want to move out.  Increases in rental demand == increases in housing.   
Oil is down.  Chinese goods are on sale.  Therefore the cost in materials to build is down and builders will take advantage of that.

personalfinance,Would this be a good idea? (refinancing/ prioritizing debt),"Hello all,

Here is a quick summary of my debt situation:
- Car loan ~18k, 350/month, 2.95% interest. currently about 4.6 years left til paid off

- Federal School loan ~20k, 235/month, weighted average of 3.9% interest. currently about 5 years left

-private school loan ~30k, 435/month, 4.46%, 7 years left


Thinking to refinance my private school loan to a 10yr term at 4.6% interest. monthly payment would be about 325.

Seems like shooting myself in the foot, but I plan to follow the Dave Ramsey method of paying the shortest term first. In this case, the car loan. I aim to put in the difference + any extra cash I have on hand to pay it off in less than 2.5 years. Afterwards, I plan to take that money and finish off the private loan. Does this seem like a good idea? Going into a longer term at similar interest rate in order to pay off other debt?

investing,Long-dated puts as a replacement for bonds now that rates are this low,"With interest rates at near-zero is it reasonable to use puts to hedge your bets instead of bonds? I figure if you buy reasonable enough puts nothing too bad will happen if the market goes up assuming they aren't a large part of your portfolio and if things go down you can use the money from the puts to buy in. Corporate bonds might be a better option but even they're a relatively low yield. Didn't see much about it when I tried looking it up so I figure there's a pretty big hole in this logic. But so long as your strikes are high and dated far out it should be fine I'd figure.

Edit: To clarify the idea would be to buy puts with such a high strike youre almost guranteed not to lose the entire premium, but usually lose a little every expiry or time you sell and buy new longer dated puts. This way you basically pay a small amount every x amount of time (selling stock buying safe puts) But in the case your portfolio loses value you can just reduce your options and buy more equity. Looking at it again im not sure if the long dated part matters as much and might actually be worse but so long as you have the high strike price your risk is pretty low.",finance

I hope to go to law school and would love any advice on how to plan for it financially. If I get in, I’ll start in fall 2022, so I’ve a little over two years to plan for tuition and living expenses.

Some financial context:
- I’ll be an international student, so would have to rely on private loans. I don’t have anyone in the US to co-sign them. This probably means fewer loan options with higher than average interest rates.
- No help from family or anyone else, not going to inherit anything, etc.
- No undergrad debt (from a US college) thanks to generous financial aid, or any other loans (except for my credit card which I pay in full each month).
- I’m very lucky to have an income that has let me max out a 401k and a Roth IRA for the past ~9 months (recent grad). 
- I’m optimistically (perhaps naively) assuming that I’m unlikely to be laid off in the next couple of years as my employer is well-capitalized, draws revenue from industries in a good position to weather financial crises, spends a lot on new hire development, didn’t lay off anyone during previous recessions, and work inflow hasn’t decreased lately (working from home). Having said that, I also have to rely on US immigration continuing to let me work here, so nothing’s certain.
- I currently have 15k allotted to my emergency fund which I’m reluctant to touch and another ~10k outside my retirement accounts.

Questions:
- Should I cut down my retirement contributions now to save up as much as possible in a high yield savings account to reduce the amount I’d have to borrow? I’ll still have to take out a ton of loans.
- Or should I continue to max out now and decrease them after law school to pay back the loans, since compound interest makes every dollar invested earlier worth more? On the other hand, loan interest compounds too, so does the answer depend on how the expected average rate of return of the US stock market in the next 40 years compares to the average loan interest rate for the length of my repayment plan?
- If the school offers need based financial aid to international students, do they factor in retirement savings? If I put money in a savings account instead of a retirement account, will that lower the amount of aid I’m eligible for or will that not make a difference?
- Any other suggestions on funding law school?
- Is it a stupid decision to even go to law school given my situation?

I realize there are bigger problems in the world right now, and I’m lucky that this is currently my biggest financial concern. Thanks for reading this far and for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,I can pay for grad school up front but should I take out a loan?,"**TL;DR** I can pay for grad school up front but should I take a loan out to keep money in my pocket for feature plans?

I will be attending grad school this fall for Political Science-International Relations, its only a couple of years along with in-state tuition so thought it would be a good investment 

I'm able to pay every semester's tuition up front (around $3200), in two years it'll come to around $12,800 just for tuition. Should I pay for every semester's tuition up front or should I take out a federal loan and pay it off when I graduate? 

The reason I ask is if it would be smarter to keep that money in my account in case housing prices become affordable and I can use around $15K as a downpayment

Are student loans a deal breaker when buying a home? Also, are there any private student loan companies that could benefit me in any way if I take a loan out from them without falling into the trap of paying interest every month?

investing,The Fall of the US Banking Sector,"Over the last 20 years we have noticed interest rates have been much lower than the previous 20 years, reaching new lows after each cycle. Accommodative monetary policies have become the standard tool to jumpstart economies after each downturn. This is no different in 2020 as we feel the effects of COVID-19 where long term interest rates have again fallen to the same levels as those experienced in the GFC. Low interest rates usually stimulate the financial equities markets by increasing spending and credit, lowering the discount rate and making the higher returns provided by equities more attractive. However, do we see the same effects in the banking sector which has a unique and more direct relationship with interest rates?

Interest rates in Japan and Europe have been at or below zero for the last decade which has also coincided with significant downwards pressure in the stock price of each regions banking sector. I want to investigate the validity of a causal effect in this relationship and how it may affect US banks in the next decade as the US heads back towards the zero lower bound and potential negative rate territory.

**Banking Sector Performance in a Low Interest Rate Environment**

Following the global financial crisis all three bank indices in the US, Japan and Euro area saw their prices drop more than 60% (see Fig. 1). Banks in Japan and the Euro area never saw their prices make meaningful recoveries since in the backdrop of zero to negative interest rates. However, banks in the US recovered to their 2007 highs in the backdrop of increasing interest rates. 

[Figure 1: Central Bank Interest Rates and Performance of Bank Indices Over 20 Years](https://imgur.com/Cu3fCE6)


An argument could be made that this could simply be a reflection of the US stock market having had one of the best bull markets this last decade whilst both Japan and Euro stock markets have struggled. The counter argument is that although the US bank index (KBW) has largely tracked the US market index (SPY) both the Japan and Euro bank indices (TOPIX and SX7E) have de-coupled from their respective market indices (Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50). Both the Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50 have largely recovered their losses from the GFC but again the banks in either region have not. 

[Figure 2: Performance of Bank and Market Indices in Japan, the Euro Area and the US](https://imgur.com/G263RPz)

Another argument one could make is that the difference in price growth could be due to a result of the proliferation of share buybacks that has occurred in the US stock market compared to that of Japan and the Euro area. Banks also usually yield high dividends which are not reflected in the chart in Fig. 1. I don’t have the data to explore the impact of share buybacks and dividends further, but I assume the significant divergence in the indices are little explained by share buybacks and dividends alone.  

For the same trends we see in Japan and Europe to hold true in the US an assumption must be made that the Federal Reserve (FED) will hold interest rates near or potentially even below zero for a significant period. I believe there is a high probability that this will be the case as we saw in 2018 tightening monetary policy resulted in fear in the financial markets. It will become ever more difficult for reserve banks to unwind reserve assets and pull back from accommodative policies as low interest rates become the framework on which the new economy is built on. 

**Interest Rate Effects on Bank Profitability**

First, I want to examine the effect of reserve bank interest rate policies on bank profitability. The impact that interest rate changes will have will depend on a range of variables such as the banks asset and debt portfolio, the maturity gap between its assets and liabilities and non-interest portion of income (such as fee income for products and services). 

The effect of lower interest rates on profitability come directly from the level of rates and the yield curve. The effect of the level of interest rates can be summarized as follows:

* Banks partially fund their operations with retail deposit at rates set as a markdown on market rates. This markdown is compressed as interest rates decrease because the deposit rate cannot fall below zero. Therefore, as interest rates decrease, the net interest rate margin on banks also decreases. 

* Lower interest rates will generally induce more lending and investments in riskier assets in search for higher returns. This is the whole point of accommodative monetary policy (low interest rates) and may increase net interest rate margins. However, this depends on economic conditions as a weak economic outlook (precisely the reason why rates may be low) can limit demand for loans. 

The effect of the yield curve is explained by the operation of banks taking short-term loans and granting longer term loans. Therefore, net interest rate margins are compressed when the yield curve flattens and increased when the yield curve steepens.

If we examine the net interest rate margin of banks in all three regions, we see an overall downtrend, in-line with that of central bank interest rate policies (see Fig. 3). The net interest rate margin is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). The average net interest rate income growth follows the same trend, where the growth is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). 

[Figure 3: Interest Margins and Net Interest Income Performance over the Last 20 Years](https://imgur.com/qa6tGk2)

In all three regions, despite a low interest rate environment, the average net interest income portion of total income remains steady (except for the period following the GFC). Banks have seemingly not been able to supplement the loss in net interest margin with non-interest income through this period. 

In conclusion there will likely be downwards pressure on the income and share price of bank stocks in the US in the next cycle. I don’t believe we will see the same catastrophic failure of the banking sector like we saw in the GFC. Banks are extremely well capitalized with healthy liquidity and stable funding rates following the GFC and resulting stringent regulations through Basel III. Liquidity issues have been further dampened by the FED initiating ‘infinite QE’ and buying up seemingly every type of asset save for equities.",finance

MachineLearning,[P] Face Recognition based Authention for Linux-Facelock,"Face recoginition has been in trend and a lot of researches and developement is still in progress. Face Recognition is an abstract concept having various use cases like use authentication, finding missing person etc. Facelock is one such other use case. Before I talk what is face lock and how it wroks, let me tell you about the common challenges encountered in Face Recognition. Spoofing by photos,3d printed models, differentiating between twins etc. are some of them. Through Facelock, the spoofing by photo has been restricted. Okay I had mentioned facelock couple of times, let me first tell you what is facelock and what it does . 

Typing passwords every time you login to your OS or repeatedly typing passwords for sudo,su commands is surely a repeated task. And sometimes, it seems frustrating too. Facelock provide a system, which will authenticate the user by recognizing their face. Let me explain this.

## Facelock 
Facelock provides you with a fast face recognition system which can be used for authentication purposes. It authenticates users at logins,lock screens, sudo commands on shell, and many other places where you need passwords for authentication.

It recognizes your face whenever a password is needed and asks for passwords only when face is not recognized within a minute. 

To enable facelock you first add your face to database through your webcam. You can control who all can pass through facelock by adding their faces. 

### Features
- Fast Recognition 
- Cannot be spoofed by photos 
- Fallback to password if face not recognized in 60s
- Easy installation
- Easy to use command line tool
- Add/Remove/Update faces from Database
- Less Dependecies 

**Note** : In this current version of Facelock, the security is not the prime feature as it provides a fast alternate for password authentication. 

### Installations
 
For installation and command line guide, visit my  github repo : [Facelock](https://github.com/anish-kmr/facelock#readme)

## Under the hood

There are many face recognition algorithms which can recognize faces. But many of them can be spoofed by photos. **_Local Binary Patterns Histogram(LBPH)_** is a method which can differentiate between photos and real faces based on textures. First LBP Histograms are extracted and then they are compared to other histograms and returns the face with closest histogram. Comparison can be done by several approaches like euclidean distance,cosine distance, etc.(Euclidean in this case)

All these algorithms are available in Opencv-python library.You can also build your own recognizer if you wish.

Now that Recognizer is built , how do we integrate it to Linux to use for authentication?

### Integrating with Linux 

Linux follows Pluggable Authentication Module(PAM) for its authentication purposes. It can be modified to run our scripts for authentication (Recommendede not to remove pre existing scripts). So every time a password is needed, it will first run our python script with face recognition and try to find a familiar face. If not found in 60s, runs the default script and asks for password.



## Conclusion 
In Future versions, Facelock will be able to restrict authentication if eyes are closed.Also having a specified emotion on face may be required to authenticate.

personalfinance,BE - Using compounded interest rates in practice (ETF),"Hi all! 

I understand the theory behind compounding interest rates but wanted to hear how people thought about dealing with limitations in applying it. I mainly invest in ETFs and receive quarterly dividends of around 15 USD per ETF, so these are quite small investments (2-3k each).

The limitations I have to deal with is:
- Dividend tax (33%)
- Transaction Tax (usually a fixed price of 2 EUR)
- Broker fee (percentage of transaction value)
- ETF price &gt; net dividend

Compounding interest makes sense, but in how far are you willing to burn cash to apply it? Do you compile multiple dividends before reinvesting? Is it worth incurring the transaction fee and tax on a quarterly basis, simply to apply this model?

Budgeting,Food Expenses - Tips,"Hey Everyone!

I am finally setting a budget and trying to be a lot more mindful of “wasted money.” One huge expense for me that I noticed when documenting my expenditures is food/dining out.

What do you think is a reasonable budget for food/restaurants each month? I am a 28 year old male living with his girlfriend (I get groceries for both of us part of the time) in Maryland (the prices here are moderate).

I downloaded the “Every Dollar” app and I plan to spend $300 on food and $100 on restaurants (for a couple date nights) in the month of May. 

Any tips to keep the cost of food lower? I eat a ketogenic diet and try my best for grass-fed / wild caught fish when I can. I know they are a little more expensive, but I look at it as I am investing in my health, and cutting down medical bills in the future.

(Copy paste description from youtube. Runs for about an hour just about variables. Really looking for ways to shorten the content)

In this video, we talk about a fundamental topic in programming - variables. Learn how to create variables and how python handles variables. Concept is simplified into variables that can be strings, decimals, integers or dictionaries (to represent complex pieces of data). 

By the end of this video, you hopefully have a better understanding on the following: 

1. How variables work 
2. How to convert non-string data types to string data types 
3. String concatenation 
4. Representing complex data with dictionaries 
5. Simple arithmetic with variables 
6. Converting ADA to Lovelaces 
7. Using the python interpreter to test code out  

For this topic's task, how would you use variables and the dictionary data type to represent a complex piece of data such as your Cardano wallet?

worldpolitics,The United States Postal Service Needs Our Help,"The USPS is an American institution and handles 45% of the WORLD's mail. Please send this email/letter or a modified version to your representative. 

Dear [Any Representative]

As a resident of [Where you live], I am writing to encourage you to support postal reform legislation and financial assistance for the United States Postal Service (USPS). The USPS accomplishes its Universal Service mandate to provide postal services that are equally accessible to and affordable by citizens throughout America. Without it we would see corporations provide unaffordable and criminal rates to citizens in ""unprofitable"" areas of the country.

Post Offices serve as vital community assets and touchstones to the Federal government in small and rural communities. In small towns, Post Offices are a crucial component linking such towns to the rest of the nation. For example, package delivery has accounted for a significant and growing portion of USPS revenues. Rural Post Offices are used by commercial package delivery companies to provide delivery services to citizens who might otherwise find their ability to receive packages inhibited by both the difficulty encountered in reaching them and the prohibitive costs.

The complexity of the financial difficulties faced by the USPS requires cooperation among all stakeholders. Solutions involving modernization of the current network can benefit communities and the USPS alike. Additionally, we encourage restructuring postage rates in a way that improves the financial viability of the USPS and is reasonable for consumers.

Furthermore, USPS continues to be one of the most trusted government organizations year after year in national polls. In addition, USPS employs over 600,000 Americans, many of whom are veterans, only second only to Walmart. Without financial support and legislation, these jobs and service standards would be at stake.

There are some in Washington who would like to see USPS suffocated financially and sold to the highest bidder. Greed and lobbyists should not dictate the future of this American institution that was created by the people and for the people. We urge you to take action!

Sincerely,

[Your name]",finance

For the past couple of months I have been considering purchasing a house in the $180,000-$250,000 range. My significant other will be moving here next month and we don’t like the idea of renting because we want to build equity. He currently doesn’t have a new job lined up, but needed to break his lease may 1st. With the obvious economic situation, I feel uncertain about these plans.

Current financial breakdown:
I had $20,000 in a fidelity brokerage account which recently shrunk to less than $17,000 in the past week. 

Also have $10,000 in Robinhood, but worried that come tomorrow (Monday) i will be in the negative.

$4,000 in checking/savings account

Don’t pay rent or need to break a lease (live at home) 

I would be putting down roughly 10% down payment and my partner would put down the other 10%. I am not at risk of losing my job. 

———-

Yes, I have enough money to put down the down payment and so does my partner. But I don’t know if it’s worth waiting for the market to recover to buy. Given the fact that stock market is volatile (and projected to crash even further) is it better to take out and diversify investments (real estate) or keep it in and wait a year or two for market to re-stabilize so I don’t lose $3,000 now? Home prices seem to remain stable and there are less options (sellers holding off on selling). Interest rates are decreasing.

1. Should we try to aggressively pay down our debt before putting any more money into a retirement savings?
2. Due to the stimulus package we will have approximately $3500 dollars coming from the government shortly. If we were to take $3500 of that money and put it towards a debt amount where would it best be spent?
3. I've looked a little bit, but it seems that my current interest rates do not make refinancing any of this debt worthwhile. Is that accurate?
4. If I had an extra $500 a month for payments towards these loans where would it best be spent?

personalfinance,Partial Benefits Unemployment(Illinois),"This past month has been a nightmare. The covid situation has completley upended my finances. First things first, I filed a claim for unemployment on 3/22. This was after a week of failing to apply due to server problems. Not even 5 fucking minutes after I filed, i got a job call back from Fed ex for some part time work. Me being delusional and desperate for work I accepted. Here's why i say that. Fed Ex was terrible, ended up costing me money to go in, and was unsafe to say the least. I should've planned better in hindsight, but the job was too much and too unsafe to be making even LESS than unemployment or my prev job. I ended up quitting less than a week in. Hearing nothing or able to call in to unemployment up to this point, I thought i was sol on benefits. Until today when I finally received my UI finding. It said I would recieve double what i made the period I worked during my part time gig. This frustrates me considering that fed ex literally cost me money while i could have received benefits. So my question is:
Am I still eligible for partial benefits even though I found work and quit. Since I made less than i would've received through Unemployment, quitting wouldn't matter?

personalfinance,Principal Life Insurance messed up my forms: 1099-R Questions,"Hi Reddit, I am hoping for some clarification and advice on what to do in regards to some forms that seem screwy to me. First, I'll describe what happened:

In July 2019 I rolled over a 403(B) from an employer who I left this year into a Roth IRA with Vanguard. The total I rolled over directly to my Vanguard account was roughly $5,000, minus the taxes that were withheld, about $670. The rollover appeared to go over smoothly and I saw the money move into my Vanguard account. Soon after, I received a check for about $5.00 from Principal, who held the original retirement account, which they said was the dividends that the money earned in the intermediary time when the money was being rolled over. Fine, I said. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have received two 1099-Rs. I don't know how much detail is relevant to gain insight into what happened/advice for moving forward, so please ask for clarification if needed. The first 1099-R has the $5K listed as the gross distribution and lists no Federal income tax withheld. The second 1099-R has $675 listed as the gross distribution and $670 listed as the Federal income tax withheld. 

This seems messed up to me because I think that the tax withheld on the second form should be listed on the first form, and I don't think I should have even received the second 1099-R since the amount is only $5. When I enter this info on TurboTax it tells me that I owe taxes, which I don't believe I do. 

I'm open to general insight as to what happened and any advice for what to do, and I also have a few specific questions. 

* Is it okay if I flub the forms when I enter my info into an online tax filing service like Turbotax and list one 1099-R, combining the Gross distribution on the first form and the tax withheld on the second form? When I do this, the site doesn't say I still owe any taxes. 
* Should the Recipient listed on the 1099-R be Me or Vanguard, since it was directly rolled into an account with Vanguard? I ask this because I'm also trying to claim a credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contributions but Turbotax is telling me I'm not eligible because my income is too high, even though my income without the $5k listed on this 1099-R is below the eligibility threshold. Does this money make me ineligible for this credit? 
* Should I reach out to Principal for a corrected form. 
* Should I have also received tax forms for the regular contributions I made into the 403(b) before the rollover and the contributions I made to the Roth IRA after the rollover? 

In general I feel like this is pretty low-stakes for anybody involved except for me since it's such a small amount of money. Thanks so much in advance for the help with what I hope is a really simple situation.",finance

Hopefully, my question belongs in this sub, but I'm happy to edit/repost as needed at request. Please lmk if this is more on-topic for r/legaladvice, figuring I could get some advice on this from a financial perspective to make a more informed decision in how I should proceed.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile. Completing it required 3rd party documentation for my personal situation, so I assumed it to be an additional \*option\* for additional FA from College Board, and opted not to complete it out of concern for my family's privacy. Between finding out about the issue, requesting &amp; receiving documentation, and completing the profile, we were two 2 weeks into Winter Quarter. I wish I had been more proactive in discovering the issue and resolving it, but the quarter had already begun, and I registered late. The issue was on me. Receiving approval from my instructors and successfully enrolling had to be done in person and on paper at the Office of the Registrar and took another 2 weeks to finalize before I was fully enrolled.

This minor inconvenience was only the wind-up for the potentially severe issue I am running into now, bringing me to this Spring Quarter:

I went back and forth on whether or not to register for Spring Quarter. I had personal health and financial concerns about registering for this quarter. Between the financial risks of COVID-19 and everything else going on in my life, I still decided to register for online classes, only to find a near $10k outstanding balance on my account, when I had been informed by the Financial Aid office in Winter that the balance would be paid in full with the aid I was expecting; with a $2k return from the loan after payment (I'm not sure what the exact term for this is, but the balance was expected to be paid in excess of $2,000). Part of my financial aid, a federal loan, was meant to cover a majority of tuition, but the applications for it are canceled automatically by Financial Aid 4 weeks into the term for any students who have yet to register for 8 or more credits. My financial aid was completed and confirmed 2 weeks into that term, but I was not able to fully register until the mid-4th week because of some red-tape (I can elaborate on this more if anyone requests it, but it doesn't seem financially relevant, so I'm excluding it). This meant that an outstanding balance totaling near 10-grand would remain on my account from the Fall and Winter terms. Despite having been in constant communication with the Bursar for two weeks lifting my registration holds at the OoFA's request, the balance I was informed to expect full payment of would remain because most of the aid would be canceled automatically by the OoFA. I couldn't find a notice about this cancellation from the federal government or any office from the school. I was no longer receiving calls from any office for the duration of Winter term after registering. I would not have registered and accrued more debt from the term if there was no guarantee that I could pay for it; instead, I would have preferred to take the term off and resolve this issue so it didn't affect my grades (I was going to my professors' classes for the first 4 weeks, but not having access to Canvas for half the term ended up taking a chunk out of my GPA). So that's what I decided to do this term, temporarily withdraw, take some time to simplify my financial aid situation, avoid any other surprises with tuition, and come in strong next Fall Quarter (online classes are not good for my learning style, in any case). I thought I was making a sensible decision financially. Evidently, this would not be the case.

After seeing the balance at the beginning of this term and calling the Financial Aid office to see what went wrong, they discovered that one of my federal loans was scheduled to disburse for both terms, but never did. Knowing this, and not being able to register for classes, I decided to communicate the situation to my institution by submitting a temporary withdrawal until Fall 2020 and avoid incurring additional debt for the term before resolving the issue on my student account. 

It was only after this point that I learned what I mentioned earlier, that one must be enrolled in 8 credits for any Federal Aid to be disbursed retroactively. It was only two weeks into this term that I learned my federal loan was canceled by the Office of Financial Aid two months ago without any institutional notice. I was registered for over 8 credits for the remainder of the term and could have corrected this issue with a retroactive disbursement had I known to ask for it, but now that I have not been registered, the deadline for a 100% tuition refund for dropped classes has passed. Meaning I can't simply lift the hold on my account, register for 8 credits, wait for my retroactive disbursement, and drop the classes. Leaving me stuck between paying a 10-grand balance on my account, or &gt;50% tuition for classes I will not be taking for more than a week. I was willing to eat the monthly late fees and enroll for Summer or Fall term and have the aid disbursed then, but I have been informed by the FA office that the aid will not disburse unless I am enrolled in 8 or more credits this Spring Term. At this point, I will be missing more than 3 weeks of classes, at best.

I do not know how I could have communicated more with these offices, why I wasn't informed about this situation, why I needed to coordinate solutions to it in the style of a detective and messenger between all 3 offices instead of systems for communication existing for unique and unexpected situations like this one. Most importantly, I do not know how I can approach this situation in a financially responsible or safe way. This whole thing is seeming more like an impossible and unexpected issue, and I do not hold the offices totally at fault. It seems like an automated clerical accident and a lot of unfortunate timing. All I would like to do is take the proper steps to efficiently and finally resolve this. 

My last hope will be to apply for a formal tuition appeal this week to waive the 50% fee and have the aid disburse before I withdraw. If that doesn't happen, I've been referred by the FA office directly to Sally Mae or Wells Fargo for a private loan... I never believed my institution could leave us so out in the cold like that. I can't take on the additional debt, it would be hard to swallow when we were expecting a 2-grand return from the federal loan after paying for both quarters. It's a discouraging situation, but what advice do you have for me? And what options would you recommend?",finance

The main question is, what can we do for the next 2-3 years to make things easier before my sister and I can step him. How can he utilise his savings most efficiently, Any savings accounts with good interest rates or good investments? Or any schemes that can be useful.

I am open to ideas. I just want to make the last few years of my dad's life comfortable.

Edit-  So returning to Ghana is the plan but it will not happen for 5 years. He has about 15k in saving and want to know what we can do with those savings to maximise their potential and make it work for him.",finance
personalfinance,"Part owner in family farm, never received income, do I owe taxes if other family members make $ off it?","My grandparents left family property (farm) to my siblings and myself along with my parent (split equally among us) in MS, but I'm out of state for a decade.  They make a bit of money off it, and use it to pay property and local taxes on the place. I've never made a dime on it.

personalfinance,Need Help with the Lunar Banking Concept,"I've just read ""Becoming Your Own Banker"" by R. Nelson Nash. Learned about the Infinite Banking Concept.

&amp;#x200B;

In Short, you open a Dividend Paying Whole Life Insurance Policy, pay your premium, then you can borrow against that premium any time you want to, while dividends add up.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to basically boil down to these three things:

1. You earn dividends on your money in the policy

2. You earn interest on your money when a loan is taken out for something like car buying

3. The dividends and interest are tax-free

4. You don't need approval for the loans

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds fine. But here's what I think about each of those valid points above...

1. I could earn dividends on bonds / ETFs / other places

2. The only reason I earn interest on my money is because I'm paying myself the interest. I don't see what the big deal is. If I put 10K into a savings account, then use 8K to buy a used car, and pay back that 8K ""loan"" at 1.5% above the normal dealership financing interest rate, my savings account ""earns interest"" in the same way the WL policy would... so point 2 is a wash.

3. Tax-free is great. I'm interested in tax-free investments, as long as the returns are worthwhile. If I can get better after-tax returns, then that's even better than tax-free dividends

4. I don't need approval to get a loan out of my savings account (to use the word ""loan"" similar to how the book does)

&amp;#x200B;

I like the idea, but not so much the execution recommendations. So, what I'd like to do is find somewhere to put my savings that earns dividends. My thought is something like Municipal Bond ETFs, or something similar. This isn't my IRA, and it's not my everyday trading. This is my Dividend paying, savings alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal for the Lunar Banking Concept (Which I just made up on the spot, since I'm asking you all for the moon here):

1. Low enough risk that I could comfortably put \*most\* of my savings into it (with just a small percentage kept in an actual savings account)

2. High enough return that it's worth doing this over a high-yield savings account, or using something like Robinhood's Cash Account with (as of this writing) 0.3%APY. Preferrably a dividend that can be auto-reinvested, rather than looking for growth

3. High liquidity- I want to be able to easily access the funds within a week, and not have to undergo a paperwork nightmare for the requisition process.

4. Tax free, or high enough yield to make the taxes worth paying

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to use a normal Taxable account with M1 Finance for this project. That gives me near-immediate access to the funds, should I want them at a given time. I can simply withdraw any amount I like and it is evenly pulled from the whole portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently experimenting with four positions in my Pie, each started off with $100, listed below with their respective dividend percentages.

CIF - 10.48% (tax free!)

MIN - 9.28 %

BIL - 1.75 %

SHV - 2.00%

&amp;#x200B;

Those positions seem to be relatively low-risk as far as I can tell. CIF and MIN offer 9 and 10% dividends, and CIF is generally tax free.

&amp;#x200B;

Other symbols that I've found only today (so haven't sufficiently researched) that have high dividend return are:

PSEC - 15.82%

ORC - 18.13%

AGNC - 11.79%

DHY - 11.17%

CLM - 23.88%

OXLC - 27.00%

DHF - 10.56%

GAIN - 8.87%

&amp;#x200B;

My primary questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

Which of these would be the best position for such a goal?

What other symbols do I not know about that would fit well here?

What would you eliminate from my lists?

In what ways am I being blind, stupid, ignorant, clueless, thoughtless, arrogant, etc- with this kind of plan?

&amp;#x200B;

I accept the fact that these will not grow like a ""3 fund pie"" and that some will lose value to pay the dividends, but I'm not looking for the highest gains, just a net positive, after-tax return that beats (or totally crushes) a savings account or CD, but has similar liquidity to a savings account. I tried with T-Bills, but didn't like my results.

stocks,Cut my losses or wait it out?,"I bought some put options a couple weeks ago near the current bottom. I think SPY was around 240 when I bought. I had one 240 4/20 put which I already sold for an $1100 loss, and rolled out into SPXS calls, $11 5/15 and $10 6/19. I’m currently still holding 5/1 262 and 250 puts, which in total are down $3,680 or 80%.

I think the reason I held on so long was mostly sunk cost fallacy but also not setting an appropriate exit strategy in the event of losses. My intuition tells me this is a bull trap, and each day I keep telling myself surely today it will finally go down. Instead the market continues to defy all logic and go higher and higher.

I currently have lost all faith that this is a short term bull trap. We’ve seen only bad news the past couple weeks and the markets do not give a shit. I am not one bit convinced upcoming earnings will have a negative impact on the market, although I previously thought they would. Everyone already knows earnings will be bad so I don’t think it will come as a surprise. Even if they are worse than expected, unemployment numbers have been worse than expected so why would worse than expected earnings tank the markets?

I think it’s likely we will see another leg down in the future, but I fear it won’t be until much later in the year, in which case my all my options would become worthless. Now I also think the fed and Donald trump are prepared to do whatever it takes to keep the markets afloat, so the dip may not come until November or after.

I feel so stupid for trying to fight the fed, but at the time these options seemed like a sure thing. I also bought these on margin so I feel even dumber for that. And I suppose that’s the other reason I’ve kept holding, bc I wanted to recover my losses and not have to pay all this back. Thankfully this is an amount I can realistically pay back and my job is secure so I don’t have to worry too much, but the loss definitely stings.

TL;DR: bought put options on margin, down ~80% and lost almost 5k. I think this is a bull trap, but now I think Donnie and the fed are gonna keep the markets going until November at least and I’ve lost faith that upcoming earnings will cause the markets to dip any further.

There’s an argument to be made that home demand may decrease as buyers exit the market after seeing their or their spouse’s employment situation upended, but then again rates are low now with the fed’s moves.

\- While things still remain uncertain, they're a whole lot less uncertain than they were before. Back then, everything started closing, there was no Fed and government securing bailouts. They removed near-term bankruptcy risk for all companies. 

\- The market moves on expectations, it doesn't need good or bad news to move the stock prices higher.

fintech,Top 11 US Lending Startups That are Changing the Real Estate Industry,"&gt; Original Source: written [by Editorial team at Django Stars.](https://djangostars.com/blog/lending-fintech-startups/)

The common pain of all millennials is having multiple debts — starting with student loans and ending (or not) with loans for their car, a house, and so on. This is the main reason why the lending market is on the rise:

* Direct student loans equal $1.24 trillion, with over 35.1 million borrowers
* Consumer credit reached a peak of $4.15 trillion in Q3 2019
* Finally, mortgages comprise the largest part of the US lending market, with a total debt of $9.2 trillion.

As a result, numerous lending fintech startups have emerged to get a piece of the pie. Let’s look at why they are growing in number, examine other causes of their growth, the trends and challenges that small online lenders can face, and study the most successful examples of US lending startups.

## Online Lenders: An Accessible Alternative to Legacy Banks

Around 63% of Americans who own a home have a mortgage. At the same time, in less than 5 years, the number of traditional bank loans shrank from 40% to 28% of the market, while the share held by online lenders rose from 5% to 38%.

https://preview.redd.it/9wusfiy0lls41.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=464226abe752ea2086f1ccbfe723f982ea523902

What caused such a surge in fintech lending? Look no further. Here are the top reasons why consumers prefer online mortgages and other loans to those offered by legacy financial institutions:

1. **Accessibility**. Online lenders (or nonbanks) are always on hand. You don’t need to adjust his your schedule to the bank’s business hours — to apply for a loan, you can simply browse a website or open an app.
2. **Convenience**. Again, compared to traditional banks, online mortgages offer customers a simple form to fill out instead of asking them to bring all their documents, including their pet’s ID.
3. **No human factor**. Lending fintech startups analyze the data a user submits without seeing the person behind it. This helps them make an unbiased decision based on a user’s credit score and other important information, not on someone’s judgmental attitude.
4. **Speed**. A consumer that requests a loan online can see the status of their application faster, since nonbanks can verify the information they receive in minutes, not days. Of course, the final decision can take more time. Still, the [online loan application process is 20%](https://www.mba.org/publications/insights/archive/mba-insights-archive/2019/fintech-advantages-not-limited-to-fintech-lenders-x250356) faster than what a legacy bank can manage.
5. **Lower interest rates**. Since alternative lenders don’t need to comply with as many regulations as a traditional bank, they can offer their clients more flexible rates.

The numbers prove that online mortgages are winning big at the lending game:

* Over [6.12 million houses](https://www.statista.com/statistics/275156/total-home-sales-in-the-united-states-from-2009/) are projected to be sold in 2020.
* 66% of those who plan to buy a home would rather work with[ an online lender](https://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/research/housingsurvey/pdf/nhs-special-topic-digital-mortgage-process.pdf).
* [The mortgage delinquency rate was only 2.35%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/delallsa.htm#fn1) in Q4 2019, and it continues to drop.
* [29% of borrowers](https://fortunly.com/statistics/mortgage-statistics/#gref) cited the speed of receiving a loan as one of the top factors that influenced their choice of lender.
* Just around [7% of legacy banks](https://fortunly.com/statistics/mortgage-statistics/#gref) can handle the overall process of digital loans.

## Challenges and Trends in the US Lending Market

Though the demand for loans is growing, a number of things can hold you back if you decide to launch one of the lending tech startups. There are challenges you might come across and trends you’ll need to keep up with. Still, there’s nothing extraordinary, so let’s put the negative thinking aside and get down to business.

### Lending Trends To Watch For In 2020

So you won’t think of these trends as simple buzzwords, we’ll discuss only the most essential ones.

**1. More digitalization and automation**. In addition to round-the-clock availability for customers, going online offers benefits for alternative lenders as well:

* Operating costs reduction. One of the most obvious advantages of having a tech-based mortgages company is the potential to optimize your budget. Owners of online lending startups don’t need to waste money on office rent or facilities or on hiring an army of in-house employees.
* Faster decision-making and requests processing. The main reason why digital mortgages succeed is the speed with which application can be processed. The powerful technology behind that user-friendly interface analyzes the data a borrower submits, determines their eligibility for a loan, and provides you with a decision based on that potential client’s risk factors.
* No human error. Even if you have a couple of people on your staff, automating routine tasks will reduce their chances of making a mistake. It will also empower your employees to focus on establishing long-term relationships with clients and/or investors.

**2. An omnichannel user experience**. Being only on one platform means losing customers in other places where you might have reached them. Covering multiple channels of communication is a better option, yet the optimal choice is to orchestrate every touchpoint you have with your borrowers. This means not just enhancing the customer experience for desktop and mobile users, but also making it smooth whenever your client switches from one platform to another.

If you’re unsure whether you should use more communication channels, bear in mind that [67% of those who seek](https://www.fiserv.com/en/about-fiserv/the-point/2019-trends-whats-new-and-whats-next-in-the-mortgage-market.html) mortgage brokers startups would prefer to request a loan from their laptop, while 29% would rather use their smartphone or tablet.

**3. Turning data into actionable insights**. As noted above, digital solutions allow you to speed up the verification of the borrower’s info based on the data he or she specifies when completing a form on your website or in your mobile app. The quicker you process loan applications, the more deals you can close. Additionally, faster processing times enhance the user experience and develop customer loyalty.

But having all the data is not enough. If you analyze it properly, you’ll gain a competitive edge over other nonbanks. Of course, it’s hard to do without the proper tools, and this is where artificial intelligence (AI) can come in handy. Because it’s a high-end self-learning system, AI can supply you with more accurate and client-oriented decisions over time.

### The Most Common Lending Challenges You Can Face

Despite the rise in online mortgages, even the best US lending startups still encounter similar difficulties. Let’s look at some of them so you can be prepared:

**1. Low mortgage rates**. In 2020, [APR is expected to remain at the same low level](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/housing-mortgage-trends-2020/) as in the last quarter of 2019. This is obviously good news for consumers, though nonbanks don’t seem to be happy about it.

**2. Fewer homes for sale**. The number of houses being built can’t meet the growing demand from young adults who want to buy their first home. Here are a few reasons for the housing shortage:

* *Homeowners refuse to sell their houses*. They prefer to [rent it to somebody](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/6-reasons-there-arent-enough-homes-for-sale/) and earn passive income from it.
* *People stay in the same house longer*. According to the [National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-highlights-11-07-2019.pdf), in 2019, a typical seller had lived in their house for 10 years, compared to six or seven years before.
* *Homebuilders are under more regulatory pressure*. Regulatory spending represents [32.1% of total house costs](https://www.nmhc.org/contentassets/60365effa073432a8a168619e0f30895/nmhc-nahb-cost-of-regulations.pdf), which makes it too expensive for some developers.

**3. Higher competition because of FHA loans**. Traditional banks held back FHA lending over a couple of years because of tough regulations and penalties for non-compliance. Yet, the Departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development issued a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/sfh_HUD_DOJ_MOU_10_28_19.pdf) (MOU) on October 28, 2019, that aimed to clarify the expectations to financial institutions in terms of the FHA program. Also, the MOU is intended to encourage banks to underwrite FHA loans. Thus, borrowers might have more options to choose from when selecting a lender, which can be troublesome for alternative mortgage providers.

You may consider these challenges critical, but we’re dead sure that there are no obstacles that can’t be overcome. Hopefully, at least mortgage rates might grow a bit after election year.

## To Conclude

We can assume that the demand for lending fintech startups will only keep growing as more people want to buy or sell a home. Despite the challenges in the current online mortgage market, the opportunities are still numerous — which is proven by a number of loans being processed by existing alternative lenders and issues the traditional banks have.",finance
personalfinance,Did I pay too much taxes? 1st time doing payroll for S corp,"I own a business in Texas (LLC/sole prop.) and recently elected to become an s corp and pay myself a salary. I have no in depth knowledge about taxes, so I hired a CPA to handle all filings and do my payroll. We did reasonable compensation which determined my salary to be at $51,000/yr. I was not aware, you must pay taxes when you do payroll, so I was in shock when I asked CPA to do $30,000 payroll for April, and I only received about $19,000 in my employee account. With about $8,000 going to Federal income tax, $1,800 social security, and $435 to Medicare. On top of that my employer account paid $1,800 to Social Security, $435 to Medicare, $42 to FUTA, and $243 to TX SUTA. For a total of over $10,000 in employee tax and $2,500 employer tax just on $30,000 of payroll. Is this correct, or am I paying too much? Will I get a refund? (I am single with no dependents).      Luckily I did not need to entire amount to pay for something or this would be a much worst situation.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage question: ARM vs Physician Loan,"Note: **I realize buying a house in our situation is not the best financial decision**. However, we've been looking at rental options for months and none of them meet our needs, so we're buying because even though it's worse financially, we want to live in a house that meets our needs.

My SO is a physician about to start a 3 year fellowship. At the end of fellowship we plan to move to a different city, so we only plan to own the house for 3 years. Given our circumstances, I'm looking for a mortgage that provides: (1) low down payment (2) good interest rate (3) no PMI. My understanding is that many ARMs* (5/1 or 7/1) and Physician Mortgages meet these criteria, with the tradeoff being that the Physician Mortgage loan requires less money down but the ARM would likely have a lower interest rate. **So my question essentially boils down to: Is it better to take a worse interest rate in exchange having to put less money down?**

We had set aside enough money to put 20% down, but I'd really like to re-invest that in stocks if I can (obviously no one can predict the market, but it seems probable that  stocks will outperform my local real estate market over the next 3 years). Am I stupid for not wanting to put more money down?

I'm also open to any general advice/criticism of my thought process, this is our first mortgage so I may be making some dumb decisions. Thank you internet strangers!

*I haven't researched ARMs extensively, but I have a family member who was able to put 5% down and avoid PMI with a 5/1 ARM.",finance
investing,TLT,I've been paying pretty close attention to TLT as I have a put ratio spread currently open and I couldn't help but notice a pretty sizable move up from 164.55 to 165.20 in a pretty short time (still in the red though). Could that possibly be the Fed and if so what would the implications be?,finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my car now?,"I have just under $7k left on my car loan with 1.9% interest rate. I was following Dave Ramsey’s advice about paying off all my debt ASAP so I was pretty aggressive with it. Now that times are a bit different...should I be dumping money into my Roth IRA? Should I be taking advantage of the stock market instead?

I have ~$10k, 23 years old so I could technically pay it off now but I feel like with my interest rate so low I could be using that money elsewhere to make more money. I’ll obviously still be making the minimum monthly payments during this time.",finance
personalfinance,1098-t and taxes,"Does this have to be claim on my federal and state income taxes?

I had about $200 left over from what they gave me vs what I used",finance
personalfinance,Credit and Credit Card Question,"I have what I think is a dilemma. I am in the process of finishing paying off my student loans, which is great, but I have noticed this is bringing my credit score down because the average age of my credit is decreasing.  I have a pretty solid score of 785 and am not super worried about that exactly, but I am trying to make a decision on whether I should get another credit card or not.

I am currently saving to hopefully buy a house in 2-3 years. My only credit card has an age of 4 years and 10 moths. I should be able to finish paying off my student loans before the end of this year and hopefully in October. So assuming I buy a house 2.5 years (30 months) from now, giving me a credit age of 7.33 years. This would put me in the higher credit score bracket I believe possibly allowing me to get a lower home loan interest rate. 

What are the feelings from r/personalfinance on this? Should I go ahead and get another credit card or should I wait for my credit age to mature until I get a home loan before I open anew line of credit? I should say I am  not willing to prolong paying off my student loans.

Edit. If I should get a credit card are there any suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"As the title says, I am considering refinancing home. It was purchased in August 2017. We currently pay $1379 a month which includes interest and escrow. Our payment has gone up about $150 since we bought the house because our escrow amount needs to be higher due to taxes and insurance going up since we purchased. Our effective interest rate is 4.5% and we have a VA loan so we don't pay PMI. Where do I start and are there any lenders that would be recommended? I have tried to look up rates but some websites don't even list them at the moment, any idea what the rates current rates are roughly?",finance
personalfinance,Filing county taxes - include out-of-state (then)fiancé’s income?,"My now-husband and I lived in different states most of last year, and the state where I lived requires residents to file county taxes (in addition to state and federal). I’m filing as “married, filing separately” for my county and state taxes, so do I need to include the income my husband made during 2018 — even though we weren’t married yet and he never lived there?
I’m sorry if that’s a stupid question; I’m just totally clueless.",finance

worldpolitics,Trump and Conservative Rage Fest Against WHO Makes No Sense,"&amp;#x200B;

By 

[Greg Sargent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/greg-sargent/) 

Opinion writer

April 13, 2020 at 10:11 a.m. EDT

President Trump [is expected to move this week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-world-health-organization-funding/2020/04/12/c3bb53f8-7d0c-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2) to curb U.S. funding for the World Health Organization, after [raging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/08/why-exactly-is-president-trump-lashing-out-world-health-organization/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2) at the WHO for accepting China’s initial downplaying of coronavirus. It’s clear the WHO will be a fat target as Trump deflects attention from [damning new details](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html) emerging about his horribly botched coronavirus response.

As part of this latest exercise in blame-shifting, Trump has taken his first public shot at Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and his own administration’s leading medical expert. Trump angrily [retweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249470237726081030) a call for Fauci’s firing, while again [hailing](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249470237726081030) his own early restrictions on travel from China and [furiously bashing the media](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249519742093864961) for failing to recognize that decision’s foresight and brilliance.

Underlying this rage-fest at all these targets is an actual argument: All criticism of his response pales beside this one travel decision, which he undertook in defiance of his own experts, the media, and international organizations, thus underscoring his brave and heroic leadership.

But this story line is profoundly absurd, for two very fundamental reasons. Amid [new signs](https://www.axios.com/trump-campaign-joe-biden-china-0bc24346-0942-4df0-b929-7d9807732e15.html) that it will be absolutely central to his efforts to erase his role in unleashing this catastrophe, it’s worth engaging frontally.

[Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_8&amp;itid=lk_interstitial_manual_8)

Opinion | Don't broadcast Trump’s press briefings live. They contain more questions than answers.

The coronavirus pandemic is too serious to let the president hold freewheeling press briefings in real time, says Post media critic Erik Wemple. (Joshua Carroll, Erik Wemple/The Washington Post) 

The first reason this narrative is nonsense is that Trump committed a whole range of other extraordinarily serious missteps whose consequences continued to play out for weeks and weeks *after* Trump imposed that ban, *in spite* of whatever good it did.

Trump and his allies are making two claims about the WHO and China simultaneously. They [claim the WHO was too credulous](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-april-7-2020/) about China’s initial deceptions about the threat, hampering our response here.

Even as they’re claiming this, they’re *also* hailing Trump for his early [recognition of the threat](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787) posed by the China outbreak. Thus the Jan. 31 travel restrictions, which Trump [has described](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-april-7-2020/) as “the biggest decision we made so far.”

As an initial matter, the hyping of this decision is ridiculous. [At least 40,000 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html) traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump imposed it. As [the New York Times pointed out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html), it may have “come too late” to meaningfully limit the threat coronavirus from China posed.

But even if one were to accept Trump’s spin, it’s still not exonerating in the least when it comes to Trump’s broader failures. That’s because those failures badly exacerbated the situation that unfolded here after Trump imposed that ban.

The Times’s [utterly damning weekend exposé](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html) of all these failures illustrates this with great clarity.

**Cascading failures**

For instance, on Jan. 30 — the day before Trump’s heroic travel restrictions — Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar directly warned Trump about the seriousness of the looming pandemic. Yet Trump dismissed the warning as “alarmist.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s dithering held back the response in numerous ways: Plans for a federal system to track the virus were “[delayed for weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html),” which, along with the [well-documented failure to ramp up testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html), left officials with “[almost no insight](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html)” into its spread.

Meanwhile, in late February, administration officials concluded Trump should communicate the need for strict social distancing measures far more urgently. But Trump [privately raged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html) about these warnings, because they spooked the markets, and “crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president — time when the virus spread largely unimpeded.”

All that occurred here after Trump’s travel restrictions — and the catastrophic consequences continue to unfold right now.

Trump’s argument is akin to a baseball manager citing a double play in the second inning as proof of his team’s fielding prowess, to rebut criticism of a string of subsequent errors that went on to allow the other team to score 10 runs.

Only in this case, untold lives are at stake. Confirmed U.S. cases [now exceed half a million and confirmed U.S. deaths total](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_rhp-banner-low_web-gfx-death-tracker%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_28&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_28) over 22,000.

**An even deeper absurdity**

The second reason Trump’s narrative is nonsense is this: Even though Trump did impose the travel restrictions — with limited effect — Trump himself *didn’t actually show the level of initial skepticism toward China’s public claims* that he’s faulting everyone else for failing to show.

Again and again [throughout the month of February](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/trump-coronavirus-china/index.html), Trump expressed confidence in China’s handling of coronavirus and/or said China shouldn’t do anything differently.

To be fair, Trump had understandable reasons for this. He wanted to maintain good relations to secure trade peace and to get needed medical supplies.

But there’s another point here that continues to elude notice: Trump’s praise of China’s handling of [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_34&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_34) *was absolutely central to his own downplaying of the threat*. Again and again, Trump cited China’s successes [to argue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/10/trumps-china-bashing-ad-is-more-ridiculous-than-you-thought/?itid=sf_plum-line&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_34&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_34) that through collaboration, Trump and China were restraining coronavirus.

Thus, Trump’s praise of China was central to maintaining *his own early spin that he, too, had it totally under control*. That turned out to be catastrophically wrong, and it’s only after this became too overwhelming to ignore that Trump, [joined by his propagandists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-fox-news-china/?tid=lk_inline_manual_36&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_36), fully pivoted to blaming China, the current story line.

**The WHO’s role**

As if this narrative weren’t absurd enough, Trump’s attacks on the WHO to prop it up make it still worse. Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Center on Foreign Relations, [correctly points out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-fox-news-china/?tid=lk_inline_manual_40&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_40) that even if the WHO did commit early missteps on China, it righted itself as more data came in.

Indeed, the WHO [declared](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-who-public-health-emergency-international-concern-declaration/index.html) an international public health emergency on Jan. 30, right around the time of Trump’s travel restrictions. In so doing, the WHO alerted us and the world to the threat — and the vast bulk of Trump’s missteps unfolded after that, as did their horrifying consequences.

Meanwhile, [experts are warning](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/12/trump-defund-world-health-organization-181166) that defunding the WHO could prove disastrous when the outbreak gains steam in the southern hemisphere. It would be perverse indeed if Trump’s actions end up hampering efforts to save more lives abroad, mainly to sustain a ham-handed effort to cover up his own role in needlessly lost lives here.",finance

Before we were married my wife had an unpaid tax liability from 2017, that stemmed from the first year she ran her own business. We got married last year and filed jointly this year.

I had my salary cut by 10%, but I’m still making $900 a week. My employees were cut by 10 hours a week, and are all still making between $450-700 a week. State unemployment benefits are $247 a week. None of my employees are qualifying for state unemployment, because they make over $247 a week. However, they seem to think that since their hours were cut, they WILL qualify for the $600 a week  from the federal government regardless. Is that the case? It doesn’t make much sense to me that they would all be getting $2400 a month when they’re losing somewhere around $500-700 a month.",finance
personalfinance,Should we just put off buying a house for another year?,"My fiancee and I had been planning to buy a house this summer with a move-in date of September 1st (when our current lease ends).  We had just barely started the process (just research and getting pre-approved) when shit started to hit the fan with COVID.  At first it seemed like we would benefit from the lower interest rates, but now it seems much more complicated than that.  For example, it seems like people are sitting on their homes that they might otherwise have been putting up for sale right now, and that we have fewer options available to us (although this could just be cognitive bias).

Should we call it off this year and just sign a new apartment lease?  We have very secure jobs, can immediately switch to self-employment if needed, have no debt, have the option of living with parents if we have an emergency situation, etc., so we're not worried about being unable to afford a new home if the economy stays weak (unless it *really* tanks).  It's mostly just a matter of whether all this uncertainty makes it an unwise idea to close on a home in 3-4 months from now when putting it off another year wouldn't be such a big deal for us financially (albeit disappointing).",finance

Long story short, I walk out with a 42k loan at %3.99 interest. Keep in mind I was at the dealer for over 6 hours when it came time to start signing papers and it was past 8pm. The next morning I wake up, drink my coffee, and start reading the contract I signed last night in full. Slap my forehead, I bought over 2.5k in products from the dealer of which they had me thinking were a Toyota backed thing, and ""All Toyota's need this"". Including a $958 GAP policy.

Every 6 months the composite rate is recalculated. The composite rate is the fixed (you lock this in when you buy the bond) + the changing inflation rate. They currently yield like 2.2% which is far better than the yields on treasuries trading on public secondary markets. 

most of the decade the fixed rate has been zero. In 2019 it hit .5% twice and is now at .2%. you can lock in this .2% until April 30. 

With all of the money printing and the decrease of interest rates to 0 - 25 basis points is it a good time to buy these bonds and lock in the fixed .2% considering it is likely that interest rates remain low for years to come making this the last chance to lock in a non 0 fixed rate for a long time? 

Or do we have 1 more 6 month period where the fixed will be higher and the inflation rate low because of the immediate deflation we are experiencing?

If something like this can impact the market so slightly and prove it can be artificially propped up then where is the risk? Can everyone win?

People compare the the current time to that of 2008, but in 2008, even though the Fed used similar tactics, it was somewhat of a less transparent venture due to social media, etc not being as big, there were no memes, information didn’t spread as fast, and 90% of the population wasn’t as knowledgeable about the subject.

I started my job with my current company about 6 years ago. During my on-boarding I was automatically (possibly important?) enrolled in the company's 401(k) plan with TRowe Price. I didn't have one at the time and I've been contributing 5-7% ever since. I've recently decided that cashing it out for some personal finance reasons was the right option. 

So, last week I called TRowe Price to start the process and find out exactly what my distribution would be after the 10% early withdrawal penalty and any applicable federal and state taxes. The retirement specialist told me that my particular retirement plan does not allow for early withdrawal unless :

A) You meet financial hardship criteria (I don't)

B) You're fired

C) You quit

I was absolutely in awe. I have never heard of a 401(k) plan with this type of restriction. A couple points - 

\-I am fully vested with the company, as are any company matches (they do 50% up to 3.5%) as soon as they are distributed.

\-I have spoken to 2 different people at TRowe Price and they have assured me that my plan does not allow me to liquidate my assets unless one of the 3 above status are met - I guess my next step here is to have them escalate the call to a Supervisor to make sure?

\-I have spoken to 2 different Human Resources employees at my corporate office and neither of them have any idea what they're (or I for that matter) are talking about - next step here to contact our parent company HR, whose name the plan is actually in, to see if I can be released from the plan?

TL;DR

Want to cash out my 401(k), TRowe Price says through my employers plan I can't take any early withdrawals unless I quit, am fired, or meet financial hardship criteria. 

Is this typical of employer based 401(k) plans? I have never heard of one like this

Can they legally hold my money hostage until I quit / get terminated?

Do I have any recourse through my employer or TRowe Price?

Any input is greatly appreciated. Cheers, Drew.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy this house?,"Me and my SO are currently in contingency on a house here in the midwest. Everyone I'm currently consulting with is pretty positive about the purchase. I've worked out the finances a bit, and I'm comfortable with the purchase.  But I feel like I need your guys' viewpoint to get a more well-rounded pool of opinion on things. I'm usually pretty frugal on things, and I always envisioned buying a house once I had saved up the total purchase price, but I feel like many things have aligned to where I feel comfortable purchasing now. Most important of which is my fiance, who is looking to move out of our old apartment, and our ""dream house"" just went on sale (This is more the straw that broke the back, as I try and keep emotions out of purchases. I feel this purchase has enough rational reasons to support the purchase).

&amp;#x200B;

* Cost of house: $300k
* Down payment: 20% (60k)
* Mortgage rate: 2.6% for 15 yr fixed
* Joint net income: $75k (though will be getting raises soon)
* Savings: $150k
* Zero debt

&amp;#x200B;

Reason I'm buying: Tired of paying rent, opportunity for rental income, diversifying of investments, low interest rates, and a house we've always loved recently went on sale.

* Currently paying $1000 rent + utilities for an old house that's falling into more disrepair. And our neighbor has become a problem.
* Need of larger space. I need a workshop/garage in order to work on things, and I have a little side business where it would be useful to have the extra space.
* College town with large rental market.
* The house is amazing, and it's actually right next to our work.
* Also at this point, I feel like I'm just saving money for the sake of saving money. The only big reason I've been saving is for a house, and now seems like the right opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

We currently pay \~$1000 for rent &amp; utilities, and we both put in $2000 into a joint savings account every month - a portion of which we invest into the market. We also contribute monthly to personal savings and retirement. With the rest for spending, we live very comfortably.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I try and simplify it, the $1000 rent + $2000 savings we currently pay every month can be put directly into mortgage + utilities + tax, and we'd still have enough room to put \~$1000 into joint savings, and maybe add a bit extra into mortgage every month to pay it off a bit early. That burden becomes even easier if we rent 2 of our 6 rooms out. And we're basically net zero if we rent 4 rooms out, if we think we can manage the extra tenants. And we still have \~$100k in our savings as a buffer zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this seem reasonable? It's on the edge of what I'm comfortable spending, but I feel fine with this plan given the circumstances.",finance

personalfinance,Is it possible to renegotiate a crappy loan? (TD) + debt payoff next steps,"Hi there. Been lurking here for about a year and a half, first time poster here.

Ok, let's get in to it. 29 y.o male here. My early-mid 20s were not a healthy time for me. I got a decent paying job after university and spent more than every cent trying to keep up with my friends' lifestyles.

In addition to that, I had some major untreated anxiety and depression that really dominated my life. Naturally, to deal with all this, I self-medicated to excess nearly every weekend.

Quickly racked up consumer debt of aprox 20 K and got a consolidation loan from TD @ 12.99% when I was 26.

Because I was **still an idiot** and had not truly matured and learned from my ways, I piled on an additional 10k+ in CC debt pretty quickly after that.

At 26/27, I finally got some help with my anxiety and spent about a year working through my problems and turning away from self-medication and other destructive behaviors.

At 28 I decided it was time to grow up and take control of my finances. Reduced my expenses, learned to be happy with what I have and know I cannot keep up with everyone. I finally built a budget that works for me, and I have accomplished the following:

\- paid off all CC debt

\- paid 5k onto consolidation loan

\- saved 5k in a HISA as an emergency fund

\- don't want to die every time i open my banking app

**Basic financial picture:**

net income of $4200/month (relatively secure job)

total expenses of about $2,000.00/month

$5,000.00 in a HISA

Random TFSA holdings of about $2,000.00

Credit:

15K left on 7year loan at 12.99% from TD (currently paying off aprox $400/month)

$0 balance on cc with my bank (2k limit)

$0 balance on cc with another bank (4k limit) (yes i know this is stupid)

$0 balance on cc with a third bank (2k limit) (ohhhhh yeah, smart, open another account 26 year old me, free money, nice work!)

**My question is:**

When I got my consolidation loan I was **desperate and financially clueless.** I went in to my bank (TD) and asked about my options and they offered me the consolidation loan at 12.99%. Like an idiot, I gladly took it.

Looking back... this was obviously not the best deal I could have got... F.

Do you guys think it is possible to renegotiate the loan to get a lower interest rate?

Do I go balls to the wall and keep directing maximum available funds to pay this off? or should I continue saving money and paying off the loan at $400/month at the same time

Also what do I do with credit card accounts 2 and 3? is it possible to close them without penalty?

What would [r/PersonalFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinance) 's next moves be???

personalfinance,How to determine if one should finance vs paying in cash,"Not sure if that is the best title, but I am trying to figure out how much money from our savings my wife and I should use to pay for our car purchase which is likely to happen this July. I am struggling to figure out how much to pay down and how much (if any) to finance. TLDR at bottom. 

We have about $60-70k in savings and the car we want will probably cost $20-25k out the door. The reason I am struggling is because we currently rent a tiny condo, and we know we will need to upgrade the size of the living space in 2021, if not 100% for sure in 2022. We will probably want a house and we figure we'll need at least $60k+ for the down payment. I'd say on average, we currently save $2k per month, but with a new baby coming in 3 months, that will drop to nearly nothing for a while. Most, if not all savings will come from my yearly bonus at work. 

So the question is... pay for the car entirely in cash, finance some or finance all of it? I'm in the Navy Federal Cred Union, so interest rates should be &lt;3%. Personally, I am leaning toward putting a small amount down, such that my all in monthly cost is no more than $300, and keep as much in the bank as possible. too much uncertainty right now with covid &amp; baby coming. Once a house is purchased... if there is left over in the bank and monthly savings goes back up, I can pay the remainder of the loan off early.

personalfinance,Best Approach to Buying A Car?,"I've been looking to buy a car for some time now, but I'm beginning to quickly approach actually *needing* a car. I've been lucky enough to consistently live close to where I work and get groceries, but I plan on moving once this pandemic lets me and that luck is looking like it'll run out. However, I can't seem to find any reasonable financing terms for a car. I either get immediately denied or am told to make a down payment upwards of half the car's overall value. Background of my finances:

\-Left college almost a year ago with $20k of student debt. Been making payments that are just a little more than the total interest, so that hasn't gone down a notable amount. (I'm going to continue to make payments during the CARES Act so it'll actually go more towards my principal balance)

\- Credit score is 710. Only one credit card, 2 years old. Never missed a payment, I usually try to make sure I pay my credit card before the credit reports so it shows a $0 balance but that doesn't always work out.

\-Worked part time in college (full time over the summers), a little over federal minimum wage. Had a gap in employment \~July to November to working full time at a job that paid about the same so my AGI isn't the highest.

\-Never owned a car before, credit card and student loans are the only things only my credit reports

I'm just confused by financing terms, and how I can find something that'll actually allow me to get a car. Whether it's now during whatever 0% APR or delayed payments some dealerships are offering, or later after this pandemic stops skewing finances. I can obviously wait until after I move to get a car, but right now I can't even get any idea of a down payment or monthly payment to start budgeting for it.

Essentially this is assuming all fiscal / monetary policies as currently enacted and consensus estimates on COVID-19 mitigation (i.e. gradual resumption of normal commerce after mid to late Q2). See more detailed assumptions later. 

&amp;nbsp;


Some facts going into the analysis:

* 2019 saw a ~30% gain in the S&amp;P 500, however corporate earnings were nearly flat. Consequently, the 30% rise in the S&amp;P 500 was due almost entirely to increases in valuation, i.e. stock investors paying more for future earnings
* The OECD had projected in September 2019 3.0% Global GDP growth and 2.0% for the US. This was already a deceleration of global growth from 3.6% worldwide in 2018 and 2.9% in the US.
* US Manufacturing, according to the ISM and IHS Markit surveys, weakened through most of 2019 (although showed a slight rebound near the end of year)
* US Business investment also declined through much of 2019, potentially due to the ""trade war"" between the China &amp; the US
* US Consumer spending remained robust throughout 2019, although also appeared to decelerate near the end of 2019 / early 2020. 
* US households had modestly de-leveraged as a % of GDP since 2008, and the debt servicing costs (due to lower interest rates) were at historic lows at the end of 2019. It’s worth noting the changing composition of household debt, with strong increases in student loan and auto debt while mortgage debt decreased. Housing debt peaked at ~$10 trillion in 2008, compared to slightly less than ~$10 trillion at the end of 2019. However, non-housing debt peaked at ~$2.7 trillion in 2008, while by 2019 non-housing debt stood at $4.2 trillion
* US Corporate debt stood at record levels as compared to GDP: ~75%. This debt had also deteriorated in ratings with the largest percentage in history rated as slightly above junk (BBB)
* The US deficit for fiscal year 2019 was estimated at ~$1 trillion pre-COVID
* The bulk of net inflows from 2016-2019 into US equities have been driven by stock buybacks. Since 2009, companies have spent ~$5 trillion in share buybacks

&amp;nbsp;


In short, my analysis is that the US economy entered 2020 with modest to low growth prospects. While consumer spending and household debt servicing costs remained bright spots, modest wage gains coupled with high housing, education, and healthcare costs presented a mixed picture. Both business investment and manufacturing activity were subdued, although hopes for a ""Phase 1"" trade war seemed cause for modest optimism. 

&amp;nbsp;

With those facts as background, here are my baked in assumptions for the following analysis:

* The OECD nations + major developing countries (China, etc.) modestly resume normal economic activity in mid to late Q2

* There is no vaccine or ""miracle drug"" until late 2020 / 2021
* Stimulus from major central banks globally prevents an immediate financial crisis or severe market distortions (e.g. the corporate credit market seizing up)
* Additional fiscal stimulus measures, while substantial, do not exceed the original stimulus bills (e.g. the $2.2 trillion US bill)
* The COVID-19 lockdown contributes to a severe recession in Q1/Q2 2020 in most countries, but the easing of lockdown measures + stimulus leads to modest to substantial recovery in Q3 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;


Alright, onto the main event. Here is what I think is ""baked"" into the future assuming the above events:

* Dramatic increases in sovereign debt levels. The US alone is estimated to run a deficit of ~$3-4 trillion depending on the severity and duration of the recession. With global debt levels already at records highs, it is unclear what effect these substantial debt levels will have (deflation, inflation, stagflation, no effect?) 

* Severe budget deficits in US state &amp; local governments. Increased spending on unemployment insurance and healthcare expenditures coupled with decreased revenues will force states to significantly cut their budgets. These cuts will include layoffs of non-essential employees. 
* Increased pressure on Euro zone economies, particularly Italy. Italian economic growth remained anemic in 2019 at 0.3%. With the complete lockdown of the Italian economy (which began in the economic engine of Northern Italy), Italy will likely face dramatic declines in GDP and correspondingly large government deficits. Northern Eurozone countries will be faced yet again with difficult choices with regards to Italian debt. Pressure from northern Eurozone countries on Italy risk furthering inflaming public opinion and leading to a separatist backlash. 
* Negative to zero growth in US consumer spending in 2020. Despite the enhanced unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and corporate / small biz loans I believe it is unlikely that consumer spending will rebound in 2020. Consumers will prioritize on paying off debts, rebuilding savings, etc. due to the economic uncertainty. Furthermore there is permanent demand destruction in certain sectors, e.g. consumers are unlikely to replace all of their canceled vacations, restaurant visits, shopping excursions, etc. The ""wealth effect"" will work in reverse as many high income households see drops in both their investments accounts as well as variable compensation: bonuses, pay raises, RSUs, stock options, etc. 
* Unemployment will remain substantially elevated over its early 2020 low of ~3.5% through 2020. As in 2009, many corporations will ""do more with less"" in lieu of hiring during uncertain times. Small and medium sized businesses will face substantial revenue losses in 2020 and will focus on cutting costs to remain solvent. 
* Manufacturing and business investment will remain weak in 2020. Manufacturing will continue to stagnant due to sluggish demand for automobiles, aircraft, and other durable goods. Businesses will focus on preserving cash, paying down / refinancing debts, etc. due to weak global demand
* The US Federal Reserve will continue to support markets with QE and other monetary policy measures. 
* Increased likelihood of a change in US presidential administrations. In early 2020 the Democratic party appeared poised to nominate a progressive, divisive candidate in Bernie Sanders. By April 2020 Joe Biden, a center-left candidate, had secured the nomination. At the same time, the US economic outlook had substantially deteriorated. While the economy is likely to improve in the June-November timeline, it is unclear if this recovery will be substantial enough to allow President Trump to run on a message of economic recovery. The increased likelihood of a Democratic presidential administration is a corresponding decreased likelihood of further US corporate tax cuts.
* Dramatic decrease in stock buybacks in 2020. Companies will focus on preserving cash and reducing debt levels. 
* Significant deployment of ""dry powder"" from cash rich corporates and private equity firms (which have ~$2+ trillion in unallocated funds). These funds will look for opportunities in distressed credit, M&amp;A, and other opportunistic areas
* Continued low oil prices in 2020. While a modest recovery is possible, the magnitude of demand destruction for oil, the unraveling of Opec+, and the continuing impact of American shale drillers will contain price growth. 
* Continued China - US tension. There is little sign of a thaw in relations, and a hard line against China is one of the few popular bi-partisan issues in US domestic politics. Initial discussions to suspend Chinese tariffs during the crisis seem to have stalled.
* Emphasis on supply chain resiliency / diversification. Between the US - China trade war and the COVID-19 outbreak, OECD companies will face both investor and political pressure to diversify their supply chain away from China. This will bolster the slow and gradual shift that was already underway due to increasing Chinese labor costs and the perception of an opaque, unfair legal regime. In the short term this will drive up costs (China is a manufacturing hub for many reasons beyond cheap labor) which will either compress corporate profits or raise consumer prices.  
* Unlike 2009, there does not appear to be a new global engine of growth. China seems justifiably concerned about exacerbating their debt situation with massive fiscal stimulus. India was already experiencing a recession, and other major economies like Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. do not have the per capita purchasing power to stimulate global growth. Many of these countries are also suffering from the collapse in commodity prices and the flight from emerging market bonds / equities. 

&amp;nbsp;


I hesitate to forecast the future, because obviously there is significant uncertainty. However, my personal base case is that an immediate ""V-shaped"" recovery in asset prices is unlikely. For asset prices to reach or exceed 2020 levels would require corporates to either substantially increase earnings in mid to late 2020 AND investors to value future earnings at the same high levels of 2020. However, it is worth noting that the record low interest rates (and corresponding bond yields) and monetary easing could in theory drive investors into equities, real estates, private equity, etc. as the only option for positive returns. My personal base case is a sluggish recovery in mid to late 2020 with asset prices remaining volatile to shifts in sentiment. With the Fed stabilizing markets, a widespread global depression seems unlikely but could occur if high global debt levels trigger widespread corporate bankruptcies or some form of ""stagflation"". Another unlikely, but possible case is that the world emulates Japan after the early 1990s and experiences a long period of slow asset price decline as corporates deleverage, credit availability declines modestly, and no new global engines of growth emerge. 

&amp;nbsp;


Thoughts?

Edit #2: Adding in how to know I'm wrong


One thing that occurred to me is that since this analysis is slightly bearish, I should proactively offer some data points that would indicate I'm wrong / overly pessimistic:

* Rapid recovery in US consumer spending in Q3 / Q4 2020 to pre-COVID levels
* Rapid return to pre-COVID employment, ~3.5%, by Q4 2020 
* Increased US business investment / manufacturing activity in Q3 / Q4 to supplement or replace consumer spending
* The rapid return of the US corporate debt market which enables large stock buybacks in Q4 2020 onward
* Corporate earnings growth compared to late 2019 (i.e. not simply quarter on quarter comparisons against the likely awful Q1 / Q2 numbers)
* Massive US government infrastructure projects / other stimulus programs that generate demand and boost US household incomes 

Edit #3: Some people have correctly pointed out that India was not in a recession in 2019. Apologies, I should have said that growth had decelerated over 2019, with Q4 2019 growth estimated at ~4.7% compared to GDP of ~7% in 2018. I think my larger point stands that India's economy did not appear to be trending in a positive direction, and given their per capita income of ~$1700 4.7% is not sufficient to dramatically improve global growth.

stocks,Lost for words - need some basic advice?,"Hello,

I decided to get into ""investing"" with this current market ""correction"". 

I was completely new to trading and didn’t want to jump in immediately. I've spent the last 4-5 weeks doing a ton of research on investing basics, how the market works, reading investing guides, listening to talks/ podcasts and also researching individual stocks with prices I'm willing to pay to start actually investing.  

My goal is to invest semi-long term (5-10 years), and with some research, I narrowed down my list of shares AMD, Tesla, Microsoft, Disney, Take 2 and maybe Apple. 

When I started researching during the initial crash (early/mid march), I put my personal savings ($20K) into a US share trading account ready to trade. What I didn’t realise was that the AUD to USD exchange rate at the time was pretty much at an all time low of 0.57c per AUD $. With the $20K now exchanged at this horrendous rate (which I only recently realised), the money has pretty much been sitting there ever since as I was waiting for a ""dip"" to jump in. Well guess what, that dip never came and I completely missed out. 

On top of now essentially losing a ton of money on the exchange rate, I did purchase 15x shares in AMD at $38, while good, is &lt;5% of my initial investing amount. I was also uneducated and tried to time the market and put down $350 on TVIX @ $500. Now I have also lost around $250+ in TVIX, and still declining with the weekly depreciation and the market growth. 

Since these 2 initial trades, i backed off and the market has picked up considerably. I ""waited"" for a  drop to jump back in and had prices for each stock I wanted to buy (AMD - $40, TSLA -$400, DIS - $90, etc). Safe to say, the market never saw those lows again and here we are 3 weeks later with TSLA +80% from its lows, AMD +30% and so on....

Looking back I’ve pretty much done absolutly everything wrong from exchanging money at an all time low and not doing anything with it to buying TVIX and losing a ton of money in that also. 

After yesterdays trade, all my stocks have now skyrocketed even further and im completely lost for words and in denial.

   
 

I guess my final questions and comments are:

\- I’ve lost 15% of my total investment deposit on the exchange rate alone. I need to at least go +15% on my investment to at least break even today and even then in 5+ years, the exchange rate will be even better! - so possibly even +20% to just break even on exchange rate.. jesus..

\- What do I do with TVIX?, sell now at a huge loss?, market isn’t going down anytime soon...

\- I've always been waiting for a ""dip"" to jump back in and DCAing, but  I think we all know thats not happening anytime soon. None of my stocks ever hit the prices i had in mind again and are now all insaly above what that initial price was. I tell myself surly there will be a dip this week, 3 weeks of rally in not sustainable, and then TSLA +18% overnight, AMD +5%, all opportunities for the companies I liked are completely gone and doesn’t seem to be looking back anytime soon.

\- Do I start DCA now?, all my stock choices have pretty much closely recovered to pre COVID-19 times...

\- Do I wait for a small dip to start DCAing?, is this really really sustainbale? (but ive told myself this for the past 3 weeks and look at us now)

\- Market doesnt look like its going down anytime soon, Fed is pumping way too much $ into the economy, cannot be compared to any other point in time. People predict ""crashes the following week"", next week comes and we're in record breaking rally's. TSLA up +80% and AMD up 30%+ from when I was a click away of buying it at its all time lows is just soul crushing.

\- the longer i sit here doing nothing, the more i see my initial $20k deposit decline more and more, not a good feeling.

personalfinance,Clarification of taxes for temp worker,"Hi PF,

My friend works as a temp, and filed a W-9 for this one place he worked at in 2019. He receives check payments on the same day of service, but this one place he worked at decided to reduce the check amount because the employer had deducted for FICA.

My friend says it was odd at the time, but figured it would work out since he already filed the W-9.

Fast forward to the present, my friend is looking through the W-2 he received from the workplace, and  Box 1 for wages is equal to the full amount my friend was **supposed** to be paid. Box 2 federal tax withheld is $0, and Box 4 (social security) and Box 6 (medicare) are filled in. 

The question is: Isn't Box 2 related to Box 4 and Box 6? Shouldn't Box 2 have a value that includes the values from Box 4 and Box 6? Why is Box 1 the full amount before taxes when that wasn't the amount paid at the time of service?

personalfinance,"23y, $35k/year and want to move out. Advice?","Sorry if I don’t do this correctly, this is my first Reddit post.

(There’s a tl;dr at the bottom)

So here’s my situation.

I live in AZ and met a girl about 6 months ago. She’s from WI and was here for school. We hit it off great and have been dating for 5 months now! However, back in December, her roommate and his family kicked her out of their house and with nowhere to go, she had to move back home. We were both heartbroken, but have been handling long distance pretty well. She’s pretty tired of being home and feels like her time in WI is at an end. All she wants to do is move back to AZ and be with me and all of the friends she made down here. I would like nothing more than to have just that. She can’t afford her own place, so her only option would be to move in with me. I live with my parents and we just don’t have the room for her.

Now about my living situation.

My parents are really hooking me up. They let me move back in when my ex cheated on me. They don’t charge me rent and I get home cooked dinner almost every night.
My only issue is that I’m 23 and would like my own place and some freedom. Don’t get me wrong, my parents are awesome, but they still treat me like I’m 12 some times... Point is, I’m looking to move out too. My best friend(whom is close friends with my gf) is also wanting to move out. I’d consider him as a roommate in a heartbeat(I trust him more than anyone else and he’s my most financially stable friend). We figured the 3 of us can get a place together.

I’ll detail my finances.

I make 35k/year. I have a $16,000 car loan that I pay $345/month on. I’m also co-signed on my ex’s $8,000 car(yikes). In total, my bills come out to around $700/mo. I’ve got about $5,000 in credit card debit(all on one card), but I’m paying that off rather quickly. My credit score is currently 720+. As of now, I have $7,200 in savings.

So here come my thoughts/questions.

With interest rates as low(and dropping) as they are right now due to the effects of COVID-19, my first thought was to buy a house. After detailing my situation to multiple real estate agents(one of which being my aunt), they all believe it’s a great time for me to buy. However, I’m just skeptical due to the fact that I only have $7.2k in savings and only make 35k/year. Granted, I’d have 2 other people contributing to the monthly costs, but I’m planning on only having the house in my name. I can’t see myself alone being approved for more than $100k(if that), which gets you almost nothing in AZ. However, I know almost nothing about buying a house. I do know that I qualify as a first-time homebuyer, but I’m not sure how much that will help. Does anybody think that buying a home, given my financial situation is possible/a good idea? Or should I wait a few years and attempt to build my savings?

If I wait to buy a home, that would mean that I rent. Between the 3 of us, I think our max rent is somewhere between $1,400-1,600/month, depending on additional fees. I’m just afraid that if I have to pay rent, that will leave me no financial room to save any money. Besides, I’ve always felt as if renting is just throwing money away, it’s not going towards anything. I’d rather just save that money to buy a place.

At this point, I’m kinda just throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks. It seems like ever time I come up with an idea, some kind of fatal flaw in the plan comes up. If anybody bothered to take the time to read this and wants to give their two cents, shoot. Good or bad. I’m all ears.

If I forgot any crucial details, I’ll try to edit them in.

Once again, sorry if something isn’t correct. This is my first post.

Thanks!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,How can I pay my US student loans while living permanently abroad?,"I'm an American citizen living in Germany and have US federal student loans from my bachelor studies. I haven't made any payments for the entire time I've been in Germany (\~4 years) since I haven't had the money to do so and I have a $0 minimum payment. However, between recent savings and a private loan from someone I know and trust, I can cover the cost of my loans in the US.

The issue is that I'm unable to find a way to make any payment to my servicer Nelnet. They only accept payments through a US-based checking or savings account (and I think recently added the option to pay using a debit card over the phone).

I don't have a US account. I've read that I can only create an account with an online bank if I have a US address. I've also read that I can create an account with some banks even though I live abroad, but then I would have to make the account in person. With the current situation, all my travel plans to the US have obviously been cancelled.

Another way I've tried is using the TransferWise multi-currency account, which allows me to pay in any currency through a debit card. Unfortunately, this doesn't work as Nelnet has declined every transaction attempt I've made, and there's only been radio silence as to why.

I'm frustrated and out of ideas how to do this. I have the money available, but there just doesn't seem to be any way to get it into my loans.

Is there a way to create a US account from abroad? If not, how can I make a payment through a US-based checking or savings account from abroad?",finance

investing,Change of the economic world as we know it? Situation in USA is just insane.,"Hi guys. I know I won't receive definite answer, this is just post for a conversation. We all know this situation is insane. Record number of people without jobs, businesses stuggle, who knows when we will be able to travel internationally, almost everyone on the planet got involved in this COVID-19 disaster, many businesses and people will bankrupt sooner or later and yet, the market is going crazy. Biggest increase in stocks in decades in last week. Tesla went yesterday up by 13%. It's up like nothing has happened, like 80% of the things got repaired and only great days are ahead and we are ready to get back to normal. 

My brain literally hurts from this. I know that INSANE amount of money were injected by the FED and central banks from all over the world, but that's gotta show somewhere. That's gotta impact the economics world somehow (at least in long run). Then you take a look at US, people without jobs, tents of homeless people all around LA, their health system (at least for me) is absolute joke and trillions of dollars will make unpleasant things dissapear and it's basically just **win-win-win** situation? Who still believe this BS? 

I know, by some time everything will go back to normal. As everyone panicked way too much on the stock market one month ago, now I think people are way too comfortable with the growth, they do not realize the impact of coronavirus that will take place even months from now... 

Maybe I'm crazy, but seeing all of this, I don't believe US market at all. It's pumped like crazy, people ignore obvious trouble just because of huge amount of helicopter money. I still think, we are in bear market (today, S&amp;P 500 is at 2761 - so if you find this in the future, you can laugh on my expense). 

If you agree with some of my points, where do you invest? What does make sense? On what literature I should focus? I really do think world is changing and definitely would love to find more ideas about it (even critique of my opinions are 100% welcomed!)

investing,Consumer confidence signals,"Despite signs everywhere that we’re entering a recession, there are still plenty of bulls who think we can print our way out of this and that we’ll see a V shaped recovery.

Let’s pretend we reopen our economy next month. Unless we do it alongside the measures recommended by doctors and scientists (widely available antibody tests, tracking measures in place, etc.), consumers will not be lining up at all their favorite venues to spend their money. 

They will be saving more and spending less until there is either a vaccine, a 90%+ effective therapy in mass production, or strong tracking and prevention measures put in place that are supported by science and backed by policymakers. There is currently a growing rift between state governors and the Whitehouse. The Whitehouse wants the economy to open up. Coastal state pacts are saying we won’t do it without the guidance of our scientists and when we do, it’s going to be slow.

The economy is close to 70% consumer driven. Consumer confidence is going to be one of the best indicators during these times to help us get a sense of when a true recovery is happening. Last month it dropped below 100 which is historically a sign of growing pessimism and reduction of consumption. https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm

My husband and I (mid 30's, from Ontario) have been living in a tiny bachelor apartment in my parents basement for the last year while saving for a downpayment for a house. We have a 2 year old and a 4 month old. My husband and I are very frugal people, we live within our means, drive old cars we repair ourselves and have no debt. Due to tensions in the house we need to move out soon. My parents really don't want us to rent because we worked so hard to save towards our goal and with the rental prices in our city, renting would cost us the same or more than a mortgage payment (I realize a house costs more than just the mortgage payments). However my husband and my father are constantly arguing and yesterday my dad said we need to find a place soon. We are going to be purchasing a house with my husband's mother and we have looked at several houses with completely separate suites for her.  She will be paying 1/3 of the mortgage, taxes and insurance along with some utilities. This will help ease some of the costs of owning a home in our city which is very expensive. My husband and I have stable jobs that we can't see being affected by any covid-19 job losses. My mother in law is retiring from teaching this June so her income is stable as well. She is also contributing to the downpayment.

Just before all this covid-19 craziness started we had put an offer on on a house but we didn't get accepted. Bidding wars on houses are the norm around here. We had raised our offer to way more than we had ever wanted for the house and when we didn't get it, and the covid lockdown started my husband was very relieved. We had decided then to stop our househunt and see what happened with the housing market in a few months. 

However since those last few weeks my parents have strongly encouraged us to continue looking for a house especially since my husband and my father are at each other's throats. They won't kick my children and I out but my dad has said he is one more argument away from telling my husband to leave. This would mean we leave to, for my mental health I will not live without my husband especially with two small children.  

I spoke with my realtor yesterday and she said that while she can't predict what the market will be like in the future, and she understands if we want to wait, right now there are no bidding wars and we might even be able to negotiate an offer under asking on a home. Also Interest rates are very good right now.  I found a house that I am very interested in that we are going to look at tomorrow. This house is outside our city by 30 mins and a much larger house for $60 000 less than the house we almost bought. My husband is wondering if we should just rent for the next year and see what happens but I know that will mean that we have to use some of our savings and we only have enough for the house and our emergency fund. With the cost of renting in our city we won't be able to save much over the year. Also moving costs money and their is a huge bedbug problem in our city that I don't want to have to worry about if we live in an apartment. I know many people who have had to throw out all their furniture. 

Also another factor is that my mother in law needs to sell her house and if we wait for the market to potentially drop her house will be worth less and she may not be able to sell. 

I've come to realize in all of this that my husband and I know very little about the housing market and we are scared that we will make very big mistakes. Can anyone offer any insight on our situation. I feel like covid-19 has really changed everything I thought I knew about buying a house. It's either buy or rent for us. We could stay with my mother in law for a few weeks but she really doesn't have the space for us and she would have to give us her bedroom. 

I'd appreciate any advice or insight since this is such a major decision.",finance

This seems simple and logical to me, but I'm concerned I could be missing something. By not making the regular monthly payment on the rest of my loans, could this somehow push out my pay off date, or are there any other downsides that I'm not thinking of?

The S&amp;P was up 13% from the beginning of Nov 2019 to mid Feb 2020, in just 3.5 months. Prior to that it had traded between 2,500 and 3,000 for about 2 years on a very slight upward trend, but with a 20% drop at the end of 2018, hitting 2,350. The world wasn't shut down then. There was no virus. The economy was still ""healthy"".

As of this writing, the S&amp;P is down just 6% from November 2019 at 2,830. Yet almost every economist and analyst in the world expects a contraction materially larger than the great recession.

Going back to 1937 (these are recessions following the Depression, which lasted 43 months), the average length of the 14 recessions since then has been 11 months. Dotcom was 8 months and housing was 18 months. Dotcom S&amp;P peak to trough was about 24 months, 16 months longer than the official recession. Housing was 18 months, matching the recession itself. 

We are coming up on the two month mark from the 3,400 peak in mid-Feb, yet the recession is not yet official. We're still locked down. People are still dying. Emerging economies haven't yet been fully hit by the virus, where we could reasonably expect hundreds of thousands to die due to their incompetent governments, poor living conditions, and inadequate medical care.

The big difference this time is that central banks have been much more aggressive much more quickly to prop up financial markets and increase transfer payments to households, measures supported by trillions in new debt. Socialism has saved capitalism yet again. The greatest bubble in modern times is alive and well so the financial markets say. Stock markets are still bubbles, bond yields still assume there is no risk in the world.

Q1 earnings are coming out and they look terrible, with more to come in upcoming quarters, and yet we're down 6% from November. It seems the greatest economic contraction in modern times is worth about 6%. It was worth over 50% for both dotcom and housing. I guess this time it's different. We should applaud central banks the world over for making our economies risk free.",finance
personalfinance,A tale of two refinance options,"I currently own a 3 unit house that badly needs a new roof. I am in quite a bit of debt to boot. The ultimate goal here is to pay down debts and get the roof fixed. Longer term is to also build a new place and keep the house in question as an income property. 

I’ve been looking at my options and have basically narrowed it down to three options: 

1. My current mortgage company will not do a cash out mortgage. They will however offer me a refinance that adds 8 years to my mortgage term, but brings the monthly payment down by $900 a month. With money expected to come in from tax returns, govt incentive, and my last expected paycheck, I could probably squeeze out enough to pay for the roof, but be left with very little to live in or pay other bills. Of course I’ll have more wiggle room monthly due to lower mortgage payments. 

2. A mortgage service has given me an offer that will pay off 3 of my largest debts and give a cash payout for the roof. This will increase the term of the mortgage by 8 years as well, and increase my monthly payment by about $600 a month.  It will, however, free up $1500 I am paying on the debts that will payoff. 

3. Another bank has offered a mortgage at a slightly higher interest rate that would add 8 years to the term of our mortgage and give a payout that would pay for the roof. The monthly payment would come down by $500.

101k (shows $265/month payment on credit report) (cant go FHA because they will take 1%) Moving to an extended repayment will not help ($697/month)

Private Student Loans (with payments)

$9773-$152

$3736-$68

$8607-$147

$2925-$107

$2335-$83

Will pay off all other debt before hand (roughly $5k)

I applied for a mortgage with the same lender and was discussing on paying down student loans. My father offered to help ""gift"" paying off the private student loans. And the lender said that was ok as long as it was coming from his bank account and could show proof ect. That took my dti to 48%. But lender overlay killed it again.

If the private student loans were paid off and I was just left with the mortgage

My father would prefer to pay these student loans using a credit card (through plastiq or similar service). 0% apr

My question is if he was to pay those off before I apply with a different lender how would the underwriters view this?

Any help would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Loan Repayment Schedule Change - Why?,"I have a student loan refinance with Sofi through Mohela since 2/2018.  I got a document today called ""Loan Repayment Schedule"" that has increased my monthly payment by $3.50/month.  It says ""Your terms have been recalculated because of a change in interest rate.""

personalfinance,Selling/Buying in this market?,"Hi there! My wife and I are considering selling our house and buying this summer but not sure about the financial risks/benefits. 

We bought our house 4 years ago and house values shot up. We love the house itself but not the neighborhood and it has a very small yard. We have since had a child, changed jobs, etc. Also of note regarding the neighborhood which is purely emotional and not financial: our neighbors across the street are homophobic and have said pretty nasty things to us at times which isn’t a great selling point of staying. 

The numbers: 
Our house would list for 300k, we owe 201k left on it. Conventional mortgage @ 3.5%. 3bd/2ba MCOL area. 

We have 25k in savings and one car loan of 10k @ 2% and federal student loans at 24k @ 6% - my wife is a teacher who qualifies for teacher loan forgiveness (different than PSLF) which would be eligible in 2 years. 

We make ~ 125k/yr gross. We live within our means and have 1800/mo extra after retirement and 529 contributions which we’ve been throwing at debt over the past couple years. We’re not maxing our retirement accounts but are making sizable contributions (~10-12% of income). We both have stable, unionized positions and would be able to find work again if we needed it relatively easily. Credit scores above 800 for both of us. 

We were thinking of selling our house for 300kish and using the profits to put 20% on a 350k house. Similar house size, just different neighborhood or town nearby. 

From a financial perspective, does this seem risky? Our other option is to wait a year, pay off most debt and list it next year but I’m afraid we’d be in a full blown recession by then and might not get as much for our house. Personally, we don’t feel great with the nasty neighbor and want more outside space for our kid, plus we’d like to have another in the next year or so and moving while pregnant sounds more difficult. 

So PF- be our reality check. Worth it or should we wait?",finance

personalfinance,CA Personal Income Tax - Estimated Quarterly Payments Required?,"Hi all,

**Question: As a 1099 independent contractor (approximated income of about $51K/year), I would like to know if I am still required to make quarterly estimated payments for tax year 2020 for California Personal Income Tax (CPIT).**

I understand that the IRS/fed does **not** require for me to make estimated payments for tax year 2020 as an exception because I did not have to file a tax return in 2019 (according to the [2020 Form 1040-ES](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf) form, bottom left on page 1). I was an unemployed, graduate student in 2019. **I would like to know if the same exception applies to CA PIT.** I could not find an answer online or on the [DE 4](https://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de4.pdf) form.

I am in the process of completing my [W4](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf) form and DE4 form for my second job (W2 employee) and will not be selecting the option of ""multiple jobs"" so that I do not have additional withholding on my biweekly paycheck to account for my 1099 job as I rather pay the taxes at the end come tax season (again, this is allowed according to the exception mentioned above). I rather take 100% of 1099 payments and pay toward my debt especially with my loans on 0% interest for the next 6 months. If I don't have in enough in savings, I was thinking of borrowing my mother's money to pay the huge taxes come tax season.

I have tried to research the answer to my question based on the CA Franchise Tax Board and other Reddit posts, but I could not find the answer. I've tried calling the CA FTB, but of course, they are way too busy to take phone calls or chats right no so here am I calling to my fellow Redditors for help. This is my first time seeking financial/tax paperwork advice. Thank you in advance for any help I can get and hope you all have been well!

stocks,Using the obvious recession to time the market.,"The definition of a recession is negative growth over two quarters, which means a recession won’t be acknowledged until those two quarters have passed.

In the current environment, I doubt we’re going to avoid a recession. And I’ll bet dollars to donuts Q1 growth was negative.

My assumption is the federal government’s acknowledgment of Q1 negative growth and Q2 negative growth, along with an announced recession, is going to hit the markets hard.

Is there a scheduled date for Q1 and Q2 growth announcements? Are they public or is a sort of white paper provided ahead of time?  

And what are people’s thought on the lead-up to a Q2 negative growth announcement? I assume negative Q1 results will rattle the markets, but they’ll get pumped right back up. However, I also assume there will be some lead time ahead of the Q2 growth announcement where insecurity will slowly start to creep in.

Designing a calendar around these dates would provide a roadmap for options plays as well as  value stock purchases.

I’m curious what everyone’s thoughts are.

stocks,1984 is a very good case study to compare to 2020,"1984 was election year. Republican Reagan was running for 2nd term that year. Market was shaky to start the year but never crashed as it got propped up non stop. Reagan went on to win 2nd term. Through the 1980's was all recession but the market didn't reflect due to propping up.

A CPA? A tax attorney? She's a federale, her income will increase with regularly scheduled promotions up to about $120k in the next few years, with the potential to increase further because her agency and career field (contract officer) have a hard time keeping people and GS-13 and GS-14 positions are easy(ish) to come by. We both can live off of our respective VA disability payments if we had to, and are embracing some frugality after both coming to our senses on trying to spend our way through our various traumas, so we just want to try and make as much as possible to provide for our kids and to actually build our financial self esteem... 

If anyone has any advice or can point us to some resources we could use without paying someone, that would be rad. If anyone has any life advice having dealt with this situation before, let me know. Finally, I don't think either of us are ever interested in getting married again. I personally only would for very tangible financial benefits for myself and another party, the risk assumed is otherwise completely not worth it and you can totally have a productive, intimate relationship without ever getting married.

defi,"Why interest rate swaps are so important, especially for Decentralized Finance now?","Swaps rates are the market expectation of the variable rate.

Starting simple, what are “swap rates”? They are fixed rates that the market can offer to you now in exchange for future variable rates (also called floating rates). There are as many swap rates as dates to which you can lock up the contract. So, there can be a one-month, four-month, or 254-days rate present in the market. At Swap Rate, we introduce 12 rates for the next 12 months.

Arbitrage example: Why are swaps so cool for arbitrage? Because using them, you can easily hedge cash flow at different maturities from fixed income instruments.

Today, I received a $1200 deposit from the IRS in the same account. I am not sure where this is from. Should I take some immediate precautions or actions?

EDIT: Ok, I realize this is the stimulus payment. So, there is another problem. I am an international student. After filing taxes, I realized that TurboTax only works for US citizens. So, I will have to submit an amendment form within the next three years. The process for that has not begun yet.

personalfinance,What's the best course of action in regards to paying extra on student loans now that Federal Student Loans are not charging interest or requiring minimum payments through September?,"I know that the answer to this question depends on several factors but in my case, I have both Federal Student Loans (5%) and a Private Student Loan (5.25%) and a Car Loan (3.25%). 

For the past four years I've been paying down extra on my Private loan since it is the highest interest.  Since my federal loans are effectively 0% for the next 6 payments (April through September) does it make sense to take the previous minimum payments required of $450 and instead apply that as an extra payment towards my Private Loans (which are still charging interest)?  It seems like this would be the more efficient choice, all things being equal.  Am I missing anything here?

If not, I guess this post could also serve as a PSA to anyone else that has also been paying extra on their debt.  If you are not being charged interest on the Federal loans right now, it may be worth it to divert those minimum payments no longer required (until 9/30/2020) towards any other debt you may have that **is** charging interest.",finance

investing,April 14th Market Review - Canadian Names Edition,"I have mentioned a couple rules over the past posts.  Last week I noted not to mess with the Feds who have a money printing machine to keep the stock market afloat.  In my [post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g0qgbm/market_analysis_april_13_canadian_names_edition/) I talked about riding momentum.  Today’s lesson which many of you probably know - **the market is irrational**.  SPY was up 3% today putting it at August 2019 levels, close to October 2019.  Think about that, with tens of millions unemployed in Canada and the US, many companies closed, the stock market has only gone back 6 months, which is still miles above where it was a year prior.  Personally I chalk this up to two things:  1. People don’t see this as a true recession and believe businesses will just hit the ground running when this is over; and 2. Fed throwing money to solve problem short term.  Both could be true and theoretically we could just be propped up, even if we start seeing terrible financials over next 3-6 months.   Before my analysis for today, I realized I talked broad strokes without identifying all the companies I am watching.  So I will provide a list of companies I am watching and then my analysis on the day.  Note:  I watch SPY, Gold, GDX, and USOil to get an idea of general market movements. 

**Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy

Oil is going to test the low ($19.25), especially after a brutal -7.5% today.  From a technical standpoint – 4 hour RSI close to oversold, $19.25 will be right at bottom of daily Bollinger Band.  If I knew nothing about the current environment, I would look at that chart and say $19.25 is a good bottom fishing play, meaning I would buy around $20 for the psychological hold, $19.50 and just below the break at $19 expect the bulls to show up and protect that support.  With both a supply and demand issue for oil, it’s a risky play.  Despite that, most names were only down between 0.5% and 2% with only Husky being down 5%. 

People may be wondering why the oil names didn’t fall much today besides a couple percent.  Others may wonder why I am playing oil in this environment?  Why am I currently holding over 20,000 shares of MEG?  Isn’t that super dangerous and clearly not working right now?  Yes to all of that.  Personally I see two factors at play here.  One, what is priced in?  Here is what we know – short term both supply and demand are facing issues.  Storage tanks are filling up, supply has been cut but people say not enough to meet the reduced demand.  So the question is, what have people priced in?  If you look at the fall on some of these names I have mentioned, we fell between 70% and 80% since beginning of March.  I see this as peak fear and pricing in worst case scenario, so although we could see more short term downside, I think the worst is over and that leads me to #2 – government aid.  Today, during his daily briefing, Prime Minister Trudeau was asked multiple times about a bailout for oil.  He said he expects to announce relief this week for sectors greatly affected.  Numbers of $20B to $30B were mentioned.  It will be interesting to see what sort of relief is given, whether it is priced in, and the overall sentiment.  I have already flipped CPG from $0.92 to $1.41.  I will take some short term pain on MEG for a potential of a huge spike.  

**Gold Miners** -  Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold.

As mentioned, gold miners have been riding the bull break of gold to new daily highs or at least short term strength.  I said last week I did not expect this to happen because it has run so hard from the bottom without consolidation.  Look at this [weekly chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZKvsFFSi). .  That 5 week bounce is over 90% from the bottom without consolidation.  Gold and gold miners were approaching a monthly resistance and it looked like people either sold or shorts got in to protect resistance.  Most of the names were up about 7% to 10% this morning but began pulling back, hard.  Names finished between up 3% to down 3%. I would expect a short term cool down before trying to break through resistance.

**Marijuana Stocks** - I had only mentioned Canopy as that is the main one I trade because it is the sector leader and has enough liquidity for my trades but I also watch Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSO’s.

Organigram (OGI) had weak financials and was down 11.5% today.  Canopy don’t give a shit.  It was up 6.5%.  It is now within striking distance of two daily resistances that have acted as the highs since the flush of March.  It definitely still has a bullish chart.  Doesn’t matter though as I’m still watching for short term bearish opportunity with long term calls.  

**Banks** - RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD

I have mutual funds/ETF’s that are banks because I believe there is long term safety in these.  As a short term trader I don’t care much for them because their increases and decreases are not as volatile for me.  Case in point today, up and down 1% across board and in a sideways tight equilibrium.  These are for investing, not trading.

**One Off Companies** - Bombardier, Air Canada, Blackberry

**Bombardier** - It’s holding between $0.53 (high of the bounce) and $0.455 (low of last pullback).  I would say $0.45 is the true lower end for the psychological factor, I think more people will load up there to try and hold that.  If $0.45 breaks I think lower $0.4x is likely.  If it holds I can see it pushing $.50 again.  Finished up 2% today.

**Air Canada** - should of sold my puts when they were up over 50% yesterday.  SPY continuing its ridiculous run makes global markets strong which makes Air Canada and other names stronger.  It was up 1% today.

**Blackberry** - see above, up 3.3%.  Trying to confirm daily bull flag with break above $5.59 and then it’s the double top of $6.09",finance

stocks,Can housing make it or is it time to sell Zillow and Redfin?,"Over the last few weeks I've kept a close eye on housing market related stocks. I watched Redfin rocket up from March 18th lows and Zillow has also done great! I believe today marked a turning point and over the next few days, I'm going to be watching for the opportunity to switch from holding stock in these two companies to looking at puts.

My take on things. Mortgage lenders have become increasingly risk averse with the outbreak of Covid-19. They aren't being shy about it either. You can read plenty of articles from various banks tightening lending standards. Additionally, people are losing their jobs and they aren't necessarily going to get rehired May 1st. The last thing someone is going to be thinking about is taking on a mortgage.

 A $1200 stimulus check is great, but it's not going to keep you from digging into your savings to cover expenses over the next two months. Those were the savings for your down payment. I know this because I am that person! I'm dipping into my down payment savings to cover expenses and most of my friends are doing the same. 

I know what all the skeptics are thinking. Real estate is solid! We were in a bull market, home buying frenzy before all this! Interest rates are low! There's no way we're going to see drastic decline in home buying! I disagree with this rosy outlook though. In February, before we felt the true impact of the economy grinding to a halt, there were 7 million Americans behind on their auto loans. Now you add in the next few months where money is going to get tighter and people will get more behind on those auto loans. Then there's the potential for medical debt! All of these missed or late payments will lower credit scores and that coupled with the tightening of lending standards is going to slow the growth of real estate. I do not see Americans recovering to their home buying fanaticism any time in the next few months.

Thoughts?

personalfinance,"Is the IRS just backed up with work, or should we be worried about our refunds?","Hi everyone! I hope this is ok to post here, I’ll try to keep it as brief as I can.  
  
My husband and I filed taxes through TurboTax and received the texts and emails saying both our state and federal tax returns were approved on 3/12. We received our state tax return, but have yet to receive our federal return. I set up direct deposit into my bank account, which my husband is not on yet but we have an appointment tomorrow to add him to the account (we haven’t been able to until now due to being in a mandatory quarantine).  
  
It has been well over the 21 day limit, and I’ve tried calling every number I can find but it seems the IRS is not taking calls at the moment.  
    
Strangely, I see the stimulus payment of $1200 pending in my account, but this should be $2400 total for both my husband and I.  
  
Is the IRS just backed up because of all that is going on, or should we be worried about this? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Should we refinance our mortgage?,"Hiya, I have a refinancing question for all you financially smart people!

My husband and I bought our own just under a year ago. We have looked into refinancing and we got a rate that is 1% less than our original one and it will save us about $100 a month. But it will take 4-5 years of payments to make up the closing costs that are getting rolled into our loan. It just doesn't seem like a good idea to increase the amount of debt I am in to save $100 a month. I honestly dont know if my husband and I will be in our house for the whole 30 year term. Who knows, maybe we sell in 5 or 6 years if the market is good and we want to upgrade. So, while I understand that with the lower interest rate we may save money over the entire length of the loan.. say we want to sell in 5 years, does it really benefit us? I am just so confused on whether it is actually a good idea or if people generally make this decision solely for the monthly savings? We arent struggling to pay our mortgage as it is. 

Any advice would be truly appreciated!

personalfinance,Single with zero allowances... How tf do I owe money on my taxes?,"I was always taught in personal finance classes that if you list zero allowances, you wouldn't owe any taxes.

I guess I have to list more withholding next time I file a W4 beyond zero allowances. Did I add something wrong? Or do I really owe $139?

personalfinance,Cash-out Refinance on Home Loan and Student Loan?,"Current mortgage is conventional, 30 yr at $1,590/month (interest, principal, mortgage insurance, taxes, insurance) with 5.125% rate and about $225K remaining principal. 

Originally was just going to do a simple refinance to 30 years at 3.375% which would drop payments to $1,318/month, but then we inquired into do a cash-out refinance to pay off wife's federal student loans with about $30k balance remaining at 4.5%., which would drop payments to $1,519/month and closing costs of $4,600.

I've heard of the pros and cons, but with a baby on the way, this cash-out option seemed like a good option to basically cut one entire loan payment out and even lower my monthly mortgage a bit (albeit obviously paying more interest overtime on the student loan amount). Any thoughts if this is a good option?",finance

stocks,"I'm really, really, really bad at trading.","I've been trading now for probably 7 years. I got really into it at the tail end of High School, when I would trade low value stocks up based exclusively on the ""buy low, sell high strategy"" that I had learned about through cursory research. At the time I was trading maybe only $50-$100 here and there, just to test the waters. My DD consisted of one thing: looking at the chart for 5 minutes and deciding whether or not it was a good idea to buy based on what the little squiggly line looked like (these were the days before Robinhood back when there were more than 3 settings for TA).

I made a few good plays... so good, in fact, that I doubled and in some cases tripled the small amount I wagered. This wasn't overnight either—it often took a few weeks or months to happen—but needless to say it was pennies. But at that point I realized the potential: I was hooked. All I had to do was click a button (again, before Robinhood, so yes I actually ""clicked"") and my money would double in a few weeks! I didn't have to do anything but sit back, relax, and watch my $$ multiply.

Obviously, this was more fluke than trend, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this post. As I continued, I began to realize, albeit slowly, how complicated the superstructures of trading really are. It's a far-cry from being as simple as ""click buy, click sell."" You have things like commissions to consider (remember those?), stocks to choose, investment strategies to decide on, risk profiling and diversification, moral guidance for investments, algo trading bots/software, just to name a few. Not to mention the most significant variable: the market is alive. For every trade you make, there is someone you are trading with. Someone on the other side who has the exact opposite strategy as you have in that moment. Someone you're constantly fighting to win.

I'm generally an adaptable, hardworking, idealistic person (I now realize these are probably the worst traits for a successful investor to have). It's been my experience that the more you put into something, the more you get out of it. It's worked with all of the real things I interact with, so naturally I let these behaviors lead my investment experience. I would place a trade and, thinking that the more I watched the markets the more responsible and hard working was being, would be glued to the screen from open to close. Further, every time I learned something new about the market I tried to adapt my strategy to cope. I realized that it's much easier to make a $15 commission back on a $1000 investment than a $100 investment. Especially if I'm investing in something more volatile, right? Well, this quickly led me to pink slips, and from there into obscure, baseless ""investments"" in now mostly defunct companies. But I would always cling onto the hope of landing a good trade, which sometimes happened. Mostly, though, I kept losing money.

I realized that my strategy was failing, so I decided to stop investing in stocks. It was time to move onto something more productive, like making an honest living. So I worked for a few years, and then my life transformed. My dad died, quite suddenly, of a heart attack. I still lived with him and performed CPR, but we still lost him.

The trauma of that evening broke my brain, and I felt that the only way to fix how I felt was to make something equally as life changing happen, except good. So I went to the only thing I knew--trading, which quickly transformed into even more speculative crypto trading. It happened to coincide with the crypto boom in 2017, which threw my portfolio in a crack-crazed blitz to the moon. It was happening! I finally had figured it out! My life was going to turn around and I was going to retire on a mattress stuffed with bitcoin.

And then as quickly as it was there, it disappeared. Largely because crypto is a baseless and extremely complicated &amp; volatile asset that no one really understands.  But also because I kept chasing. I kept chasing the feeling of gaining; knowing that my approach had led me to success, I kept at it to find more success. Then came Robinhood and Options trading.

You get the story by now.  The combination of my ambition, idealism, and broken heart led me to lose almost all of the money I've made in the last 7 years. I'm down $130k. I wish I had a more heroic story to tell, because engaging the markets truly felt heroic—especially on the 100%+ days. But at the end of the day, I spent $130k to lose 7 years of my life. And my dad isn't coming back no matter how much money I make.

The markets are a beast of our own making that represent human psychology and behavior on a macro scale and almost always emphasize the negative elements of human capacity.  We have created a phenomenon that enslaves us in isolation and addicts us to hope, yet remains completely separate from the real world.  It's effectively a sink for our emotions, resources, and time; one where we are encouraged to live by our worst tendencies in a Wolf of Wall Street-esque hedonistic dystopia. Any wealth that comes from the markets just builds on the current financial inequities we are victim to--enabling the uber rich to get richer.

So, I'm done. Time to spend my time and energy doing something real. 

TL;DR: Lost money. Don't lose money like me.",finance
personalfinance,"Wife is now a Homemaker, moving IRA to ROTH. We should consider FZROX and FZILX right?","Setting up my wife's previous job $2,000 IRA to ROTH with Fidelity next week. Waiting on Fidelity's waiting period.  Going to add $100/mo. Going to invest in the following:

|**Index Fund**|**ER**|**% of Investment**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Fidelity Total Market Index Fund (FSKAX)**|0.015%|70%|
|**Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index Fund (FZROX)**|0.00%|0%|

|**Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund (FXNAX)**|0.025%|10%|

We are not really sure if we should consider the Zero ER Total US and International index funds. Looks like both are lower than when they started. Would it be wise to invest in something so new? Maybe do 5% of the respective markets?

**Edit**: It looks like for my personal situation, I don't *need* to switch to ETFs (was looing at ITOT, IXUS, and AGG) Mostly because I am at Step 4 and Step 5 of this subs [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). 

After reading [https://www.wallstreetphysician.com/not-make-keep-improving-tax-returns/](https://www.wallstreetphysician.com/not-make-keep-improving-tax-returns/) I see that Vanguard has a nice structure with their ETFs. They act as another share class of a mutual fund. This is a process unique to Vanguard, protected by a patent until 2023. Fidelity does not have that (but might someday) and would require someone at a previous step of the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) to do there own trading of ETF to get the tax-saving perk. 

Although the combined ER of the Non-ETF combo FSKAX, FTIHX, and FXNAX is 0.01%. The iShares ETF combo listed above is 0.17% ER and Vanguards EFT combo of VTI, VXUS, and BND is a total 0.155% ER. Saving the work of manually trading Fidelity's iShare ETF, while also saving 0.07% in Expense Ratio cost and 0.055% with Vanguard, seems like a good tradeoff. I'm not educated enough to compare that to what I could save in taxes by paying the higher fees and saving in taxes, but I know the work is much less which saves me 100% anxiety of ""doing everything right"". Simplicity and risk mitigation has been the key to my success and happiness. Plus looking at my taxes for 2019, my federal taxable income was $25K less. So like User 732 said, ""Over 30 years you'll have spent a whopping $130 more."" That doesn't seem worth all the extra work.

Had to stop there because of letter count max.",finance
stocks,"My defensive buy-and-hold portfolio, started ~1y ago, beat its benchmark for the first time yesterday. Evaluating what I've learned over the last year","About one year ago, I started to move a portion of my savings out of a passively-managed strategy and into an account I actively managed for the first time. My reasoning was twofold. First, I became interested in learning more about the stock market and investing in general. Second, I had a medium-term bearish outlook, and wanted to see if I could develop a defensive portfolio that would achieve decent returns. In a past post, I described this as follows:

&gt; I am a young, fairly bearish investor. I am concerned about a significant market downturn in the near future, but as a young investor with room to tolerate a fair amount of risk I don't want to sit out growth opportunities. So I am trying to build a portfolio that can capture gains during the remainder of the bull market while still being protected in the event of a recession.

I embarked on this effort knowing that stock-picking was a bad idea, that I probably cannot beat the market, etc. (This all still holds true.) But, it was a fun little challenge that motivated me. I decided to see if I could beat a total-market equity index, and chose the Wilshire 5000 as my benchmark.

Yesterday, for the first time since inception, my portfolio's performance crossed over my chosen benchmark: [proof](https://imgur.com/ig89MQE). This isn't really a brag post, since this probably isn't going to last long (I underperformed the market today...) and it certainly isn't anything approaching a good enough sample. But since it has been encouraging to make up some ground over the course of the coronavirus drop, and this is something of a milestone, I've decided to do a little self-evaluation of what I've learned, gotten right, and gotten wrong to keep myself honest. Hopefully, some other investors will take something interesting away from this post so it's not a purely masturbatory exercise.

------------------------------------------------------------------

After taking a little while to find my footing, I established two main rules for myself.

### Long term buy-and-hold only  
I definitely, 100%, have no idea how to time the market. I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow or the day after. TA is bullshit, and institutions that are smarter and more knowledgeable than me are out there arbitraging short-term inefficiencies and processing new information much more effectively than me.  
The logical conclusion from this knowledge is to put money in total-market index funds if I want the highest return. I consciously accepted a near-certain loss of money by choosing to pick stocks. I aim to mitigate that loss as much as possible by *not* trading, *not* panicking, and *not* trying to get cute with options, shorting, or other instruments I don't understand. I buy shares in a company and I will continue to accumulate them as I save income until a time that my investment thesis fundamentally changes, at which point I sell all my shares.  
Over the course of the past ~year, I've only sold two companies: one because my investment thesis changed, and one because I rushed in too quickly and realized I didn't really understand it as well as I thought I did.

### Don't invest in anything I don't understand  
If I was going to invest based on analyst recommendations, popular sentiment, or desire for diversification, I should again simply invest in a total-market index fund. Since I am (accepting that I will likely fail and) trying to 'beat the market', I will commit to this, and only invest in companies which I understand and have some reason to believe will outperform the market's expectations. (I will likely be wrong.)  
The *bare minimum* for 'understanding' the business of a company requires:

* Reading the most recent 10-K (or equivalent report), with a key focus on: nature of the business, risks highlighted by management, health of the balance sheet, any figures or accounting tricks I don't understand, current state of the industry/important competitors, secular trends in the industry. To build up the basic facts I need to know about the company and business.
* Reading all recent investor presentations, earnings call transcripts, other communications from the company. To see what management is drawing attention to (or deflecting attention from), and try to understand what's currently going on with the company.  
* Read the accessible analyst reports and opinions on the company. Not to develop an investment thesis, but to check my work - to see if there are concerns or arguments I'm not thinking of, to understand why overall sentiment might be with/against my own.

I have done the above for all the companies I have a position in. This should get me at least to the point where I could explain the business to a friend at a high level, identify short term head and tail winds for the company, and explain what the prevailing Street sentiment is.

Frankly, this is not enough for me to really feel like I 'understand' the business. I have found myself surprised and disappointed by how little information is contained in things like 10-Ks. For a few of my holdings, I have dipped my toe into the waters of trying to put together some independent research on the company's performance. For example, in researching $KSU (a railroad), I dug through some transportation reports and BTS data to try to build up a picture of flows through their rail network, but found myself unable to do so to my satisfaction. I'm not sure if my failure is because I'm not 'in the know', and there exists good ways for professional equity analysts to put together this information. Alternatively, maybe they're all hacks who are just regurgitating data from the most recent 10-K. My presumption is toward humility in cases like these given that I really don't know what I'm doing, but this still has been a point of frustration. If anybody knows some good books or resources on how to conduct equity research, I'd love to hear it.

This rule has probably limited my performance a lot, since a lot of the best-performing companies are in big conglomerates in the tech or healthcare sectors. I am a 'tech guy' (software developer), but don't claim to really understand the details of a lot of the big tech companies. And I tend to shy away from conglomerates, because it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts of the business and develop an investment thesis. My preference is toward small- or mid-cap companies that have one core competency that they do very well.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, to discuss what I've actually done. Aware that we were nearing the end of a market cycle, and having a natural proclivity toward the excessively cynical and pessimistic, I wanted to build a portfolio that would outperform through a recession that might occur within the next 2 years. However, as I mentioned above, I didn't want to simply sit in cash or gold or something, since that would suggest market-timing abilities I don't have, and I wanted to be able to reap the rewards of a potentially ongoing bull market.

I read a lot, and have read a lot about the 2008 recession. I am finding now that probably the biggest flaw in developing my strategy was that it was too backward-looking, i.e., I was imagining a recession triggered for basically the same reasons that 2008 was. (Probably, people who have been on reddit are familiar with how many were simply assuming that student loan debt or corporate debt would play the role of mortgages in 2006-08. As well as the ever-present quoting of ""The Big Short"". I fell prey to the same thing.)  Of course, the crisis we are currently in is not identical to the one we experienced in 2008, and of course it wouldn't be - it's always the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out. Chalk this up as another good reason to not believe myself smarter than the market and simply invest in a total-market index fund.

I break down the holdings in my portfolio, broadly, into three segments:

### Real Assets  
These are companies whose value is primarily in real assets like land, pipelines, commodities, etc. My picks erred toward sectors I thought would hold value and be resistant to bubbles like we saw in housing in 2008.  
Tickers: $AUKNY, $PAC, $BIP, $KMI, $WMB, $DOC, $SPG, $AUY, $WY

I bought $PAC (operates a group of airports in Mexico and one in Kingston, Jamaica) because I was bullish on US-Mexico trade and felt that air travel will have durable demand going forward. I knew it would take a temporary dip during any recession, but felt that this was a much bigger threat to airlines than airports, especially given that Mexican airport operators work via government concession. I was looking to buy $AUKNY (Auckland NZ airport) on a dip and initiated a position after the March downturn.  
Obviously, air travel gets hit a lot worse during a *pandemic* than during your average recession. $PAC has been one of my worst performers so far. I purchased a lot at $128 and it has been as low as ~$40 in the last month. However, I am still very confident in this sector long-term and am adding significantly to my positions here.

$BIP, $KMI, and $WMB are all heavily in the natural gas pipeline business (midstream), though $BIP is a conglomerate with diversified infrastructure exposure. I felt that natural gas is in a secular uptrend, but that midstream would be steadier than oil companies or direct commodity price exposure, as the fee-based structure and wider moats from the pipelines mean they're insulated from price swings.  
Obviously this sector has also been somewhat hard hit from the oil price war (also difficult to predict!). However, the midstream companies are insulated to an extent as I had hoped. I also seemed to have picked some of the [best performers in the sector](https://imgur.com/9gvoor7), which was fortunate. I have been averaging down on these companies as well.

$DOC is a Medical Office Building (MOB) REIT. They have a solid record of growth via profitable acquisition and I felt that MOBs (which tend to be filled with specialists, as opposed to hospitals where core emergency services are) might be in a secular uptrend due to aging boomers and also might be better insulated from potential changes to health policy from the federal government. I thought their lease model and sector were well-positioned for a recession.  
$DOC has been one of my best performing positions to this point, down less than 5%. Not sure how the virus is going to affect them going forward differently from a normal old recession.

$SPG is the largest premium mall REIT in the US. I felt that the 'retail apocalypse' narrative was slightly overblown and that while there would certainly be contraction in brick-and-mortar, this would hit the lowest-margin properties first, and that brick-and-mortar retail would simply concentrate into the highest performing malls. This matched my personal experience (with friends and family), at least. Since $SPG had premium properties and were making good moves in the 'experiential' development space to bring people into their malls, I felt good about their chances going forward.  
A pandemic doesn't care if you're a mediocre mall or a premium mall. I feel this position has the highest chance of permanent capital loss and will be reviewing my thesis as the next quarterly reports come out and the Taubman deal potentially closes.

$AUY is a junior gold miner. I wanted exposure to gold but don't like simply owning the shiny stuff since it isn't a productive investment. I felt $AUY was being unfairly punished for divesting some mines when I first got in; I liked their decision to refocus on their core holdings and improve the balance sheet.  
$AUY is my best performer and I'm up about 50% on my position so far.

$WY is a timberland REIT that also sells lumber and some engineered wood products. I was waiting for a dip to initiate this position and got in at ~$17 post-corona crash. This is not really a flashy business but I feel that their demand will largely be deferred rather than disappearing and the trees aren't going anywhere. Hoping to see a return to ~$30 and stable dividends afterward.

### Industrials  
These are companies whose businesses are 'internal' to the economy, and not directly exposed to strength in discretionary income. I hoped these companies' revenues would hold up even in the case of collapsing consumer confidence/demand, like we saw in 2008.  
Tickers: $INGR, $KSU, $WRK

$INGR primarily processes corn into starch/syrup, and refines these into more specialty ingredients. I liked their vertically integrated business model and the fact that we'll always be eating corn. I felt they were making the right moves to expand margins by improving their specialty offerings without decreasing broader market share.  
This is a pretty defensive sector and my position is down less than 10%, one of my better performers.

$KSU is the smallest Class A railroad with a well-positioned and strategically important network that has great exposure to US-Mexican trade. Rail is an industry that I felt would continue to have secular growth long-term.  
Transportation stocks dipped but have rallied pretty well and this position is also down less than 10%. $KSU is one of my strongest conviction holdings and I am adding aggressively on all dips.

$WRK is in packaging and containerboard. They supply for Amazon; enough said, really. I felt they were making some strategic acquisitions and wanted exposure to this industry.  
This sector is an interesting one, and I'm not fully up on how it's being impacted by coronavirus. On the one hand there's additional demand for shipping to houses with stores shut down, but many of the retailers shutting down are also big customers for the industry. This position has outperformed the broader market but I'm trying to learn more about what to expect here going forward. Will be keeping a close eye on earnings reports in this sector.

### Defensively-positioned Consumer Discretionary  
I didn't want to avoid consumer discretionary entirely, since this sector saw a lot of gains. But I wanted to pick companies with good balance sheets and products with durable demand, that could survive and expand market share through a recession.  
Tickers: $LEVI, $SKX, $RACE, $TTWO, $ULTA, $CVS

$LEVI and $SKX were my picks for apparel. Both of them share near-pristine balance sheets with solid direct-to-consumer sales, which I felt would be important for any retailer to survive a recession. For $LEVI, I liked their brand strength and how they were leveraging it with their diversification into more women's clothes and tops. For $SKX, I felt that demand for shoes might fit a model where people would shift toward lower price-points as opposed to cutting purchases. Like, if you've got less disposable income, you might buy fewer shirts or jeans. But if you need new tennis shoes, you've probably gotta buy a pair - but you might go for Skechers instead of Nike. I thought with $SKX having a great balance sheet and expanding internationally they might pick up market share through a recession.  
$LEVI dipped hard but seems to be doing well with a good earnings call recently, I'm adding to this position. I'm less sure about $SKX. With the pandemic, demand might not shift the way I expected. I'm being cautious here until we get some more visibility into results in this sector. I need to catch up on the recent Nike quarterly report.

$RACE (Ferrari) is well known to everyone. Luxury goods tend to hold up based on brand strength and this company did very well through 2008-09. I also felt that highest-end luxury autos are better positioned to survive the trends toward hybrids and eventual self-driving relative to others in the auto industry, since they sell based on brand strength and driving experience more than efficiency.  
Ferrari has [outperformed every auto company but Tesla](https://imgur.com/6f55Cn2), which I'm assured is not actually an auto company. This is despite its only factory being in an incredibly hard-hit area of Italy, so all else equal it should be underperforming the auto sector. This is confounded by Italy's choice to ban shorting, which is suppressing some price discovery, but so far this pick seems to be working out very well.

$TTWO is a video game company which has the rights to several key franchises including the 2K Sports games, Civ, and most importantly GTA. My model for video game spending (purely anecdotal) is that as discretionary incomes go down, gamers will cut back by focusing their purchases on a smaller set of games that they love and offer a lot of playability. Some just see the price tags on things like NBA 2K or GTA and assume people will shy away, but I think they'll instead cut back on their impulse buys and focus on the core titles they know they like. 2K Sports and GTA in particular I felt would hold up very well.  
The 'stay-at-home' nature of this particular crash is clearly helping $TTWO in a way I did not predict at all; my position is slightly green. This is a result I don't think I really get credit for given my reasoning.

$ULTA, a beauty retailer, which is an industry that classically holds up well in downturns. $ULTA has a lot of brick-and-mortar exposure but I liked their 'experiential' pitch where they have professionals in store to help customers pick through and try their products. They also have a pristine balance sheet and were in my mind unfairly punished with a big dip from ~$350 to ~$225 earlier in 2019 after a rough quarter. I started my position after this dip.  
""Come in to our store and have our employees rub stuff on your face"" is very clearly not the business model you'd love to be in at this particular moment. However, $ULTA's online business is holding up and I think this company will still do well going forward, though it has taken a big hit to its share price. Long-term I still like $ULTA and have added through the crash.

$CVS, another company everybody knows, though not really true consumer discretionary, not sure exactly how to categorize them. Felt that some additional healthcare exposure would be good and durable, and felt the market was punishing them a bit too much for the debt taken on for the Aetna acquisition. Liked that they were making the right noises about paying down this debt in a disciplined fashion going forward.  
This position is down less than 10% for me but I'm very unsure with how it's going to work out going forward, especially since I think this pandemic is going to increase the chances of significant healthcare reform. This is the business I think I understand the least and may divest from going forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What have I gotten from all this so far?

First of all, I've had a lot of fun. Yeah I'm a total nerd but I actually enjoy reading all these reports, learning new things, and especially using it to slack off from my desk job. So I don't regret the experience, even though I've invested a lot of time to basically match the market's performance so far.

Secondly, I've learned that I know nothing. Everything I've learned, all the moderately successful picks, and all the very unsuccessful picks confirm to me at every turn that me attempting to beat the market - at least with my current set of tools and knowledge - is a very foolish endeavor. If I wanted to maximize returns, I should be in a total-market index fund, and probably so should you. I *especially* would have no chance if I was trying anything more active than my buy-and-hold strategy, like fiddling with options or day trading.

Let me know if you have any advice or questions. As I've said, I'm mostly logging this to keep myself honest, but hopefully others will get something out of all this typing.",finance
personalfinance,Is pay to delete a bad idea?,"I just discovered a past due medical bill on my credit report. I had forgotten about the bill, and it definitely is mine. It’s for about $350, which I can easily pay off without derailing any finances right now. In the past, I’ve had some success with creditors doing a pay to delete, which basically means instead of haggling for a lower price or making payments, you pay it all off at once and the creditor removes it from your credit report entirely. I was trying to gather information about whether or not this particular debt collector has a history of doing that, and I ran across a couple articles that indicated that it’s not a good idea to do that. I would like to buy a house in the next year or so, and I don’t want to get hosed on an interest rate.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt - Unique Situation,"I have now paid off all of my credit cards and secured an emergency fund that covers 6 months of expenses. My only remaining debt is 24k (avg. interest rate of 4.3%) in student loans that are approaching the 5 year mark.

If I were to aim to pay them off by the 10 year deadline when interest rates increase, that would average monthly payments of about $400.

However, due to COVID I was able to move home and am now living rent free with no expenses (aside from cell phone and subscriptions) until the stay at home order is lifted and my workplace reopens.

My question is whether it would be smart to:

**OPTION 1** \- Make massive payments on my student loans (could be as much as $2-3k per month) until I return to work and save modestly ($1k)

**OPTION 2** \- Make large payments on my student loans ($1k per month) until I return to work and put the remaining amount ($2-3k) into savings

**OPTION 3** \- Make larger than normal payments on my student loans ($500 per month) until I return to work and put the remaining amount into savings. There is no reason at all to try to pay them off early.

**OPTION 4** \- Option 3, then when I do finally return to work do one massive payment equal to a set percentage of the additional savings that are not part of the emergency fund (maybe something between 50-70% of additional savings?)

personalfinance,"Already paid federal/state taxes and 25% penalty on Simp IRA withdrawal, filing this year says I owe $858 more.","I posted about this once before and didn't really get a clear answer, so I thought I would try it again since I can't get through to the IRS currently.

Long story short, I did a total distribution of my SIMPLE ($3430.46) and told my broker to take out 5% ($172) for State and 10% ($343) for Federal, and then the whopping 25% for early withdrawal fees for both being under 59½ and the withdrawal being within the first 2 years of account opening ($857) for a total of $1,372.66. 

To my knowledge, that is every penny I should owe on that early withdrawal, yet when I enter my taxes on both Credit Karma and Turbo Tax, they have me as still owing exactly that 25% fee again, or $857.

investing,Why SP500 Is Rebounding Quickly,"The SP500 index is literally mostly on companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google.
Almost all the 'money' currently is getting funneled to the 'winners' of current epidemic: tech companies.

Sectors like oil and gas is a sub 2% on your market cap index currently. It can literally go to zero and you will only see a drop of 2%.
Hotel/restaurant sector is like 1.6% on your market cap index currently. It can literally go to zero and you will see only a drop of 1.6%. 
Sectors such as transportation infrastructure is 0.1% of your market cap index currently. Again, it can literally go to zero and you will see a drop of 0.1%.

You see, unlike previous recessions, there's currently some sectors flourishing/booming in the market. Those sectors are currently a significant portion of your index.

+ Speculation with lots of 'hope' that stock markets only go up. Maybe the bubble will burst soon. Maybe it isn't a bubble. No one knows.
+ Pathetic interest rates making stocks the only viable investment option.

But mostly.. no one here knows.
The only significant industries in the market cap currently I am seeing vulnerable to this recession are:
Banks: 4.38%
Real Estate: 4%

Hotels/Restaurant/Retail: 1.6%

It's absolutely astounding how tech heavy our US Total Stock market is. The market cap dictated tech as the future of growth with this epidemic.
The US stock market today is essentially a tech + health care index.
Current evaluations are stating that the future of America is in tech/health care. And that many of today's companies in the more 'traditional' sectors are no longer necessary.

\- I would like to do some updates to my home that my husband cannot afford. Flooring, windows, some light landscaping. We bought a home that needed a lot of updating but all I could afford to do at the time was re-do the plumbing

personalfinance,International student from Canada files IRS taxes after internship on J-1,"Hello everyone,

I hope to find some answer here.

I am international student studying in Canada (I am a temporary resident of Canada based on my Student Visa) and I had my paid internship in the United States, California during 2019, where my employer sponsored J-1 visa. I had my employment for 8 months. Based on the info above, legally, I am considered to be a non-resident alien. Overall, I paid certain amount of taxes to Federal Government and State of California.

I have recently filed my taxes for 2019, however I have not submitted them yet (I will get refunded about 25% of total taxes I paid to the US and CA). Took entire day to read and understand all kinds of forms and publications from the IRS and CRA, however I still have some questions.  All I have from my employer is W-2 form which I used to file my taxes using free tool provided by the IRS using TaxAct. I submit 1040-NR-EZ to IRS and 540NR to California. *I am not submitting it for now, because I would like to fully understand my situation and probably find anyone with similar experience.*

1. Do I need any additional forms from my California employer? 1042-S? Can it help?
2. *I am an international student in Canada*, thus I am a temporary resident of Canada and a permanent resident of my home country. There is no student tax treaty between the United States and my home country (Russia), only with Canada. Can I potentially benefit from being a student in Canada while filing my IRS tax return?Note: based on what I have managed to find on the Internet, I cannot, because I am not Canadian.
3. Do I file my yearly Canadian taxes based on refund information from IRS or based on my W-2 form? I had my previous internships within Canada, so it was pretty easy before.

I have spent the majority of time trying to Google any information regarding my case, however I have managed to obtain only general information from the IRS or CRA web-site and I feel like it applies only to foreign nationals studying in the United States or Canadians. I consider Reddit to be the last source where I can get any advice (since it is not an *official* source of legal/tax information), however my case feels to be somewhat unique at least based on Google search I have conducted and based on my social circle (all my friends who had internship in the United States are Canadian or American citizens).

Thank you in advance.

P.S. I am happy to refund even that amount stated above (+ hopefully something from the CRA) because during this COVID-19 pandemia and global economic downfall my monetary resources are very limited. I am not from an oligarch family. However, I would like to get as much refund as possible to keep paying my international tuition in Canada to relieve burden on my family. California intern salary allowed to cover several semesters.

personalfinance,Debating what my next financial moves will be short term and long term.,"So some background: 21 years old, graduating college this semester for economics and business, miraculously got a job at a contract biotech company 2 months ago working supply chain - about 52k/year give or take depending on how much OT I do (also maxing out 401k match at 6%), 13450 in college debt and no other debt. I have a few different savings accounts - Emergency fund and college savings are in high-interest accounts, some other savings in more liquid accounts I can pull from at any time. I even keep 2k under my mattress for dire emergencies lol. I have an investment account I started when I was 18 with money from family - sitting on 2k invested, 3k cash. 

Now that I am damn near done with college and working full-time (even during these times since I'm an essential worker), I'm trying to figure out my next moves. Obviously, I'm gonna pay back my loans asap but I know my interest rate will be decent since their federal loans. I can easily pay it off within 1 to 2 years at most. What comes next is what gets me stumped. The next big things I have in mind are just moving up in my company, eventually moving out, buying a house and just chilling. 

In the short term, I want to invest more and get rid of my loans asap. I luckily filed taxes as independent for last year so I should get the full amount of that government check. I plan on using that money, my remaining college savings and the remaining cash in my portfolio to buy some BRK/B, VTSAX, VOO, and QQQ (though those are still subject to change). From there, dollar-cost averaging and maybe playing around with some other stocks and ETFs (bonds have never really caught my interest for some reason).

In the long term, I plan on continuing to live at home till I can afford a house then chill I guess. I think I'm just concerned about the things that can happen between the short term and the long term. I don't see myself doing anything stupid financially. If anyone has any advice for any other finance moves I could make, it would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Interest paid decreasing in ally savings account month to month,"Hello PF community. First time poster, long time lurker. 

My ally savings account interest rate is now 1.5%. I believe this is a recent decrease due to the feds slashing interest rates again. 

But even before this decrease when my rate was the same month to month, why were my monthly interest paid amounts decreasing every month? 

For example I was paid $37 in interest in June and by December it was $28 (each month decreasing in between) with no balance transfers. 

Is this how interest paid is calculated? I might be dumb but I thought interest paid would increase every month because it would be compounded on top of the increased balance. 

Or does the interest rate at on a hysa fluctuate that often?

Edit: 
Thank you for your help. I checked my statements and the apy% each month decreased. I thought it would stay steady for at least one or two months. Will now put portions of my savings into a cd.",finance

stocks,Conspiracy?: All online brokers are working with the Fed,"Everyone around the world wants to get in on the rise of the stocks.
The fed is pumping billions of dollars into the economy so its looking quite bullish.

Most online brokers are working with a queue’ing system because its “so busy”.
rh has 2.4 mil people waiting, Degiro has a bit over 20k of people waiting.
These are just the brokers of which i know the approximate queue times.
I’ve also noticed that the queue hasn’t moved for 3 weeks.
Which means that they’re not working on the queue, which means they dont want to gain money from new customers. Why? Transaction fee’s are their main form of income! unless they received external funding.

My guess :
Because the Fed is paying them to hold them in one place, and release ALL newbie investors with their stimulus check into a bull rally because they think they’re too late.

When this happens, the market will rise, and will crash right after people blow their full stimulus checks on stocks. and people will be even more broke than they were.


Is this what is actually happening?
I dont know, but i wouldn’t be surprised with the Fed doing what its always doing, manipulating and cheating.

Bitcoin,Banking Collapse,"The European banks have been lab testing its rats with the beautiful negative interest rate experiment during the last couple years. The research project has been led by the ECB and its brr brr brr printer located in Frankfurth.

*TLDR: The foundation of the banking system is softer than my pee pee when my wife's bf comes on his Friday night visits.*

We all know about Jpow and madame Lagarde's brrr brrr brrr bukaki fest going on lately, but this is just the grand final of what i believe could challenge the banks basics of existence.

**Some background**

The shit show began in June of 2014 when the ECB introduced negative rates of -0.1 to stimulate growth in the region, fast forward to September of 2019 couple months before the ol' ro ro outbreak, rates where cut to -0,5 in a desperate attempt to win the Paralympic gold medal for financial irresponsibility. With the banks in uncharted territory around the union they had to adapt. On one hand lower rates = more loans, more mortgage refinancing etc. = gr8 fOr biZz. On the other hand, due to the banks risky behavior from 08 and general bad pr and distrust in the public they were handcuffed by most European governments demanding them to increase their capital requirements, take less risk and an ever evolving and expensive KYC/AML procedure.

After all the rate cutting and increased expenses, the banks margins grew tighter and tighter. In fighting for survival the banks had to react, first off they implemented negative interest rates on corporate deposits with household deposits still remaining in the positive. At this point a mayor revenue stream for the banks was gone, as they historically always made money from household deposits, all of a sudden this was no longer the case.

No bank works for free and they would suck every last drop of blood if they could but they had to stay competitive with each other as well as acting the role of the responsible parent in the eyes of the public. So what was the next step?

Jyske Bank in mid 2019, the 3rd largest bank in my beautiful country of Denmark was the first bank in the world to introduce a -0,5% mortgage rate. Yep you heard that right, Jyske Bank pays customers 0.5% pr. year to take on a mortgage. You might think to yourself, daaaamn i wish i had such nice bankers in my country, but hold up. The next step Jyske Bank would take lifted the eyebrows of every autist with a brain cell. Jyske Bank went negative on household deposits. All of our lives we were told to save for the future, to be financially responsible, Jyske Bank took that philosophy and pissed on it. I mean a good old dark, yellow, stinky, hangover morning piss. At first it was exclusive for high net worth clients having at least the equivalent of 1 milly USD, but the requirements quickly lowered and all other mayor Danish banks followed suit.

As of today it will cost private households deposits -0,75% pr. year if you own more than roughly 35K USD. Yup you read that right, we have to pay the banks to gamble with our money!

**What now?**

Even before the Rona i think negative rates on every household deposit in every European bank were coming now it is inevitable and i don't see a way around it in great Muuurica as well.

After reading through reports on the National bank of Denmark, they express concern with what they call ""reverse rate"", this basically means that there is a point where lowering the rate through monetary policy further into the negative would have a reverse effect and banks would increase their rates to borrowers and growth would stall. In other words, they are running out of ammo. I know Japan has been running this scheme for decades but it is just not sustainable for the entire European union and possibly the states all at the same time.

**Total disaster**

My fear and doomsday scenario goes as follows:

Good credit and less risk is very subjective terms in banking. Every fucker with a paycheck applied to all the negative and near zero % mortgage loans in Denmark and around Europe and of course the banks have lend out more lightly than they should. All off the banks are now tied up on long term mortgages making peanuts with margins tighter than ever meanwhile governments are pushing for lowering rates on risky business loans even further due to the credit crunch going around the world atm. On top of that we are in a situation where unemployment is skyrocketing allover the place, supply and demand chains are shutting down, consumer confidence must be at an all time low, what does this lead to?

From a game theoretical perspective the most logical thing for people to do when this thing drags out is to do a historical bank run. People will flood the banks asking for physical cash withdrawals to avoid paying negative rates on their deposits in times of uncertainty and distrust, the banks cash requirements are non existent and most central bank liquidity is just numbers on a screen, no bills. This leads to a solvency crisis, 1930's 2.0. The Danish national bank even discussed the issue in one of its reports but pushed it aside with the argument that lager physical amounts of cash is a hassle to store, the public will not give a flying fuck when they see their fortune vanish and it is time to put food on the table.

This could possibly lead a total collapse of the banking system in the western world, banks did not have a reason to exist with negative interest rates before the Rona, now it is even more evident. No brrrr can make up for distrust and panic in the public, only push it further.

After posting this on WSB, a report from FSB (Financial Stability Body) surfaced expressing mayor concerns with stable coins. This all comes together with my post. Stable coins are a direct threat to the banking system and its negative rates on deposits. This is the last desperate attempt from the banks to stay in control.

CryptoCurrency,Stable coins getting banned - G20 regulation,"Before I discuss any further I want you to remind what was discussed in December 2019 where Christine Lagarde touched the subject ""stable coins"". Take a look at the video  
Time stamp of the video 57:13  
 

[https://youtu.be/ucuSp2QiK\_I](https://youtu.be/ucuSp2QiK_I)

 Pretty much they don't consider bitcoin as a danger but in fact they consider stable coins as a danger. She mentioned that they gonna get ahead of the curve on the stable coins and then immediately started discussing digital payments in the EU across European Banks and it is becoming a very severe situation with central banks pushing digital fiat. And that tells us that as it is the current situation with negative interest rates, central banks wants us to have an account in the bank so they can charge us negative interest rates, instantly, and force us to go and spend money, pretty much they can control our behavior with a click of a button.  
So since this press conference there was not that much of a news regarding stable coins but it came that day where they are going to pretty much ban them. They are forcing a new G20 regulation.  


Stablecoins continue to grow, we also saw some new stable coins launching in the past year. Different stable coins with different mechanics, some of them are backed by real fiat (dollars) and some of them are just an algorithm that keeps the value of the coin at $1 stable, a real example of this is Dai.  


[https://cryptobriefing.com/central-banks...ablecoins/](https://cryptobriefing.com/central-banks-recommended-ban-stablecoins/)  
I came across this article this morning. Financial Stability Board that is hosted by the Bank of International Settlements and it is also in high connection to the G20 are basically saying all countries have to ban stable coins because is no way that these stable coins can comply with even portion of the rules that they are imposing.  


Quoting  
""The Financial Stability Board (FSB) outlined ten recommendations to central banks for regulating stablecoins, including outright prohibition."" - I think this will be implemented real quick, I would say by the end of 2020 this might happen because it is in direct competition with digital fiat and they are not letting that to play by itself in the ""free market"".  


Quoting  
""The FSB is an international entity that provides suggestions on the global financial system."" - In many cases the regulation is put in place not to protect the consumers that is the biggest lie in all the regulations. They pretty much are saying, regulation is here for you, the consumer, in reality the regulation is there to protect the monopolies because you have to understand when you are a new company you are a new organisation and you becoming big. Question is why do you become big? Well it's simple because you've been working hard because you invest in research and development because you served the marked very well and all this is expensive but it's well worth.  


But the thing is when you become big enough when you become global, when you become powerful you have the choice to either continue investing in creating better services, competing on the markets allowing newcomers to compete with you and just being a normal participant in the free market as everyone else OR you have the choice to invest some money in lobbies and try to lobby for a regulation, try to build up the defense around your business model so nobody can compete because nobody has the resources nor the man power nor the knowledge to be the part of your walled garden because you have built up all this regulation and as you see it is very clear that this is whats going on right now. The fact that they are protecting the consumer, this and that, but in reality they are also admitting that this is in direct competition with their own system with their own power. It is very important to note that whenever you hear these regulation you have to understand that they are selling it to you and acting like they are defending you, so you don't revolt about monopolies because it's all about you ...  


I even believe in their ""meetings"" they are discussing a lot how they will keep the ""people working paying taxes don't ask any question"", ""we can do our monopoly defending through regulation because they think we are defending the people and by the way we also gonna do central banking"" which is the fact that you get people with high credit scores getting cheap loans getting cheap money and we see this wealth transfer from poor to rich, the Cantillon Effect(google it to understand better what is this). This all is marketed and positioned in media as something good for all of us but in reality it is not. It's all about keeping their monopolies and their system.  


Quoting  
""The recommendations are to be presented before an audience of G20 countries, and reference major stablecoins, including USDT, USDC, TUSD, PAX, and DAI (DEFI). Given the market’s heavy reliance on stablecoin, a ban could mean disaster for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market."" - Let's see what kind of arguments they have, why do they want to ban stable coins and at least regulate them to death. It is not necessarily that they are going to ban but it's that the regulations are impossible so it is a ban pretty much.  


Quoting  
""The FSB’s primary focus is on the potential risks that stable coins could pose to global financial stability""  - This bothers me so much, apparently the financial system is so brutal it is so vulnerable that we need to have all these guys protecting it all costs and when you have some stable coin project it needs to be removed because it threatens the stability. It really brings the question how vulnerable is this whole financial system why is it so unstable? Whenever new invention you have, whenever new startup, you always have to ensure that it doesn't threaten the stability ...  


They are basically saying that because retail investors are getting in all these stable coins it means if one of these stable coins exit scams or something else happen it means that that particular retail investor that bought a stable coin will feel poor it will feel like they don't have money and they will not spend in the economy so thus the financial sta",cryptocurrency

If I sample myself, my demand destruction has nothing to do with lack of funds. Getting $1200 in the mail is not really going to do anything for me here as far as adding to aggregate demand. 

There are all these little things, like that if I was driving to work I would randomly go buy a coffee or go to the convenience store for a snack. Seeing an item at the convenience store would lead me to think to buy something else later online or at another store.

Personally, I am getting use to just staying home and not buying much besides food. 

I probably would have already bought a shirt or new pants for work this month. No point to that right now. Just seems like you can go on and on with all these little things that are not solved by printing money.

How can I get better credit if nobody will lend to me in the first place?

I’m writing this seeking financial advice as a recent-graduate BS holding student who can’t seem to figure out the system.

I am 25 currently working as an employed IT professional in a salaried position making about $50-60k. The advice I seek is how to fix my credit score given my circumstances. Below I have made a list of the things that are affecting my credit score that currently sits \~555 “needing work” status in both TransUnion and Experian.

1. Federal Student Loans: : $26,000 (sole owner)
2. Joint Student Loans: $35,000 (jointly with mom)
3. One credit card: 3k limit, currently sitting at approx. 1k balance.
4. Monthly Rent payments: $1100
5. 2x Old (paid off) delinquent accounts (\*still appearing on credit history but closed status)

The only credit card I have started out as a secured card because I couldn’t get any others – now it’s unsecured with something like 21%APR. Recently I have tried with multiple companies (SoFi, LendKey, Petal) to refinance my loans or consolidate the debt with denial across the board. I pay my student loan payments on time, and regularly spend/pay on my credit card but still my score is not high enough to qualify for the simplest of things such as another credit card NOR approved rental applicant for housing.

Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

EDIT:  

According to my Credit Karma report, the negative things I have are:

95% payments made on time

7 years oldest line of credit and high credit usage.

The old line of credit is one of the Federal loans (each one is approximately 2,000-2800) and there are about 7 of those.

Am I best off working to pay off each one of the loans individually, one by one? I'm unsure if this would make the other 6 not being paid toward become delinquent.

With the on-going pandemic my Federal Loans all have become interest free (originally various 3% to 6.5% loans as rates changed over time), and Naivent (who administers them) has shut off Auto-payments for the time and seems to not be expecting them.

I was about to make a manual payment for the most-recent payment expected, and was planning on doing that for the foreseeable time.

However, I considered that up until about 2 months ago (various other obligations have had me put this effort on hold) I was putting an extra second payment into paying off a single loan at a time on top of the regular payments. 

My question is would it make more sense to just pump full payments into a single loan during this time  instead of trying to keep the regularity of payments across my loans until this period of freezes is lifted?

I believe we've already passed the recession phase as we've seen over the year prior with the interest rate cuts.  
So as Ray puts its we could either go through a very brutal deleveraging or a ""Beautiful deleveraging"" but would depend on how the policy makers handle this phase.

personalfinance,Interpreting Savings from Student Loan Refinance,"Hi everyone, I'm currently trying to figure out how I want to go about refinancing my students loans and get the best value out of my money. Right now I have about 175k in student loans at 4.95% with about 15 years left of payments. Making payments isn't an issue and I've refinanced a few times before to what I think is a pretty good rate. I'd like to refinance again and the best rates I can find right now are variable (not my first choice but I just don't see the fed raising rates anytime soon so I'm willing to roll the dice) 15 years @ 4.299% and 20 years @ 4.712%. 

Here is a summary of my situation with questions at the end:

1) Refinancing to the 15 year term at a significantly lower rate saves me about $75 per month and $10k in  interest over the life of the loan. If I maintain my current payment it will save almost $15k in interest over the life of the loan. 

2) Refinance to the 20 year loan, saving about $250 each month and paying $25k more interest over the life of the loan. If I maintain my current payment then I will save $4k in interest over the life of the loan. I would most likely go with  he 15 year loan if I intend on maintaining the same payment as my current loan.

3) Potential yearly savings in cash for the 15 year loan is $900 and for the 20 year loan it's about $3k. 

4) Lifetime cash savings at new lower payments come out to $13.5k and $60k, respectively.

My question: Is going with the 20 year loan the best option to maximize my money? I will pay more over the life of the loan in interest, but I will have more cash on hand (to invest, buy a house, etc.) and generally have greater flexibility with my money. 

I haven't seen a post like this and I've generally followed the path of pay off ASAP so I can be debt free but I feel like there is a better way. I feel like if my cash savings over the life of the loan are greater than the difference in interest, then thats the best way to go.

Loan of roughly 135,000, but the interest payment ended up being in the high 4s, maybe even low 5s. Think it was 4.75 honestly. Anyways, been thinking of potentially refinancing if I can catch the interest rate  low enough. My questions for you: Where is the best place to refinance? With my current loan company (PennyMac)? Or one of those QuickenLoan, RocketMortgage, etc? I get the feeling their a little too gimmicky. Also, considering I'm only 2 years in to a 30 year loan, at what point is it even worth it to refinance? If I can drop the interest rate .25 lower? .5? 1.0?",finance

3. Does it make more sense to use this time to pay down student loans (federal) or other credit cards?

* The fund’s derivative protections proved critical, blunting equity losses: we sold the VIX calls (adding +2.6% for the fund during March) and (most) equity put options (+1.4%); credit spreads blew out in Europe and the US lifting our credit protections (+4.7%)
* Capital preservation has allowed us to acquire mispriced assets amidst the volatility including gold mining equities; fixed income gyrations allowed us to add long-dated US TIPS (+20% in USD since purchase) at attractive yield
* Is proposed stimulus enough to allow markets to stabilise, ‘looking through’ to a post-virus era? With the depth and duration of record economic disruption unknowable but increasingly visible, and in the absence of a magic bullet (eg vaccine), further volatility is likely and risks accelerating an investor preference for liquidity
* Central banks are throwing the kitchen sink at the crisis, but their omnipotence is another COVID-19 victim. On Sunday 15 March, the Fed cut rates to zero and unleashed massive quantitative easing. Markets fell sharply the following day, the third ‘black’ day this month. This was the Fed’s ‘emperor has no clothes’ moment, and signalled the end of the post-1987 ‘Greenspan put’ era, where monetary easing alone repeatedly bailed out fragile markets and economies
* Our bet remains that deeper financial repression will result, with inflation-linked bonds and gold the key fund defences

I was filling for taxes and noticed that my wife's W2 shows that she paid $18 for federal taxes for the whole 2019, even though she made around $13k. Her W4 says Married, 2 dependables. 

I'm not very savy with taxation, so how is this possible that her employee took out only $18 for federal taxes?

We talked to her manager and he was no help. He said they will let their accounting person know to make sure it takes federal takes for 2020. However I'm still buffled with this situation since now we own about $2k in taxes.

investing,Federal Reserve - Beige Book April 15th,"Overall Economic Activity
Economic activity contracted sharply and abruptly across all regions in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The hardest-hit industries—because of social distancing measures and mandated closures—were leisure and hospitality, and retail aside from essential goods. Most Districts reported declines in manufacturing, but cited significant variation across industries. Producers of food and medical products reported strong demand but faced both production delays, due to infection-prevention measures, and supply chain disruptions. Some other manufacturing industries, such as autos, mostly shut down. The energy sector, suffering from low prices, reduced investment and output. Districts reporting on loan demand said it was high, both from companies accessing credit lines and from households refinancing mortgages. All Districts reported highly uncertain outlooks among business contacts, with most expecting conditions to worsen in the next several months.

Employment and Wages
Employment declined in all Districts, steeply in many cases, as the COVID-19 pandemic affected firms in many sectors. Employment cuts were most severe in the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors, where most Districts reported widespread mandatory closures and steep falloffs in demand. Many Districts said severe job cuts were widespread, including the manufacturing and energy sectors. Contacts in several Districts noted they were cutting employment via temporary layoffs and furloughs that they hoped to reverse once business activity resumes. The near-term outlook was for more job cuts in coming months. No District reported upward wage pressures. Most cited general wage softening and salary cuts except for high-demand sectors such as grocery stores that were awarding temporary ""hardship"" or ""appreciation"" pay increases.

Prices
The general direction of price inflation was down for both selling prices and non-labor input prices, as Districts reported either slowing price growth, flat prices, or modest to moderate declines in prices on balance. These trends were seen as reflecting weaker demand for many goods and services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four Districts also reported further declines in energy prices. In contrast, supply chain disruptions and shifts in the composition of demand led to significant price increases for some essential services—such as freight—and some agricultural commodities and consumer goods. While expectations concerning agriculture prices were mixed, the outlook calls for further downward pressure on prices on average.",finance

personalfinance,"Young, Need Advice.","Hey there!

I'm looking for some basic advice on managing my current finances. 

Some background on me:

* I am a freshman at one of the Federal Service Academies
* Technically receive a salary of \~$12,000 a year, however, the pay each class differently. During Freshman year, I will have received $1,500 of that pay. The rest goes towards paying off loans furnished by the Academy to purchase all uniforms and items issued to us, paying for food and other services.
* I am quite a saver, especially back during middle and high school, saving most of my money I received for Christmas/Birthday and working with my father.  I have over $4k in my savings.
* My parents/grandparents each invested in stocks monthly on my behalf from when I was born until 2008 (we were hit extremely hard by the market crash). Currently, there is about $6-$7k value in these, with about half in a mutual fund, and the other half in KO and DIS.
* I have another $8k in savings that came from a prepaid college fund, which my family instead cashed in and gifted me in return for earning my spot at the Academy with no tuition or room and board charges. 
* So in total, I have approximately $13k in savings currently, and $6-7k in stocks. I also just received the $1200 stimulus check and wish to invest it all. 

So here is what I intend to do, but want advice on specifics.

* Invest the entire stimulus check. 
* Invest a good chunk of my savings, but as for specifics, I don't have a number and are open to ideas.
* For these investments, I have questions. 
   * Am I able to open an IRA? I filed a tax return for my income, using the whole $12000 number, not the $1500 I actually see. 
   * If I can open an IRA, should I use my current savings and the stimulus to first max out a Roth IRA for the year, and then move to a taxable brokerage account?
   * Just an FYI, while considered an active duty servicemember, Academy students are prohibited from the Thrift Savings Plan until graduation, so I do not have a 401k option for another 3 years.
* I currently save about 25% of the monthly pay that I actually receive. Life there is like prison sometimes, so you end up spending a lot just from eating out and doing fun activities in town to decompress. This percentage will increase as I get paid more as an upperclassmen, but that is where it currently sits.
* Of that 25% I plan to save, I currently was thinking of saving 40% of it in my saving account, and investing the other 60% monthly.

I am currently paying back my student loans. My loans can be seen on FedLoan Servicing, so I have the ability to see at break down of the total loans, their current accumulated interest, as well as the ability to target individual loans.

To keep it short, I've been working my way back from a divorce, and am now in a good place and employed with a solid company. I have made sure to pay on my student loans, as well as pay a bit over. My total student loan through their website comes to $66,106,26. Broken down, it's a principal of $64,973.03, and outstanding interest of $1,133.23.

These are further broken down into the loans for each individual semester.

I am doing well financially, and in a place where I can chop down some extra on debt - I have already paid off a credit card. In terms of debt, is there an advantage to chipping away the accumulated interest, especially now, while I sitting on top of a bit extra?

personalfinance,How should I dispense with my credit cards,"I have $14k to clear some debt (\~34k).  My goal is to be debt free in 15-18 months and to stop the senseless high interest rate bleeding as soon as possible. Here is the breakdown of my credit card debt:

CC1:  8440  (19.99%)  interest charge is about $141

CC2:  11,613 (23.9%)  interest charge is about $221

CC3 (Closed):   14,000  (13.24%)  interest charge is about $166

My plan is to do the following:

(1)  Pay off CC2 immediately

(2)  Pay $3k toward CC1

(3)  Wait (1 month??) to open an Amex EveryDay® Credit Card from American Express and transfer as much balance as possible from CC1 and CC3 (0% APR and $0 in fees on balance transfers for 15 months).  My credit score/rating/debt will significantly improve with an 14k CC debt payoff (steps 1-2).

(4)  Pay about $900/month (budgeted for CC payoff) to either Amex and CC3 (or just Amex if I can get the whole balance of all CCs to transfer).  This hits my goal of debt free and immediately stopping high interest bleeding.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

(1)  Since CC3 is already closed, does it make sense to look into one of these debt management companies and see if they can help negotiate a better interest rate for CC1/CC3 as an alternative to a balance transfer?    I have no idea how much credit Amex will give me to the do the balance transfer.  On the other hand, a debt management company will require me to close all my credit card accounts and I will take a hit on my credit score (not sure how big of a hit that is).   I am trying to balance these 2 routes.

(2)  Will the Amex EveryDay CC require me to spend a certain amount to keep that balance transfer at 0%.   I didn't see any conditions but my new financial advisor suggested that there is probably some sort of a catch.  He suggested that they will find some way to screw me if I dont make a payment or don't use it enough, etc.  Going forward, I only want to use my CCs on small purchases online so that I don't have to use my debit card online (to be paid off every month).

(3)  How long will it take for my credit score and credit worthiness to improve after making my 14k payment?   how soon can I sign up for the amex card?

(4)   Any other suggestions on how to get my debt down as quickly as possible with only $14k in hand and about 900/month budgeted to CC payoff?

CryptoMarkets,Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy,"*As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.*

Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.

When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it’s cheaper to borrow money, so there’s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy – paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal.

That, at any rate, is the theory. It’s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).

## The outer limits

This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe – so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn’t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities.

So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn’t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before.

It didn’t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.

## Helicopter money

Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes – greater than even the Global Financial Crisis – central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is ‘helicopter money’. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving $1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea.

But there’s a problem with this, too.

Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where ‘going out’ is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere.

That’s really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools.

## ‘Hot potato’ money

In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy.

Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses.

But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We’ll call this ‘hot potato’ money, because it has to be passed on fast.

Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder.

So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo’s Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits – enabling even more targeted stimulus.

This idea likely has far-reaching implications – and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different ‘classes’ of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction?

This and other questions would need to be explored further. What’s clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools.",cryptocurrency

Investors dove head first into treasuries as a safe haven once Covid-19 started getting real, and they will likely start to exit this safe haven once the Covid-19 curve starts to flatten out and we open the country back up. Additionally, the expansionary fiscal/monetary policy is inflationary, pushing up expectations of inflation which is the primary driver of interest rates on these bonds. Powell was quoted saying inflation is not a primary concern at the time (more worried about the economy imploding). The trillions of dollars in stimulus will push up the supply of bonds as the U.S. begins record-setting debt offerings.

btc,Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy,"*As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.*

Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.

When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it’s cheaper to borrow money, so there’s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy – paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal.

That, at any rate, is the theory. It’s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).

## The outer limits

This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe – so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn’t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities.

So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn’t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before.

It didn’t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.

## Helicopter money

Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes – greater than even the Global Financial Crisis – central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is ‘helicopter money’. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving $1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea.

personalfinance,General Direction Request for Refinancing a mortgage given current circumstances.,"I am in a situation where I financed my House at a significantly higher rate than what is available now. I have thought about refinancing for a while, but my lack of knowledge has made me nervous. I am interested in refinancing now, while rates are low and housing prices haven't suffered too much, but know very little about where to begin ""shopping around"" for the best rates and would like some guidance. I also am confused about the idea of buying points and whatnot. Any advice on websites to read or companies to shop through would be helpful. Here are a few facts about my situation that might be helpful. Let me know if I should add any other pieces of information

Reasons for Refinancing

-Lower Interest Rate

-Lower Term Amount

-Removal or decrease in PMI (I am close to 20%, but not quite)

-No out of pocket (though no opposed to rolling into the loan)

(lowering payment is alright, but I will most likely keep my monthly payments the same or slightly higher, regardless)

Other Info
-Secure Job for the foreseeable future (as secure as it can be, really)

-Credit Karma Score of ~660, but looking to payoff a substantial amount of credit card debt in the next day or two. Estimated jump to ~750 when it finally hits my credit. Utilization is my biggest issue

-Plan on living in the house for at least the next 8 years

General Questions: 
-Any good sites that can explain my options in higher rate, lower points vs lower rate higher points?

-What are the best ways to ""Shop around"" for rates and which companies are a must to consider?

-Consider my credit Score (which I realize is suspect being from Credit Karma) and what the potential increase would be, is it worth waiting until that hits? Speaking with one company a while back, their ""version"" of my credit score was higher,guessing it doesn't take that into account as much for refinancing.

-Any other obvious things I am missing

personalfinance,Refinance Student Loans with Help from Parents?,"Hi all, I am a graduating medical student starting residency training soon in the US.

I have a principal amount of $82k in federal unsubsidized loans for medical school and about $14k total in accumulated interest. The $20.5k loans were each taken out from 2015-2019 and are 6.6%, 6.0%, 5.3%, and 5.8% interest rates respectively (but are 0% right now due to COVID-19).

My parents are offering to open a home equity line of credit and pay everything off in full, refinancing the federal loan to a much lower interest rate of about 1.75% right now. They are also going to be pretty lenient with repayment during residency, saying I can pay them back aggressively once I get an attending job making about $200-250k annually. However, they note the home equity loan is a variable APR and it's been around 3-4% in the past up to a peak of 7% at one time.

As far as I can tell, this is a great deal; I get to avoid the immediate capitalization of $14k interest upon graduation and get a much lower average interest rate throughout residency and early attendinghood. My parents and I are very close; they won't be strict with the repayment terms, and I plan on paying them back 100% plus more. The downsides I can foresee would be losing out on REPAYE interest subsidies and the 25 year forgiveness plan, PSLF (which I was not really planning on doing anyways), and the possibility of the variable APR increasing steeply at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve and JPOW were ahead of the game when they dropped the federal funds rate to nearly 0%. This drop couldn't have stimulated the market for more borrowing or more spending obviously because of quarantine. We're seeing sales drop all across the board which was expected and we will continue to see them for at least 2-3 more weeks. We are becoming more optimistic with the ""Curve Flattening"" but we should be worried about a rate cut that drastic, that quickly. With the stimulus checks being delivered from heaven electronically to many people's accounts in the last week, you have to wonder how the government did it, and what does the future hold?

There's only one reason why the reserve would print more money after just dropping the rates like that. As Matt Phillips states in a New York Times article talking about where the money is coming from for the checks, ""the relief package, called the CARES Act, will require the government to vastly expand its debt at the same time that the Federal Reserve has signaled its willingness to buy an essentially unlimited amount of government debt. With those twin moves, the United States has effectively undone decades of conventional wisdom, ***embedding into policy ideas that were once relegated to the fringes of economics***. [Link To Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/business/coronavirus-stimulus-money.html)

The actions that the government has taken have always been deceitful and meant to profit them in the end. Always a facade that never shows the true meaning of what they are doing. No one is thinking about those rate cuts anymore but they were purposefully already done to prepare for the economic stumble. I believe that after quarantine, the government wants that money back. They didn't print it to give it out, they printed it to get it back, with a profit. Rates will definitely spike after the quarantine as well. Add that to all the newly unemployed workers and you've got a ticking time bomb.

Do what you want with this information, I'm about to gamble some tendies with this stimulus check and post losses to r/wallstreetbets

personalfinance,IRS Installment Plan but now PIF,"Filed Fed taxes 2/7, owed $2506, authorized direct debit for full amount to be taken 4/15.  I began an amended return, but never filed, to cancel auto debit. Successfully set up installment agreement—received confirmation letter 2/28—and was quite shocked to see the full amount taken out today. Was able to cover it, but IRS hasn’t even sent me a tax due notice, so curious of timeline for them to realize the tax is now paid.

Will the installment plan automatically cancel once they see it’s been paid in full? There’s no way to edit or revise plan online as it’s not showing the 2019 amount due calculated. I want to make sure I avoid the installment set up fees and that they don’t start taking monthly payments out. Can’t speak with a live person at all, so am flummoxed with the whole process and my own stupidity for not cancelling the full payment. At least it’s paid.

personalfinance,Help with late taxes,"Hi!

I worked in the US with a J1 Visa back in 2014 and a couple months of 2015. I went back to my home country after that, and failed to file my taxes for those years. I did consult one of these companies that fill the taxes for you, but back then they told me I would have to pay about 3.5k to federal government and get a couple hundreds back from state government. Since I was completely broke back then , I ended up not filing my taxes.

I never got any notices from IRS (it's probably tricky for them to track me down and not worth the money?).

I have a few questions questions: 

how bad is my situation now?

How should I get my taxes done? I have no idea on where to start and I would love to get some help..

. Should I look for professional help? If so, what companies would you advise? If not, how could I do the late taxes by myself (software, sites, guides, manuals)?

My employer has given me the option to choose how much they will withhold from vested RSUs for tax purposes. I need to select either 22% or 37%.

I live in California and from just my base pay + bonuses, I'm already in the 35% marginal tax bracket for federal 9.3% marginal tax bracket for state. 

Putting my total marginal tax rate at 44% combined.

Am I correct in assuming that I should elect 37% withholding since any extra income on top of my existing pay will be taxed at 44% anyway due to the progressive nature of our tax system?

personalfinance,Refinancing with Med School on the horizon?,"So with the lower rates, I've been looking around at refinancing. Looks like I can drop anywhere between .5 and 1.5% off my interest rate. Closing costs put my break even dates anywhere between 1 year to 3.5 years out.

However, my wife is planning on going through pre-med, med school, and residency starting this summer. It would take her about 2-3 years to knock out pre-med here locally before we would move about 1.5 hours south to do 4 years of Med School and then back to where we are now to do finish with her residency.

We really like the house we are in and would like to hold on to it and possibly rent it out while we are gone for Med School.  I don't know the first thing about being a landlord though which makes me nervous about the whole thing. No idea how much of a time commitment it is, how much money we would need to charge for rent, how difficult it is to find renters, etc. Lot's of unknowns here. If we can hold on to it, we'd move back into it for her residency.

The way I see it, I have two options

1. High closing cost; low interest rate; may not recoup all our money before we maybe move/sell
2. Low closing cost; high interest rate; definitely recoup all our money before we maybe move/sell

As I type this out, I guess it comes down to how much risk we're willing to take.

According to their COVID page: 

""Federal Family Education Loan Program (or FFELP) loans were originally made by banks and other financial institutions under a federally guaranteed program. Some FFELP loans were later transferred to the U.S. Department of Education, and those particular loans are now government owned. The relief programs available may differ based on whether the loan is owned by the government or by a financial institution, such as Navient. ""

personalfinance,Car Financing: Choose really good (?) dealer incentive vs 3rd party loan,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I have a small question regarding purchasing a car in the near-future. 

While my current car works perfectly (its a 2009 Honda Civic Coupe EX), I'm reaching very quickly the point where I'd like something else - a car that I can feel more comfortable taking on trips to Tahoe and up dirt roads, with a bit more carrying capacity than my tiny 2-door. I also have relatively negative 'feeling' with my car due to a few legal problems incurred in it (Wet Reckless), and would like to move on from the bad 'karma' and start new. 

While I know that r/personalfinance's usual response like ALWAYS is going to be ""buy a ten year old beater Toyota Camry and drive it to death"", I already \*have\* a perfectly fine 10-year car. I think I'm in a decent financial position to buy a new car - and frankly, given the reliability and relative quality of the model I'd like (Mazda CX-5 AWD Touring), buying a newish used car would frankly be virtually the same price. 

\- No debt at the moment (paid off 65k in student loans that I'd refinanced through First Republic to a 1.95% rate)

\- 6-month+ savings 

\-stable job; currently contributing 10% to 401k

\-6,000mo take-home income

\-$1,100 rent 

\~\~\~\~Anyway, I'm not really trying to justify buying a new car (though, please chime in if you'd like). 

**I'm just wondering what the best option for financing currently would be:**

1) **Mazda is currently offering a 0.9% 60-month loan for new purchases**\*\* this is supposed to last until end end of April, but who knows what this COVID-19 situation is going to do. I will likely not buy the car until this settles down, because a new car isn't worth infecting anybody/being exposed. 

2) **Or, obtain a 3rd party auto loan**

I'd be selling my current 09 Civic, which could probably net around \~$5000, and I'd be contributing another $5000 or so for a $10k down payment on what ultimately is a $28-30k vehicle. 

Should I go with the Mazda financing? It almost seems too good to be true! **Or, for a 3rd party loan, what would you recommend for the best rates?** I have excellent (780+) credit and have gotten spoiled with my student loan refinancing of 1.95%, so frankly, I want the lowest rate possible. 

I'm sure many people here would also say to save up and pay in cash, but that doesn't seem like an effective use of cash/I'd prefer to hold more cash at a time given 1) the current macroeconomic situation makes me want to hold more cash if I can get a low enough interest rate, and 2) the opportunity cost of spending my cash reserves when I could invest/hold it compared to a (potentially) low rate. 

Please, help me! I've never had to buy a car (my current car was passed down), and I'm a bit lost on financing. Worse, online review sites like Credit Karma or Nerdwallet only seem to offer their tiny selection of 2-3 auto loans that somehow feel like they're getting a referral from.

stocks,Buybacks that backfired.,"I look at BBBY which is trading at 1996 levels and it occured to me the company would have been in much better shape had they never bought back a share, paid back all their debt, and kept a good chunk of their money in cash or simply raised a dividend. 

I see DKS is headed down that same path.. buying back stock with flat revenue growth to try to boost their EPS which will ultimately backfire leaving them a $5 stock in a few years.

Does it ever occur to these companies maybe this is a bad idea? Maybe paying down the debt would be a better idea? Holding a bit more cash, or maybe diversifying a bit with the cash reserves and not putting all their eggs in one basket?

Shareholders punish flat or declining revenue/EPS growth so investing in buybacks when you don't have the growth to fuel your stock price seems like a fool's move to me. Look at GE as another example.  MMM (the company where I happen to work at and have been buying their stock with my paycheck) has been doing it (much to my annoyance) Leveraging up to buyback stock does not create shareholder value if you don't have the revenue growth to keep your stock appreciating. (unpopular opinion)

Many younger people might not know this but stock buybacks were not legal before the early 1980's, and there is a push by some to have them banned. I support the ban, because there are too many examples of it backfiring on companies. Usually when something backfires as many times as buybacks have, laws are made against it.

As I continue to dig through tickers I find more examples of companies with lots of debt and high levels of ""treasury stock"" on their balance sheets, with share prices much lower than where they were buying... and they want to give all these companies fed backed loans... well as long as they don't outright forgive their debt (unless they file for bankruptcy) I'm okay with that.  I guess if they do start forgiving debt all the debtors will be winners and savers will be fucked. That will make for a great society which we can all be proud of.",finance
personalfinance,What happened to my tax returns?,"In late February, I prepared, printed, and mailed my 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal and state (MO) tax returns. All the state ones went in one envelope, all the feds went in another, with a cover letter on each explaining why they were late (complications with divorce and innocent spouse claim) and so on. The IRS rep handing my innocent spouse case told me back in Feb that the accounts were in non-collectible status so if I filed finally, they couldn't take my refund to apply to my ex's debt. 

Anyway, so I think I'm back on track and all caught up. Feds owe me $8.6k minus whatever fees they charge me for 2017-18 being late. 

Missouri promptly pays up and I get my refunds in a few weeks - these would have been garnished if the account was in collectible status so I know I was correctly advised. But from the IRS... NOTHING. Not a word. On the website for ""Where's my refund?"" I'm told there's no information about my filing (I tried entering the info for all 3 years). Not pending or processing or anything to indicate they even got what I sent in. I get the ""No information"" message on the stimulus website thing they just released (I am owed $1700). I can't get a human on the phone at any IRS or tax advocate office anywhere.

Thinking at this point maybe I reprint all of it and send it in again with a letter saying it might be a duplicate but nothing is changed, wondered if it got lost, etc. Certified mail or something. 

Any other ideas? I know paper returns and playing catch-up can take awhile but I am very nervous that I can't even get confirmation that they received any of it.",finance

My goal is to become debt free. I just graduated college and not paying back my student loans yet. Due to covid-19, the interest for all my student loans is currently 0 so I figured I’d hold off making payments until the grace period ends in October.


In the meantime I was planning to invest money in stocks and then sell them off in October to pay off my biggest loan of 8k that would go back to earning 7.5% interest. All other student loans have &amp;lt;5% interest.


I am currently contributing 9% of my salary to my 401k. My company matches up to 6% but I figured I would add more since I’m 26 and haven’t contributed anything until now. Should I change this to 6% and use the extra income elsewhere?


The interest rate for my car is 4.2% and I think my minimum payment is around ~$300 but I am paying $500 in an effort to pay it off sooner. Should I keep doing this or just pay the minimum and use the money elsewhere?


Emergency fund.... should I even focus on this while I have all this debt? I know how much this subreddit loves emergency funds but I don’t like the idea of money just sitting there while I could be using it to pay off debt.


When the grace period for my loans is over I am planning on adjusting things to pay off $1500 in student loans a month along with $500 for my car loan which won’t leave much room for savings or an emergency fund.

My father has only ever worked with real estate and is looking for a way to earn money off the money sitting in his bank account (over 100k). My research shows that being 60, his interests lie in a 50% stock/ 50% bond but I can't figure out the specific names of those funds.

One thing I've been struggling with is how to make instant buys using vanguard.

investing,Time to ditch Redfin and Zillow?,"A few days ago, I wrote a post about the turning point for housing stocks like Zillow and Redfin (below). I'm wondering what investors are thinking about real estate stocks and the market as a whole moving forward. There wasn't much discussion on the original post that was buried in the depths of r/stocks, but I'd like to hear more thoughts especially from those who lived through the 2008 financial crisis. I was too young to really understand it then. 

**Original post:**

Over the last few weeks I've kept a close eye on housing market related stocks. I watched Redfin rocket up from March 18th lows and Zillow has also done great! I believe this week marked a turning point and over the next few days, I'm going to be watching for the opportunity to switch from holding stock in these two companies to looking at puts.

My take on things. Mortgage lenders have become increasingly risk averse with the outbreak of Covid-19. They aren't being shy about it either. You can read plenty of articles from various banks tightening lending standards. Additionally, people are losing their jobs and they aren't necessarily going to get rehired May 1st. The last thing someone is going to be thinking about is taking on a mortgage.

A $1200 stimulus check is great, but it's not going to keep you from digging into your savings to cover expenses over the next two months. Those were the savings for your down payment. I know this because I am that person! I'm dipping into my down payment savings to cover expenses and most of my friends are doing the same.

I know what all the skeptics are thinking. Real estate is solid! We were in a bull market, home buying frenzy before all this! Interest rates are low! There's no way we're going to see drastic decline in home buying! I disagree with this rosy outlook though. In February, before we felt the true impact of the economy grinding to a halt, there were 7 million Americans behind on their auto loans. Now you add in the next few months where money is going to get tighter and people will get more behind on those auto loans. Then there's the potential for medical debt! All of these missed or late payments will lower credit scores and that coupled with the tightening of lending standards is going to slow the growth of real estate. I do not see Americans recovering to their home buying fanaticism any time in the next few months.

Thoughts?

I filed my taxes back in February and as expected, my return was withheld due to defaulted student loans. Now I've already been in contact with the loan servicers and sorted my defaulted loans. 

Yesterday, I received a letter from the department of education stating I'm owed a refund from ""federal refund, social security, and/or wage garnishments."" Now, to me, this tells me they are refunding garnished wages that occurred after the March 13th date specified. As far as I know, my return was withheld before March 13th. 

However, my fiance, who has not had any wages since February to be garnished, recieved the same exact letter. Unless it was sent out in error, there's no other explanation I can think of that would result in her getting the letter as well.

Does this mean we will be getting our tax returns after all? I did make a call to the default loan services company a few weeks ago regarding my defaulted loans, but when I asked about refunded garnishments, they said they didnt know if would be eligible for a refund.

I think there was a number on the letter, and I plan on giving them a call when I get home from work. I just don't want to bother them if they wont be able to give me any useful information in the first place.",finance
personalfinance,Unemployment Claim in Illinois Roadblocks - any ideas?,"Hello everyone, 

I was laid off on 3/31/2020 due to Covid-19, and filed my unemployment claim with IDES on the same day. In Illinois, in order to receive unemployment benefits, you have to create an account with Illinois Job Link and upload your resume, look for work etc. You also need to certify for benefits every two weeks saying you've been looking for work, haven't refused work, etc. 


My problem started 3/31/2020 when tried to login with the username I was given to create my Illinois Job Link account. I got an alert saying my username was ""deactivated"", and the website said I needed to call in to speak with someone to reactive it. I received a few weeks of unemployment at the beginning of 2019, so I figured that may be the reason, but I'm definitely not maxed out. I've called daily, but there is not even an option to speak to a person anymore, the lines are either constantly busy or the automated system gives a message and then disconnects the line. 


I've taken a screenshot of every message or alert I've gotten during the application process and trying to correct the issue with resetting my password or logging in on different browsers. I also keep a log of every call or email I've written. I even faxed them a letter via efax and got confirmation from efax that it was successfully delivered. 


Today is my certification day, but I got an error message saying ""you cannot certify for benefits at this time, please contact IDES"" and gives the number where the message plays and it hangs up. I tried certifying through their automated phone system at (312) 338-4337, but after entering my SSN I got a message saying my PIN was not entered within 30 days of my claim, so I have to call. I haven't read anything about a PIN and my claim was submitted less than 30 days ago. 


Below is the letter I faxed on 4/9/2020. I sent my 5th email regarding my issues today. If anyone has any other suggestions that I'm not thinking of, please let me know! 


Thanks so much, and I hope you all are getting resources you need. 


**The Letter I Faxed:**


Hello IDES and IllinoisJobLink, 

I was laid off from my position as a (Position) at (Company) on 3/31/2020 due to Covid-19. I filed a claim for unemployment insurance on 3/31/2020. 

- My Claim Confirmation Number is: xxxxxxxx    
- My Claimant ID is: xxxxxxx    
- “The effective date of your claim for unemployment is: 04/05/2020”    

I filled out the Reemployment Self-assessment Questionnaire on 3/31/2020, and I received my Illinois Job Link email providing me with my username the same day. 

- My Illinois Job Link Username: xxxxxxxxx    
- My email associated with my account is: (email address)

I have attempted daily to login into my Illinois Job Link Account, but am met with an error message saying my username has been deactivated, and that I need to contact American Job Center to request reactivation. I know registration is a mandatory step to receiving unemployment insurance benefits. I have attempted contact in the following ways:

- Emailed DES.IJLSysAdmTech@illinois.gov four times requesting activation     
- Emailed DES.IJLSysAdmSpprt@illinois.gov two times requesting activation     
- Called (800) 244-5631 and chose 4 for Illinois Job Link many times – no answer    
- Called (877) 342-7533 many times  - no answer    

Please reactivate my username so that I can register and receive unemployment benefits. 

If needed, I am able to provide screenshots proving my attempts, messages showing errors with my unemployment claim, the emails I sent, and the letter from my former employer stating that my lay-off was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I am writing this on 4/9/2020.

I understand the high rate of unemployment and new federal stimulus package due to the Covid-19 pandemic is causing an overwhelming amount of work for IDES. Should there be a delay or error with my unemployment and/or stimulus supplemental benefits, I hope this letter provides the information needed to help correct those errors. 

Thank you,

personalfinance,Classic payoff debt vs save question-,"Like many of you, i received a stimulus check. But also, had a small windfall due to birthday, tax refund etc that totals $3400. 

I have several debts i am working to pay off (snowball method ) and am currently throwing an extra $300 towards one - however, if i take the $3400- it would pay off one bill that would free up an additional $408/month (because it would be paid off and that’s the payment. ) and i could then have $708 for the snowball (or save the extra $408?) 

My question is: in these uncertain times, do i do this? Or should i save all of it and just keep slowly chipping away at the overall debt? 

My savings is small but working on it(~$1500 in an Ally savings acct) 

the interest rate on this particular bill is 5.75%

I am currently still employed. Not an “essential” but work for a large company.

I am wondering what mistakes I should avoid making? For those who graduated college in 2008 what is something you with you knew? 

House: I have starting the home buying process as I would like to avoid renting and am very confident I can get a great interest rate &lt;3.5%. On that note what should I be budgeting for the house? I set my Max to $2000/month (mortgage, interest, insurance, etc). An apartment in the area is nearly the same price. My company also gives me benfefits for purchasing a home. Is it even a good idea to get a house during this crisis? 

Car: I would like to purchase a new car before 2020 is over. How is Covid-19 going to affect the vehicle market and should I get a vehicle sooner rather than later? Based on my salary and highest case house payment what would be a good idea? I have crunched the numbers and I can afford my dream car on top of my house payment. The car is ~700 per month and insurance is 120/month. How bad of an idea if I do get a car for it to be my dream car? I already have a running car but it only has 2-3 years left

Student loans: Now that student loan payments are paused would you recommend I begin to pay on them immediately or wait? I owe right around 25k in student loans. How do I estimate my monthly payments on these?

Vacations: I didn't go on any trips during the entirety of my college career due to intense studying and career prep. Would you recommend saving for a trip during this time? Or put it towards an emergency fund.


 I have made a spreadsheet with sample month-to-month budgets based on a scenario. It is very difficult to budget though without knowing exactly what my monthly take home pay will be after taxes.

I am just wanting an idea of what to prepare for so I'm not living paycheck to paycheck on a great salary for new grad. Some points would greatly be appreciated!",finance

Very grateful that I'm in a position (esp. in the current climate) where I can continue to pay down my loans, and want to make sure I'm doing it as effectively as possible (esp. as I can refi with lower rates, and am in good credit standing \~740).

My current principal balance is \~$106k (down from an original amount of \~$125k) at a 5.74% fixed interest rate (refi'd my loans initially in the fall of 2017). I'm on a 20 year term (240 payments) and have already made 30 payments.

My monthly payment amount is \~$900, and I pay $300 on top of that to attack the principal (confirmed that it is going to the principle, not the interest).

Was reviewing my loans and over the past 2.5 years, it says I've paid $19,250 towards the principle, and $17,000 towards the interest. Meaning I've paid $36k in the past two years and my loan has only gone down that $19k.

I certainly have a ways to go in understanding how loans work (admitting my faults that I should have attacked this sooner, did not grasp the financial situation I'd find myself in and for the past few years have been scared to face it head on -- at this point I can't change the past and can only move forward), though that just doesn't seem right that the interest is only 5.75%, though \~47% what I pay is going towards the interest alone.

I have never missed a payment, I don't have anything past due, and the only outstanding accrued interest is $85 (don't know what this means).

I've been buying ALLY weekly for some  time now. A few shares at a time. I'm very bullish on them long term.   This is a great article talking about why ALLY would be a strong edition  to your portfolio.

&gt;Ally  financial currently maintains over $100 Billion in deposits, a  figure  they achieved in ten years following an increasing trend towards   digital banking. Unsurprisingly, as more consumers switch to digital   banking, Ally will undoubtedly see this figure skyrocket as the next   generation of adults will hardly rely on physical branches to hold onto   their cash. This is compounded by the fact that Ally financial boasts  an  industry-leading 1.8% interest rate on its high-yield savings  account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having  been spun-off from GM's financing division, Ally is the national   leader for automotive finance, making it a leading choice when looking   for an auto loan, whether as a consumer or dealer. Ally is already   established with over 18,000 dealers in the United States, roughly 90%   of the market, and as the company becomes more profitable and since it   is well-positioned to capitalize on the online banking trend, it is   likely to capture the remaining 10%. Through their dealer rewards   program, which offers rewards to dealers who promote Ally to customers,   Ally could certainly expect to see a revenue stream from not only the   remaining dealers but customers who turn to those dealers for advice on   financing an automobile

personalfinance,Most cost-effective way to pay off wife's student loans?,"Hey all! 

First time poster here!

So with all of the COVID-19 stuff, the US Government has frozen all interest accumulation and sent all federal student loans into an administrative forbearance. So all of our auto-payments have stopped as of last month. After looking into the details, this forbearance will last until September 30th, 2020.

My wife and I have been fortunate enough to be able to continue working during this pandemic. We have about 40k in federal loans and 50k in private loans. Our private loan payments are still being withdrawn normally.

So here's my question. Is it a smarter idea to continue paying our federal loans since 100% of that payment is going to the principal, or should we stop paying our federal loan altogether and use that extra money to tackle our private loan principal? One important thing to note is that my wife is a nurse, so she will technically qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in about 9 years.

personalfinance,Questions about putting money into HYSA vs CDs/I Bonds,"Hello,

I recently signed up for a HYSA through Discover bank for the 1.50% APY along with their new-account bonus of $200. Specifically, I've got about $25k - 30k in savings that I'm holding onto for living/education expenses for an anticipated year-off from working while transitioning from biotechnology to software engineering.

I was looking into CDs and I Bonds as well, to maximize the growth of my money over the next year or two (since I anticipate needing to use some of this money in 1 year, so I don't currently want to lock my funds up for anything much longer than 12 months). 

At the moment, Discover bank's CDs only offer 1.50% APY as well (I know Marcus offers 1.85% APY for CDs right now), and the composite interest rate for I-Bonds is currently 2.22%.

What I'm wondering now is this: 

1) When choosing to put my money into CDs or just my HYSA, are there significant factors I should be considering aside from just the APY percentage? Because my HYSA offers 1.50% APY and Discover CDs only offer 1.50% APY, I see literally zero benefit to lock my money into CDs, when my HYSA offers the same APY. (Marcus offers 1.85% on 1 year CDs, but still doesn't seem worth the effort for the amount of money I would be willing to lock up for the upcoming year)

2) Similarly, with the I Bonds, I'm not entirely sure how to estimate the APY based upon the composite interest rate, but with a guesstimate/assumption that the APY is roughly 2.22%, the amount of money I'd make from the difference in APY from my HYSA (2.22 - 1.5 = 0.72%) isn't really worth the time/effort it would take to set up, and isn't worth locking my money away for more than a year.

2a) Am I hugely misunderstanding (or underestimating) something about the APY of an I bond? 

2b) Are there any unique benefits to I Bonds (like tax benefits) which make them preferable to putting my money into CDs or my HYSA?",finance

Accordingly, we have decided to rely on the SEC Order and endeavor to file the Annual Report no later than May 14, 2020, or within 45 days after the Original Due Date. The reason the Form 10-K cannot be filed timely does not relate to the inability of any person, other than the Company, to furnish any required opinion, report, or certification.
 
Social distancing measures have been taken by both the Registrant’s outside accountants and its independent registered public accounting firm in order to protect the health of their employees. Further, travel restrictions have delayed certain inventory audit procedures and other items required for the annual audit. All of the foregoing has slowed the accounting and auditing work required to compile and audit the Registrant’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to be included the Annual Report.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. 401K,"Hey all,

I currently make $87,000/year before tax. My company has a generous 401k program that matches 50% of your contributions all the way up to the IRS Max (meaning if I put in 19k, my company will match with 9.5k). Vesting schedule is 20% per year over 5 years. 

I have $50,000 in student loan debt, which is at an interest rate around 4% (once the COVID-19 interest freeze is off). 

Right now I contribute 6% of my salary (3% employer match) to 401k and I put $1,250 per month towards student loans. 

My question is - should I be paying the minimum on my student loans and maxing out my 401k or attacking student loan debt with a modest (or no) 401k contribution.

I then attended law school after working in social services for a couple of years. 

All in all, I came out with six figures of federal debt and my $30k in private student loans.  

I worked very hard to pass the bar exam while also being a full-time parent turned single parent. I'm now a prosecutor for a government agency. 

I make $50k (first year and am getting very valuable experience along with job security during this time). 

I have paid my private loans faithfully, on time, and almost always more than required. However, my loans are not consolidated and are currently at variable rates up to 10% at this time. 

I have worked diligently to build my credit after being a stay at home parent and student. I'm now around 700 and have opened 2 high- limit cards that I never use or pay off immediately. I also have two negative dings on my score that should be falling off in August 2020. 

I have applied for consolidation of my private loans through my credit union and also through SoFi. They declined my app and SoFi asked that I recruit a cosigner. I am going through a divorce, and do not have family who would be willing to assist. 

Is there any hope or way for me to get this consolidated and get out from under this? $300/$500 goes to interest every month.  I'm getting nowhere and desperately want to be able to buy a home for myself and my son before he starts school. 

Any advice is VERY much appreciated!

personalfinance,Which order to pay off debts?,"Hi everyone, 

Just looking for some advice on my plan of attack... 

California, 30yo male, marketing manager (~$2,400 monthly take home) wife stays at home and watches our 2 year old. 

I have a little over 10k in hand between tax returns and corona stimulus and I’m debating how I should pay off some debt with it. 

Mine:

Car payment - 360mo - 1417 balance

CC1 - 25min - 860/1000 - 25%

CC2 - 85min - 2940/3100 - 19%

CC3 - 25min - 631/750 - 24% 


Wife:

CC1 - 275min - 11604/11900 -15%

CC2 - 90min - 4315/4400 - 15% 

My plan was to pay off the total of my debt leaving me with roughly 4K as a cushion should I get laid off or something. That will drop my monthly bills by about $500 which I can in turn  start snowballing into my wife’s CC’s, or I could then apply for a personal loan/debt consolidation from my credit union to drop the interest rate on her CC’s and lower the payment on those two CC’s. 
I tried to apply for a personal loan to consolidate ALL the debts but I was denied because it was too much debt to income, and my credit score is 630’s. 

Using some simulators it says if I pay off my CC debts it should push my credit score to the 730’s... anyone know if that’s even remotely possible? 

I apologize if the formatting is booboo, I’m on mobile.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend lives in Colorado and he has struggled to hold down jobs over the past 6 months leaving a couple here and there after 1-2 weeks due to school and wrong fits.But now he is making $15/hour so roughly $500 a week for his efforts. He's grateful he has a job in a time like this but he has dozens of friends who are on unemployment and making nearly double if not more than double of what he is making every week for the foreseeable future due to this stimulus bill. These friends have never made this type of money before and are now banking $800-900 every week sitting on the couch watching Netflix. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, if my friend were to email his employers that he no longer feels safe in the work space due to this virus and being in close contact with people daily saying he requests to be laid off or just simply quit. Would he then be able to collect unemployment benefits and file under the reasoning that he quit due to COVID. The laws on this are very grey and tough to understand in times like these. I have heard stories of people in California ""requesting to be laid off due to covid"" and it must be honored by that company. Is this actually a thing or just something that hasn't been noticed yet by fed govt. In any case was just curious what advice I should give my friend. Stay at his job and just face the fact some got lucky with this stimulus (while also realizing there are millions who are suffering I get it ..) or does he have grounds to ask to be laid off/quit and still collect unemployment benefits.

personalfinance,Do any Online Banks/Cash Management programs still have a worthwhile APY?,"About 3 years ago I opened up a special Savings account with a local Credit Union that offered 5% interest on your first $500. Used it blindly and didn't think much of it until I got into Personal Finance about 7-8 months ago, and I noticed that the rate in my Savings account for the money after that first $500 was like .095%. I ended up moving my money (less $500) to my chosen stock broker, Public, as they had a Cash Management account offering 2.05%. 

I found out today that after all the recent Fed rate cuts, Public quietly killed the Cash Management feature without actually telling the users. I thought ""Oh well, guess I'll move my money over to Robinhood's Cash Management. It's not the same, but it's better than nothing."" Then I opened Robinhood for the first time in a couple months, Cash Management now at .30%. 

So my question to you guys is, know of any online banks/Cash Management programs offering anything worthwhile for APY? I only have a couple thousand so it's not like it's crazy important to me, but 6 months of Cash Management from Public had paid me significantly more than I had made the whole last year I was in the Credit Union's Savings account, with less money. Is it just better for me to throw my money back in to my Savings account until interest rates eventually rise elsewhere?

personalfinance,Options for two outstanding car loans?,"Long story short: I have a Subaru in which I still owe $37k at 7.99% APR. I also have a VW that I owe $13k at 12.24% APR. I’ve only had the Subaru for 6 months while I’ve had the VW for roughly 2 years. My monthly payments between the two car loans/insurance come out to $1,335. I believe both terms were 6 years each.

My credit score is currently at 803 and I make about $62k per year in the good ole state of Georgia. With that being said- I’d like to just have one vehicle and need some options.

With COVID-19 leading to recent drops in interest rates for new vehicles I’ve thought of trading both vehicles (with the negative equity) into a new one. Ive been offered roughly $33k for the two current vehicles leaving $17k to be added onto the next vehicle. I’ve been approved, but haven’t pulled the triggers/signed anything. I’ve been offered 1.9% interest on a $38k vehicle at 84 months (and yes I’d pay half the bill 2x per month to shorten the term). The new monthly payment would in turn save me ~$450 per month. I’m going to continue shopping around, of course.

I’ve thought of saving to sell the VW back to the dealer, pay the difference of $6k just to take the loss and be done with it. After that I could refinance the Subaru and try to get a better interest rate? 

I’m trying to make a smart decision to combat some awful ones from the past.  I’m guilty of making quick decisions and letting my emotions take the wheel (literally). I’ve thought long and hard on all of this and would love some feedback from complete strangers. If there is any guidance one could bestow upon me so I can make a break for a better future- it’d be greatly appreciated. Thank you and thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on best plan of action for tackling debt.,"Hello, everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I come to you tonight as I'm looking to put myself in a better position financially and, after researching my options, have found myself with only a few left in reducing a fairly large debt I owe. Since you all seem to be a smart bunch who keep yourselves out of messes like this, I figured it would be best to get your opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, and over the past 4-5 years, I amassed a fair bit of credit card debt that I failed to tackle over the past 2 in any measurable way. To put it lightly, the debt I amassed during all this rivals my student loan and car loan combined. How I did it, I am not proud of. When this all started, it was about $7000 that I and an ex of mine managed to spend. She never had the credit for getting approved for cards, I had great credit and managed our finances well. We weren't well off by any means, but were comfortable, if still somewhat poor. When we split those 4-5 years ago, I went into a spiral and was in no position to afford living, much less the habit of drinking near constantly when not at work, buying things to fill a void, and eating out as I could no longer stand to look at our, now my, apartment, much less drag myself anywhere near the kitchen. I had planned to drink until I died. I no longer cared. I didn't die. Life slowly changed, the pain faded, I found myself a husk of the person I was, but I rebuilt. Life changed for the better, slowly, and I found myself where I never thought I'd be: a fully functioning adult with a full-time, decent paying job. My debt continued to amass though, as debt seems to do if one does have the means to pay it and also live a semi-normal lifestyle for one's age. That, however, is no excuse. And a lesson that I have learned the hard way.

&amp;#x200B;

This has left me with 3 options that I see, as I am no longer able to qualify for any private loans at reasonable rates:

1. Declare bankruptcy, which I am not even sure how to do or if I could.
2. Continue to pay what I can, cut my life down as much as possible and become beholden completely to my debt. I would suspect I could pay it off this way over the next 10-15 years, if everything where to stay exactly the same, which we all know it won't.
3. I will explain below.

&amp;#x200B;

To assist, I will provide a breakdown of my finances as they stand today below and the debts owed. I am providing approximate amounts for simplicity's sake. Also, as some information, I have never defaulted on a debt, never had collections, never missed a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

THE BASICS (per month):

\-Housing: $0; I currently live at home, which is a recent development due to another breakup, family in need, and now COVID. I do not foresee myself leaving until stay-at-home orders are lifted, however staying until the debt is paid is likely not an option, as the owner of the house will likely be selling it this summer.

\-Utilities: $0; this, I am grateful for.

\-Food: This was initially close to $850-900 before the pandemic. It is now closer to $400.

\-Cell phone: $85. There is no way for me to currently lower this, as I am paying off a phone.

\-Gas: $20, though this is really only to drive to and from the store now for food and essentials.

\-Entertainment/streaming: total, $33. This might be essential now.

\-Insurance, car and rental: $105 (divided up by month, not paid by month)

\-Car payment: $350

\-Student loan payment: $250

\-Automatic deduction to savings: $160

\-Total expenses: About $1400

&amp;#x200B;

Income, after all taxes, deductions, contributions to 401k, healthcare, etc: $42,000

I do receive a yearly bonus, but I do not factor this in as it is variable and not usually more than $3000 before taxes, if that.

&amp;#x200B;

DEBT (at time of writing):

Credit card 1: $21,130.00 (credit line of $26,000; APR 17.74%)

Credit card 2: $7800.00 (credit line of $25,000; APR 20.40%-24.40% depending on the type of purchase)

Credit card 3: $0 (Credit line of $5000.00)

Student Loan balance: $21700

Car loan balance: $11100

Total owed: About $62,000

&amp;#x200B;

Savings are currently about $4000.

My car is worth almost $14,000.

My 401k (almost entirely Roth): $27500

&amp;#x200B;

My calculations puts my net worth at -$16000 and my time to pay off the entirety of my debt, if nothing changes and no interest is charged, at 2 and a half years. This obviously will be more as the debt is charged interest, is revolving, and things will change. I am lucky enough to be employed and work fully from home. Unless the world stops fully for an extended period of time, I will probably remain employed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that brings us to option 3. I have a 401k I can borrow against, the total of the loan being $13750, the max I can take out. Unfortunately, I cannot withdraw the entire thing or I would put that on the table. I suppose this doesn't qualify as a hardship. The loan can be paid back between 12-60 months with a 3.25% interest rate. A 60 month loan would be a payment of about $230, which is equal or less than the payments I have been making on credit card two. Using this, I could pay off all of the higher APR credit card and a decent chunk of my main and lowest APR card. My savings is my emergency fund and what I was going to use for a security deposit and first month's rent when I moved into a new place, but that may not be happening until June at least, from the looks of things. Without using it, I could bring my revolving debt down to $15,178 vs the $28,928 I currently owe. Using all $4000 would bring me to $11,178 and back under 20% utilization of my credit lines. I am currently 51.6%. I am 30. I also have a pension that is vested, though currently small at a payout of $121/month at time of retirement. I will be Medicare/SS eligible, given those still exist when I reach the appropriate ages.  


So, /r/personalfinance, what do you recommend I do? Is option 3 my best bet at a financially solvent future? Or do you recommend a different approach?  


I appreciate all of you taking the time to read this and give your advice. Stay safe and stay well.",finance

personalfinance,"Unemployment for ""voluntary"" reduced work: possible? unethical?","Last week I began a reduced, 4 days/week at 80 percent salary work schedule for the next three months. This was one of the options offered by my company (which ranged from buying additional weeks of vacation to taking multi-month leaves of absence; my election is middle-of-the-pack). My company also stated that it would not contest any unemployment benefit applications for those who have taken one of these ""voluntary"" measures. Voluntary is parenthetical because my company has strongly urged employees to take a reduced-pay option and has all but said that significant layoffs are on their way. 

My questions are:

\- Despite making the election to take reduced work, can I still make an unemployment claim? 

\- Would doing so be unethical given that I made the choice voluntarily at the end of the day?

\- If not, would I be ceding any sort of tactical advantage in applying now rather than waiting to see if I am fully laid off in a few months (given that unemployment benefits run out after a certain number of weeks, if I read things correctly)?

My job is in an industry deemed essential, and basically safe for the next six months; anything after that is up in the air.

personalfinance,"Locked a mortgage rate refi last month, did my paperwork and everything, and now its about to expire on monday.","**TL;DR** Locked good mortgage rate in early March, it is about to expire for reasons that is not our fault. Ally not getting back to us. I have one day to rectify by talking to the supervisor of our flaky processor. What do I do?  


Sorry, this post has some venting on Ally customer service in it so forewarning. While I appreciate any validation of my frustration, it is more about how I can go about leveraging my current position to get what I want. I know it seems first world problems of me, but this refi would do wonders for my wife and I as we are expecting a child very soon. Anyway, thanks for reading.  


Back in early March, my wife and I locked in a rate of 3% with Ally with negative points so basically our closing costs are nil. We were super pumped about that. We had just refied last year in August with Ally, same lender. Our financial position is actually even better now since I have switched to W-2 from 1099, which was iffy to the underwriter previously. So my assumption was that since we got our refi thru last year, this time it shouldn't be a problem because we are in an even better position. I emailed back and forth with them near the beginning of March and was told we shouldn't have any issues and, in fact, the process should be faster because we didn't have to do an appraisal.   


Up until this point, Ally service had been good and was professional. They seemed eager for our refi and they had been very good last time. Also to be fair, there wasn't a lot of corona madness at that time. That is a point I should make.   


We follow their requests for paperwork and tax filings etc. They call my employer and do their normal stuff. Everything seemed good. However, we then went through a weird period of no communication with them. We'd email and set up phone calls and they began to be late in getting back to us. Okay, that's fine...they are busy...covid-19 is starting to get around, so I do my part to give them the benefit of the doubt.

   
This keeps going and then the phone call appointments begin to follow a pattern of being late by many hours. We'd set an appointment for 11AM and then the ally rep would call at 5pm, no apologies, no explanations. When we did reach our processor, we express that we are getting concerned that the rate lock is actually going to expire before we close.  At that point, we were about a week from expiring. We ask if there are issues and she says that the underwriters have not gotten to it yet. The rep says she will see if she can get an extension on the rate lock and see if Ally will pay for the extension, but she will let us know. A couple days go by and no answer. We set another phone call and again, the request to escalate is received, the processor says she will see what she can do. She then says she will call us back today (Thursday 4/16/2020) at 2pm. It rolls around to 5pm and we finally get fed up and call Ally ourselves only to find out from the phone rep that our processor is actually out of the office for the day. WHAT?  We never received any heads up about that or anything. At that point, I was really frustrated and expressed to the service rep of my situation. She tells me to hold, I wait 5 minutes,  and then she comes back saying that there was a problem with our underwriting in that I was listed as temporary at my work (I am a full time employee) and that my wife's job seemed inconsistent, even though just back in August they had looked at it and signed off. This surprise really caught me off-guard as we were told nothing was wrong. Then I found out that note apparently was logged **a week ago**. The processor never told us this, which now makes me question if our processor was even looking at our case.  I demand to speak to a manager and then I am put on hold. The rep returns and tells me that she has alerted the manager of my situation will call me back right after fielding another call. One hour goes by and I call back. I get a different service rep who then proceeds to tells me that the manager is gone for the day. At that point I am just really really frustrated.   


I don't know what to do, I feel like Ally is playing some weird game to get some of these mortgage locks to expire for who knows what reason. Even if they are understaffed, an unlicensed phone rep was able to tell me in minutes what the problem was. 

  
Anyway I have basically only tomorrow/Friday to see if this lock can survive as our rate lock expires on Monday. Our processor is MIA and her manager, I hope, will have some professionalism in getting back to me. But I am not hopeful.  


So redditors, they have me by the balls because that 3% lock would help a lot right now. We had followed every instruction and I don't even understand why this is happening.   
What angles and options do I have to try to get this lock through with the mortgage manager?    
How should I proceed next in terms of a game-plan?",finance
personalfinance,Tax advice for an American overseas please!,"Hi- I’m not entirely sure what type of help I should be seeking, and I’d love to get some of your input before deciding which type of professional to approach for their services. I am not sure if I should be approaching a financial advisor, US-based CPA, or CPA who specializes in expats.

Background: I have been living and working in Singapore since 2017 and am an American citizen only.

I’m going to break my questions into two separate tax years. All money will be quoted in USD.

**2019 tax year:**

* I earned $26,000 in Singapore, working for a Singapore-based company.
* I spent over 35 days in the US due to a family emergency and now owe US taxes.

Question: Do I only owe federal taxes, or do I also owe state, FICA, etc.?

**2020 tax year:**

* This year I expect to earn $40,000 in Singapore, working for a Singapore-based company.
* I have also inherited $20,000 from a US-based family member. ($15,000 will be tax-exempt as a gift, but $5,000 will be taxable).

Question: I expect to not spend more than 35 days in the US this year, so I will be able to claim FEIE. Since I can claim FEIE and earn total below the $107,600 threshold, do I still owe taxes on the $5,000 of the $20,000 inheritance? If so, same as above, would I only owe federal or also state and FICA?

**Other questions:**

* Since I am paying taxes for the year of 2019, **can I still contribute $6,000 to an IRA for the 2019 tax year, or is it too late?** I didn't contribute last year because I didn't expect to owe taxes.
* What are the requirements for filing an FBAR? If in 2019 I did not have more than $10,000 in my account, but in 2020 I will, must I file an FBAR for the 2020 tax year?
* If I have a Singapore Dollar-denominated investment account overseas (similar to Robinhood), must this also be filed on an FBAR? And do I still only pay taxes on capital gains?

vet,"Reoccurring stinky breath, likely digestion related?","Hi, so bit of back story first off:

I have a \~2ish year old rescue mixed breed dog (common guesses are parsons terrier x french bulldog?) - totally unknown background other than I'm 100% sure his diet was ""anything &amp; everything"" for some, if not all of his life. Likely a lot of cafe/pub human food as, holy cow, did he turn his begging tricks up to 11 when we took him into one!

When we got him it took a good few months of trial &amp; error to fix his incredibly loose stools. We settled on a high-fibre, fish based dry kibble (for ultra sensitive dogs) &amp; have stuck with it ever since. Any treats he gets during the day are meat based (like dried fish or meat jerky) or quality grain-free biscuits.

On the back of the long-term loose stools was the full anal sacs, which we've had emptied twice in the last year - first time was shortly after getting him, second was after a vomiting bug that stopped his fibre-diet for over a month &amp; set him right back. It's been 2 months since then &amp; no bum licking/nibbling, so they seem to be behaving for now.

So we're currently at hard poop = good, not-irritated bum = good ,BUT every few days/weeks he gets the WORST bad breath. Proper fishy, stinky gross nastyness :(

The only cure for it is to give him some good-quality but low fibre food that clears him through a bit &amp; it fixes it (we usually give him ""pure"" brand freeze dried just-add-water food);  it's like there's something stuck down there &amp; it just needs poking through, but by fixing the front end it'll flare up his butt-glands again &amp; irritate there (not only do they cost money to fix, he is VERY anxious at the vets - needs muzzling, very bitey, very likely badly treated by one in his former life). He isn't constipated - he poops usually 4 times a day on average. His teeth/gums are fine &amp; there's nothing visible in his mouth.

We're trying to keep him on a mix of 1 scoop of ""pure"" mixed with 1 scoop kibble in the morning, and 2 scoops kibble in the evening. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, and his gross breath is better on the whole.

Just really wondering why! It's easy to picture his whole digestive system as a pipe; one end slows down, the other end suffers... except he doesn't seem to be backed up, poop is moving through fine, it's blimmin frustrating! He does have tear stains, but nothing we've fed him has ever gotten rid of them; they're not an issue for us, but I know they can be diagnostic &amp; point to sensitivities.

But thank you all in advance for any insights you've got. Any reasons for his grotty breath and any potential long term solutions/supplements/routines to try are greatly appreciated :)

computers,"Need to add a graphics card, but how?","I built my pc a few years ago - overbuilt it actually, it’s still fast enough - but I stuffed everything in a micro itx case with no room for a graphics card.  Now I’m looking into some games that require heavy graphics processing and my options are egpu, external card dock, or put everything in a new case.  I’d rather do the latter and save the desk space.

So my issue is this - I need to swap my components into a small form factor case that can accommodate a compact graphics card...but I’m not a “computer person”, as it were, and not sure where to look.  A lot has changed since I originally pieced everything together with a build list.

personalfinance,Would refinancing really save me this much money?,"My current mortgage payment is $1763. Bought our house for $230,000 in 2015, currently owe $203,920. Interest rate is 4.125%. [Here](https://imgur.com/AJVQdCM) is a breakdown of our monthly payment.

So I was messing around in Credit Karma and ended up in the refinance calculator. Put in the loan amount, estimated home value. And even with higher interest rates, it's showing an estimated monthly payment of around $1,000. Obviously this is just an estimate, but why such a big difference?

personalfinance,Organizing finances for people who don't want to think about it,"Coming out of college in 2018, I had a lot of debt and not a lot of income. I knew I had to get my finances in order but have never been good at budgeting or tracking. I never had a solid grasp of where the hell my money was going. So, soon after school ended I made a saving plan that I’ve considered “organizing your finances for people who don’t want to think about it”, since I am very much in that camp. Knowing that I’m the type of person that just won’t track expenses, I tried to sync and combine different tips I gathered from Reddit to make something that works around my habits. The below method is great for those who don’t like to track their daily expenses with complex spreadsheets, apps, etc. It requires up-front planning and setting up, but then I consider it to be pretty smooth sailing after. 

With that said, I’m by no means an expert in budgeting or financial planning - so as much as I’m hoping this could help others like myself, I’m also hoping someone can give me tips on how to make this a more effective plan. I don’t think there’s anything novel about the plan I made for myself, but I’ve used it for those around me and have gotten good reception so I figured I share. I’d appreciate all feedback, even if you suggest I scrap this plan altogether. Here we go!

*DISCLAIMER: I mention the service Qapital here a few times. I’m not trying to push this service on anybody. This is simply what I chose to go with for myself. In fact, I’d love to hear some alternatives because I did not look very far for my “Second account/savings” solution that I cover.*  


1. Determine your expected take-home pay every month (take note of payment frequency as well, per paycheck). Give a conservative estimate, one you can be pretty confident in taking home every time.
2. Determine list of all fixed monthly expenses (aka monthly bills). When it comes to debt payments, just jot down the minimum payments for them. 
3. Determine generous estimate of variable but necessary expenses (aka groceries, gas, toll, etc). To do this, you can look at your past bank statements in the past 30-90 days to estimate what you’ve spent in each category per month… assuming you haven’t been tracking your expenditures.
4. Add the totals from steps 2 and 3. This will be the amount of money you’ll put in your “bills account”. It should sum to an amount that is less than your total monthly take home pay, ideally!
5. The leftover will be the funds for your “miscellaneous spending account”. This is not only for fun money, but for all expenses not covered by steps 2 and 3 - things you don’t regularly buy or budget for (hygiene products, cleaning stuff, eating out, booze, clothes, etc)
6. However, you should hopefully be able to also set aside some of that money to save/pay debt. This is where you’ll need to curb bad spending habits, so that your misc spending funds can stretch.
7. Now with your two “funds” separated, you’ll want to open up a separate bank/debit account to separate them. My existing account was with Bank of America, so I opened up my second account with Qapital. This plan includes a banking account and debit card, as well as convenient ways to automate my savings and set them aside. 
8. To split the funds into separate accounts, your job should allow you to split up where your direct deposit goes into. If not, have your income deposited into one account (I recommend going into the Bills account), and then use Qapital savings rules (or whatever service you choose) to transfer funds to your misc spending account upon receiving paycheck.
9. Set up auto pay for as many bills as you can on the bills account. And use this account only for your bills and necessary variable expenses. This way, you’ll use this card way less and it can be more out of sight out of mind.
10. Use the other account only for your misc expenses. This is where you’ll want to save as much as you can as well.
11. Now that you have your money separated, figure out how much you can save from your misc expenses every month, and set up saving rules in Qapital (or whatever you choose) to automate savings. Basically, you can treat this as a monthly expense if your income is steady.
12. If using Qapital or similar savings service, these savings can split up into multiple saving buckets if you’d like. For example, I save into one bucket for an emergency fund or to pay towards CC debt, but I also have a savings bucket for “large fun money purchases” like gifts, tickets, etc. I also did a temporary savings bucket for moving expenses.
13. This should be everything you need to know where your money is going. This will provide you with the ability to automate saving, and spend “freely”, with the peace of mind that you are not spending more than you can afford.
14. Expenses can change every now and then, even subtly, so it’s always good to repeat steps 1-3 to audit your expenses every few months, and re-calibrate your splits if needed. 

Now, if you want to plan your finances to start developing a savings fund and tackle debt:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Write down a full list of your debts. What kind of debts, how much the minimum monthly payments are, and the interest rate for each debt.
2. Order the debts by highest interest rate. You’ll want to pay these off first.
3. But before paying off debts, you’ll want to develop an emergency savings account. From what I hear, the basic rule of thumb is to save 3 months worth of expenses in your emergency savings. This is the safest, however if you want to be aggressive in tackling debt ASAP and think your current job is stable and safe, you can go lower if you’re comfortable with that. Call me risky, but I only have saved $1000 as my emergency fund, which is the absolute lowest I was willing to save (reconsidering now with COVID recession). Use your savings rules to make an emergency bucket.
4. Once you’ve completed your emergency fund target, you’re ready to put extra money towards debt. So, pay the minimum on every debt, except for the debt balance with the highest interest rate (your credit card). You’ll want to throw the rest of your money towards this credit card to pay it down as fast as possible.
5. Eventually you’ll pay that first debt off, then you’ll apply all the monthly money towards the next debt, until you eventually eliminate your debt. Voila!

Okay, that’s basically everything I know. As said above, I’m not at all saying this is the best way to approach your personal finances, but I just wanted to share what has worked for me and for others I’ve shown this to. I’d love to hear how this plan can be made better. Hope this helps you in some way!",finance
personalfinance,Please help me establish a functional budget.,"Hello,

With the recent economic implosion due to COVID-19, I am once again forced to reexamine my finances, particularly in light of losing my job due to government-mandated lay-offs. I am sitting on a small nest egg currently (thanks to a tax return and the stimulus) and am curious the best route to maximize my financial stewardship. Here are the relevant details (as of today, 04-17-2020):

35 year old male. Live with my fiancee in Chicago. She is adamant her money is hers and mine is mine, but I digress...

Income: Currently underemployed, with government benefits in limbo. Working 20-30 hours a week making $18 an hour.

Savings: $2641.80 in savings ($1400 is tax refund I am waiting for a judgment on; $1200 is stimulus), $1332.87 in checking, $6767.72 in IRA.

Monthly Expenses: $800 Rent, $100 Utilities, $53.50 Phone, $45 Internet, $150 Groceries, $242.39 Health Insurance, $27.90 Dental Insurance, $13.90 Vision Insurance, $61.40 Car Insurance, $14.00 Medications.

Debts: $1452.35 Car Loan @ 8.490%, $11,409.14 CC @ 17.190%, $1609.63 CC @ 22.99%, $1712.73 CC @ 0.00% until 12/2021, then 24.99%, $0 CC @ 24.99%, $51,739.22 Federal Student Loan @ 5.8%, $17,442.81 Federal Student Loan @ 6.8%, $6,023.08 Private Student Loan @ 8.13%.

Total debt: $91,674.08.

Total assets: ~$1000 personal vehicle. No other assets.

I recently finished a certification for software engineering and am working my hardest to break into the market, though it has been less than fruitful thus far. I have decided I am likely unable to retire, and will be paying my debts until I am roughly 60. Where do I begin to turn this black hole around?

As title states, I decided to switch CPA since I moved to a different city at the beginning of the year. I decided to use my gf's CPA. Anyhow, the CPA asked questions the same as the prior one, sent docs via email to sign. And I confirmed to the CPA that I want the money to be direct deposited via email. 

Anyhow, long story short, I was an idiot for signing the docs with the new CPA without double checking the address field. Honestly, this is something that I understand I need to work on, reading before signing. After everything is said and done, my refund is being sent to my gf's address for both state and federal. I can only assume my stimulus payment is also being sent there. For the life of me, idk why the CPA would put my gf's address when my W-2s, and other documents including property docs all point to a different address.

The kicker is that she moved from that address too, she moved in with me.

personalfinance,Change from FHA to conventional mortgage?,"I could use some insight here, as I've been pretty financially illiterate for most of my life.  I've started to turn things around in the last few years by being more responsible with my finances, but mortgage  is certainly an area that I don't have much knowledge in.

I bought the house in 2005 with a 30 year FHA loan at 6.05%.  I did an FHA streamline refinance in 2016 which brought my interest rate down to 4.25%.  I did the refinance for 20 years since that's roughly what I had left on the original loan.  My loan has been bought by PNC and is currently with them.

Now I'm seeing rates at my credit union for 2.50% for a 15 year fixed conventional loan which has me wondering if I should switch from FHA to conventional to get that rate.  The original purchase price in 2005 was $80,500.  When I refinanced in 2016, it was for $56,000.  I still owe $46,000.  My Fico 8 credit score is about 760 right now, so I think that I should qualify for a good rate. 

Property values in my neighborhood have dropped significantly since I bought the house in 2005, and I think that I would have trouble selling it for what I currently owe.  The house is badly in need of new siding, and it had a roof leak for years before I finally put a new roof on last year (but I never repaired the damaged ceiling drywall) and I don't know if it would pass an inspection if I do a loan that needs an appraisal.  The reason that I did the FHA streamline last time is because they didn't have to evaluate the house.

If I switch to a conventional loan, could I also drop the PMI because I owe less than 80% of the original loan?  Or would it go off of how much I owed when I refinanced and I have to get to 80% of that?

So my options that I'm considering are:

1.  Do another FHA streamline refinance if the rate is lower than 4.25%.  Which seems like the easiest, cheapest, and safest option.
2. Do a conventional refinance for the cheapest rate that I can find.  Which may be more hassle and cost more, but may save me more money.
3. Do nothing.  I can afford the current payments, but I just figured that if I could save money then I should try to!",finance

It's been almost impossible getting in touch with anyone. They have a horrible, non-functioning website and don't expect to get anything solved on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I signed up for a citi accelerate savings account sometime last year and I just wanted to share my experience.  I have quite a few savings accounts with different banks and this has by far been my worst experience.  Everything was fine during the initial setup.  I selected the savings account where there was no service fee if you maintained a $500 balance.  Initially, things were fine.  I was able to transfer my money in.  I should've recognized the first red flag that it took months for them to post what my interest rate was.  Then there was a very roundabout method required to transfer money to an external bank which was problematic.  I started to slowly move money out of the account while still maintaining the $500 minimum.

 I checked my statement recently and noticed a service fee.  I got on their customer service chat and was informed that my savings acct type had been changed to a packaged acct with a checking acct (that I never signed up for).  Since my acct was in this package, I was subject to a $10,000 minimum or $25 monthly service fee.  I was able to get them to waive the service fee but was told I needed to call to un-package the acct since they saw that I didn't actually have a checking acct with them.  I was able to get someone on the phone within 5 minutes and they told me I wouldn't be able to have the accelerate acct with them only their basic acct with a monthly service fee so I asked to close my acct.  I was told I had to call back another time after removing my funds to close the acct. I called back that night, and was on hold for 2+ hrs. I was able to close but they told me my online acct would be shut down even though I still have a credit card acct with them, but I should be able to reopen it.  I've been trying to reopen the online acct with no luck as their website is a giant piece of crap that has virtually no functioning links.  Links to their online chat are also broken. The only option is to call with average wait times of 2+ hours.

personalfinance,Taxes not being taken out of my unemployment benefit even though I requested,"Good afternoon,

I am currently receiving unemployment benefits from the state of Maryland due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and being out of work. I am receiving my state allotted weekly benefits coupled with the extra 600 (Maryland just made the extra 600 available today). I returned a letter in the mail about two weeks ago confirming I would like to be taxed for the full amount (10 percent federal, 7 percent Maryland state). None of my benefits have been taxed so far and I am starting to get worried that my letter was either lost or they are having serious trouble processing all the taxation requests. There is no way to update my tax status online, only through a hard letter, which I already returned.

With all that being said, I have decided to just remove the 17 percent from each benefit payment and place it into a separate savings account. Is this acceptable? I've never paid quarterly taxes and both my states comptroller and the IRS help line are not accepting calls at the time. Will their be any downside to me just moving the amount I should be paying in taxes into a separate account and paying when it's time to file my taxes? I've heard there are potential fees for not paying quarterly taxes in a timely manner. Thanks for the assistance.",finance

stocks,Student lender (SLM) at an attractive valuation,"**From:**  [**http://elevatorpitch.substack.com/p/-cigarettes-and-student-loans-**](http://elevatorpitch.substack.com/p/-cigarettes-and-student-loans-) 

&amp;#x200B;

 [SLM Corporation](https://www.salliemae.com/investors/) (SLM-US)

***United States / Student Lending / \~$3bn Market Capitalization***

SLM Corporation, which does business as Sallie Mae, originates and services private education loans (student loans not made, insured or guaranteed by any state or federal government). Its originations are funded with FDIC-insured deposits. The company has more than $20bn of loans outstanding.

#### Return Potential

SLM could triple over the next three years

* *Assumptions*: Management’s pre-Coronavirus EPS guidance ($1.85-1.91) is achieved within three years and the stock trades at an 11.5x P/E (median multiple since spinning off its government business \[[Navient](https://navient.com/about/investors/)\] in mid-2014).

#### Current Valuation

* Stock price: $6.57
* 3.9x NTM P/E (Median of \~11.5x since spinning off its government business in mid-2014)

#### The Elevator Pitch

With unemployment likely to reach its highest levels since the Great Depression, why would anyone want to invest in a student lender? The answer is simple. Sallie Mae may make education loans, but it’s really lending to high FICO score parents. Last year, 87% of originated loans had a co-signer. The average FICO score at the time of loan approval was 746. If you’re reading this, that’s probably about where your FICO score is.

Will borrowers with your credit risk default on these loans over the course of the current economic shutdown? Some certainly will. There’s virtually no doubt that the next two or three quarters of earnings releases will be ugly, but the world will eventually get back to normal over the next couple of years.

SLM would remain adequately capitalized at a 7%+ tier 1 common ratio even if its loan loss provision this year was 7x the original 2020 guidance (assuming no change in pre-provision profits). Could losses be even worse? Yes, it’s possible. But at less than 4x EPS, the market is already pricing in a huge dilutive equity raise.

And what about political risk? There’s been a lot of chatter about forgiving student loan debt. What’s important to understand here, is that virtually all of this talk references ***federal*** student loan debt and not private student loans. Legislation to cancel non-government guaranteed student debt in which no compensation is paid to private investors seems highly improbable. [This would clearly be unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain).

SLM management, whose guidance has historically been dependable, gave 2020 core EPS guidance of $1.85-1.91 with its Q4 earnings release. This was given prior to COVID-19. Assuming that at some point in the next three years the mid-point of this range is a reasonable estimate of normalized EPS, and the stock trades at its historic median P/E of 11.5x. This would imply a share price of \~$21.60, more than 3x where shares currently trade.

#### Primary Risks

* The current recession is bad enough for prime borrowers to default on student debt at levels high enough to require significant write-downs and a dilutive equity raise. This is arguably already priced in at current levels.
* Legislation detrimental to ***private*** student loans",finance
personalfinance,Social Security Administration Shows $0 Income The Past 4 Years.,"Based on advice I read here, and frankly because, what else am I doing right now? I went to the SSA and opened up an online account.   The advice I read said that you should do this if for no other reason than it prevents someone else from doing it as part of identity theft.  


I saw that I could view past years earnings going all the way back to 1986.   I have been self employed since 2002, made a profit every year, filed a schedule C, paid quarterly SE tax.   However starting in 2014, the SSA is reflecting that my income is $0.  


I will spare you the details of the conversation I had with the guy on the phone (he wanted to educate me that ""if you fill out a schedule C and your expenses are more than your income, then it's a negative number and you don't have any income to report that year"".  He said that THREE TIMES.  No shit, mf? Is that how that works?)

personalfinance,"First time refinancing, I have a quote and need some help / advice before moving forward","Hello, 

When it comes to refinancing and everything involved, I only know what I have learned in last couple days so pardon my ignorance.

My current situation:
  
Current Credit score- around 760-780 


Debt - Car and house that's it


Original Loan - Oct 2013 - $103,000 / 30 year / 4.5% / paying PMI around $120-$150/month 

Total payment right now - $940/month

Remaining balance - $90,500 at 6.5 years in, so 23.5 years left.

I was looking around at interest rates and found a bank (First Federal) with the lowest I have seen so far. I just talked to them and here's what they said -


20 year fixed / $850 a month / 3.26%  (with $3300-$3700 in closing cost rolled in and including escrow payments for my home insurance / taxes)  

and

15 year fixed / $950 a month / 2.875%  (with $3300-$3700 in closing cost rolled in and including escrow payments for my home insurance / taxes) 

This is using a low end estimate on the appraisal of my house. I was seeing 120k-135k so we calculated at 120k which puts me at 79% of the loan left (or however you word it) so PMI will come off.

Am I missing something big here? What specifically should I look for before signing anything? I was going to call around to other banks and compare offers but I doubt anything will be lower than 2.87% would it?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Credit score somewhere between 760-780 I'm pretty sure, dropping 8.5 years off my loan, paying the same amount, lowering interest from 4.5% down to 2.875%... This seems too good to be true. The only debt I have is my car and my house.",finance

personalfinance,"Follow-up: with the CARES act retirement withdrawal options, should we take out money to pay down high-interest credit card debt? I do know that this is bad, and we are working on it.","Hello everyone,

I'll repeat the high points of the previous post below.  Unfortunately, I know some of the answer to this question is, ""it depends on what the market does"".  

&amp;#x200B;

**The main question is: should we take money from retirement to pay off our high-interest credit card debt?  If so - how much?**

&amp;#x200B;

According to the CARES act, coronavirus-related withdrawals are:

* Not subject to the 10% early distribution tax under Internal Revenue Code section 72(t)
* Limited to $100,000 from all plans and IRAs. Plan rules may limit the amount that can be withdrawn from a particular plan.
* Taxed over three years unless immediate taxation is elected
* Not subject to 20% tax withholding or 402(f) notices
* Not allowed to be used as a rollover to an eligible retirement plan
* Eligible to be repaid within three years

&amp;#x200B;

When we purchased our house two years ago (which is the direct source of &gt;90% of our credit card debt, plus some circumstances that have come up with my job), we took loans from our retirement:

&amp;#x200B;

Self:

$18,905.33 ORIGINAL LOAN AMOUNT-$3,435.50 PRINCIPAL RECEIVED= **$15,469.83 BALANCE**

**5.50% Fixed**, Term: 9 Years

Repayment Amount: $206.47 monthly, suspended payments for one year as of 4/1/2020

&amp;#x200B;

Husband:

$7,295.13 ORIGINAL LOAN AMOUNT- $1,325.90 PRINCIPAL RECEIVED= **$5,969.23 BALANCE**

**5.50% Fixed**, Term: 9 Years

Repayment Amount: $79.68, suspended payments for one year as of 4/1/2020

&amp;#x200B;

Because I took out more than him (my retirement account was older due to my age), today we've looked into having him take out some to help pay down the credit card debt.  His retirement has a 1.5x contribution from his job for his first 8%; he also puts in an additional 2% on top of that to make it an even 20% total.  (I used to do that before my job was cut back to part-time).  

&amp;#x200B;

He is early 30s, retirement balance currently 68K, lost 13.4% since January.  It is already on the way back up; he's basically where he was in December 2019 at this point, so we ""only"" lost 4 months of progress. Right now, the max he can take out is \~36K, although I doubt we'd do that much.  

&amp;#x200B;

Taking out about 10K would make us ""even"" in terms of how much of our retirement we've put into the house.  Any more than that, I'd want to match what he takes out.  My retirement account isn't too far off from his.

&amp;#x200B;

\----Repeated information:----

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $20,000 from a recent sale that I plan to use to pay off debt (still hasn't gone through, FYI, but should close \~this month).  I have one personal loan, $13,151 left on it, **fixed minimum payment of $752** (regardless of balance), interest rate **16%**. So - I have to pay off the **whole thing** to get rid of that $752 a month payment. Also, I can't ""add"" anything to that loan (ie, I can't transfer a balance).  I plan to pay this off in full as soon as the sale of a property is finalized (net \~20K).  **So I should have \~$7,000 left over to pay down other debts.**

&amp;#x200B;

I also have variable minimum payment but higher-interest credit cards:

* **$20,316** @ **24.99%**, current minimum $377
* **$6,420** @ **21.99%** min $170
* **$288** @ **21.99%** min $28
* **$12,143** @ **17.24%** min $284
* **$9,943** @ **13.24%** min $192
* **&lt;$8,315** (\~**0%**, not sure exact current total - on $142 autopay)
* **&lt;$30,881** (\~**5.5%**, not sure exact current total - car loan on $608 autopay)

&amp;#x200B;

Total credit card payments now \~$2,553/month including car.  

&amp;#x200B;

Total credit card debt about **70K**, around 100 with car.

&amp;#x200B;

Other debt:

* $3,000/month mortgage (I know)
* $500 his student loans
* My student loans are under forbearance for job issues
* The home purchase retirement loans have a one-year payment suspension

&amp;#x200B;

Other expenses:

* 1045 (phone 30, Groceries 300, Netflix 13, utilities, bug service)
* $400 savings (theoretically, not always)

&amp;#x200B;

So, a safe estimate of monthly expenses is **$7,150.**

&amp;#x200B;

Income: 

* $5K/month husband (after taxes and retirement)
* $1,273 self (salary has substantially decreased recently, had some luck in interviews but we'll see)  
* $700/month: renting out a room
* $0/month dog-sitting (was $300 until COVID happened)
* $300+/month so far freelance work (since my work was cut)

&amp;#x200B;

So, a safe estimate of monthly income is at least meeting expenses ($7,150).

personalfinance,Help a DCFS kid budget their escrow!,"A little bit of background on myself, I'm 20 years old, turning 21 within the next two months. I've spent the last 9 years of my life in DCFS, and the last two specifically, in an independent living program. This program (which has very stringent requirements) has provided me with an escrow, to be received when I turn 21.

Essentially, this program was giving me a check each month to put towards bills, from DCFS, as I have been living on my own since 18, but am still considered a ward of the state since I was never adopted or anything like that. Every three months, the check I was receiving reduced in amount, and the difference was set aside to put into an escrow. Now, since I live very frugally, and am used to supporting myself, I was allowed a faster spend down at my own request (meaning my checks got smaller, faster.) so that I was able to put more money away into this escrow... In less than two months, I will be receiving approximately 15,000.

I've lived a fairly poor life for as long as I can remember, and a sum of money like this, admittedly has me rather anxious. And so, I've budgetted as to what I plan on doing with this money, and would appreciate any advice or criticisms on my current plan, since I want to make the most of this. 

A little bit more info, I currently make about 30k a year, and have about 6K in savings. I've amassed about 9K in student loans, but payments will not be due until I graduate, which won't be for another two years.I have both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. 

I currently have no credit card debt, and a creditscore of about 720.

My 6K that I have in savings currently, is in a Chime savings account. I would like to move this into a savings account with a high interest rate, preferably somewhere that makes it a little less liquid, as I plan on 
pretending the money doesn't exist unless I wind up unemployed. This is very important to me, as if I were to end up unemployed or homeless for some reason, I personally have no family to fall back on whatsoever. I am very much open to suggestions as to where to move this money to. 

I currently have no vehicle, and have spent my entire life with cheap, old, unreliable cars. I'd like to spend about 8K (including tax, title, plates, registration, etc) on finally getting another vehicle. I don't want a car loan, and plan on buying something outright. 

I already have an employer sponsored 401K, that I have admittedly only just opened within the last couple of months. I would also like to put 2K from my escrow into an IRA, to start my retirement fund (the younger the better, right?) I'm thinking roth IRA, after doing some research,q but again, I'm very much open to constructive criticism and advice. 

I'd like to put 1K from the escrow back into Chime savings, as Iwill be ignoring my emergency fund, this will be the beginning of a new layer of savings, meant to cover smaller expenses that arise. Of course Iplan on growing it over time from there, but 1K feels like a fair starting point. 

I'd also like to set aside 1K for moving expenses, as my girlfriend and I are planning on moving in together in June, and that will be approximately my half of first month's rent and deposit. 

In addition to this, I'd like to use about 2K to get a new couch, maybe some shelves, maybe an entertainment stand. Just, some furniture upgrades. My livingroom very much screams ""budget friendly facebook marketplace furniture"" and I'd like to make it feel a little bit more like a home. 

Lastly, I've budgeted 1K for a combination of spending money, and birthday money. Y'know, the frivolous fund. Throwing a kickass 21st birthday party (seriously, it's been such a long road, and I'm so excited to be free of DCFS for good.) and a new tattoo I've been wanting for a while. I know I'm gonna wind up blowing at least some amount of this money, so.. I'd rather budget out some spending money than make an unplanned for mistake later.

Since I'll be in grad school though, I wont have an income this year and thus won't have enough of an income to file federal taxes (&lt;$11,000/year). So do I still have to pay this 10% fee? Do I still have to file federal taxes because of this 401k withdrawal?",finance
personalfinance,Tax Returns - Confused - F1 Visa,"Hi all! 

I'm a bit confused about the entire tax structure of the US. Here's my problem very briefly: My roommate and I are both from a country that does NOT have a treaty with the US. We've both completed our educational programs and are currently on our OPT period where we get to work in the States for a year, still on the F1 visa. 

I've had 3 jobs so far while my roommate hasn't had any. So she hasn't had any income. We both filed for taxes at the same time and for some reason, she got a $1000 federal tax refund and I got a mix of Federal and State refund with a total of $992. My question is: We lead pretty similar lives aside from employment. We live in the same apartment, both do not have cars.  I'm just wondering if I am missing something in mine? 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks a million.",finance
personalfinance,Should I put leftover student loans into my emergency fund or should I pay them back?,"I just started working in the fall making 85k per year. I have just under 5k left over from student loans. I suck at budgeting so I kept them after graduating in case I needed something to fall on while I’m figuring it all out. I now have about 11k of my own money (on top of the 5k) since I started working so I am wondering if it’s a good time to pay it back.

I have not been making payments to my federal loans yet because I need to update my income, so far my income was 0 so my payments have been 0. My 2019 income was 15k for if I recertify my income based on my tax return (I’m pretty sure that’s a thing?). I have 119k in federal loans (about $1500 of that is interest) at 6.125% and 8k Perkins loans so far. I have a check from my 529 plan for 8k. My 10% income payment if I certify @85k is like $550 ish and monthly interest is like $600 ish IIRC. 

So I am wondering if I should keep the 5k from the student loans and the 8k from my 529 in my emergency fund? Otherwise, I can pay the full amount of the Perkins loan and be done with that but the minimum payment is only $85 per month if it makes more sense to put the 8k toward my federal loan?

I still have my job and full income right now and that shouldn’t change. I am wondering about all this now because my payments won’t be going into the interest black hole for the next few months so it will be a good time to dump a bunch of money into my loans!

I also haven’t put anything aside for retirement yet, just getting an emergency fund going. All of this is super confusing for me.",finance

personalfinance,Please explain to me how i will be able to afford a house (california),"Hello all,

I am 26 years old living in Los Angeles, California, and I've been spending a lot of time recently trying to figure out my finances to figure out how i can ever even think about affording a house here. Let me preface my post with the following, since I know I will probably get comments about it anyways:

**I am unable to move anywhere else - both my job and my partner's job are dependent on the area**

I make around $110,000, which is almost 6,000 on the dot per month after California and federal income taxes.

That stated, here are my current expenses:

$1477 rent (split with partner - this is my portion since i make most of the money in the household)

$100 total utilities

$363 car payment (4 years left in loan - 2% interest rate- doesnt make sense to pay more down)

$215 car insurance (had 1 accident 2+years ago on record that unfortunately makes this high. This is the lowest was able to get between 5 insurance companies).

$150 apartment parking (street parking is not possible since i live in an urban area)

$50 gas for car

$5 renters insurance

$10 spotify

$247 student loans

$80 work health insurance.

$20 a month for therapy ($10 copay x2 a week).

$300 grocery budget.

**total expenses: $2997. Lets round to $3000**

That leaves me $3k a month for discretionary/down payment savings/**retirement**. (Retirement has been lacking, as last two jobs I have had either paid garbage wages or did not have a 401k. I have about 13k in my 401k.)

Due to some bad financial choices when I was out of work for 3 months, I have about 9k in credit card debt. This was put on a 0% interest card, and I have since transferred that balance to 2 other 0% interest cards, each with at least 20 months time to pay these off.

So going forward, this is my plan:

$3,000 left per month after expenses.

$650 per month to pay off credit card debt. With 0% interest period, this will mean I should pay this off in about 14 months. 6 months shy of the full 20 month 0% interest period.

$1,500 savings for down payment.

$250 towards investing/roth ira

$500 discretionary for 2 people. This would include eating out/clothes/entertainment. Anything left over would go into savings.

**Would definitely appreciate any suggestions to this. I'm pretty disappointed in my retirement amount so far**

So this is my plan:

Over the next year, my credit card debt will be paid off. With $1500 a month, at the end of the year I will have **$18,000** saved towards a downpayment. This is absolutely **nothing** for Los Angeles. Again, both our jobs are dependent on the area, so moving to a lower cost of living location is both a) something we don't want to do for quality of life reasons, and *most importantly*, b) would result in our salaries *drastically* falling. 

The **average** Los Angeles home is 620-750k, and rose 8% in the prior year. I would like even just a simple, entry level home, but even fixer uppers in a crime ridden area that would not be suitable to raise a child (which is something I eventually want to do) is at a minimum of nearly $500,000 that's 1+ hours away from my work. There is nothing close to my work that is not 700k+, so this is a sacrifice I have to make.

So even at say, 550k. How can I save up for a downpayment and contribute more to retirement without the price of housing increasing to the point of being out of reach? 550k with an 8% increase would mean that 18k downpayment is worth even less now that the average, starter, home would be worth 594k. Give it two years, I can move all that credit card payment money into savings and have ((1500+650) * 12) + 18,000 (from pervious year) = 43,000, and with a conservative 5% raise on that previous house would mean that house is now worth 623,000. So downpayment after saving for 2 years would be 7% of the housing price...

Lets extrapolate to 3 years. Assuming no rent increases for 3 years (laughable), and a conservative 5% housing price increase, same savings as the previous year. At age 30 I will have $68,800, and that same house would be 654,000. That brings that housing payment to 10.5%. At age 35, when I'm pushing the age to have kids, I'll have $194,000 for a down payment after 8 years of savings. That same house, assuming a 5% year over year increase in housing prices. That house would be worth a whopping $834,000... but at least I would have a 20% downpayment!!! (fucking kill me) I don't think the price of these housing numbers are unreasonable, as in the last 6 years, the average price of a home has increased **44%**. My numbers have housing prices increasing 52% over the next 8.

My biggest concern with this plan is that this whole time I am neglecting my retirement. How can I even think about retiring on $250 a month towards 401k/IRA? My job doesn't offer 401k match due to being a startup, so I can't really take advantage of that.

I make good money, why does it seem like I cannot afford a piece of property? I am trying to be conservative in my numbers. I'm assuming no salary increases and no rent increases. Obviously they are simplified, in 4 years I will have my car paid off, etc, but I want to plan for the worst case scenario. At what point can housing prices keep increasing like no tomorrow? If I'm making 110k, how the fuck can people making way less even think about SURVIVING let alone planning for their future? If someone more experienced with real estate can tell me that my numbers are garbage, PLEASE do so. I would love to hear better news on the state of the market.

The biggest thing I can see helping with my savings goal is moving to a cheaper housing. Right now it's just me and my partner. It's not an ideal scenario at all, but at the end of the lease (11 months to go), we could probably see moving with roomates into a 2 bedroom house and reducing my housing costs about 50% to $800 total instead of $1477. In that scenario, should I move that ~750 towards retirement? Or should I funnel it into downpayment savings?",finance

So, first thing's first, I'm 27 and haven't yet had a job with a 401k, and have honestly been a little clueless on how these systems work to try and squirrel money away into one in the past.

I'm in a position where I'm comfortable despite a lack of work thanks to some savings cushion, but still will be getting unemployment benefits, as well as the $1,200 some time soon.

I  don't know exactly how much would be the starting amount, but it would probably be a solid $2,000 or so, with a likely possibility of a little more depending on how long the unemployment lasts.

""The bull run end is nigh! Key indicators displaying crash imminent"".

Enter catalyst; Covid-19 (and oil war).

If we take the pro-crash side of the argument and the Fed steps in again, wouldn't we then be heading for another crash as the underlying issues would not only still be present, but exasperated?

stocks,This is why I'm bearish.,"I was writing some thoughts to a question and decided this would be best suited as an individual post. This is explaining why I have a bearish stance toward the economy and the market right now:

1. The economy is heavily based in consumption. Like 70% is consumer based. Services and goods.
2. Obviously, any degree of restrictions will begin to hinder consumption. The more extreme the restrictions, the more extreme the damage to consumption.
3. We don't currently have the virus under control, or close to under control. There are 4 states that appear likely to open by May 4th (Hawaii, Montana, Vermont and West Virginia). Another 9 states are on track for June to early July (Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah). This is predicated on having mass testing and resources to contact trace, which we don't currently have in place. Hopefully we will in these 4 states by May 4th, since they are relatively small states that aren't densely populated.
4. Even once we have the virus under control, that doesn't mean life returns to normal. It'll mean less deaths, and it'll mean less restrictions, but it doesn't mean we go back to pre-outbreak.
5. Once we have mass testing and contact tracing, if cases get above 150 daily new cases, a 14 day semi-lockdown will likely be necessary. This was true for South Korea and would likely apply for us as well. The reason being is that the ability to get ahead of an outbreak once it hits that point starts to fall apart quickly without immediate restrictions
6. The current damage from the lockdown is substantial. The IMF currently projects at least a 3% contraction in global GDP. Some places will struggle significantly with the longer term fallout, especially countries that already had economic issues going in. Being a globalized economy, this will have global repercussions.
7. We don't currently know, nor can we quantify, the damage of the shutdown from start to finish because we still don't know how long it will last. We only can give broad guesses and try to deduce what areas will likely be hit the hardest.
8. We will likely only begin to understand the longer term damage of the shutdown once the virus has been successfully contained and we start to understand what the ""new normal"" actually entails. There are many details that people are likely overlooking on the face of it.
9. Business will default at a higher rate. It's already a certainty. We don't know how much. Just like job losses. There will be jobs that don't come back. The question is the degree. Whatever that number is, people likely have not factored that into their pricing of companies. Companies that might not have defaulted for a few years might be pushed right to the brink in a few months. It's much like the virus outbreak concern with overloading hospitals, ""too many too fast"". There may be too many defaults in too short a time frame, even if many of those businesses would have gone under within 3-5 years. The sudden burst all at the same time disrupts normal market conditions which can cause a downward economic spiral.
10. Government budgets at a state level are going to be in crisis. The conversations have been put off for now because we are still in the thick of the crisis containing the virus, but when this debate comes up (plenty of state budgets come due in the summer) this will become an explosive issue. There will be budgetary shortfalls for every state. EVERY single state. The degree of lost tax revenue already ensures that. States can't handle budget deficits the way the federal government does. They have to issue bonds. They need to raise taxes to pay those bonds back. If they can't raise taxes, they have to cut the spending from somewhere else. Aside from Vermont, every state has some balanced budget requirement. With the level of shortfalls we will see, there's 3 options: big tax increases, big state budget cuts, federal government bailouts. The third is going to be seen as the most sought after and is also going to be the most contentious. Anybody think Senate Republicans aren't going to take issue with bailing out the ""generous"" budgets of liberal states? That will be a huge fight. We have a few months before that can can't be kicked down the road much further.
11. With increased business defaults, ballooning corporate debt, increased unemployment, a global decline in GDP, and budgetary issues for governments, there's simply no way the economy snaps back. If you think people are pricing this in, you're wrong. Very few people are talking about this stuff right now because we have bigger problems. We are trying to reverse a pandemic and stop tens of thousands of extra deaths. Relatively speaking, just getting out of ""how many people will die"" will feel like a huge improvement in the situation. As a result, people think that once we get out of that situation, it's smooth sailing from there. It's not. It's really not. And most people, investors included, are not seeing it coming yet.

We have a clearly defined enemy right now. The Coronavirus may be invisible, but it's an evil we know exists, and we know what we need to do in order to spot it and get it under control. There's a clear path forward to conquer it. Once we do, lives will have been saved and relatively speaking, life will improve from the current lockdown. But once we get out of that hole, we have a much more complex enemy to face. Our greed. Our fear. Our worst impulses. Our partisanship. Our distrust. Ourselves. What is happening now doesn't exist in a vacuum. There's going to be consequences at the other end of this crisis. Sorting them out will be difficult. We're going to point fingers. We're going to blame each other. We're going to judge each other in the harshest light, pointing to every flaw and failure the ""other side"" made. We will be facing massive challenges and there will be no simple answers. No clear enemy.

I don't currently have faith that we can navigate this all successfully. And this isn't a simple matter of ""Trump bad!"". I fundamentally think we are too divided, too partisan, too emotional, and too individualistic to come together and figure this out in a way that doesn't prolong the damage done. We will come out the other side. The country will eventually be better than it was before. I don't know how long that will take, but I feel confident it will be a long hard road to getting there. The decade bull of low unemployment and happy days is behind us. What comes next I don't think people have accepted yet.",finance

Just wanted to post my story in finding the best mortgage deal for me and helping anyone looking for the best rates. Less then a year ago I bought a house for 280k put 5% down. The house was appraise for 320k. I finance 266k with 4.875 interest rate / 5.2 APR 0 points. Monthly payment on the mortgage with principal and interest and PMI is $1507.69 . Fast forward to today I pay down the principal to 260k. I’m currently in the process of refinance my home and I been shopping around for mortgage lenders for a week . So far the best offer I got is 3.125 interest/ 3.25 APR 0 points with my principal and interest being $1,217.31 monthly. No upfront cost, appraisal waive (using the same one from purchase) and $775 up to 2k cash back. Saving of $290 every month. So One of the lenders I contacted earlier this week reach out back to me. We talk and I inform him the the other lender gave me the offer I mentioned above. Couple hours later he email me saying that I think I found a better deal then what she offer you and he wants to speak to me tomorrow.  If the offer is better I post it on the comment.

In case anyone wants to ask how I got this low rates is I went to google and search lowest mortgage rates in my country. I stumble this website and I found the best rates and they update the rates daily as well. https://smartasset.com/mortgage/florida-mortgage-rates . 

   I saw one bank offering 3.025 interest but I didn’t qualify I needed 800 above credit score. If anyone wants to know the lenders the company is called silverton mortgage. Lender I’m working with is called newamerican funding.

*Middle FICO score is 740
*The House is under my name.

From what I understand, I can contribute to it again for another $6,000 in January 2021. However, as I will be a full-time student in Fall 2021, I would (likely?) not earn the Retirement Saver's Credit I currently earn as a schmuck (non-student).
* I have a New York State 529 Plan, opened in previous years and, basically, kept open with a $1.00 addition in 2019 (plus whatever $1 earns). From what I understand, contributions are not taken off my state or federal taxes (because I'm too poor?).

I'm primarily debating whether to put the unused cash in a 529 or to save it and possibly put it in my Roth IRA. Here's why:

**NY529:**

\- Grows tax-free

\- Locks it in for school use (I guess it'll be a *whoopsie* if I get a full ride or significant money for school?)

\- Supposedly tax-deductible (ignorant as to why it might not have been for the $1, but wasn't going to fight it over $1) (Source of tax deductible information: [https://www.nysaves.org/home/why-ny-529-direct-plan/tax-benefits.html](https://www.nysaves.org/home/why-ny-529-direct-plan/tax-benefits.html))

\- May or may not be better growth than the market-based ROTH IRA savings account APY?

\- Will be considered if my school uses a need-based aid calculation for financial aid

\- Cannot be used to pay income taxes if I get tuition remission (i.e. if I work for the school and they remit my tuition as a benefit for being an employee)

**ROTH IRA**

\- Also grows tax-free

\- Can be kept forever (or until I retire?) if not used for school

\- Similarly, doesn't have to be used for school - i.e. house down payment, car or public transportation, etc.

\- No credit/tax benefit since I have to wait until 2021 to deposit it and will be a student in that year

\- Will most probably not be considered as a resource for me, for the purposes of calculating need-based aid, because it is ""located""/""locked"" in a retirement account

\- May or may not be better growth than the NY 529 account?

\- Could be used to pay income taxes if I use a tuition remission benefit

&amp;#x200B;

**Alternate (Savings Account/CD/Redditor's Suggestions):**

\- Savings Accounts, etc. have taxable 1099-INT statements

\- Other accounts are most probably considered for need-based aid

\- No tax credit/deduction/etc. for being a schmuck with a savings account

personalfinance,Refinance VA IRRRL- too good to be true?,"My spouse and I currently have a VA loan on our home and are looking to refinance with the VA IRRRL streamline process. No appraisal needed and no VA funding fee required due to VA disability. We contacted several lenders directly, as well as contacting a local mortgage broker who seemed to have good reviews online. The mortgage broker sent us a loan estimate that is significantly better than the other offers because they're offering a large amount of lender credits. Otherwise the cost breakdown is really similar between all the offers-same interest, same origination fee, etc. Is there something I'm missing here?

personalfinance,Refinancing Primary Residence or Investment Property,"Would like some advice on the best way to refinance given the below:

* Primary residence is all paid off and worth around 900k
* The duplex investment property is worth about the same with about 500k left to pay off. Interest rate was 4.625% at the time
* Both properties are jointly owned

Should I use equity on the primary residence to pay off the rental property? Should I live in the rental as a primary residence for a bit and refinance the rental? If I go the first route, am I foregoing the benefit of having a rental property and the mortgage interest deduction? I think the standard deduction will still be greater than my itemized deductions. Any other calculations or items I should look into before deciding?",finance
personalfinance,How much house can I afford?,"Good morning everyone. I've read through tons and tons of posts about this but I don't think it ever hurts to ask my own question. 

I've done a ton of online calculators (yes I understand they're not the best but I like doing them regardless), used 28/36% rule, etc and I just want it confirmed via this beautiful subreddit. I am a 24M.

So for starters, income. 

I make $37/hr in a really stable field (nursing). I get paid biweekly, contribute 15% to my 401k/Roth (6% toward 401k to get company matching) and end up with checks around $1600-1750 depending on the number of hours I have worked. Those checks should go up a bit due to changing healthcare plans reducing about $800/year but for now, lets use those figures.

-Monthly gross income $5328

-Monthly net income $3200*

Current debts/obligations are as follows:

-Car $262/month. $5600 left on loan (really low interest rate so I've just been paying it to build credit since I am young and only have one small credit card open...should I pay this off?)

-Car insurance $130

-Phone $67

-Groceries $140

-Rent $500

-Gym $30

-Spotify - $5 (wont start until February d/t free trial)

-Amazon/Disney Plus - Already paid through next year but about $10/month combined

-Eating out/Entertainment - $400 (estimated quite a bit higher but to account for things like spur of the moment trips, vacations, fancy dinners, etc)

For a grand total of $1,514. 

Now for my savings account/down payment. 

-Savings/Down payment - 80k (in HYSA)

-Emergency fund - 4k

I've got about 2k extra but I will not be accounting for that in either of these figures due to an upcoming purchase. Each month I am able to save at least a paycheck, if not more. For this past year I was able to save $25k which is actually a good bit considering my net income was below $50k. I anticipate having close to $100k as ""down payment"" whenever I buy a house.

Now, using the online calculators the ""minimum"" nerd wallet states is $222k w/a mortgage of $910. Nerd wallet and other sites have me at around a 350k mortgage which is 28% of my income/month for the mortgage payment (1300ish). 

When I use my figures, the 28% rule comes out to $1491 (5328 x 0.28). The 36% figure is $1678 (5328 x .36 = 1918. 1918 - 240 = 1678.) (The only true ""debt"" I have is my car loan so is this calculated correctly?)

So from these figures, I can afford a $1491-1678 mortgage payment. I understand what I can afford vs. what I should afford...but that's not really important right now when I am just trying to get some numbers worked out.

General questions I am wondering:

Whenever I use my gross income, should I be taking my 401k contributions out of that first before trying to calculate things?

Should I pay off my car now, despite wanting to build credit since it is such a low interest rate? (Not sure on exact number but I am paying about $13/month in interest...) I understand many people say don't waste money to build credit but paying it off wont hurt my credit score, correct?

If I can afford &gt;20% payment, should I do it? I don't know anything about the markets or where to start. I see all the time I can get close to 6% interest in an index fund which would probably be better than a bigger down payment but I don't know where to even begin.

Is there anything I should be doing differently?

**TL;DR: Buying a house calculating is tough. 28%-36% rules states I can afford a payment of $1491-$1678. Online calculators put me roughly in the same area.**",finance

personalfinance,Student loan forbearance minimum payments,"I don't know who needs to hear this but since Federal student loans are in administrative forbearance at the moment, if you plan on continuing to make payments please for the love of god don't keep making your minimum payments to all your loans. Use the money that would've been allocated to those minimum payments and lump it together with your payment to your highest interest loan. This only applies to those who plan on continuing to make payments.

Another suggestion I've seen on here is just to hold onto your money until right before forbearance ends since no interest will be accruing and use it as a temporary emergency fund. In the event that you don't need to use those funds you can make one large lump sum payment before the administrative forbearance period ends.

Lastly I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe during this difficult time. For those who aren't doing well I hope you are able to find the assistance you need to be able to keep you afloat during this whole ordeal. Stay safe and healthy yall!",finance
stocks,Why it does not go lower?,"I do not know much about economy and have only started investing 3 months ago. But I have some ideas and theories that I would like to share. 

Most of the people seem to be waiting for the market to crash, so they can buy it lower. People do not seem to be afraid. They are even happy to get things on a discount.

Maybe that is one reason why it does not crash.
When it crashed in March, people seemed scared to invest, everyone thought it was still expensive to invest at levels of spy 220.

Now, I do not see that fear anymore. People know that when this virus is done, the stock will recover quickly. Because this recession was not caused by a structural problem, it was a biological problem.
Sure there is a lot of unemployment and everyrhing is stopped. But once this is over we can go back to our great economy. Or so do we believe. 

Future is not so uncertain, we know how to solve it.

Anyway, i do not see any fear.
Even I would be excited for it to go down, so I can buy some stocks that I like at a cheap price. Some juicy TSLA below 420 😋

My friends who never invested are even now waiting for it to go lower to invest in. Nobody is fearful enough. We believe we got this under control in the long run

Edit: Also FED is helping

# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.
*****
&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.
*****
&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.
*****
&gt; “As the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. “The data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.” As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.
*****
&gt; Charts are important
&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.
*****
&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday’s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.
*****
&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen’s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.
*****
&gt; “My [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there’s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It’s been awesome.”
*****
&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.
*****
&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. “The market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,” he said. “They’ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.”
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.
*****
&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed’s quantitative easing programs. “We’re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,” he said.
*****
&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. “Part of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that’s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,” said Doll.
*****
&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.
*****
&gt; “Its going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,” he said, “This one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that’s defensive in nature is going to perform well.”
*****
&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy’s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.
*****
&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.
*****
&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.
*****
&gt; “I think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,” said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.
*****
&gt; “They won’t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,” he said, “I think that window will close, and we’ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there’s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.”
*****
&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.
*****
&gt; “It’s just a reflection of physical market conditions,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.

# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu

&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).

&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.

&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.

&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!

# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term

&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**

&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**

&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**

&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.

# It’s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)

&gt; It’s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn’t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.

&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn’t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn’t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won’t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.

# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 “Best Six Months,” has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA’s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.

&gt; April’s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.

Disclaimer first, as someone who is just starting to invest and most of my knowledge came from Reddit and Youtube, these are just my own speculations, and I welcome any criticism and counter arguments

1. **Market uncertainty:** Back in Feb, there was a great amount of uncertainty about the extent of damage that the Coronavirus can inflict on U.S. , how long is it going to last, how the oil price war is going to play out etc. coupled with investors possibly being complacent due to the 10+ years of bull market, that created the massive panic and sell-off, with VIX reaching 80+. Now that the extent of the impact has been mapped out, and oil price war settling, it is unlikely that panic will reach Feb level highs. Some may say that when U.S. reopens the economy, a second wave may hit and cause more panic, but I believe with case studies like China, this possibility has been taken into consideration and people will be ready for it. 
2. **Political intervention:** I believe if the market test the bottom again, there is a high possibility it will break support and sink much lower. Being the election year, Trump will do whatever it takes to make sure the stock market stays up. Thus the FED will be Brrrrring non-stop, and might even start buying equities (as suggest by J. Yellen) if the market approaches the March bottom level. 
3. **Investor sentiment:** I used to have a misconception that bad news=stocks go down and wise versa, but then, I realised that the price of a stock is determined not by facts such as earnings, but by the buyers and sellers in the marketplace and their perceptions of the facts. When you have the Fed and big institutions as the buyer, it will be hard for the sellers to push the price down to low levels. I believe many investors are now picking stocks that will not be severely affected by the lockdown, some who see downside risks probably already have hedged properly or have cash on the sidelines, thus it is unlikely to have massive panic selling again.

Some may argue that the past few bear markets lasted an average of 2 years or that often there are rallys to the 50% fibonacci level, but I believe relying on history will cause us to have an inaccurate bias, it is important to evaluate and compare the underlying factors in previous recession and the current one than to say this will happen because it happened before. The only possible scenario where I see the bottom being tested is if another black swan event occurs, (severe mutation/ a novel virus, vaccines/treatments resulting in fatal effects, WW3), as only such event could create a massive impact on the market that may outweigh the FED's effort to save the market.

But this does not mean we will not never again drop to March level in the future, who knows, maybe next year Biden gets elected, and came out with policies such as raising interest rates, or maybe a new currency is threatening to replace the dollar as the reserve currency years down the road. 

I guess some people who are hoping for a second bottom missed out on the 30+% rebound and wishes for the market to drop low so that they could buy stocks such as Amazon at a discount (I myself used to be one of them), but just because you missed this opportunity, doesn't mean there are no opportunities left, just like when the TVIX increased from $40 to $120 in Feb, you might think you have missed the opportunity, but if you brought it at that time, you could still ride it to $900+.

 No one can accurately predict where the market will go tomorrow, if not we will all be millionaires, but based on current facts, we can determine which is a more probable outcome. I am not saying that the currently trend will continue and we will reach all time highs, there might be some downward movement or consolidation Currently my investment strategy is mainly on industries that could rebound quickly after the lockdown and tech companies that does not have a super high P/E, but I am also setting aside about 30% for some short intraday trades or new market developments.

TLDR: Unless another major black swan event occurs, there is no strong opposing force that could push the market down to March levels.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Rate Question!,"I’m currently about a week away from closing on a home (first time home buyer). Though the interest rates have gone down significantly (.2%) since I first started negotiating closing the mortgage rate being offered to me by the bank has not changed. My rate is not locked yet and they are telling me that the only way to get a lower rate is for me to buy it down. I don’t want the lowest rate in the market, I would just expect that if the lowest rate available has dropped then the rate offered to me should drop as well while the other terms (closing cost and down payment, etc) would remain the same. Am I thinking about this incorrectly?

investing,Monday/this next week is judgement day in the markets.,"My last post seemed to be quite well received, in it I discussed macro-principles which we are currently tasked with as an economy while bringing some technical analysis to the table as a means to share my analysis/what I'm considering as PT's for long term investing entries; today I'm simply sharing an update on findings &amp; what I believe to be a major tipping point in market movement moving forward. \* Quick Disclaimer: No, I'm not here to act high and mighty or be crowned a fortune teller, nor am I 'making a killing' lol; movements had been forgiving up until Friday, got caught being greedy &amp; lackadaisically overconfident on someone else's analysis rather than staying hedged\*

For those that didn't catch my last post - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fvjlin/economic_stagnation_financial_corruption_dying/). I brought into perspective what I believe to be many of the ways as to 'how' our markets have been propped up/inflated \[while also highlighting some of what I believed to be key indicators in continuation of the rally that would leave many bears/greedy traders getting burned - ironically as I write this, even me\] While also shedding light on how I believe the integrity of these means to inflating the markets would give way/lead to the continuation of sell offs to at least retest lows or visit even lower lows in the near future. \*Yes I believe the Fed will continue intervention, but to the extent which prevents our markets from totally losing their value (which was at risk for awhile in March.) but, do I also believe that this can again reach a rate that is beyond their control/brings about a 'fire sale'? Certainly\*

Fundamentals aside; I'll jump into technical's starting with the strongest tickers, ones within the NASDAQ - [NVDA](https://gyazo.com/a76ab526020ac4f08ee16f53a7e52117). Early in February NVDA hit LT resistance before tumbling down, being a tech company &amp; 'safe haven' withing the NASDAQ,  it was instantly getting bought up &amp; formed a 'bullish' support on its uptrend line (like many of the other tech stocks/ semi-conductors.) However, a bounce like this has simply created more momentum for the downside, in the current economic climate and how uncertain investors are, any panicked would send stock prices tumbling in the event of further liquidity issues/continued uncertainty of business growth as ER's are reported &amp; guidelines are disbanded. (Opening potential to revisit the lows being tested in 2018; perhaps even as low as their highs in 2000 - $80 for NVDA specifically.)

One of the most influential indicators of the markets current direction imo, financials, more specifically [JPM](https://gyazo.com/c175725b089868cb777764d60fc3ad80). Eager bulls have been getting trapped the entire way down since the descent began in late February, and even this 'uptrend' is looking WEAK. The blue line of LT support, again coincides with the breakout level of 2016 (If someone were truly bullish on the economy &amp; believed this pandemic is 'over-hyped', this most likely would've been their PT of entry.) JPM/Financials is also one of the few sectors which is clearly displaying a bear flag, opposed to the descending triangles/rising wedges seen across the other markets. To even humor the bulls, I've drawn a channel of the current 'uptrend,' However, the sell off's following the egregious ER from JPM had pushed it totally out of this trend channel (a sell signal) &amp; Friday ended with a back-test of this trend line, what I believe to be the last chance for bulls to sell out with a minimized loss/profits for en-entry at these lower PT's. Fair value on JPM, lay between $65-75; I don't believe we see the true market recovery until these at least some of these fair market values are hit. (Mind you, EPS was missed by -57% on JPM, meaning that on rudimentary calculation alone with their updated projections, Yearly EPSxPE = 'Fair Price,' \~5.4 x 8.77 = $47.5) Yes this is offset by the 'ability to recover,' but would the majority of top tier investors seriously be inclined to pay double at the current share price in hopes that maybe in 2-3 years they'll be back to where they once were? It's an extremely uphill battle that I can't imagine any firm or investor would seriously put money into at these current valuations.

\- **BUT THE FED IS BUYING EVERYTHING YOU AUTIST.** Well, yeah they're currently repurchasing securities/debts in efforts to stabilize the markets, which they have done effectively at this point. But in order for the markets to stay 'stable,' this hail mary of a Prayer from Prez would actually have to come true (Opening economy May 1st, 'going back to normal.') &amp; somehow would have to continually reassure investors during these next weeks of shit ER's that ""it's just a blip."" I personally believe smart money is still waiting for that sale, and those investors are going to be pumping in WAY more money to stabilize the markets after they've been enticed with true 'fire-sale' prices, much more so than the sheep/retail investors &amp; ST pumpers buying up the bear rally up until this point. (Which, in my opinion will coincide almost exactly with the time that the general public finally wakes up to realize that everything isn't going to just return to normal at the drop of a hat. \~May/June.)

Next I move to [BA](https://gyazo.com/8474bbe8ddd1902b74b89cad987581b2), a 'strong company' within the Dow Jones &amp; played a heavy roll in the rally of the Dow on Friday. Supports/Resistances - The Orange line is representative of LT resistance on Boeing at the $154 mark (this was the resistance broken which resulted in a parabolic move by BA - the move which resulted in almost tripling their share price during the months/years to follow.) Blue is 'bullish' support around the breakout level of mid-2013, and off screen I have a lower support at $70 - representative of their high in 2000 &amp; the first breakout point following the 2009 GFC in early 2012. The Descending Triangle/ rising wedge/bear flag (otherwise known as a 'bear pull-back') - Clear as day on daily, hourly, and even weekly charts &amp; Friday's close has put Boeing at SUCH a key spot, closed AH just below that 154 resistance line and fully completed it's 5th trajectory within the wedge/triangle. Typically, after the completion of a formation like this, the next move will be very powerful (as its been building momentum while bouncing up and down - imagine compressing a spring &amp; releasing it.) That said, based on financial situation &amp; the future prospects of BA, I would put their fair value price at $70 and if I were interested in investing in BA long term currently, I'd be waiting patiently for a light load at $100 &amp; adding more aggressively as the price draws closer to $70. A quick note on '[proof](https://gyazo.com/bdf7f172dbeb29c088873befcecae2ea)' of this over-valuation. BA was trading at about \~$50 range during 2005, revenues were approx 50 Million; peak revenues were achieved in 2017-18 (\~100 Million, double the revenues seen in 2005) yet BA managed to trade at a high of $445? Cut and dry, Boeing hasn't become that much more of a profitable company; surely not enough for serious investors to even considering buying in while the price was so inflated from 2016-2020. However, this begins to expand on a greater underlying effect on these prices; and the fact that the market is no longer only driven by ER's &amp; future projections, but that it more commonly reflects our economy (or the consumers perception of our economy) more than ever. Simply put, Americans hear trump talk about never letting Boeing fail/ ""how great Boeing is for our economy, we need to make more jobs,"" and all these damn sheep buy in, driving up the price.. Now is an investor that got in early going to complain about this? Absolutely not, they're gonna ride the wave and make fkin LOOT on the silly sheep driving the price up to kingdom-come. Now the same is true as they exit their positions, this ENTIRE week Boeing saw negative net flow from large-scale orders; firms/smart money/etc selling off to the sheep willing to still pay for an inflated price tag, just like we watched happen in 2008...

Another Example - [LYV](https://gyazo.com/f225f80c63ea2f353eb1d9768f9f5a19). Live Nations Entertainment (Company which hosts music shows/festivals/etc), this company's performance is dependent on consumer spending, and IMO is one of the best reflections of the bull trap playing out in the markets currently. $30 support coincides with the breakout level which was finally crossed in 2016, again; meaning, any perma-bulls that don't believe our economic impact will be very significant at all would've been scooping shares here (and even traders which have been deep diving on TA &amp; saw this key support area being approached, knowing the resulting bounce very well could create FOMO &amp; a nice return during the early stage of the rally.) Consumer spending is going to be demolished, and any investor (outside of sheep that have attended a live nation show &amp; think 'Oh it'd be cool to own them, it was just at a high of $70/share, I wanna go to a concert when this quarantine is over, surely they'll bounce back') know this &amp; that their outlook for the upcoming year is TERRIBLE. Live nations is about to lose a FUCK load of money, and the gov't sure as hell isn't backing that; what happens when they cancel shows &amp; cannot refund their consumers? The outlook is one I cannot see any sane firm/investor touching with a ten foot poll right now.

The plat de résistance, [SPY](https://gyazo.com/854bb2b1bd62fdd1e490759209f91dfa). Does it surprise me that this week was a another green week following, ""the greatest market comeback since 1934."" as claimed by news &amp; DT himself? Not at all. Rising wedge, 5th bounce hit and rejected resistance of 288.5 today, this is what I view as the tipping point, rejecting that resistance was absolutely massive &amp; unless Monday comes around with a gap up from the futures, I believe the highs of this rally are in.

TLDR; The markets are at their tipping point, I believe we begin to slow bleed or enter phase two of the blood bath following Friday's rejection of 288.5 (For MANY stocks, this equated to a back-test of their 'uptrends' and a 5th bounce within their Descending Triangles/Rising wedges.) as we enter the next next week. Current Positions- BA $120p May 15th, LYV $25p May 15 Put, AMD $45p June, &amp; NVDA $200p June 2020 Put",finance

* I've already liquidated my retirement. It was suicide, but I had to for survival.
* I've already asked for a well-deserved raise, but it is unlikely before July. I have also started preemptively hunting for a new job. I love my job, but I was already underpaid, and I can't afford to go under again.
* Due to complications of last year's job loss, I also have a high debt/credit ratio and not-great credit, despite having a pretty good payment record- I've only missed one payment in something like 13 years.
* Family tried to help me, but underwriting shot their refinance down due to coronavirus.
* My main gig pulls in $3930. $800-$1100 of supplemental monthly income from Airbnb vaporized overnight as soon as 'Rona happened. I started looking for a roommate in January to lower my cost of rent, which is already way below market. No luck now, especially with the bodies piling up in my city to the tune of hundreds a day.
* I shopped around for unsecured consolidation loans and couldn't really get anywhere.
* I already asked for interest rate reductions for my cards. It was a no-go.
* I just managed to get a $1K emergency fund, but can't afford to do a snowball pay-off plan at the moment, because the coronavirus deferrals, stimulus, and forbearance are basically the only reason I'll get through July at my current salary.
* Paying as much as I am in debt is totally unsustainable- when the forbearance on my two loans expires, my payments will be upwards of $2200 a month. I don't want to default or settle my cards, but  I'm starting to panic.

* CLOs can only hold 7.5% of CCC rated debt, 8% of them exceeded this amount earlier this year.
* 30% of CLOs likely exceed that now.
* The Fed, FDIC, and OCC have limited reach into CLOs. I know the Fed included them in the recent $2.3 trillion package, however a-lot of the lower rated stuff is financed by credit funds and shadow banks. They don't regulate these entities.

I'm just trying to figure out if it is odd enough to consult a tax prep consultant as I'm very unemployed and very broke (as the title suggests). Let me know if you have experienced anything like this.

I'm in a tight spot and essentially am a witness in an ADA investigation and I have to remain in the area until it is resolved. I withdrew money from my 529 to survive, and I expect to pay penalties on that and that is fine. I suspect that is where the tax I owe federally comes from.

I earned about $12,000 from jobs and withdrew about $14,000 to survive (I bought an electric bike to get me around instead of a car, in order to save on insurance premiums which are high in CT; the bike was a good chunk of the $14,000).

I also have a few investment accounts in my name that I do not inherit until I am older, but I get the forms for and file accordingly. I chose high withholdings at my jobs this year to hopefully avoid any tax penalties.

I owe about $200 federally, which makes sense with the penalty. What doesn't make sense in the CT taxes and I'm trying to figure out if there is an error (or if it looks good to people with tax experience). I don't understand why the tax burden is so high -- it looks like they charged an income tax on the $14,000 withdrawn, despite me paying the federal capital gains-type taxes as well. Is this normal? The accounts are not located in CT. I also got a tax penalty accessed as well, for non-payment of state taxes, How does one pay state taxes on income withdrawn from 529's?

Sorry if this is confusing. I'm okay with paying if it's legit, I'll figure it out somehow. I'm just very stressed since it is so much more than my federal tax amount. Thank you for your help -- I'm young and trying to learn.

Edit: I should note I had withholdings from both jobs already, so that's what makes this so stressful. I thought I was getting a return finally but now I owe instead.",finance

economy,How exactly does the FED pump money into the economy?,"I have recently watched Ray Dalio's video about the economic machine and when I came across the part about the Central Banks printing money as a method to stimulate the economy, I don't quite understand a few things. 

As the video explains,  I get that the Fed can't directly hand over the money to the Gov't and that they can either 1) buy financial assets and/or 2) buy Gov't bonds (treasuries) but when the printer goes 'Brrrrr' and magically say a 1 Trillion USD$ comes fresh out of the oven, do they literally use the physical M1 money they just printed and then go to the physical markets to buy these financial assets/treasuries with the new cold hard cash in massive briefcases?

And second another question I have is with regards to the Fed buying financial assets, what are they buying exactly? Are they trading like an institutional investor buying/investing into individual stocks, ETFs, hedge funds, etc? If they are buying these financial assets as so, do they sell these assets at a later time or just leave it as is indefinitely? 

I'm probably asking the wrong questions here but I hope someone can clarify and explain this to me for learning purposes. Thank you in advance.",finance

stocks,Maybe We ARE Seeing Inflation &amp; Our Dollar IS Worth Less,"Now that we’ve accepted the Fed is printing money and we’ve adopted modern monetary policy, let me ask you this, is our dollar worth less? I’m not here to tell you whether or not this is the right move by the Fed because A. i’m not qualified and B. were way passed that... instead I want to ask you if our dollar is worth less. 

Maybe its waay too early to have this discussion but some have pointed to the fact that Gas is less than $2 a gallon, car prices have dropped and food prices remain the same if not lower to argue were not seeing inflation... but I want to talk about DJI, S&amp;P, Nasdaq etc. 

I think every single one of you on here has looked at at least one stock in the past 48 hours and can’t believe its nearly recovered its 52 high or hell in the case of some ($OKTA $DOCU $WMT etc) we could be breaking the 52 week high - in this climate!? 

You may believe some of these valuations are artificial, manipulated by the central banks and that when earnings come out over the next 2 weeks itll all crash back down to more “realistic” lows - thats what I personally think will happen. 

But if we don’t see any significant dips, if the likes of $MSFT $AAPL etc remain largely the same, then is that our proof that our US Dollar is now worth less? Is that the evidence that our buying power has decreased? How else can we explain over valuation of these stocks? Maybe they’re actually valued just right and its our US dollars that incorrectly valued.",finance

investing,Tesla Long Term Bear vs Bull Thesis,"With Tesla moving back towards its ATH, I thought I would provide my perspective on the supreme-meme stock. Before the Tesla cultists jump on me and spam ban requests for my account, I want to give a bit of background. I bought Tesla 10 years ago when it was less than 1/10 of todays price, and sold a few years ago for a profit. I love Tesla's products and would gladly buy one of their cars myself. However, this is strictly about the value of their stock which I feel is very overvalued right now. Those of you who think you are visionaries if you are just now buying this company in 2020, lol. You are very late to the party and at this point are being spoonfed a lot of ideas by the new mainstream that are not supported by deductive reasoning or data.

Before I go on, I am aware that Tesla does not follow fundamentals nearly as well as other stocks. The wild speculations and cult-like following make the short-term prospects for this stock very unpredictable. I am just attempting to make an educated guess about the long term performance of this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bull Thesis

1. Tesla's cars are the best thing since sliced bread or the first iPhone. They have the highest owner satisfaction of any car, and will become the most prevalent car on earth in the future and monopolize the market
2. Tesla is not just a car company, they are also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company. Thus they are a premium, innovative technology company more comparable to Apple than GM. They will monopolize several of these different markets
3. The company is not profitable now, but its income will continue to grow exponentially in the future due to our society's moving to green technology, and Tesla's prime position to capitalize
4. One fund manager (Cathy Wood) says she expects the stock to hit $7000 in the next 4 years (lol!)
5. New factory in China = \~1.5 billion Teslas sold (I'm being facetious)

The Bear Thesis

1. Not much of a point in focusing on current fundamentals or TA, since based on its current stock price Tesla's market cap is larger than the 3 major US automakers combined. Everybody knows their current sales are nowhere near justifying this valuation
2. We are on a 12 year bull run that many (most?) are predicting is over. In a recession/depression, the animal spirits that kept Tesla flush with cash despite their losses will fade away
3. Also in a depression/recession, less people are buying expensive electric cars or new cars period
4. Tesla investors want to believe it is a tech company, but a car manufacturer's profit margins are highly unlikely to ever match traditional ""tech companies"" (software &amp; electronics) in the future. There is a ton of competition, large overhead costs to produce and ship these products and the auto industry as a whole has been declining for years.
5. Electric vehicles are limited by infrastructure. The world's population is mostly urbanized and increasingly so. Where do you charge an electric car for an hour+ if you live in a small apartment, as is the case for nearly the entire millennial+ generation?
6. Tesla will suffer due to rock bottom oil prices. Going green is nice but ultimately economics are the strong guiding hand towards electric cars. It appears that oil will be cheap for at least a few years. Additionally, Trump is likely to win the next election (I don't like him myself, but I think this is the harsh reality). His presence will not benefit green companies like Tesla for the next 4-5 years
7. Government incentives that helped a lot with their early growth are drying up
8. Tesla has never paid a dividend and the company is very leveraged. Comparing it to other brand-name tech companies is silly based on this fact alone. Just look at their 10-k history, without the dreamer aspect it just looks atrocious. There is a reason this 17 year old (they are 17 years old and still not profitable!) company's debt is still junk rated by the major credit rating agencies. In contrast, Apple has had a net income of well over a billion dollars since 2005, before the iPhone even came out. Pretty much every other big tech company is the same, massive sustained profits for a long time.
9. By the way, since they were rated junk prior to March 22 Tesla does not qualify for Fed bailout money if things start to look bad
10. Tesla is seen as a leader in a few green fields right now largely *because they are allowed operate at a loss.* Other companies do not have this same luxury and are expected to return big profits. Toyota can't just go full electric and operate at giant losses, their shareholders will go nuts. Tesla has been allowed to do this for a surprisingly long time because of animal spirits. As soon as these green energy fields become profitable and the infrastructures start to take shape other companies will immediately jump aboard in droves. GM already has the Bolt which is actually a great electric city car. Volkswagen has spent tons of cash on EV development. I am sure as soon as total EV sales numbers become more than just a small niche their EV portfolio will take off, along with many other manufacturers
11. ""Tesla is also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company"". I see this quote nearly everywhere Tesla is mentioned. None of those are profitable for Tesla and all of them have major competitors. I think it is unlikely for Tesla to be a monopoly in any of these fields. Facebook/IBM/Nvidia/Google/Amazon are way ahead of Tesla in anything AI related, they are all filled with Stanford/MIT/Berkeley etc. graduates with 6 figure salaries. Similar statements can be made for autonomy, in which Tesla is also not the leader. Ford and GM are doing surprisingly well in autonomy, arguably they are outpacing Tesla  [https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery)
12. There are competing core car technologies. Hydrogen fuel cells, while inferior at the moment, have had several breakthroughs that may propel their green technology further in the next 10 years.  See here:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786). A lot of Tesla's value is hinged on their absolute dominance of their type of electric vehicle technology in the long term future. Challenges to this thesis substantially hurt their valuation
13. ""The future is self-driving taxis everywhere, and they will all be Teslas."" Another common point that is made, which is quite unlikely due to existing competition. Uber has a big leg up already. But also, going back to fuel cells: fuel cells recharge in the same time as gas, a couple min. Tesla's batteries take well over an hour to fully charge. Time charging is time not spent driving, which is lost revenue for a taxi. For now electric batteries are the winner, but it is not certain that in the long term future this will be the case
14. Many Tesla cultists think the growth will be exponential and soon their cars will be in every driveway. Just like when the iPhone came out, it grew exponentially for a long time. This thinking is flawed. For one thing, the iPhone has saturated in market share. At this point in time almost everybody who wants a smartphone has one and the phones are starting to blend together, we are entering a new period for the phone industry. Tesla will saturate the same way, their market isn't even a new field like the iPhone's was since people already have good cars. Once the early adopters have their cars, Tesla becomes less of a novelty. You are already seeing this in rich neighborhoods in California. If 3 of my rich neighbors have Teslas I want something unique. This is one of the main reasons no car company has ever been totally dominant.
15. Covid-19 will likely change the world, telecommuting will likely become much more of a thing. Jim Bianco talks about this a lot  (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M)). Historically a lot of people have never telecommuted and didn't know how to do it. Businesses needed to figure out how to structure themselves to operate in such a manner. Now that they have overcome this hurdle, telecommuting will become much more prevalent. Less driving to work = less need for an expensive car like a Tesla. For my weekend car, I'll stick with the manual transmission Porsche which is much more fun to drive for a couple miles
16. China. They opened up a factory in China, great. China has never stolen anybody's technology before (/s). The iPhone, made in China but its sales there have always been crap. They only recently hit single digit millions in a country of over 1b since the government actively promotes domestic brands, and strongly takes their side in courts. If a Chinese company makes a ""Resla"" that is an exact copy of the Model 3 and then sues Tesla for IP violation, you better believe they will win in China. China is experiencing massive GDP losses right now and an uncertain future, both politically and economically. There are many talks right now of reducing our reliance on China due to Covid and punishing them. IMO this all does not bode well for future sales of Tesla's pricey electric cars

TLDR:

Overall, I think that Tesla is a great company that will do amazing things in the future. We just have a lot of ""dreamer"" investors right now who think Tesla has some kind of infinite magic sauce. People who bought the stock early did well. And in 8 years, I think you will probably be able to buy their stock for $500 and enjoy a decent dividend and some more steady growth to follow. I think the people buying and holding at today's prices will see more crashes and no/low profits for a long time. I can see it retesting and crossing the limits that were hit in the crash a month ago, as Covid is far from gone at this point. I would only buy this stock if it goes below $200, and definitely would sell right now if I was holding.",finance
investing,"""You can't time the market"" is a nonsensical phrase and everyone needs to stop saying it.","So a lot is currently happening in the investing markets, and people are throwing their thoughts and advice around. I think it's great that people are talking about their ideas like this, but one thing that I keep hearing is the phrase ""you can't time the market"". It's one of those platitudes that is true and false at the same time, and is generally terrible advice.

Here is the hard truth. We are all timing the market, all the time. It's just the spans of time that differ.

Yes, even the people who are dollar cost averaging. Would you be putting money into a market that you expected to go down long term? If you are, there are other issues, but if you believe the market goes up, *then you are timing it*. Your time span is just very long. If you are shorting, you are timing the market in a short-term time span.

I'll just put this out there that yes, I have sold my 401k into cash around this price level a month back, because there are just too many risks in the short-term and I couldn't sleep peacefully. I am not shorting because the fed involvement has proven to make that almost impossible.

I felt I needed to say this because there are a lot of new people, here and in my real life, who are new to investing and asking for advice because they are seeing the headlines of ""market has done the best in the last xx weeks than it has done since year xx"" and they want in on the action. I become very fearful when I see these things. I was in the crypto space in 2017, and the similarities between then and what I am seeing now are very similar. People buy a stock because everyone else is buying it, they make money, and feel like a genius despite having done no actual analysis into the stock or why it's priced the way it is, and then telling people all of these bad headlines are ""priced in"".

This stuff scares me and is why I am out at the moment. When people say ""I am dollar cost averaging because markets go up long term"" and in the same breath say ""you can't time the market"", I cannot take you seriously. Dollar Cost Averaging is something people do because it makes them feel better during times like these.

The people that are making fun of bears for ""missing the bottom"", I am convinced are investors that have never truly lived through a crash or just haven't learned from the last one. On a technical analysis level, we will need to break the ATH's in February on strong volume before we officially declare that it was the bottom. Until then, a retouch of the bottom or a new bottom is still very much in play.

For all of the confident folk out there, please stay healthy and safe. I hope I am wrong, I truly am. Because if I am right, lots of people that are betting stimulus money that is supposed to go to future rent and bills will find themselves in a very bad spot in a few months. I just hope you find it within yourselves to stay humble and learn as much as you can. I cringe when I go back and read some of the shit I wrote about Bitcoin back in 2017. I learned that I know nothing, and if I am wrong about thinking things could get worse now, I will take it in stride and accept that I lose money. What I will not do is make fun of others and act like I know it all. Because I don't. And I never will.",finance

investing,Low yields and high stock prices are a recipe for disaster (if you are investing for retirement),"After a cliff-diving that saw markets in the US lose 35% in 5 weeks--and then gain 30% in 4 weeks (recovering about 60% of the losses). Interest rates being driven to 0%, infinite QE, etc... in the midst of the greatest health crisis in living memory (I am young, and only lived through SARS [coronavirus] in its epicenter in south China, and H1N1, and felt that those were nowhere near as bad), surging unemployment (and substantial loss to income for most).

So, what does this leave the average investor? I will tell you a story about annuities. The Chinese Yuan (￥) is used in this discussion, as this annuity was purchased in China.

My mother was 33, and took out an annuity for herself. The premium is ￥920 a year, and she would pay 23 years, and started collecting ￥500/month at age 56, and will continue to collect the same amount until she dies or the company goes out of business, whichever comes earlier.

If we take a look at this and think: well, what is ￥920 a year compounded at a 10% annualized return for 23 years? That would have been ￥73 179. At 10% annualized growth, the return would be ￥7 318/year, but ￥500 * 12 = ￥6 000. So, that meant the company that sold her the annuity thought that it can profit big time. Except that is likely to be wrong. Even though GDP growth had been above 10% annualized for a long time, that growth had slowed to only 6%, and now it just plunged to deep negative due to the coronavirus. With extreme population aging and the lack of immigration, they are being Japanified at a horrifying speed. To expect 10% growth for another 20 years in the future is flat-out delusional (average life expectancy of a woman is 77.6 years right now).

Sidenote: my sister is at the same age now as my mother was when the annuity was purchased. I know for a fact that the annuity should be more than twice as expensive for her if she wants the same payout, inflation adjusted or not.

So, what does this mean for the average investor? It is simple: if you live on $10 000, then

- when interest rates were 20%, you needed $50 000 to retire

- when interest rates were 10%, you needed $100 000 to retire

- when interest rates were 5%, you needed $200 000 to retire

- when interest rates were 2%, you needed $500 000 to retire

(The 30 year US treasury yields less than 2%)

- when interest rates are 1.5%, you need $666 666.66 to retire

- when interest raes are 1%, you need $1 000 000 to retire

- when interest rates are 0.5%, you need $2 000 000 to retire

It doesn't take a genius to realize that when interest rates are 0%, you will never retire in absense of public pensions (CPP/OAS in Canada and Social Security in the US). Period. Even at $1 million, it would take someone highly frugal 35 years to save up. At $2 million, it would be impossible for anyone making less than 6-figures to ever save up enough before dying of old age. That means investing your entire portfolio in 30 year bonds and clip coupons is not really an option any more, no matter what your age is.

This brings me back to stocks. In 2000, the S&amp;P 500 companies had $56.13 earnings per share, in 2001, it plunged to $38.85. That was a 30.8% collapse, and it took until 2004 to recover. In 2007, the EPS was $82.54, and in 2008, it was $49.51, a 40% collapse--and the 2007 EPS was almost 6% below 2006. It took until 2011 to recover to (and surpass) the 2006 peak.

Therefore, I posit that in 2020, earnings will collapse from $162.35 to $113.65 or even $97.41 (somewhere between a 30-40% collapse) and will not recover to 2019 levels until 2022 or even 2024. At $113.65 EPS and 2874 for the S&amp;P 500, the P/E ratio is 25.28, and at $97.41, that P/E becomes 29.5. If the average P/E ratio at the bottom of a bear market is 16.7, then based on these earnings, S&amp;P 500 should bottom out around 1625-1897, which is somewhere between 300 and 560 points below the March 23 low.

People think that this crisis will pass quickly. Err...no, and I will tell you why:

Who will go to the malls, stadiums, airports (even if you have millions in your bank account)? You can catch COVID-19 and risk a 1 in 250 chance of dying within 1 month of catching it (I pulled that statistic out of Germany's ass).

If a substantial number of people are not going out and spending, then a lot of people who work in these industries will simply not have a job. Unemployed people don't spend any money on anything besides essentials like housing, food, clothing and transportation.

Also, once things open up, there is nearly guaranteed to be a second wave of infections. China, Hong Kong and Singapore are places where this second wave is already happening. A second wave will mean a second shutdown, inflicting more damage on the economy. This would cause a greater collapse in earnings and stock prices.

This is absolutely horrific for any investor who is saving up for retirement. This kind of stock market pump is merely a transfer of wealth from the prudent to the reckless, not necessarily from the poor to the rich (some rich people can be very conservative in their investments).

Options positions planned (in Canadian dollars), for both hedging and speculation of the coming financial crisis:

- TD $55 2021/12/17 P

- BMO $70 2021/12/17 P

- CM $80 2021/12/17 P

- RY $85 2021/12/17 P

- BNS $55 2021/12/17 P

Close positions when the banks go to 50% of their all time highs, or if TSX goes below 9000 points.

If S&amp;P TSX goes below 9000, I will be all-in on XIU--and keep averaging down and go long on the Canadian market to oblivion. I can even leverage myself to the hilt by buying calls and selling naked puts to avoid having to pay for the calls. But I will go net short the financial institutions starting next week because the mortgage and housing bubble will go bust like it did in 2008 in the United States. Mortgage defaults will sweep the country like we haven't seen since the 1980s. Airbnb hosts who ran highly leveraged investments thinking they can get $3 000 a month in rent from each property are now going bust and will probably declare bankruptcy when no tourist goes to the cities, this puts downward pressure on residential real estate prices and rents.

personalfinance,In-service 401k to Roth IRA Rollovers,"Hi, everyone.

I'm sitting here tonight, a little less than halfway through the education portion of studying for my CFP. Taking a night off, but finance and planning are still on my mind. And I was wondering why more people don't take advantage of in-service 401k rollovers to get around the annual Roth IRA contribution limits. Assuming they're eligible for Roth contributions, of course. 

You can only contribute $6,000 per year if you're under 50, but if you're able to shove $19,000 into your 401k every year you can rollover that over and end up with more than $6,000 in your Roth every year. It obviously depends on your tax bracket, but you've already paid OASDI and Medicare taxes on your 401k contributions, so all you'd owe is federal and state taxes. Combined, you'd have to have an effective tax rate of something like 73% to get you all the way down to $6,000 from $19,000 plus employer match. 

Why don't people do this? Even if you paid 35% in federal and state taxes, you'd still end up with something like $14,500 in your Roth IRA every year, more than double what you'd be able to contribute otherwise.",finance

CryptoCurrency,What Would Happen if The USA and China Wanted to Destroy Bitcoin?,"Hey Good Folks and HODL'rs of r/CryptoCurrency,

I have had a long burning question at the back of my mind for a few weeks now, and I personally don't know anyone who is informed enough to discuss this with. So I have turned to you guys *(I hope this isn't a mistake... lol*).

**Situation**: What would happen if countries such as The USA, China, Korea etc. wanted to destroy Bitcoin?

Hypothetically, if the USA wanted to try and destroy Bitcoin by making it illegal, banning US citizens from buying/owning BTC; or even worse, use the FED to print Trillions of $'s and buying up all the Hash power and majority of BTC on the market, what would stop them from doing so?

Over the weeks I have thought of a few counter arguments and ideas what would happen in response to situation. Please add your insight and correct me if I'm wrong:

1. BTC community could decide to Hard Fork the network, rendering all previous BTC coins useless. It would have to be a hard fork, because we don't want ""backwards compatibility"" with old coins and inflate the market.
2. The amount of money/time/effort going to try to destroy BTC will cost too much $$'s and wouldn't be worth the endeavor.
3. BTC community would sense a hostile attack and join forces together and mine to combat the US government (sounds like a hollywood movie).",cryptocurrency

stocks,Take profits in your tech stocks NOW,"This is an objective take on things from a value investing perspective. I’ve been a value investor my whole life. Granted, this hasn’t served me well in the last couple of years. But overall, my value investment strategy has outperformed the market significantly over the years. I make investment decisions based on facts and numbers and hold cheap stocks long-term, regardless of current sentiment, FED buying, etc. This is what Warren Buffett does. I have been watching tech stocks becoming extremely expensive compared to usual over the last two years, so I hope to issue a warning to people investing in this space. 

Take ADBE, for example: its price-to-earnings ratio is 50x. A normal stock over a long period of time trades at an average Price-to-Earnings ratio of about 15x. So this is a very expensive stock from a value investing perspective, but they do dominate the market and make good profits. However, there are many so-called “growth” stocks in the NASDAQ today that have negligible profits (if at all). Think AMZN, UBER, SNAP, LYFT, and of course, TSLA. AYX is another one, trading on 296x earnings. These “growth” stocks trade on the sole basis of future growth, which is then supposed to lead to market domination one day, at which point the company is supposed to start making profits. 

So people are paying eye-watering prices for dominant players like ADBE and MSFT, but they are ALSO paying even more eye-watering prices for “growth” stocks which will become profitable “one day”. There is a major flaw in this logic: “growth” stocks will never become profitable if the current dominant players continue to be dominant. **They cannot both win**. Profit margins for all tech stocks are currently very elevated, and the sector can only grow at the pace the economy is growing. It’s simply not possible for ALL of these tech stocks to increase their market share and their profits. 

After it became clear that the US was heading into a recession thanks to COVID, people started piling into these already expensive tech stocks. A big part of the reason why is that tech did well in the previous financial crisis. People want somewhere to “hide” from COVID, to wait it out. However, what these people may not have realized is that the situation today is very different to 10 years ago, when the tech sector was relatively un-impacted by the recession. Many of today’s big names, such as AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, are involved in selling luxury items to consumers. This will take a bit hit. Other names such as FB and GOOGL will also take a massive hit, as the economic slowdown impacts online advertising revenue. You can think of FB and GOOGL as the real estate of the internet – back in 08/09 online retail was too busy expanding from a very low base to be hit by a generalised slowdown – but now these Tech stocks are too big not to be affected by prevailing economic conditions. The online advertising complex has a similar dichotomy to software. GOOGL and FB make all the profit. AMZN and other retailers are meant to be much more profitable one day – but that profitability would come at the expense of the online landlords. **Again, it doesn’t make sense for EVERYTHING to be on a high valuation!**

You might be thinking: the NASDAQ has been exceptionally strong recently. Why don’t I just buy a few stocks and see what happens. What can go wrong? The problem is that when there is a crash, things will go down VERY fast. You will likely not have the opportunity to get out of your stocks once things start going down properly. 

Many companies will be reporting their Q1 numbers soon. Many of them will avoid giving guidance for Q2, saying that their future performance is uncertain. However, one thing is certain: Q2 performance will be catastrophic across the board. Companies (especially tech companies that pay their employees in stocks) will try to keep the stock price up for as long as possible. However, they will have to report these bad numbers at some point. We don’t know when the market will lose confidence in the sector as a whole – it’s not possible for anyone to time this, even Warren Buffett. However, we can be sure that an actual decline in performance is coming, and when the market reacts to this, things may drop faster than you can react. 

TL;DR, tech stocks were already expensive pre-COVID, and are not the “safe haven” that some people believe them to be. This is not the time to buy tech stocks, or hold them with the intention of selling in the near future. The whole sector is set up for a significant dip, as COVID-19 impacts are not yet priced in.",finance

personalfinance,Swaps: Risk Management,"I've been reading this book, Corporate Finance for Dummies, and I've come across this topic on Swaps.

Under the description for Risk Management, the author has provided the following example.

`The easiest way to see how companies can use swaps to manage risks is to follow a simple example using interest-rate swaps, the most common form of swaps.`

1. `1. Company A owns $1,000,000 in fixed-rate bonds earning 5 percent annually, which is $50,000 in cash flows each year.`
2. `2. Company A thinks interest rates will rise to 10 percent, which will yield $100,000 in annual cash flows ($50,000 more per year than their current bond holdings), but exchanging all $1,000,000 for bonds that will yield the higher rate would be too costly.`
3. `3. Company A goes to a swap broker and exchanges, not the bonds themselves but the company’s right to the future cash flows. Company A agrees to give the swap broker the $50,000 in fixed-rate annual cash flows, and in return, the swap broker gives the company the cash flows from variable-rate bonds worth $1,000,000.`
4. `4. Company A and the swap broker continue to exchange these cash flows over the life of the swap, which ends on a date determined at the time the contract is signed.`

`In this example, swaps help Company A manage its risk by making available to Company A the possibility of altering its investment portfolio without the costly, difficult, and sometimes impossible process of actually rearranging asset ownership. As a result, Company A makes an additional $50,000 per year in bond returns. Of course, like with many investments, the company could also lose money if interest`

&amp;#x200B;

My question is if Company A has to pay $50,000 to a swap broker. What's the purpose of buying a swap in the first place? I mean, that would leave company A with $50,000 only, which it was anyway earning in the first place.

Company A was already anticipating a GAIN in the interest rate, so I'm sure it wouldn't be trying to hedge its risk.

investing,"TA may be meaningless right now, but it shows a big week ahead","From a TA perspective this should be a pivotal week, as we are now approaching 5 separate levels of resistance:

1. In our initial downturn, we hit the 2860 level as a low on 02/28 where it acted as support. We then hit it again as a high (2880) on 03/10, where it flipped and acted as resistance. We haven't been back since until this past Friday.
2. Friday was also the first time since 02/21 that the S&amp;P was not below the 50 day moving average... we hit it right on the button. This is also represented by the MACD finally crossing the 0 axis.
3. The higher highs and higher lows of the upswing that started on 03/24 haven't formed a parallel channel, but rather a narrowing triangle. The trend lines of this triangle are set to intersect by the end of this week.
4. The trend line for the recent higher highs is also set to intersect the 200 day moving average by the end of this week (around 3000).
5. Right between the local price resistance level of 2880 and the 200 day MA level of 3000 is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 2930.

To me, these 5 together represent pretty significant levels of resistance in the 2880-3000 range... especially the 200 day MA which also just happens to be pointing perfectly towards a nice even number. If we do break through, the next level up would be around 3130. If we bounce off, the next support levels would be around 2630 and 2460.

TA may not mean much in the face of a black swan event where the news changes daily and the fed is printing unprecedented amounts of money... but I still feel like this will be a pivotal week. I personally think the retracement from the lows was too optimistic, and we'll be headed back towards the 2630 and 2460 support levels.

She was talking about cashing out to preserve her money.  One month later, she hasn't taken any action, and of course her account has partially rebounded.  Just curious what other people who are retired already may be doing if around this age.  Are you moving everything to cash and very conservative investments for preservation?  Or are you expecting this downturn to rebound quickly enough to not make a difference long term.  Her Fidelity advisor was helpful, but of course has no crystal ball.  The options were do nothing... move to a more conservative profile with the IRA... or move part of her IRA balance to cash...part to an account with a guaranteed 2% interest rate for three years...and leave part of it in the current investments.

My wife is a nurse, making around 60k/year, and we both have student loan debt from university as well, each about 28k (totaling 56k), some subsidized, and some unsubsidized. With the whole COVID-lockdown, the US suspended all interest rates and payments on loans, but we are still able to pay them back if we want to.

My graduate school is a PRE-accredited school (I can't stress this enough... PRE-accredited... NOT UN-accredited. It's a new school, will be accredited soon). But until we are accredited, we cannot get financial aid federally, so I had to use a private lender to pay my tuition. Also, when we moved for my education, my wife didn't have a job lined up yet, so I just ended up getting a loan for whatever amount my school suggested. Here is a breakdown of our debts:

College loans: 28k, minimum monthly payment $300. (interest rate just says 0% right now because of suspension)

College loans: 28k, minimum monthly payment $300. (interest rate also 0% currently.)

Graduate school loans: 79k with 7.74% Fixed Interest rate, and over 2.6k accrued in interest for this loan so far since July.

$1800 Card 1 - I currently have an email from them offering to settle for $1200. I have not contacted them yet.

$1800 Card 2 - This has gone to collections. I have not contacted anyone to settle this yet.

$800 Card 3 - This has also gone to collections and I have not contacted them yet.

What is my best course of action? Should I save the $3000 for an emergency fund? Should I use part of it towards debt and save the rest? Should I use all of it for debt repayment and then aggressively save part of my income from my new job to establish an emergency fund in 2-3 months?

How should I pay them back? Should I settle with Card 1 and attempt a pay for delete for the other two? Do I contact the original people I owed money or must I contact the debt collectors at this point? I think with my new income I will be able to pay off my total debts in 3-4 months, but I don't know if I will be able to set up payments with the debt collectors or if they will require one lump sum payment. Should I spread out payments between all of them now or pay them one at a time even if it takes a few months. Obviously my credit score has absolutely tanked, but I'm just trying to mitigate damages at this point and then will rebuild from there.

Again, I acknowledge I have been a huge fuckup, but I'm trying to unfuck things as much as I can at this point.

personalfinance,How many official death certificates are needed?,"Hello,

My father is passing away soon and funeral service charges $20 per official death certificate. I came up with this list so far of things I have to notify of my fathers death.

* 1x - Checking/savings account (hope he only has one bank)
* 1x - Pension
* 1x - Social Security
* 1x - Health insurance (do I really need to let them know?)
* 1x - Car insurance
* 1x - Title transfer car
* 2x - Federal and state tax return (do I need 1 cert for federal and 1 for state?)
* 1x - Credit bureaus (notify 1 bureau, they will notify others)
* 9x - credit cards (he had a lot of credit cards but luckily most with 0 balance)
* 1x - mortgage

I am sure I have missed some. I counted 20 above so I was thinking of ordering 23 official death certificates in case I missed a few. Does this sound correct to everyone? Thanks.",finance

investing,"If you haven’t sold your long positions, why?","Not all of my accounts are completely liquidated, but my overall stock exposure is probably under 15% at this point. 

I see no reason for this irrational exuberance. We sit at levels that were resistance levels in mid 2019 when everything seemed rosy. We’re less than 10% off all time highs. 

Oil is $18 a barrel and won’t likely spring back to viable shale prices anytime in 2020. There will be hundreds of thousand of jobs permanently lost there (remember 2016 when this was the primary reason the markets were selling?)

We have many industries that are taking permanent damage - airlines, hospitality, restaurants, entertainment. 

Many technologies will likely be delayed. I doubt the iPhone for instance will be ready in 2020. 

Sporting events likely won’t happen until there’s a vaccine. That hurts advertisers.

personalfinance,Chicago Cost of Living Budget,"I am going to graduate with an M.S. later this year and move to Chicago for an entry-level job. The base salary is 77k. I used a calculator to get my net income after tax, and it came out to a monthly net income of $4,200. I have approximately 60k in graduate loans, with an interest rate of \~8%. The calculator took into account health, dental, vision, state income tax, federal  income tax, FICA and state insurance taxes such as social security and  medicare, 401k contribution of 6%, and additionally a monthly transportation fee of $100 per month (I can use pretax dollars to pay transportation fees, so I deducted $100 for the monthly CTA pass). After all of that, my take home salary is about 67% of my gross. 

I've never made a budget before, so I want to know if my budgeting is realistic and reasonable. From googling around, these are the numbers I came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

20% Savings, $840

Student Loans, $600

Groceries/Eating out, $500

Personal Items/House supplies, $50

Fun, $150

Subscriptions (Only Netflix and Spotify), $20

Phone (My parents will continue to pay it off), $0

Car (No car, just public transportation I used pretax dollars for), $0

Internet, $60

Renter's Insurance (I don't know what this is, I just stumbled upon it in every budget), $30

The total above is $2,250, and the remainder left is $1,950. I want to use this remainder for rent and utilities. This is well-above the general rule of thumb of 30% net income for rent with utilities included, which for me is $1,300. However, my situation is that I would like to rent a decent 1BR place because after 5 months of living alone, my girlfriend would also graduate and move in with me. My worry is that I have to sustain the initial 5 months of rent and utilities alone, and want to know if its even possible with my circumstances? Should I cut a bit into my savings % per month and allocate it elsewhere? What other budget items did I not include? Are my estimates conservative? I also want to know how bad this plan is financially, or if it's not completely dumb and irresponsible? Should I just scrap this plan, and decide on living somewhere with far less rent/utilities?

I know that I am putting too little off my student loans, but my plan was to keep it up for the 5 months, then change my payment plan to pay it off a bit more aggressive than how I have it now. If my hypothetical rent/utilities is true of $1,950, I would split that with my girlfriend later and it would then be well under the 30% rule of thumb.  My girlfriend is to make around the same as me after she graduates. Also, I would agree that spending nearly $2,000 is ridiculous, and that as a new-grad, I don't have that sort of luxury to live like that. It is just a personal desire that my girlfriend and I share. We prefer not to live in a very small apartment. We were looking into more of the modern apartments, and nothing of ridiculous commute. It doesn't have to be downtown, it can be a 30 minute commute away.

Additional info: I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally with friends. However, I don't think I will do that quite often anymore since it's not university.",finance
investing,Trends for 2020 due to Covid-19 for investment due to trends and human behavior,"Created a new account after deleting my old account to move away from politics and get more into investing, which explains my new account. Wanted to talk about trends and human behavior which can help explain consumer activity as we all go through the disruptions of our lives due to covid-19. This is unprecedented territory here partly why we see so much uncertainty in the markets. The goal here is to clarify what we can do to invest based on how humans react, and think about what companies will be needed to survive, and what will fade away as non-essential luxuries that no long make sense in the new normal. They may come back, but priorities of survival are what you should look to in the short term, while others are long term.

Think about how this disruption will change consumer spending habits. Which industries will fail, which will benefit. Short term, long term changes to daily life along with trends will help to weather the storm understanding how people react to all of this.

1. Consumer confidence will need to be managed by increasing health security to go back into stores after these stay at home orders get lifted. Think about ways retail stores will help consumers feel comfortable getting out, away from E commerce, and getting back into brick and mortar. I'm thinking thermal imaging cameras to monitor temperatures before people are allowed back into stores, or even office buildings.
2. Coping mechanisms to deal with the pain of financial ruin. Many will turn to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain. Medical marijuana and alcohol sales were deemed essential business in some states after consulting addiction specialists to avoid the pain of withdrawal. Think about medical marijuana stocks or alcohol stocks. Yes, bars will not be opening, for a while which means those stocks will be going lower for some good buys.
3. Food. Everyone needs to eat three meals a day, and as restaurants close, grocery chains are benefiting. The food supply chain is disrupted as food processors need to shift from commercial to retail sales, along with packaging into smaller portions for the consumer now buying for home use. This takes time, and will be very disruptive. Prices will rise due to crops and livestock being destroyed due to lack of demand from schools and restaurants, but the food is still needed. People need to eat, and it's a guarantee for human life. Some restaurants will not come back, and consumer habits may shift due to fear, so look to grocery, and food processors.
4. Travel. Work from home, and people canceling vacations will hurt travel, including automotive industry, and insurance industry. Oil will bounce back eventually, and very low if you are looking to get in now for gains months out.
5. Supply chain. Shipping companies such as FedEx, UPS, or even air-fright will be big as there is a rush to accommodate launch schedules of product, and increase of E commerce.
6. Think about what is essential to life, that will still make money, as opposed to what is luxury. Look at what is shut down as not essential, and what is remaining open as essential. All these factors will help investing what will continue, while avoiding what is doomed to fail.
7. Never forget gold and silver and wealth that has held value for thousands of years. If we look at an economic jubilee of elimination of debt at the international level, gold and silver will go up. Gold is also used in high level electronics and the best conductor of electricity, and silver is used in high end medical tech for its anti-bacterial properties. As people flee the market, they go into these assets as well.

There are others, but hoping you all could add your thoughts, and what trends you see in the near and longer term future.",finance
personalfinance,Filing multi-state (Puerto Rico and Alabama) tax return,"My girlfriend lives in Puerto Rico, she is also a bona fide resident of the island and has lived there her whole life except for January through August of 2019, during which time she moved to and worked in Alabama. She has to file taxes in the US and the state of Alabama for time worked in the state, during which she earned a bit less than $8,000. From August of 2019 through the end of the year she's been working in Puerto Rico and earning an income there and her earnings were around $9,000 during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

She tried filing with TurboTax and an issue arose with multi-state returns and the income she earned. When filing with TurboTax, should she ignore income earned in Puerto Rico and just file federal taxes and those for Alabama, without entering Puerto Rico as a state of residence? It is my understanding that she has to file separately with Puerto Rico. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue when she adds in Puerto Rico as a state of residence is that she is not allowed to add income for it and so she qualifies for the Earned Income Credit (only taking into account the $8,000 in earnings). However, since for tax purposes she is single and has no dependents, and between Alabama and Puerto Rico she has earned over the threshold for that credit, I don't know that she actually qualifies.

&amp;#x200B;

She also has a US bank account and I'd like her to have access to direct deposit for this refund if possible. The Earned Income Credit and the fact that she adds Puerto Rico as a state of residence in the US tax return makes her ineligible for that (mail-in only is the only filing method allowed). Direct deposit information is also required for a timely deposit of the $1.2K check most people are getting, but since she is required to file taxes in the US, she cannot use the IRS website to enter direct deposit information. It's a weird catch-22 where it seems she is not allowed to add direct deposit information anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is an unusual tax situation and I'd usually recommend visiting a tax preparer but due to current circumstances I thought she could give it a shot on her own. Please let me know if she is better off just biting the bullet and preparing with a tax professional. Thanks.",finance

I have income based for the federal and then I pay a little over the bare minimum payment on the other. Plus now that I’ve completely paid off a private student loan I put the extra money I was paying on that loan onto the loan with the highest interest rate. 

Here’s the deal, I’ve been a very frugal person my whole life and have saved my money well. I don’t have enough in my savings at all to pay off my loans by any means but I have enough to cover emergencies plus. 

Now I want to get a housing loan with my fiancé. My plan is get a house that’s more expensive because I’m not a fixer upper person and I don’t plan on buying a starter home. 

Would I get a better mortgage loan by paying more of my student loans off now or by having more saved up? I’m not quite sure how that works out I guess. My fiancé tells me I should pay a bunch of the loan, my parents say I should keep more in savings since obviously I also need to plan a wedding as well.

Bitcoin,"In the US, lost your job, and selling long held Bitcoin to pay your bills? Watch out for estimated taxes and underpayment penalties.","Some people here are in the unfortunate position of having been furloughed or recently lost their jobs due to the pandemic, but are in the highly fortunate position of having well appreciated Bitcoin holdings that can be sold to pay your living expenses.  In the US this situation presents a minor tax risk in that you might not be expecting.

The IRS (and many states) require that you make payments through the year which total either 90% of your tax obligations or 100%* of last years taxes (* 110% if your AGI is over 150k). If you don't meet these requirements and owe $1000 or more in taxes there is an underpayment penalty of roughly 0.5% per month under paid plus interest (recently around 5% but it may drop to 3.25% due to the federal funds rate changing).  When you have an ordinary job payroll tax deductions mostly take care of meeting your obligations, or at least getting close to them.

However, if you lose your job and start living off selling Bitcoin you'll owe taxes on your capital gains and you won't have payroll withholdings. Any time you have large capital gains the same sort of risk exists but the combination of gains plus having lost your payroll withholding create an increased risk of large penalties.

To address this you're supposed to make quarterly tax payments.

Perhaps you're unable to do so. A tax penalty isn't the end of the world.  Maybe because of the pandemic they'll wave or lower penalties (they have done so in the past when changes in taxes left many people under-withheld)-- I wouldn't count on it, it's better. Regardless, better to be forewarned so you can incorporate it in your planning!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for some insight on paying 2 collections off.,"Now that I'm in a position to start working on my credit score financially, I'm wondering the best way/route to go about it.

My current situation - I work a federal job and bring in \~$2500/mo depending on how much OT I work. 2500 is working 40 hours a week, when in reality I work closer to 50 a week, but better to plan safer. My monthly bills are about $1000/mo (rent,car,phone,etc).

From credit karma today, I have 4 open accounts. 1 is my student loan (34,000) which I have been deferring since I finished school, I just deferred it again at the end of last year, and would like to be in a position to start paying it when my deferment is up at the end of this year. I have 2 credit cards, and I have made a few payments on to get them back current, and now they show as restricted so I'm assuming once they are paid down, they will get closed. 1 is at $398, the other is at $280. I ""had"" 2 accounts in collections, I disputed one on CK, and it no longer shows on my account, but I recently received a letter from a different agency than the one it was originally through. Someone told me, the dispute probably ""went through"" and they may have ""sold?"" the account to that company. Either way, that account was $350, and the agency said in the letter they would settle the account in full if I paid $180. The other is $130, and I have all the info and am able to send a payment online to pay it in full.

I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do other than paying them in full to make the best of it. I thought once you paid it off, it would get removed, but further investigating, showed me I was wrong, and that even though it will show paid in full, it would still be on my report.

My plan is to pay both my collections off first, since they have the biggest impact, then next month pay my credit cards. Is this the best course of action to take?

I bank with NFCU, and was thinking about trying to open a secured credit card, that I can put a few hundred dollars into it, and start rebuilding my credit, and along with my car payment, my credit should start going up.

energy,Why we west coast should NOT interfere with WY/MT/UT coal export,"West coast are engaged in a battle against coal on environmental and political ideology grounds. This worries me as a west coast resident.

There are two reasons why we West Coast should get out of the way of WY/MT/UT coal export, as long as they fulfill the general (not specialized for coal) environmental regulations.

(1) **Denying landlocked states' right to sea is unconstitutional**. We need reciprocity. It might incur revenge from these coal exporting states in other issues that require interstate cooperation. Think what if WY/MT/UT police refuse to extradite someone who have committed a felony in Seattle, or what if WY/MT/UT block CA made software and IT services from market.

(2) **Actively fighting coal export may corrupt our own state politics** as an unexpected effect. The power to block export creates a perverse incentive. Coal conglomerates are powerful in lobbying and political donations. If we as a state actively interfere with WY/MT/UT's business with other foreign state players (Japan, Taiwan, S.Korea), think of all the state sanctioned silver bullets that will seek the way into our politicians' campaign fund.

&amp;#x200B;

Let the federal government handle the matter. Trump might be pro coal, but he has at most less than 5 years left, so even if Trump mess something up, future presidents will fix the issue. Also, coal is a dying industry, so even if they can export, the shipments will go down in long term, leaving the railroad and port infrastructure for other environment friendly business.",energy

Bitcoin,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history. 

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this. 

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and

2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem. 

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

stocks,For those who think the market is acting irrationally,"Some thoughts I feel should be put out into the forum to mull over. Yes, I get that we know this downturn will be bad. Worse than what people expect. But let's break it down a little further.

Many people, including people like me, bought stocks well before the highs. We didn't sell on the downturn because conventional wisdom says selling off our holdings in a panic is a good way to sell to others at a discount and play yourself. We don't go on a buying frenzy either though. We wait to see when there's some degree of stabilization to the down turn. Don't react emotionally. Short sellers and those who do panic will drive the market down short term, but then we will see a momentary stabilization. 

Now we get the rebound. And this starts to confuse a lot of people. ""We haven't reached the bottom, things are just starting to get bad, why would people buy?!"" and I think that may be the wrong question. The right question is ""why are there more buyers than sellers?"" And I think that gets to the root of the issue. You might believe this is a bear market rally, but that doesn't mean you're selling your holdings.

For instance, I don't think we're at the bottom. But even the bottom is likely close to or still above the average I paid for a lot of my holdings. Why would I sell them, unless I believed the fundamental picture has changed for those stocks? I wouldn't. So I might stop buying at this point, but I'm still not selling. Because best case scenario, I don't know the prospects for the company of the stock I'm holding, but I know selling on uncertainty is a bad move. So I wait.

That means this past month and the immediate future, the bulls are going to push the volume over selling. And nobody wants to fight that momentum with the government behind them in the short term. Short sellers are going to wait for momentum to stall and start to shift. Something to indicate that the bulls have run out of steam and they can create momentum in the opposite direction to profit.

My theory is that this change won't happen within the next few weeks. It doesn't make any sense to shift. Virus cases will decline. Companies will keep announcing progress on trials and results. States will announce more states opening back up slowly. The federal government will announce new stimulus. That's all short term momentum pushers. Any losses will get reversed and I doubt we see much in the way of declines in the next couple weeks. 

That does not mean in the medium term I'm not bearish. At some point, the economy opens back up, the hope of ""when the virus is under control"" is already priced in, and the government wraps up with all the stimulus it's going to do in relation to virus bailouts. Then we are going to be left with the economic fallout. And I think that's when we take a negative turn. Q2 results, jobs not coming back like we hoped, no V shaped recovery, etc. We start to see more certainty in terms of damage and earnings prospects. That certainty won't be as optimistic as the hope that came with the V shaped recovery and virus under control. So I think once we get some certainty and people can get new EPS and P/E ratios and all that other stuff, once they are able to measure what actually happened, people will start profit taking realizing that stocks got overbought and short sellers will smell blood in the water.

So if you have puts for the next couple weeks, I'm negative on that. I actually bought calls this morning for this week. Betting against a replenishment of the Paycheck Protection Program and the desire of bears overall to just hold due to too much uncertainty is probably a bad idea. Analyzing the behavior of the market, and my own behavior given my held perspective, that caused me to believe we have some more gains to be had short term. Medium term will be negative. And LONG term (out beyond 5 years) we will rebound from all this. The question will be where best to put your money, and I think you should be looking at the stocks who rebounded well this past month as a starting point, then keep an eye on their quarterly reporting to see if anything fundamentally turned them negative over the long term.

Best of luck to everyone.",finance

investing,Financial Times op-ed: Bailing out the oil industry brings a fate worse than death. Zombie companies would be created that must be kept afloat with taxpayer dollars,"https://www.ft.com/content/4a6494e2-7fbe-11ea-b0fb-13524ae1056b

&gt; Whenever things went wrong growing up, my dad would tell me, “What doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger.” Dying was supposed to be the worst-case scenario. He never mentioned zombies. But that’s what a bailout for the oil industry would create: zombie companies that can’t earn the cost of staying in business, kept afloat with taxpayer dollars.

&gt; The oil patch in the US has been hit by a double whammy. The Saudi-Russian fight for market share helped drop the price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, to just above $20 a barrel. Then came coronavirus lockdowns, and an unprecedented collapse in demand for oil. While Easter Sunday’s Opec+ deal should reduce the supply glut, it is dwarfed by demand problems: WTI fell to around $18 a barrel on Friday.

&gt; With storage facilities near full, there will soon be no place to put the oil. Drillers, producers and oilfield servicers will be forced to halt production and lay off workers. Washington is now in bailout mode. The Trump administration offered storage space in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Energy department is developing a plan to pay producers to leave crude in the ground.

&gt; There are valid economic arguments for a bailout. Energy is an important driver of investment. The last time WTI dropped significantly, in 2015-16, capital expenditures contracted and the US fell into an industrial and manufacturing recession. Employment in the oil and gas sector fell by about one-third. Some say it contributed to the discontent that pushed Donald Trump to the presidency in 2016.

&gt; But the business model for many exploration and production companies was broken before oil prices fell. Fuelled by cheap credit, US shale producers borrowed heavily to invest in drilling, causing the US energy bond market to triple in size over the past decade. The focus has been on producing quantity to conquer market share and the flood of oil has yielded low returns for equity investors, as frackers reinvested windfalls and raised top executive pay. US fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy, for example, hasn’t generated a single year of positive free cash flow in the past decade. As debts rose along with oil supplies, a shakeout was inevitable.

&gt; A bailout would throw good money after bad, propping up an industry desperately in need of productivity gains and consolidation. Instead, the industry should be left to adapt. According to analysts at Rystad Energy, shale producers should be able to cut costs by 16 per cent this year, productivity gains that would not happen with government funding. High-cost or highly indebted small producers — and their infrastructure — should be taken over by larger, solvent companies. While that would result in bankruptcies and debt write-offs, it would reduce financing costs for those left standing. The industry would come out stronger and more profitable.

&gt; A backhanded industry argument for a bailout is that bankruptcies threaten investors and banks with big losses. That’s the nature of capitalism. Investors take risks and are often rewarded with high returns. Sometimes investments go south and they have to absorb losses, but it’s not a systemic risk. A compilation of annual disclosures by Bloomberg News shows Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are the largest US bank energy lenders. Only about 1 to 3 per cent of their portfolios are exposed to the industry. A series of defaults would hurt, but it would not alone bring down the big banks.

&gt; Of course the government should offer support for energy workers facing inevitable lay-offs, along with all the other Americans losing their jobs in the crisis. But while many companies closed by coronavirus were healthy businesses beforehand, many in the oil industry were already on a path to failure. This is no time to create zombies.",finance

economy,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

personalfinance,Spouse incorrectly took IRA deduction on federal taxes in 2016 - how best to move forward?,"Background - My wife and I recently discovered that on her 2016 tax filing, she incorrectly took the IRA deduction for a $5500 traditional IRA contribution - it should have been allowed as a nondeductible contribution, but long story short, she took the deduction. As a result, it appears she should have paid more tax for 2016.

Based on our reading of IRS regulations, we're just barely past the 3 year mark where the IRS allows you to amend your tax filing (and despite CARE Act extensions for 2019 filings, it appears that just requests for 2016 unclaimed refunds are extended until July this year). 

We are trying to figure out how to move forward... we are curious if there is a penalty for this type of contribution to an IRA, or really a fee for taken a deduction that we were not allowed, and if so, what is the penalty?  I know that the penalty for contributing more to an IRA that the annual limit, by income, triggers a 6% fee for each year you allow the excess funds to remain in the IRA, but I have not been able to find out if this fee also applies to a case in which there was not an excess contribution, but an ineligible deduction. 

We are also curious if we can resolve this past mistake by rolling the balance of my traditional IRA over to a Roth IRA?  This way, she will pay taxes on the tax-deducted funds (in effect correcting for the contribution that should not have been deducted). I haven't seen this particular set of circumstances discussed anywhere - whether on Reddit or other forums. 

So, in summary, we have three questions:
1) what is the penalty for deducting a traditional IRA contribution, when you are not eligible to take a deduction
2) and two, can you simply roll-over the traditional IRA to a Roth to correct for the mistake? Assuming any basis is correctly documented on 8606 forms for any nondeductible contributions.

personalfinance,Should I pay the HSA Non Qualifying penalty + taxes to pay down debt?,"Hello PF,

I have a 16k personal loan at an ~11% interest rate that I've been paying off for a year. I also have around 6k in my HSA account and wish to withdraw 5k of it to pay down this debt a little bit. About 50% of that was employer contribution. 

I am in the 22% federal tax bracket making 80k a year. 

With my stupid quick excel math, I'm seeing the penalty for NQ HSA withdrawal as 20%. So if I wanted to take 5k out, I would pay about 1k in penalties and then an additional $900 in taxes. Meaning I'd be able to take out around 3k. I'd basically have to pay 2k to do this.

I'm a pretty healthy guy in my 20s and have spent very little on healthcare expenses in the past few years. Also I still have a PPO, it's just a high 5k deductible. I'm not too worried about paying this as I'm lucky to have a safety net with my parents (who are wealthy, but don't know about this debt I've been paying off). Basically, I'm willing to take the financial risk on my health to pay down some of the debts I owe.

I just don't know if paying 2k cash that is only meant for healthcare worth paying 3k towards debt, especially considering a lot of it was employer contributed as well. 


Also, as a side note if anyone is still reading, should I refinance my debt at a lower interest % before making any relatively large payments on the debt?

personalfinance,"Not sure if I should buy a home, or rent an apartment?","Hiya r/personalfinance

This is my first time posting here, and I apologize if this question has been posted numerous times on here, but I have no one in my life to help me with this decision.

So, I've been looking at the housing market for about a year or so... just casually browsing to see what's out there. I am by no means rushing the process of buying my first home. 

A few things about me:

\-Single, no kids

\-60,000 salary (plus bonus, if that matters) 

\-Will probably go back to school this year (2 year grad school)

\-Aside from gym memberships and other misc stuff (netflix, amazon, phone, internet...) I have no other debts.

\-Will probably be getting a car this year (\~20k - 28k)

\-About 14k in savings

\-Avg credit score (\~680) 

&amp;#x200B;

I started working with a realtor, who then referred me to a lender... but in both cases I'm still confused.  The realtor never knows how to answer questions about how much house I can afford.... we were looking at home in  the 215k range... so I said no. The lender wants me to seal the deal asap... I told him to hit pause.

To my knowledge... I can only afford a 170k home at my current salary... this is based on a conversation I had with my sibling who says her mortgage is \~1,600 for a house that price. 

Now, I'm confused about where I stand... and what the best option for me is. I don't want to deal with lenders at the moment, because no one is giving me advice... they just push for a sale. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, I was set on buying a house... now the decision feels more complicated than a yes/no. My reasoning was that I would rather not ""throw away money"" on rent. Now, I feel like renting is easier than all this home buying stuff. Either way, I told both the realtor and the lender that I would feel more comfortable having more money saved up for a beefier down payment... and honestly, their responses are ""why wait, the housing market is good right now... interest rates might go up.... yadayada"" 

I *think* I would prefer to buy a house... however, I don't what I'd be getting myself into if I sign on the dotted line.",finance

personalfinance,some questions on savings / checking interest rates,"Most of my money is in decent-enough (until last month) investments, but I was recently thinking about something else I never really gave much  thought to.

My whole life, i never really paid much attention to basic banking interest rates. I never shopped around for highest rates, or anything. It was never much more than a few dollars per month anyway. I generally direct-deposit all my salary into savings, and right before bills get paid out of checking, transfer just enough money from Savings into Checking so I could cover everything, plus a bit extra for ATM withdrawals. Kind of a pain in the ass, but been doing it online for 20 years so meh.

I recently opened up an account at a credit union, and I noticed that the Savings account interest is 0.10% APY, while the Checking account is at 0.50% APY. I can't remember ever seeing that before.

Is there any catch? is there a reason I should even have a savings account, when the Checking is slightly more liquid (no limits on withdrawals), has checks, and gives 5x the (miniscule) intersest rate? This would make things so much easier, as my income would get dropped into the checking account directly, and I wouldn't have to worry about overdrafts or anything.

personalfinance,Need Help Deciding If Purchasing a House Is Worth It,"I’ve been working for the federal government for the last 10 year, renting various places around DC. Over this time I’ve been saving for a house and am trying to determine if I’m in a position to purchase. My AGI for 2019 was a hair under $100K. I currently have $58K in cash, $114K in stocks I can sell, and $13K in a CD set to mature in June 2020. I fully fund my Roth and TSP every year and would not touch either account in the purchasing of any property. I have $8K in an I-bond which I’ve owned for 3 years and consider my emergency fund. I pay off my credit card every month and just paid off my 3 year car-loan in March. My car loan had an interest rate of .95% otherwise I was prepared to pay cash in lieu of a loan.

&amp;#x200B;

With my current salary, I bring in $112K a year. I travel a lot for work and my team is extremely understaffed. This results in a fair bit of overtime every year. YTD I’m already at 95 hours of overtime. This accounts for most of the difference between my salary and AGI in 2019. Over the past 10 years, I have been insulated for government shutdowns and furloughs. I understand that is not a guarantee moving forward. I have also received on average a 3.5% raise in addition to whatever COLA increases congress gives. Again, I recognize that is not something I should count on year over year. I plan on using $90K as my taxable take home pay for planning purposes. Using my 2019 return, my federal taxes were \~$14K and state taxes were $7100. I think this means I want to spend less than 2K / month on housing \[($90K-$14K-$7.1K)/3=$22.74K/year=$1.89K/month\].

&amp;#x200B;

My current rent is $990/month plus around $150/month in utilities. I rent a basement apartment in a house. It’s not the most luxurious situation but is significantly cheaper than a studio apartment in the area. The next time I have to move, I will probably move into an apartment because I’m tired of living in cold basement apartments. A studio or 1 bedroom apartment will run me between $1700-$1900 per month. Before the current pandemic, my landlord was considering selling the house. I believe that has been put on hold for at least 1 year.

&amp;#x200B;

I value having a short commute and being close to extracurricular activities I do. This constrains my geographic location for purchasing a house. I have little interest in maintaining a huge yard but would like space for wood working and work out equipment that I have. I do not think a condo will fit my needs so I am looking at town homes in the area. Having a small backyard that doesn’t require hours of maintenance is preferred. My plan would be to find a place I can comfortably afford on my own but would rent out a room or entire level for a couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

Town homes in the area are starting at $400K. The $400K are in older neighborhoods with 2 levels and no garage. Usually 3 bedroom and only 1 bath. Going that small with only 1 bathroom would make me hesitant to rent out a room. If I want to rent part of the property, I would want at least 2 full bathrooms. This pushes me closer to $475K-$500K. Given my goal of less than $2K a month on housing, and assuming I would be purchasing a $500K home, I would need to put down \~$100K. That gives me a mortgage payment of $1891, and I still didn’t include property tax (.98% - the county I'm looking in is currently at .93%. I added a conservative .05% to account for increases in the next 5 years), utilities, HOA fees (\~$450/month) and insurance (30 year, $400K mortgage @ 3.92%).

&amp;#x200B;

I have not talked to any lenders so my numbers could be way off. The NYT Rent vs. Buy calculator results were that it is better to rent for less than $1863 which is the only thing that’s making me think my numbers could be reasonable. I could sell the $114K in stocks that I have, set some money aside for taxes and use that as my down payment. If I’m not in a position to purchase a house now, I would invest that $58K back into the stock market. I also have not started looking very hard into down payment assistance programs in my area. I’m wondering if that money I’ve saved is best used to purchase a house? Dropping more than $60K of that money will be a difficult pill to swallow so I’m looking for some financial insight given my situation. Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance

&gt;This will be the biggest, airline collapse since Ansett in 2002.

investing,Todays Negative Oil is Economically Devastating,"At the height of trading today, /CLK20 hit -$40.32. This means someone was willing to pay you $40,320 per contract to take 1000 barrels deliverd. Seems great and all, everyone gets paid, you store them in your garage or whatever, but there is an underlying issue here... storage.

Generally, retail paper traders are not trading this contract, most brokerages won’t even allow you to trade the front month after last week. You would be forced to trade the forward (June) /CLM20 or later. People trading today are actual physical buyers and sellers, large companies needing to move physical oil. For it to go negative means a lot of people were on the phones calling around trying to find space to store said oil, and they couldn’t find the space for that oil, which drove the price negative just so they could unload the contract. Who cares right? 

We should all care... why? [Government has extended DoD Travel Ban to June 30](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/04/dod-to-extend-stop-movement-order-through-june-30/) so you can be sure if they are banning non essential travel through June 30 they are likely going to ban people from coming into the work place (that cube life, the resurgence of COVID)... Travel by plane and commuting to work... the two biggest reasons for oil/gas... They have been on hold for about 1.5 months and now the government is stating that they will be on hold for another 2 months at least. Now lets not even talk about heating oil needed for the northern areas coming into spring… 

You cant keep pumping oil if you have no demand for it, and you have no place to store it, although the later is more important. If you pump it, where do you put it? As I said before, to go -$40 today it means people were calling everything they could think of (container ships, tanker trucks, strategic reserve, out of the way storage facilities, etc) before they absorb a $40K loss per contract (and they sell thousands).

What must happen next, which little demand is they must idle the pumps. They cant and wont pay oil workers $100K a year to sit around with an idle pump. We have about 10M oil workers in the US. We are potentially looking at 80% of those to be laid off… and this will take months to go through existing inventory if its completely full. This will extend for months, likely into Q4 2020, even Q1 2021. 

As a result of no travel and a slow opening all commerce will suffer. We are talking a stagnant society until at least June 30. More retail, consumer goods, automobile companies are going to go bankrupt. We have an annual GDP in excess of $20T. This is grinding to a halt. FED/Govt/Treasury has thrown ~$5T at it already, but they will need to throw $2T a month at it to keep it all afloat. Factor in treasuries, credit, bonds (corps), MBS, etc and we are looking at roughly $45T to service.  This is all becoming increasingly more difficult to service with a stalled economy. This is where we are now. 

This is why its likely unsustainable and we are about to really feel the pinch. The current market with S&amp;P (/ES) trading at 2820 (was almost 2900 last week) is an artificial pump. How long will wall street look the other way while the government throws $1T here and there?",finance

The basic idea is that you are a bounty hunter and you work to complete jobs given to you by random low life’s and eventually once your reputation has grown enough, Jabba himself. You would create your character at the start using a range of different civilizations and customizations after that. The jobs which you are given can range from robbery’s to murder and everything in between. Along your path you can encounter other bounty hunters such as Cad Bane, Bossk, and Dengar. This brings me to my next point. I believe the game should be largely based on the era of the galactic republic and confederacy as its arguably the most liked period of Star Wars. This would allow for many different scenarios and jobs as this was the outer rims prospering years. One final idea to add in is that you could create the ability to play as the other bounty hunters such as Cad Band, and create a multiplayer arena where you can 1v1 other bounty hunters using your unlocked gear. This arena will have a champion who can choose to keep playing until either he leaves with his prize, or loses (a double or nothing type system). The market for buying these weapons can be on planets such as florrum and tattoine (I think I spelled that wrong). As your reputation grows you can unlock access to new markets selling better gear. Hopefully we can grow my idea and get it to some developers! Tell me if you have any more ideas!",technology

Notes about spreadsheet: I'm starting a new job next month which is why there's a huge jump in pay from 25 and 26. I got lazy calculating after 35 so I'll just assume I make the same amount from 35 to 65. My workplace has a strong union so I don't expect my estimates to be that far off from what I will really be making. I am also assuming I'll stick with the same company for the sake of simplicity. Also, my workplace matches 4% which I haven't included in the spreadsheet.

I plugged some numbers into monkeychimp's compound interest calculator, inputting current principal $14,850, annual addition $30,000, years to grow 40, interest rate 6%, and compound interest 1 time annually. It gives me a future value of 5,075,716.28. This amount of money is way more than I need, I think. Say I live to 95; that gives me $169,190 to spend every year.

Here's what I'm getting: If I take out $180,000 in loans over 3 years, then graduate with a job paying $60,000 (about the median amount attorneys make if you get rid of the outliers), then using [MIT's living wage calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06037) for Los Angeles, the cost of living would be 26,528, income tax based on [smartasset's calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) would be 10965, and monthly loan payments based on [studentaid.gov's calculator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator) would be from 344-483/month if my income grows by 2% annually. This would, if assuming the $483 payment as a constant, theoretically leave me with $22,024/year left over to pocket.  
There's no way that can be right. That makes student loans seem not bad, but that is not what I've heard about student loans. There must be something that's wrong here - either the cost of living is inaccurate, or one of the other calculators. Is there more that I'm missing here?  
Does a more accurate calculator that combines all of those calculators exist?  
I am planning on remaining single with no kids, so I don't have to worry about family planning. All my loans will be federal loans because I'm broke enough to qualify for it. There's a chance I could get jobs in the summer to pay down the total loan amount, but for safe estimation, I've just assumed that I won't get those jobs when I concluded the 180k number from tuition and fees and cost of living expenses.  
People seem to be drowning in debt from student loans, working multiple jobs and still being barely able to get by, barely affording food and rent. Either there's no way my calculations are right, or there's more to the story than what I'm aware of (maybe private loans are the problem, but federal loans are a-okay? Nope, that doesn't sound right.)  
I've talked to financial aid offices about this, but I don't exactly trust them.  
What do you think, is it worth 180k in debt for around a 40% chance of getting a job that pays 180k annually (though, more likely, getting a job paying around 60k annually), but around a 15% chance of not getting a job? Is it more worth it to go 100k in debt for another school with around a 23% chance of getting a job that pays 180k annually, but around a 30% chance of not getting a job at all? Of course, those percentages can't really be deduced because they're based on prior year employment data, and they can't really be extracted to an individual level...there's no telling how many people actually tried to get the 180k job, how many intended on not getting a job and instead continuing with school, the factors of how hard the individual worked, etc.  
  
I know it's not worth it to go to law school for the money, but I actually like this stuff. I've been working in law as a paralegal for the past few years, and I'd like to move on up to be a lawyer. I know what I'm getting myself into career-wise, I just need help knowing what I'm getting myself into financially.   
  
I also very much welcome recommendations on books, podcasts, video series, any other media that will help me learn how to budget, especially revolving around student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans Ruined My Credit Score,"I took a gap year from college almost 2 years ago, and a few months before that, I moved to a new townhome and officially changed my address on my drivers license and with the post office.  I find this important to mention because I did not know that I had to start repaying my $5500 in student loans immediately after not reenrolling in classes, and nothing came in the mail at my new address. When I was on the loan provider website today, I saw that my email address was off by one character.

The loan provider had called and left me an occasional voicemail but I just thought it was another run of the mill scammer every time I saw. I eventually answered a call from them but that wasn't until I was already 4 months behind on payments.  When I talked to the guy, they offered me payment deferment for up to one year, so I said great and took that and did not pay a dime out of pocket that day.

Now that I checked my credit report, it shows that all 4 of those months I am/was 90+ days delinquent, and that because I have both the federal sub and unsub loans, I missed 8 payments! Since this is the only thing on my credit, it has brought me down to around 530. That scared me so much I made a payment today even though the government has deferred the loan payment further.

I have learned I can mail the loan provider and plead my case, should I be sending this letter to them instead of making you all read it to beg for them to waive the late payments on good-will, or should I be talking to a student loan lawyer?",finance
personalfinance,ARM Loan Interest Rates Calculation for Fixed Rate Period,"We have been provided mortgage options from a lender.

personalfinance,Should I refinance from a 15 year loan to a 30 year loan,"So my original mortgage was a 30 year loan around 4.5% interest and about a year later I refinanced to a 15 year loan at 3.5%.  I put 20% down to avoid PMI on the initial 30 year loan. And I was able to pay off an additional 7-8% during the course of the first year paying additional amount on principal on the 30 year loan. Then I refinanced to a 15 year loan at 3.5%. obviously with 15 year loan my payments each month increase.

[15 year mortgage vs 30 year mortgage](https://youtu.be/BJ3xhjqk52A)

Banking,"I lost money I sent to a closed account, how can I get it back? (US)(MN)","Okay, so it all started April 10th (2020) when I went to pay what I thought was my Capital One CC through my boyfriend and I's shared Wells Fargo bank account. I goofed up and accidentally sent the money to his old Capital One CC, which has been closed and paid off on full. I did this Through Wells Fargo mobile app bill pay. I didn't realize I had done this until April 14th when it said on the WF app that the payment had been delivered, but I didn't see the payment on my Capital One CC app

So the saga begins. I called Wells Fargo first. They say there's nothing that they can do, Capital One has the money now. Makes sense, so I call Capital One. They say the money should be processed that evening at 8pm because that's when they do their processing. We should get the money bounced back into our account once they realize it's a closed account that it was sent to. 

So I see what happens and the next day, still nothing. I gave them a few more days because I know things are crazy right now with the rona and all. I decided I should probably call them today (April 20th) because it still wasn't there. The first guy my boyfriend and I spoke with said that they don't see the money in his (closed) account, it probably didn't go through yet because it can take 7-10 businesses days. He said I should call Wells Fargo and have them cancel the payment. So I called Wells Fargo. They said, as I thought initially, and like they said before, that no, the payment was delivered on April 14th. It is in the possession of Capital One. 

So now this is getting ridiculous and we've spent hours on hold at this point going back and forth. My boyfriend mostly spoke with the next guy at Capital One because he was just ready to get to the bottom of it and he's better at that than me. Basically the guy told him there's nothing they can do, because it was my screw up and I sent it. They can't do anything with the account because it's been closed.

I know that I screwed up and maybe there's just nothing I can do and I need to live and learn but it just doesn't seem right. Any advice on what we can do?",finance

hardware,Hardware Futurism,"Watching the [Hellblade II trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvKQ7eTGXns) for the zillionth time, I'm reminded of how far we've come. Dennard scaling or not, hardware is getting better at a ridiculous pace, and the future is packed with many possibilities. This post is a list of fundamental changes we *might* see over the next years; some are soon and inevitable, others are unlikely long-term wishes for twenty years out.

I've purposefully excluded some things from this list, like graphene computers, but I've certainly missed others, so feel free to add. **An entry on this list is not an endorsement.**

# CPUs

Desktop CPUs have been pretty sameish since Itanium died, with the cool stuff like Denver not panning out, but we're seeing some disruption from AMD and Arm.

## SMT4 (4 threads per core) goes mainstream

You're all presumably familiar with ‘8 core, 16 thread’ CPUs. SMT4 extends this to ‘8 core, 32 thread’. As cores get larger—and they will get larger—they have more spare throughput, so higher levels of SMT become more relevant. As thread counts increase, low-end CPUs might need higher SMT levels to reduce context switching overheads. There are unreliable rumours of AMD adding SMT4 to their server line a few generations out.

## Higher core counts

Core counts have [finally started rising again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Kxj9VrtUlWnVlDa9fUVlyM9U177tRWH9ZbhAZh67q0/edit?usp=sharing). Mobile has gone highly multicore, AMD has pushed it, and the 3990X has shattered the Overton window. Once programmers acclimatize, this growth will become self-fueling.

## GPU-CPU convergence

People have been calling for CPUs and GPUs to merge [almost since the GPU's inception](https://web.archive.org/web/20040617192403/http://www.beyond3d.com/interviews/sweeney04/index.php?p=4). They might have been wrong about the timescale, but the general trend held true: GPUs have evolved into general-purpose SIMD processors, and CPUs have become manycores with fast SIMD. There are important advantages in specialization, but an eventual true hybrid is not yet out of the question.

## Apple cores for laptop and desktop

Apple's phone and tablet CPUs are absurdly fast, going [almost neck-to-neck with vastly higher clocked desktop chips](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14892/the-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-max-review/4) at a fraction of the power and clocks. Rumours (and common sense) foretell Apple bringing these Arm cores to the rest of their lineup, shaking up the industry forever.

## Other Arm chips get popular

Other Arm chips may not hit Apple's performance figures, but they are starting to compete in higher core count workloads, and on a fast pace of improvement. The small size of Arm's cores is great for making cheap manycore chips that still perform well, with the Graviton2, ThunderX3, and Ampere Altra, and the Snapdragon 8cx as an early entry to the laptop market.

# Architecture

CPU architecture moves very hesitantly, but every now and again we see innovation.

## RISC-V

RISC-V is an ‘open standard’ for a CPU instruction set and architecture that has gathered steam fairly quickly. It's unlikely to trade blows with x86 any time soon, but is making inroads in the embedded and coprocessor markets, and generally represents state-of-the-art among conservative ISA designs.

## Arm SVE

SIMD, being able to operate on small arrays of data in parallel, is a major part of modern CPU's performance, and Arm's SVE is the first you're likely to use that isn't awful. Better SIMD means better compilers and happier programmers.

## Hardware capabilities

Hardware capabilities is a security model that protects memory on a fine-grained basis using unforgeable tokens stored in the program directly. It offers vastly better memory protection than traditional memory models, and has been [explored with the CHERI project on both Arm and RISC-V](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/#transition). However, it requires program-level changes to function.

## Tachyum Prodigy

Tachyum announced their new CPUs at Hot Chips 2018, and seem on track to actually produce a product. They are taking another long-needed stab at a mostly-in-order VLIW-ish CPU, aiming for passable IPC at fast clocks and peak throughput that rivals GPUs. Preliminary performance claims look good, but so far it's just marketing.

## Mill Computing

The Mill is an even more revolutionary design, with many large innovations from the core execution pipeline to multiprocessing to memory protection. [I have issues with their performance claims](https://medium.com/@veedrac/to-reinvent-the-processor-671139a4a034), but more relevant than that they're just evidently never going to ship.

# Packaging

Packaging, aka. how silicon is bundled together to make processors, is a hotbed of innovation right now.

## 3D stacked chips

DRAM and NAND flash are already 3D stacked, and this tech is coming to CPUs. Stacking logic allows for vastly denser packing of components, which is particularly important for memory access and other long-distance wiring. Intel's Foveros is a cool upcoming technology in this space. Pervasive stacking requires fundamental architectural redesigns, since it produces proportionally more heat over the same area, while making heat harder to remove.

## Wireless 3D integration

Most silicon-silicon stacks communicate with physical metal connections. An alternative is ‘inductive coupling’, the same process used in wireless charging. This has some advantages and some disadvantages, with the main advantage being price. Refer to ‘Thru-Chip Interface’, and [this Arm blog post](https://community.arm.com/developer/research/b/articles/posts/wireless-3d-integration-making-stacking-silicon-as-easy-as-stacking-lego-1-2)

## Silicon interposers

Chiplets, like used on recent AMD processors, communicate fairly slowly, at high power cost. Using silicon interposers, which can contain much denser wiring, opens up more opportunities for expansion, such as into lower power environments, bandwidth heavy workloads like GPUs, and faster memory access. Intel is pushing this with EMIB.

## MCM GPUs

These are ‘Multi-Chip Module’ GPUs, aka. GPU chiplets. Intel is bounding into this space with some of their upcoming Xe GPUs, particularly ‘Ponte Vecchio’. [NVIDIA has published research on this too.](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/ISCA_2017_MCMGPU.pdf)

## x86 big.LITTLE

Intel will soon bundle large, powerful and small, efficient cores on the same chip, a practice long used in smartphone CPUs to save power. Their first chip to do this is Lakefield.

## Silicon Photonics

Optical communication has inherent advantages for bandwidth and signal integrity. Intel (have I mentioned them a lot recently?) [have made major advances in this space](https://www.servethehome.com/hands-on-with-the-intel-co-packaged-optics-and-silicon-photonics-switch/).

## Waferscale Integration

Silicon is generally size-limited to the ‘reticle’, the maximal area that can be exposed by the lithography machine when printing a silicon chip. Waferscale integration adds patterns between these reticle-sized areas so that the whole silicon wafer can work together as a single chip. This is an old idea, but it's always been hard.

# AI hardware

Machine learning has made AI a big deal, and neural networks are amiable to very particular hardware innovations. There is so much in this space that I selected only the most innovative approaches.

## Cerebras

Following from the previous topic, Cerebras have made a waferscale machine learning accelerator, with 18 GB of SRAM and other insane specifications. Their chip is model parallel, which means a neural net is spread physically out over the chip, more like an FPGA than a CPU. Cerebras have shipped to select partners.

## Groq Tensor Streaming Processor

Groq is a lesser-known AI hardware startup with an incredibly innovative approach and impressive performance numbers. See [The Linley Group's report](https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Groq-Rocks-NNs-Linley-Group-MPR-2020Jan06.pdf) for details. Groq's chips are available for cloud use for select partners.

## Mythic.AI

AI is largely a matrix multiplication problem; Mythic approaches this by using analogue operations directly on NAND storage, which makes for good power/performance with much higher memory density than SRAM or even DRAM products. Mythic.AI has not yet shipped.

## Vathys

Vathys tackles the memory problem by using 3D stacked memory with wireless integration, custom memory cells, and custom asynchronous logic. [Watch their 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nSn0JhZX18) for details.

## Alibaba HanGuang

We know almost nothing about Alibaba's chip, but it is included here because of its unusually high performance claims. If it's legit, it's doing something clever... but keep the emphasis on ‘if’.

# Memory

With DRAM scaling dying, there is a lot of activity in new memory technologies, above an already innovative baseline.

## Zoned Namespace SSDs

Current storage standards do not map cleanly to SSD hardware. ZNS is an upcoming standard that exposes storage as sequentially-writable blocks of memory. This allows SSDs to reduce overprovisioning and include less DRAM and cheaper controllers, while offering greater performance and endurance. Using these SSDs does require software support from the file systems and databases running on them.

## 3D XPoint DIMMs (‘DC Persistent Memory’)

People are rightly unenthusiastic about current Optane SSDs, but consumer support for Optane DIMMs, which offer near-DRAM performance at potentially a much better price per bit, with support for non-volatile regions, should change that. Next-generation Optane has twice the layers, so twice the capacity. Intel is still subsidising Optane with Xeon sales for now. Micron will also enter the 3D XPoint market soon, though their plans around DIMMs are unclear.

## DDR5

Next-generation memory has a few great features, but the headline features are double the capacity and much higher speeds; SK Hynix claiming they're working on as high as DDR5-8400. DDR5 will also have support for on-die ECC.

## NVRAM

An addendum to the DDR5 standard, NVRAM adds support for non-volatile memory for technology with near-DRAM characteristics. This does not include Optane, which is not quite fast enough without a DRAM caching layer. NVRAM also includes support for much higher capacities than stock DDR5. I won't cover all the NVRAM contenders, just the most interesting two.

## Persistent DIMM filesystems and databases

New software is needed to most effectively use Optane DIMMs and NVRAM, since they offer byte-sized accesses and vastly lower latency than even the fastest SSDs. Filesystems can also support DAX, which allows files to be mapped directly into process memory, using the underlying persistence of the storage, with no overhead.

## Nantero NRAM

NRAM is carbon nanotube memory, using them as physical switches that can be toggled with electrical fields, all roughly as fast as DRAM but without the scalability issues of capacitors, and in a manner that is fully non-volatile. They have given very aggressive performance targets, such as aiming to fully replace DRAM, and perhaps later even expand into embedded caches.

## Spin technologies

Produced (currently in small quantities) by Everspin, these various spin-based memories are based on polarized magnetic fields. They are applicable to both NVRAM applications and embedded caches.

## CXL, Gen-Z

These are next-gen standards for interconnects, both local to memory and accelerators (CXL), and at a larger rack-scale (Gen-Z), offering support for coherent accesses.

## In-memory compute

Since NAND flash and DRAM accesses are much slower than local memory accesses from cache, people have long wished to be able to do computation in memory directly. A recent attempt is by UPMEM, that offers DIMMs with integrated processors with very high aggregate throughput. Mythic.AI also attempts to do neural network calculations inside flash memory. Personally, I expect UPMEM will be fighting an uphill battle, but Mythic.AI's approach seems like an applicable niche if sufficiently performant.

# Graphics

Graphics is always pushing the forefront of technology; this is the largest section.

## Xe Graphics

Intel is entering the discrete GPU market soon. If nothing else, this should help the market's competitiveness. They are going to use MCM GPUs, at least in the high end, with Ponte Vecchio connecting either 16 or 32 chiplets in a single GPU (with 6 GPUs to a board!). Initial performance numbers from their lowest-end cards seem unimpressive, but that could be an early-hardware issue.

## Next-gen consoles

The Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been announced, with very impressive performance numbers for both their GPUs and CPU, with fast SSDs to boot. Game graphics take a leap when consoles do, so the downstream effects should be significant.

## Other next-gen GPUs

There isn't much to say about next-generation GPUs except that the rumours are dealing with big numbers, like 50% performance uplifts.

## Hardware decompression

Consoles have hardware decompression to maximize asset streaming bandwidth in games. Specialized hardware didn't make much sense for desktop processors when storage speed was low (just do it in software), and on-SSD compression (which used to be a thing) has issues, but dedicated decompression accelerators now make sense for many desktop markets, and would certainly help games.

## Sampler Feedback Streaming

This technique allows for fast, efficient, and live streaming of texture detail from the SSD to the GPU as texture data is needed. [I've written about this in detail.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/fx0bbj/sampler_feedback_streaming_how_games_will_use/)

## Mesh shading

The Geometry Pipeline is dead, long live the Geometry Pipeline!

Mesh shading replaces the standard geometry pipeline with a largely software based implementation, allowing for mesh(let) compression, better culling, and better LOD implementations, and presumably a whole lot more once people get used to it. I believe this is the same thing as the PS5's Geometry Engine.

## Next-gen DLSS

DLSS 2.0 is an image upscaling algorithm using temporal supersampling, aka. collecting pixel data over multiple frames. It shows very good results with high detail and very low aliasing, and practically doubles a GPU's effective performance. AI is getting better very fast, and version 2.0 is only the second step.

### Frame rate upscaling

Frame rate upscaling allows rendering at one frame rate and adding generated intermediates either between or after the true frames, depending on where one sits on the quality-latency trade-off. As AI accelerators can be made very fast, this is likely cheaper than truly rendering all those intermediate frames, and AI frame rate upscaling is likely to have significantly less artefacting than traditional algorithmic methods.

### AI graphics enhancement

If you've been following NVIDIA's GAN papers, like StyleGAN 2, you'll know that they are [unfairly good at generating images](https://veedrac.github.io/stylegan2-real-or-fake/game.html). Eventually these techniques will allow live improvements of either textures or full video game frames. This won't happen tomorrow, but it is clear NVIDIA thinks AI graphics is the future.

## Foveated rendering

The human eye has a very small sweet spot, outside of which we have low sensitivity to detail. With an eye tracker and a sufficient refresh rate, the computer can render at high detail only those areas of the screen that are viewed directly, with other areas rendered at low detail. Artefact-free upscaling methods, such as AI-based approaches, are needed to avoid negative impacts.

## Texture-Space Shading

TSS has been done before, but Sampler Feedback is needed to make it efficient. Instead of rendering pixels at the screen, the textures of the viewed triangles are rendered on the object mesh from the camera perspective. This reduces artefacts like flickering, and has several extra gains, which I've split out into the next few points.

### Asynchronous shading

With TSS, it is possible to render the pixels to the mesh at one ‘shading rate’ and resolution, and *rasterize* this to an image at a greater frame rate and resolution. These lower texture rates and resolutions are less visible than screen-space effects, since the triangle mesh is preserved at full fidelity. Further, meshlets may be shaded at rates depending on specularity, rotational velocity, or movement of a light source, with resolutions depending on other variables. Different properties of a texture might even be rendered at different rates.

### TSS &amp; Virtual Reality

TSS has two primary advantages for VR environments. First, both eyes can reuse all or some shaded texels. Second, texture-space foveated rendering will probably have fewer artefacts than traditional downscaling approaches.

### Texture-Space DLSS and interpolation

This is purely conjecture, but I suspect that with the easy accessibility of mipmaps and the reduced artefacting of TSS, performing AI upscaling and frame rate interpolation (for specularity) on textures directly will produce better output than screen-space approaches.

## Simulations in games

With consoles having faster multicore CPUs, and desktop CPUs going as high as 64 cores, more physics simulations will become practical in games. A 64 core CPU has a *lot* of headroom, should they come down in price over the next decade.

# Human-Computer Interaction

Monitors and input devices don't change all that quickly, but we also get more media attention on longer timescale developments, like MicroLED, lightfields, and brain-computer interfaces.

## OLED monitors

OLED has vastly superior colour and switching speeds to LCD. Samsung has reportedly exited the LCD business to focus fully on OLED displays. OLED so far has had limited impact on monitors due to its susceptibility to burn-in, but advances like Quantum Dot OLED displays, which use mono-blue OLED pixels, somewhat reduce susceptibility to burn-in.

## Dual-layer LCDs

LCDs suffer from low contrast due to light leakage. Dual-layer LCDs greatly reduce light leakage by stacking two LCD filters over a standard backlight, with only the top layer screen running at full resolution. This closes the image quality gap between LCDs and OLED using the cheaper panels of the two.

## MicroLED

MicroLED is an inorganic variant of OLED, generally with no susceptibility to burn-in and much higher supported peak brightness, and potentially even better black levels. MicroLEDs can be fabricated fairly efficiently, but it is currently very challenging to embed these into usable panels at affordable prices. However, it seems to be the future of displays, and is under very active R&amp;D. AMQLED is another inorganic emissive LED technology using quantum dots competing in this space.

## MicroLED-on-wafer displays

MicroLEDs are expensive to pick-and-place, but can be fabricated at very high densities with traditional semiconductor processes. In some applications, small, incredibly high density displays are actually superior, such as VR and AR, and microLED has a much easier entry to that market. [JBD have the most impressive demos of this:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52ogQS6QKxc) up to 2 million nits, 5000x4000 resolution, 10,000 dpi, at 1,000 Hz, all in displays that weigh a gram or less. Properly calibrated full-colour displays are WIP, but the promise is clear. You can also print OLEDs on silicon, termed Si-OLED, with similar density.

## CLEARink

CLEARink is an ePaper-like ink-based reflective display, but structured like an LCD, built in a modified LCD fab. They support colour using a filter, have better contrast than ePaper, and can make both bistable and (moderately) high-refresh rate panels.

## Advanced Color ePaper

We've had colour ePaper for a while using colour filters, but traction has been limited in consumer markets because of the reduced contrast. E Ink have figured out how to provide colour ePaper without a colour filter, by putting all coloured pigments in every pixel.

## Lightfield cameras and displays

Lightfields capture the full field of light over a plane, capturing all views at all angles of a scene. A simplified problem exists for VR, where a lightfield display only needs to handle all focal planes. Various approaches exist to tackle this, such as stacking a few projections in each focal plane, or using microlens arrays over ultra-dense backing displays.

## EMG interfaces

Oculus recently bought CTRL-labs, producers of a supposedly high-fidelity EMG device that reads neuron signals to the hand from a device strapped around the wrist, allowing reconstruction of muscle movements, with more bandwidth than from traditional controller based approaches. CTRL-labs have shown people typing with this hardware.

## Neural interfaces

Going to the extremes, Neuralink is looking to insert physical neuron detectors directly into the brain. [Watch their launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-vbh3t7WVI) or [read their paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703801v1) for details. This is a consumerization of technology that has been proofed out in universities, and we're at the point where it's moving from questions of possibility to questions of feasibility.

## Next-gen VR

We don't know anything about next-gen VR specifically, but VR will eventually become the endgame for interactive experiences, and it is all a question of refinement. Keep an eye out for this.

# Circuitry

The fundamental backbone of computational advances, and one of the most advanced tasks mankind has tackled, this section covers both short- and long-term advances in this space.

## New process nodes

TSMC's 5nm and 3nm, Intel's 10nm+ (aka. ‘working 10nm’) and 7nm, and perhaps Samsung's future nodes too, all represent important steps forward for the industry. There's not much to say specifically about these, except that it looks optimistically like we'll stay on a good cadence until at least TSMC 3nm, and Intel's 7nm should bring fresh competition to the market.

## Nano OPS

Nano OPS is a replacement for much of the established semiconductor fabrication pipeline, excluding lithography. They claim it costs one to two orders of magnitude less, supports a greater variety of materials, and comes at no loss to fidelity. They ‘just finished the qualification [...] with a $35B US electronics company’ (presumably Micron) and are ‘working on the equipment that would go into their fabs’. If true, this would legitimately revolutionize the industry. [Here's an interview with their CTO.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNE3F3Z_9M)

## AI hardware optimization

AI is well suited to several aspects of circuit design optimization, particularly during place and route. [Google has just released a paper on this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10746), showing results better than manually optimized layouts.

## Quantum

Quantum has had recent breakthroughs, particularly from Google and IBM, who both have 53 bit quantum computers. We are a long way from practical applications, and they are more limited than most of the public understands, but they truly represent cutting-edge physics and the effort to build them is sincere.

## New structures and materials

Upcoming process nodes are introducing new techniques and materials, like nanowires and germanium. [See semiengineering.com to gain insight.](https://semiengineering.com/category-main-page-manufacturing/)

## Vacuum-Channel Transistors

Affordable nanoscale fabrication has sparked investigation of vacuum channel transistors—the same technology used in vacuum tubes. At sufficiently small scales, the downsides of vacuum channels (such as power, and surprisingly also the need to pull a vacuum) significantly reduce, and vacuum channels are otherwise extremely efficient electron carriers, allowing for much higher switching rates than semiconductors. This technology is in very early prototype stages, so don't hold your breath.

## Asynchronous Logic

The clock signal is a surprisingly power hungry aspect of modern chips, and acts as a performance limiter. Asynchronous logic tracks its own readiness, removing the need for a clock signal. Asynchronous logic has a lot of problems, some of which are integral to the technology—it costs wires to keep track of readiness—and some of which is simply an issue of tooling, but it has long been an area of curiosity with occasional experimentation by both academia and major industry players.

## Optical computing

Light has several theoretical advantages over electricity, so there is continual interest in using it for computations directly. The best early progress has been in using light for matrix multiplication for AI applications.

## Integrated FPGAs

FPGAs are much faster at a subset of computations than CPUs are. Several companies have experimented with CPU-FPGA hybrids, like Intel's Xeon Scalable Gold 6138P. It is likely these products stay niché.

## Superconducting computing

Superconducting circuits can operate at vastly better frequencies with a fraction of the power cost per computation (though it takes some work to keep them cool). Superconducting circuits do exist for very specific use-cases, at very limited scale.

## Reversible computing

Unlikely to be relevant for a long while, eventually computing may hit something called Landauer's principle, which gives the theoretical lower limit for energy consumption by computations—this is still millions of times less energy than currently used by computers. Landauer's limit can only be avoided with logically reversible computing, which preserves information needed to undo the computation.

# Other

Here are a few more things of potential importance.

## Starlink

SpaceX is putting satellites in low earth orbit to serve high-bandwidth internet, globally, at better-than-fibre latency. This will have a major impact on the global internet, both in terms of service accessibility to the underserved, and reducing some long haul latencies as much as a factor of two. If SpaceX's Starship rocket pans out, space tech is likely to become very significant.

## Fuchsia

Not quite hardware, but still subreddit-relevant, Fuchsia is a truly new operating system by Google. Unlike Android, it is not based on Linux. Fuchsia does a lot of things right, such as its security model, and is making steady progress.

## Better batteries

Battery technology doesn't improve as fast as silicon, but it does improve, regardless of how bitter people are that a battery made in a university lab from an article in 2015 hasn't made product yet. Solid state batteries look to be starting production ramp, with expectations of mass production this decade. Tesla has a Battery Day soon, where they should make their own outlandish claims about the future.

## Off-topic bonus: Fusion

Fusion power research has recently had a renaissance, with lots of new companies entering the space. These aren't your old many-billion ITER projects; new technology has made the problem far more tractable. Designs based on high temperature superconductors came into prominence in 2015, with MIT's ARC; you can learn about this approach [from this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4). First Light Fusion is another challenger, attempting an interesting take on inertial fusion using specially-shaped pellets.",technology
stocks,The problem with infinite intervention would be that the dollar would lose usefulness as a valuation tool,"Much has been said about the Fed and its infinite money supply. Some people think it will lead to hiperinflation and some think that it will avoid a downfall of stock prices and that this is it. Everyone might be a little right and a little wrong with this but the main thing is that infinite intervention would be worst for the US than letting some stocks fall to zero.

Infinite price intervention would mean that you could no longer assess the price of a company stock in terms of its future capacity to generate earnings and this would lead to dollar price not being useful for this valuation nor any other. Then sooner or later a powerful figure would demand to pay an asset in a different currency because he wants a sure way to know its exact valuation with a calculation that is not arbritrary but based on something unmistakable, not manipulable, and not dependent on what an institution will or will not decide to do next week. The fact that this currency has United States Dollar printed on it would be not enough if the USA acted like a socialist country and didn't allow market price freedom.

Conclusion: Fed's capacity to influence price is absolutely limited and companies that do not produce earnings are vulnerable to cease existing as they always have been.",finance

--------------------------------

**Both the Federal Reserve Act and the recent CARES Act places very clear restrictions on the types of assets that the Federal Reserve can purchase, and the conditions that must be satisfied in order to purchase them.** Congress went so far as to include a section in CARES to emphasize these requirements “for the avoidance of doubt.”

Put simply, **Fed purchases under the Federal Reserve Act are restricted to assets that are explicitly guaranteed as to interest and principal by the U.S. government, or that has a claim to sufficient collateral to avoid losses to the public.**

The securities that the Federal Reserve is legally allowed to purchase are:

a) Section 14 open market purchases of securities that are fully guaranteed as to interest and principal by the U.S. government or a foreign government;

b) Section 14 purchases of “commercial bills of exchange” arising out of commercial transactions. What are those? See the definition in Section 13(2), which defines commercial bills of exchange exactly as they’re commonly understood: arising out of commercial transactions, secured by agricultural products, goods, or merchandise, with a maturity of less than 90 days, and specifically prohibited from “covering merely investments, or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading stocks, bonds, or other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the government of the United States.”

c) Section 13(2) discounting (i.e. prepayment) of commercial, agricultural, and industrial paper (again, bills of exchange);

d) Section 13(3) emergency lending to individuals, partnerships, and corporations, restricted to discounting notes, drafts and bills of exchange, and contingent on collateral (“security”). Section 13(3) also requires that these activities must be for “the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system, and not to aid a failing financial company, and that the security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses.”

e) Section 13(4) and 13(6) lending for payment of sight drafts for agricultural transactions, and bankers acceptances which typically arise out of merchandise transactions.

That’s it. **The menu is very specific: either government securities, or those that are backed by a pledge of collateral “sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses.”** This principle is consistent with the U.S. Constitution: only Congress has fiscal authority. The Federal Reserve does not. If this is not taken seriously, the Fed could purchase whatever security it wished, at whatever valuation it might choose, and the American public would be on the hook for any losses.

**On April 9, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the “Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility” (SMCCF), that would leverage $75 billion of CARES funding from the U.S. Treasury to buy as much as $750 billion of corporate debt and ETFs.**

**The initial allocation from the Treasury covers $50 billion for “primary” lending (directly to companies), and $25 billion for “secondary market purchases” of outstanding corporate bonds from investors. That Treasury funding is fine. Congress allocated the $75 billion in Treasury funds as part of the CARES Act. Every dollar provided by the Treasury acts as a Federal guarantee for the equivalent amount of corporate obligations that the Federal Reserve purchases.**

**The problem is that the Fed intends to leverage these funds 10-to-1 without taking actual collateral pledges from the underlying companies. This exposes the public to outright losses in the event that declining market prices or corporate defaults reduce the value of these bonds by even 10%.**

As a result, the newly created SMCCF is either a Ponzi scheme at public expense (if the Fed plans to allow portfolio losses to exceed 10%) or a 1987-style portfolio insurance scheme (if the Fed plans to liquidate securities into a falling market in order to cap its losses at 10%). **Section 13(3) requires updates every 30 days on the “value of collateral” – that’s going to be an interesting dance if we break the March lows. In any event, even here, the SMCCF is already illegal.**

**Uncollateralized junk bonds are being treated as their own collateral.**

What makes this so brazen is that when Congress approved the CARES Act, it wrote the terms and conditions section like a children’s book, “for the avoidance of doubt” – to prevent exactly this sort of abuse of public funds. Specifically, here is section 4003(c)(3)(B), which limits how the $500 billion of 4003(b)(4) funding provided for businesses, states, and municipalities may be used:

**4003(c)(3)(B) FEDERAL RESERVE ACT TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS APPLY. – For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable requirements under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including requirements relating to loan collateralization, taxpayer protection, and borrower solvency, shall apply with respect to any program or facility described in subsection (b)(4).**

CARES Act Section 4003 and Federal Reserve restrictions (violated)

**Has the Federal Reserve taken collateral pledges from the companies underlying these “loans”? Has the Federal Reserve ensured that “the security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses”? Nope.**

**Instead, what’s going on here is that the Fed is treating the SMCCF as if it is a “business” in itself. It is then treating the corporate bonds and ETFs purchased by that vehicle as if those unsecured bonds are the “collateral.”**

**Yes, that’s right. Uncollateralized junk bonds are being treated as their own collateral.**

Of course, that’s also why **Section 13(2) of the Federal Reserve Act was written to prevent this sort of thing, prohibiting discounting of corporate securities “covering merely investments, or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading stocks, bonds, or other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the government of the United States.”**

The whole operation is a hand-waving attempt to the purchase of assets that are wholly rejected by the provisions of 13(3), and may ultimately be impossible to close without a loss to the Fed, which is a loss to the public, which is fiscal policy, which belongs to Congress, not the Fed.

Again, it’s fine for the Federal Reserve to use the $75 billion of Treasury funding as “collateral“ that confers a federal guarantee on $75 billion of corporate loans and security purchases. Those funds are part of the amount that Congress, in its singular constitutional role, has allocated for public support for corporate lending.

**In contrast, additional purchases to “leverage” that funding are neither secured by non-financial collateral, nor have security sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses. They are illegal, both under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, and under Section 4003(c)(3)(B) of the CARES act, which “for the avoidance of doubt” specifically invokes 13(3) “requirements relating to loan collateralization, taxpayer protection, and borrower solvency.”**

The newly created SMCCF is either a Ponzi scheme at public expense (if the Fed plans to allow potential portfolio losses to exceed 10%) or a 1987-style portfolio insurance scheme (if the Fed plans to liquidate securities into a falling market in order to cap its losses at 10%).",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Graduate program and moving expenses,"Hi all.
I got accepted into a doctorate program in psychology. This has been my dream for a while, and I am so excited to do this. Problem is, it’s expensive. More expensive than even I expected, and I have spent the last 8 or so years trying to prepare myself for how expensive it was going to be. 

I am incredibly lucky and grateful to my parents that I have no undergraduate debt, which is a huge relief. 

I am two years removed from undergrad, and I have been working a slightly above minimum wage job for those two years. It covers my rent and expenses, and allows me to save a little bit. I’ll have about 4K saved by the time classes start in September.

I have to move to DC to start this school, and I currently live about 4 hours away. Yes, I know DC is a very expensive city. I don’t plan to live directly in the city, the school provides us with deeply discounted access to the DC metro and I have a car, so commuting is not a problem, although it is an additional expense to consider. 

My boyfriend moved in with me last month, which has cut my rent in half, which is nice. He also works a minimum wage job, but has a lot saved. He is looking for jobs in the DC area to move with me, which would also mean split rent. 

I was just awarded a federal loan of $33,000 for the first year of classes (fall 2020-spring 2021). After talking with the financial aide department at the school, that amount will cover all but about $2,000 of the money for the semester. My parents have also graciously promised me 10k a year to help cover everything. 

My job has switched me to working remotely given the pandemic, and there is a possibility that I may be able to continue working remotely for them part time after I move. This would be ideal, but otherwise I would find part time work (I don’t relish the idea of having to find decent paying part time work that fits with my weird grad school schedule in the middle of a pandemic, but I will do what I can). 

Essentially my question is- I’m freaking out at the prospect of moving to a new city to start a 5 year program that’s going to end with over $100,000 of debt. I know there are hidden expenses and fees that I can’t see or think of right now. Am I crazy to do this? Are there other things to consider that I’m missing? This is my dream, but is it unattainable? Should I wait? Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Roth or Traditional 401K,"I've been looking more into changing my contribution method to my company-sponsored 401K. Here's some backgroud:

Age - 23

Salary- $61K (Started July of 2019)

Debt- $21K for federal student loans

Company matches at 90¢ for each $1 up to 5%. I contribute 8% via Roth.

I started contributing to this 401K as soon as I could, and have built a 6-month emergency fund. I also make at least the minimum payment for my student loans, sometimes more. I feel positive my income will be higher, especially as I just started in my career, so this has made me lean Roth. However, I plan on opening a Roth IRA soon (Wanted to get emergency fund started up first), so then I'm thinking Traditional 401K. Is it smart to open the IRA now, given the current uncertainties. My job feels stable, though there have been talks of furlough. As of now, income and job security are set.

Thanks for any advice!

personalfinance,Trading in my 2014 for a 2020. Help!,"My husband and I bought our 2014 Ford Fiesta from a Ford dealer last year. A year ago in May. It had 44k miles on it. Both of us had bad credit, so our interest rate is nearly 24%. We pay $340 a month and because our payment rate is 100%, both of our credit scores are now in the mid 600 range. (Mine was 436 when we applied last year)

Two days after buying the Fiesta, the transmission needed a new clutch. They replaced it and a week later, I had my car back. Since then I have called three different times with the same transmission worries and issues but I get the run around about how it’s the “dual shift transmission” and “normal”. We were driving a few days ago and got the message in the screen saying the transmission was too hot and to pull over. The fuck? This car is too new to be having issues like this. Especially after being fixed already. Come to find out, there is a HUGE class action lawsuit regarding my car’s transmission. 

We went to the dealership and told them we are DONE with this car. The salesman told us that we’d be best off in a 2020 vehicle because of all the incentives and they could bring our interest rate from the 24% down to 6-7% and our payment would be only about $60 more. We’d also have the lifetime power train warranty among many other perks if we trade in this shitty Fiesta we are drowning in interest over.

Trading,If You Don't Have the Means to Properly Store Crude You Have No Business Buying the Commodity,"Newbies, stop asking about buying crude.  This is not your golden opportunity.  There is a reason nobody wants to take it.  If it were as simple as buying some land and letting the barrels sit in a field, oil companies would have done that already.  

The truth of the matter is that storing crude oil is subject to a litany of federal, state, and local regulations that require you to build infrastructure to mitigate the effects of any spills that may occur, such as impervious walls, culverts, retention ponds, etc.  This infrastructure requires extensive planning, regulatory approvals, and millions of dollars of investment.

If you store crude improperly and wind up spilling thousands of gallons into the ground, you risk poisoning the local water supply for years or decades to come, as well as costing the government millions of taxpayer dollars to clean it up.

So please, stop asking about buying crude.  If you don't already own and operate a crude oil refining business, you have no business accepting delivery of it.  I invite you to enjoy your fines, if you do.

There's no such thing as a free lunch.

My parents have been casual house hunting, but the recent fall in interest rates have made them a bit more serious. They would like to rent our current home, and move into a new, bigger home.

Our current home has a 15 year fixed (3%). We have approximately 30% of the house value to pay off in our mortgage. The house has also experienced ~$100K in growth since we purchased (2012 purchase). We would like to do a cash-out refinance so we can get what we have paid into the mortgage, and some of the appreciation. This house would then be rented out. With approximate rent calculated in our neighborhood, we would be around $300 ahead per month after all expenses. Houses that have shown up for rent have gotten rented out in under 2 weeks. Lot of neighbors have moved out and rented, so definitely familiar with what is going on in our neighborhood.

The appreciation and down payment we could do on a new house would be primarily from the cash-out refinance and appreciation. That would cover around 40% down payment. We would do a 30 year fixed on the new home. Our monthly payments would be well below 20% of monthly take-home.

He  told  me  that  there  would  have been  a possible  deflation scenario  before  the inflation would  take in,  and  he made me  this  example  to let me  understand. Could you tell me  if  he's wrong  or   right and  why?

*The simplest analogy to explain it is (that misses a lot of complexity) that monetary base is the amount of bricks which someone has to build with, and the price level is the height of the tower which he can build from them.*

*With a given number of bricks, and the rules of the game, times of stability allow for the gradual building of taller and taller towers*

*When some shock happens and the tower topples (or it topples under its own lack of structural integrity), doubling the amount of bricks available to the builder won't allow him to immediately build a higher tower. In the short timespan available to him, he'll probably be able to build something just as tall, but a fair bit fatter.*

*Eventually, once things are seemingly stable and no shocks are foreseen, he can strip the tower down in width and build it up to being twice as high as the previous tower.*",finance

I have the money to pay the total, but I know you can negotiate terms with these companies.  So I have a few quick questions to help guide me:

\- Is there any downside to negotiating a compromise with a debt collection company? What number should I even argue for out of the total?

\- Any advice for negotiating with the collections company?  I know they're probably eager to close the debt contract,especially right now.

\- After everything is settled, how long should I be waiting for the derogatory mark to be removed?  Is there anyway to remove it immediately after settlement (them or a credit company maybe?)

\- Any questions I should be asking that I haven't thought of yet?  Or alternative options?

I think I know the answer, but here's how it reads (not sure what parts of this are relevant, so I'll simply post the entire text):


**Claiming children as dependents on tax forms:   the parties have the right to claim the children on their tax forms as follows: every year (ex-wife) has the right to claim (child one) and (child two).  For tax years where a non-custodial parent has the right to claim the children, the parents must cooperate to fill out and submit IRS form 8332 in a timely manner.**

**The parents are designated joint custodians of the children solely for the purposes of state and federal statues which require designation or determination of custody.  If only one parent can be named custodian, it shall be the mother in even-numbered years and the father in odd-numbered years.  This designation shall not change the parenting rights and responsibilities described in this plan.  Washington state law generally refers to parenting time and decision-making rather than custody.  However, some state and federal laws require that one person be named the custodian.  The custodian is the person with whom the children are scheduled to reside the majority of the time.**

personalfinance,"I'm a first time home buyer that was pre-approved for a mortgage, but I'm not sure what I need to do","Hey r/PersonalFinance,

My wife and I (both 31) have been living in a small 2Bd/1Ba apartment in rural AL for several years now. When we first moved in, it was great, but nowadays our living situation has drastically changed. We have basically outgrown the place. Regardless of how we handle things, we are definitely moving out when our lease is up in October/November - preferably we want to buy instead of rent. We currently have $5,500 set aside in a savings account for moving/housing expenses. Beginning next month, we will be stashing a minimum of $500 a month into this savings account and should have around $8000\~ when it is time to move. Potentially $10,000\~ if we begin to save aggressively.

I was pre-qualified for a $120,000 mortgage (Note: Our budget is in the $80k-$100k range - We have no intentions of buying a $120,000 house) by a local bank. I am starting to get bad vibes about the conversations I had with the bank's mortgage servicer and it gets worse the more I play it back in my head.

For example, the bank kept pushing a conventional mortage with a 5% down payment plus closing costs and telling me to disregard any other mortgage types, citing federal rates ""are not in a good place right now"". When I asked for more information about those comments, they would just redirect me to the conventional mortage option. I also mentioned that this is my first time buying a home, but they did not seem phased by that. I'm not sure if that's odd or not - I have always been told that there were various programs available to help first time home buyers purchase their first home. They were also trying to give me credit advice such as closing out credit cards that I no longer use monthly to ""maybe get your interest rate down .5% by the time you are ready to move."" I have several credit cards - most carry a zero balance and one carries a small balance ($250\~) with zero interest financing. My ""daily drivers"" are used for expenses like gas, recurring subscriptions (Netflix, etc.), and miscellaneous work related expenses. They are paid off each month. I have one credit card that I foolishly cosigned for a family member - they maxed it out and left me with the bill. I already know that was mistake, but I was trying to give that family member an opportunity to build their credit but it backfired on me. It is currently sitting at around $860 which is a little under 70% utilization for that card. It is the only card that accrues interest monthly right now. My net credit card utilization is around 9%.

After speaking to a friend who has bought and sold homes in the past, he believes there are a lot of red flags with my experience with the bank. Specifically, he told me that it is unlikely that I would have to pay closing costs because the seller usually offers to pay closing costs to incentivize a sale. In addition, he said I should be able to get a down payment of 3.5% since I was buying a home for the first time.

Basically, I am wondering if there is anything that I need to do. I understand that mortgage companies have an axe to grind, but I didn't feel like this particular lender cared what my needs were. It felt like they were trying to push me to take out a mortgage that is not a good fit for me. 

My gut reaction to all of this is to look into another lender, so I thought that I would come here to see if anyone had advice or resources for me to look into before I do so. I feel like I need to be better prepared.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage pre-approval while student loans are in forbearance?,"Hi friends. I got pre-approved for a mortgage before corona virus happened. Long story short, it was a shit show to get approved with my student loans because I went to law school and that's expensive as all get out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With corona virus being a global pandemic and so many people being out of work, Trump put all federal student loans into forbearance until September. Essentially, my understanding is that that means no payments have to be made until September. My loans have been in repayment since November 2019, but my payments are income driven, and since my 2018 taxes showed such low income (because I was a full time student) my income driven repayment amounts are $0 a month until November 2020. So the forbearance does not affect me much in that aspect. 

&amp;#x200B;

My confusion is, my loan provider indicated to me that pre-approvals for mortgages are generally not given when loans are in forbearance. The reason for that is when they are in forbearance, they have to use 1% of your total debt as an example of a monthly payment for those loans (which for most lawyers, myself included, is about $2,000 a month). I was able to get pre-approved because she was able to use my income driven repayment price of $0 a month, not a $2,000 a month payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I suppose my question is as follows: if I put in an offer with my current pre-approval before it expires (June 5th), what are the odds that the final approval from the under writer is denied because my loans are now in forbearance? The forbearance is at no fault of my own, as it was federally mandated. But that appears to not matter to the loan providers as they just denied a friend in a similar situation a pre-approval for the forbearance.

personalfinance,Need some advice about an extra car loan I have out,"Hey all, 

I'm looking for some advice on what I should do in my particular situation. Bear with me as I am trying to organize my thoughts here as I type =)

I have a car that I am trying to off (an extra car), it's a nice, newer car (2017 Subaru) but I owe a little more on it than it's worth (which is no big deal); but the issue is, I cannot seem to get it sold! I have gotten several offers from dealerships which are always major low ball offers, and with the whole covid19 thing, the offers have gotten even worse. I owe roughly 16k on this car, and I have about 3-4k cash tops to put down on it to get it sold because I owe basically what it retails for on Nadaguides, and we all know dealers wont offer near that value. 

The problem is these dealers are offering me well below rough trade in value on this car (which is in great shape), And I don't have the extra cash to make up the difference (which is usually $6000-7000 after their shitty offer) 

I can afford to keep this car, but I'd rather not. It's an extra $530 a month between the payment and insurance, and I don't drive it so I'd love to get rid of it, I stupidly bought the car I wanted about a month ago and am driving that, because I assumed I'd more easily be able to get rid of this extra car.

 I don't have great credit but it's coming up pretty quickly, it was complete crap when I bought the car last year so I got a bad interest rate on it and my payments aren't putting much towards the principal. 

My question is, my high useage on my Credit cards are close to the only thing keeping my credit down at the moment so, should I just put my $3-4k down on the loan and just keep paying the car off until I can sell it to a dealer or otherwise?  

Or should I put my money down on my credit cards, and hope that my credit goes up high enough so that I can refinance the car and get a much lower payment? 

Or is there any other advice I should listen to? 

Again, I'm not like breaking myself owning this extra car, BUT, my wife recently was furloughed from coronavirus, so the extra money I could save every month getting rid of this car would be fantastic.

personalfinance,Mortgage Lender Willing to Cover Lending Fees - Too Good to Be True?,"Hi Everyone,

I am in the market to refinance my mortgage. I am speaking with my current lender (Chase), and I was informed that I can refinance at a lower interest rate than what I am currently paying **and** lender is also willing to cover all the  fees (almost $3,000). When I asked for the APR of the loan, he said that since the bank is covering all the fees, the interest rate and the APR are the same.

I find this too good to be true, and was wondering how I could possibly be making a mistake here? I looked at one other lender, and I would have to pay them lender $3,000 upfront for an APR that is lower by only 0.03%. Maybe that difference is enough to make it worth Chase's while, but even then, if no money is coming out of my pocket, isn't this essentially risk-free? If I sign with Chase today, and tomorrow I find that I could have gotten an even better rate, can I just refinance again with no downside? I must be missing something - banks don't just give money for the goodness of their hearts.  


\[Edit\]

Interest Rate (and APR) offered by Chase: 3.375%

LTV: 80%

This [Data](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) is used. I am using a custom data generator and processing audio files to mel spectrograms and then feeding it to the network.

1. Four CNN blocks (Conv2D, BatchNormalization, ELU, MaxPool2D, Dropout) + one RNN block (2 GRU layers) 
2. Loss : Categorical Cross entropy
3. Metrics: accuracy
4. Optimizer : Adam
5. epochs: 5
6. batch\_size : 10 (I can't increase this since I am retrieving data at runtime)

&amp;#x200B;

Problem

My training accuracy increases as the network is trained but the validation accuracy after each epoch is always 30%. Now I know this means that the network is not learning anything and is only memorizing but my attempts to improve it are futile.  


Solutions tried: 

1. Using transfer learning from the model weights given [here](https://github.com/jsalbert/Music-Genre-Classification-with-Deep-Learning/tree/d3b6e4f36420f4f7691e28c268ba6c1efdeceafd).
2. Longer period of training, say 10-15 epochs
3. Class weights to balance the irregularity in variety of class samples fed to the network in batches
4. Increased number of samples, the complete set of 6000 training samples were used but the validation accuracy remained the same

worldpolitics,George Soros Called Argentina to Tell The President NOT to lift the stay-at-home orders,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7h7GZX1CCI

Not my translation:

Full disclosure, did this on the fly and I probably missed some bits and pieces. This is some really good information but I tried to break it down as much as I could.

- Argentinas prez was going to have a meeting with his administration about opening up from quarantine. There were 200,000 jobs about to disappear, and 30,000 businesses about to bankrupt.

- Argentinans wanted to go back to work and they voiced themselves

Measures the prez wanted to take:

1st: completely eliminate quarantine for everyone under the age of 60

2nd: reopen industry, commerce, and public administration with a lot of strict rules

3rd: keep schools closed and all major public events

But during the meeting Soros called to help him ""save the Argentinans""

Soros proposed

1) Postponing interest of payments to international money fund for 5 years

2) intercede in the negotiations with the private bondsmen to guarantee a reduction of 60% of the price and buy the titles and sell to a vulture fund

3) immediately putting GRIFOLS pharmaceutical company in Argentina(which he suggested Argentina is going to be the hub of pharmaceuticals throughout all of the 3rd world countries)

4) find a new line of credit for Argentina of 4.2million dollars to disburse in 2021 with these 2 different situations

If Joe Biden wins the 2020 election the money would be immediately disbursed to them from the federal reserve

If Donald Trump does win (which he doesn't believe is going to happen) he would get that line of credit through the international money fund, the bank of the world, and through loans and a group of billionaires(philanthropists).

Fernandez interrupted and told him that between now and a year from now is an eternity, so he responded by saying that if he did all the things he asked he would personally front him the money.

Soros had 5 conditions on it though:

1) to do everything possible to destabilize the president of Brazil(Donald Trump and brazils president is 2 known enemies of Soros that need to be taken off reign)

2)legalize abortion this year with no question, also to fund planned parenthood and private aborting agencies.

3) completely reform the education system so that the kids can be taught of "" the jobs of the future"" which implicates having these students work as interns in multinational agencies. And something about eradicating the patriarchal ideology from education.

4)Soros demands to continue the quarantine for as long as possible, and devalue the coin by the 50%?

5) last was he wants them to stop their ""vaca muerta"" project, to transfer everything to renewable energy

so basically the dude who's talking now got his information from someone in the meeting and this person had to leave the country. He doesn't know what the presidents stance is but he wanted to inform the people of what happened.",energy

My loans range from 2.5k to 7k in pricing and interest is all over the place.

I already know I won't be able to pay as much as I'd like to, but i'm hoping to at least put 5k into them before November. This could either totally pay off the two smallest with average interest rate or make a huge chunk in the biggest with highest interest rate.

worldpolitics,As an Engineer I’ve learned application of multiple processes work best when balanced. My Doctor friends prescribe multi pronged treatment to more effectively fight disease.,"Please let me vent based on a few comments I’ve seen on my social media of late.... 

Socialism isn’t $1200 individual checks and $2T bailouts to already rich corporations. One was to appease the voter and win re-election, the other was graft at an unprecedented scale. Both are greed. Both debts written against our children’s future. Don’t believe for a second this is Socialism. 

Socialism is for the meek, for those in need. Socialism is Social Security, it’s unemployment insurance in times like this, it’s health care not tied to a job that can evaporate, its health care for the elderly, it’s school lunches for children that didn’t choose their lot in life. Socialist spending even TODAY is but a small fraction of the federal budget. 

Socialism doesn’t need be absolute. It can exist (and has) very well with Capitalism. In fact the most prosperous time for this country was just after The New Deal - itself the largest Socialist program in history. Where the rich still got rich but were taxed progressively to make it harder to get Robber Barron rich again. This redistribution of wealth was given to those at the bottom and worked it’s way back to the top with Capitalism. The cycle worked and was healthy for all. 

Capitalism creates competition (which is good). It motivates people to work harder if they can grab a slice of the pie (at least when wealth is distributed evenly - in the beginning). Capitalism is voraciously cannibalistic -winner take all if left unchecked (as it is today). It can crash countries like England through the 1800’s and America in 1929 when wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few and the rules (less taxes as a % paid than the middle class pays - this is how capital gains works) made to keep the small man down. 

Lastly Socialism isn’t Communism. It’s not about evenly distributed wealth. It’s about ensuring there is a safety net no one can fall below and a high ceiling that is difficult to break and impossible to stay above. It can ensure health of a Capitalistic society for generation upon generation unless greed perverts it. 

Socialism is the upper and lower control limits that’s missing from Capitalism today.

\- Foreign demand for US Dollar reserve currency, US equity, and high grade US bonds increase.

\- Foreign demand for USD balances out inflationary pressures on USD from fed printing.

* Export economies and export companies gain competitive advantage due to low currency value
* Export economies with weak currencies experience low consumer consumption. 
* US economies, with weak currencies, experience comparatively higher consumption due to lower prices .

* US retaliation to china with tariffs 
* US is not seen as safe haven currency / market, and investors put money elsewhere instead of buying USD and US assets. 
* US protectionism limits imports

personalfinance,About to deposit a $20k tuition reimbursement check with some strings attached - should I apply it toward my $70k student loans or keep it liquid in savings or some combination?,"I go to law school at night and my work reimburses me $20k tuition per year (the full amount of tuition is usually $40-50k/yr, and I'll be enrolled for 2 more years).  I have so far paid for tuition mostly through student loans from the federal government, which have a pretty high interest rate.  Current loan balance is around $70k.

However, if I leave my company, I will owe them a prorated amount back: basically, the amount minus ($1,000)*(months worked since getting the check).  I actually got the check at the end of January but have had a tough time visiting my bank as I had surgery in February and then coronavirus shut things down.  So, as of the end of March, $3k of this is truly mine while the rest is in limbo.

Since I'm a student, I can defer loan payments until after graduating.

I currently have $60k in savings and co-own a house two hours away from where I live thanks to an inheritance.  Hopefully I can sell the inherited house soon but it's hard getting there.  My income is $80k and my rent/car/insurance/bills for both me and the inherited property are more than half my take home and I'm having trouble growing the savings.

I feel I have a few options:

1.  Pay it in one lump sum toward student loans, and then if I leave my job, risk paying anything I owe out of my savings.  Personally I'd rather keep my savings for a future down payment, but this option keeps the loan balance down.

 Other companies reimburse for full tuition and I've been looking at those, so leaving is a real possibility.  If I left tomorrow,  I'd owe $17k.

2.  Pay $1k per month toward the loans.  In this scenario, I'm only paying off the loan once I know the money is mine forever, and it leaves some in the bank.

3.  Keep everything in the bank as the market is pretty uncertain with coronavirus.

4.  Try to invest it (not sure if I can beat the interest rate though? - I want to say it averages to around 6% but I'll have to double check). 

I'm leaning towards 2 but want to see what others think.

TL;DR what to do with a tuition reimbursement check that (1) must be partially refunded if I quit or am terminated when (2) I currently have a $70k student loan balance which will go up another $90k or so by the time I graduate and (3) the coronavirus leaves the market more uncertain than usual.",finance

wealth,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

Only time will tell...

MachineLearning,Question about Text Generation [Project],"I'm writing an algorithm to generate simple poems, such as haikus. I plan to use a recurrent neural net operating on the word level, and besides the normal vector representing each word to be fed into the LM, I would like to incorporate extra features, like the number of syllables that the word has. 

The thing is, I would like to expand the training data for the grammar, so that it can use more words than just those found in preexisting haikus, as well as ensuring enough data so that the writing is coherent and grammatically correct.

Mike DeWine’s stay-at-home order. And protesters at Kentucky’s state capitol interrupted a news briefing from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear with angry chants of “facts not fear” and “[we want to work](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2020/04/15/protesters-gather-outside-kentucky-capitol-over-coronavirus-closures/5141330002/).”

President Trump has blessed these operations by calling on citizens in [Minnesota](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003), [Michigan](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130) and [Virginia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372) to “LIBERATE” their states, also telling Virginians to “save your 2nd amendment. It’s under siege.” Never mind that public health experts say reopening the economy too soon could have[ catastrophic results](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/videos/the-perils-of-reopening-the-economy-too-soon).

While [evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions) suggests that well-funded conservative groups were behind many of these protests, the rage on display has been palpable. Anger has often shaped the response to economic hardship, especially in places where reverence for hard work shaped both a sense of blue-collar identity and a nascent [blue-collar conservatism](https://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15863.html). States such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky bore the brunt and severity of deindustrialization in the mid-20th century and have long resented economic disruptions beyond their control.

But protesters in Michigan came armed with semiautomatic weapons and Confederate battle flags. Members of the Proud Boys, a self-proclaimed “western chauvinists” group that the [Southern Poverty Law Center ](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys)labels a hate group, flashed the white supremacist “okay” symbol in photos with a [Michigan congressional candidate](https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/24985/michigan_congressional_candidate_squeezes_in_for_selfie_at_protest_of_stay-home_order). While one organizer attempted to distance the protest from its [fringe elements](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-rules-protests.html), their presence suggested that economic anxiety alone cannot account for the depths of anger on display. Trump’s tweets gave the demonstrators the go-ahead to flaunt their fury openly, but he didn’t create it, and neither did the stay-at-home orders.

Behind these protests is an underlying rage at elites, liberals, government and the media that is part of a half-century tradition of right-wing populism.

It started a long time ago, but nothing stoked right-wing populist anger like the mid-20th century battles about desegregation. In the North and West as much in the South, and in rural areas as much as in cities, [white rage](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/white-rage-9781632864123/) followed everywhere that civil rights activists, court decisions or new legislation threatened the status quo of racial segregation. Images of [snarling white students](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/gabrielsanchez/little-rock-nine) confronting the Little Rock Nine,[ rioting suburbanites](https://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/1cd299e6-7e1a-11e7-92bb-bf5ca2295519.html) in Levittown, Pa., and violent [antibusing demonstrations ](https://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/04/04/a-flag-a-busing-fight-and-a-famous-photograph)in Boston became touchstones for an entire era of segregationist resistance and lingering symbols of the rage that underpinned efforts to maintain the nation’s racial caste system.

There was no shortage of populist firebrands who stoked this anger, but no one capitalized on “[the politics of rage](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-politics-of-rage/)” quite like then-presidential candidate and Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who became notorious for promising “segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,” and made a career out of tapping into the anxieties and frustrations of the white electorate.

When he lambasted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as “fraud, a shame, and a hoax” in a now-famous speech, he not only attacked the Johnson administration’s signature piece of civil rights legislation but accused the federal government of tyranny for trying to enforce desegregation. Wallace’s sentiments were far from a regional phenomenon, and he swept predominantly white precincts in blue-collar areas of Indiana, Wisconsin and Maryland when he challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Democratic primary.

But Wallace found a litany of new targets during his third-party run for president in 1968, including anti-Vietnam War protesters, disruptive student activists, and “pointy-headed intellectuals.” That grievance against intellectuals and elites, not unlike his one against a tyrannical federal government, created a long-standing enemy for the populist right who think that intellectuals and elites forced unwanted new ideas that challenged society’s traditional foundations.

The Vietnam War awarded right-wing populists an opportunity to add another enemy to the list of elites threatening the nation. The Nixon administration sought to dismiss negative coverage of its expansion of the war into Cambodia and Laos by crediting it to a now-familiar scapegoat: the so-called “liberal media.” Vice President Spiro Agnew slapped network news commentators with the alliterative epithets of “nattering nabobs of negativism” and “troubadours of trouble.” That demonization of the national news media as an untrustworthy partisan endeavor is arguably the most enduring inheritance for the angry populist right. Although polls showed that 70 percent of Americans still [trusted the media](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1260&amp;context=curej) when Gallup began asking the question in the early 1970s, that percentage went into steady decline in the ensuing decades before reaching an all-time low of 32 percent in 2016.

Right-wing populist rage metastasized in the last decades of the 20th century with the growth of conservative media. Since the 1980s and the national success of Rush Limbaugh’s eponymous program, [right-wing radio](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674185012) became an incubator of populist anger by offering daily doses of outrage. Fueled by the culture wars and joined by soon-to-be luminaries such as Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity, Limbaugh and the radio right never found a shortage of potential threats to their listener’s livelihoods and freedom. In 2013, Limbaugh summed up the biggest threats as the [“Four Corners of Deceit”](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/04/29/the_four_corners_of_deceit_prominent_liberal_social_psychologist_made_it_all_up/): government, academia, science and media.

The conservative media’s greatest success in stoking populist anger arguably came in the last decade, when the radio right and ascendant Fox News juggernaut helped promote the tea party protests. The movement that ostensibly started in response to the threat of higher taxes became a sounding board for any and all complaints against the Obama administration and echoed the anger at big government that had been at the heart of right-wing populism for decades. Coverage and encouragement of these protests from conservative media not only amplified the tea party’s anger but helped turn it into electoral success in the 2010 midterm elections.

Conservative media has continued to sound the alarm about the dangers of tyrannical big government, intellectualism and the liberal media that had enraged right-wing populists for a generation. In the same vein, conservative media figures on the radio, Fox News and online played another central role in spurring the recent protests against stay-at-home orders. When the protests first started, Fox News host Laura Ingraham [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ingrahamangle/status/1250462822577975296) her support by saying it was “Time to get your freedom back,” while her network continued to give [positive coverage](https://www.mediamatters.org/coronavirus-covid-19/fox-friends-advertises-protests-against-social-distancing) to the rallies over the weekend.

If the people with assault weapons and Confederate flags at these rallies seem primed to protest, it is because they have been. Their rage has primed them to believe that a tyrannical government is always acting against their interests. Their rage has primed them to believe that the intellectuals warning them against the dangers of the novel [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_24&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_24) cannot be trusted. Their rage has primed them to believe that the liberal media is exaggerating the situation.

That same rage led many of them to Donald Trump, who not only put many of these same grievances at the center of his 2016 presidential campaign but has made daily attacks on the media a centerpiece of his presidency. Trump now promises to “[liberate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/17/states-that-trump-wants-liberate-dont-pass-benchmarks-he-himself-set/?tid=lk_inline_manual_25&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_25)” the states from their government orders. In his attacks against the “[deep state](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deep-state-department-trump-blasts-agency-workers-while-standing-next-to-secretary-of-state),” the president has lent credence to long-standing distrust of government experts. On the ground, these attacks have not only caused protesters to ignore the warnings from health experts like Anthony S. Fauci, but led to chants of “fire Fauci” at a rally in Austin.

This does not discount the real economic anxieties underlying these protests. Complicating the health crisis, covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has exacerbated the economic precariousness that has long afflicted heavily blue collar areas, as has been seen by the spike in unemployment. While that uncertainty has been faced most by poor and working-class communities of color, the economic anxieties framing protests should not be dismissed. Instead, they should be understood in the context of the deep roots of right-wing populist rage.",technology

should we instead put 100k of that into retirement savings (VTI or similar) for the very long term/retirement?

Some of our related data points:
- 30k emergency fund
- Gross household income ~200k
- household retirement savings ~250k (post-downturn)
- Both able to continue contributing at least 20% of our income to 401ks
- no car/credit card/student loan or other debt.
- Currently renting at about 11% of income (This wont last forever but not sure when it will end)
- In our mid-30s with one toddler and plans for another child in the next 3 years

Influencing factors:
- Mortgage rates are so low
- House funds have been in a high interest savings account but 2019 taxes took most of those earnings and now the savings interest rate has dropped
- Pretty confident that the market will return someday (""be greedy when others are fearful"")

investing,Is the housing market in another giant bubble?,"I'm basically going off of the simplest equation I can think of to judge how overpriced housing is: median house price vs median wages (or median household income).

What I get is this:  
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qMrO  
And this:  
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=n2Gt  
The two are fairly similar, though HI is showing more long-term price inflation.

For wages: You'll note the mid-00s bubble is quite clear here, as is the glut predating S&amp;L in the 80s. Those match up nicely, along with the relative non-bubble in the 90s.
For household income: this looks extremely frothy and above the 05/06 peak in frothness. Arguably household income is a far better measure here.

I'm having a hard time reading this as not-a-bubble, even when I've not really heard it called a bubble much in the press. Looking at trendlines, there's a definite continuity of ""normal"" prices that extends from post-S&amp;L through the 90s, then into post-2008, and (in wages) a continuity of ""bubble"" prices that extends from S&amp;L into ~06 into more recent times, or just (in household income) a continuation of the 05 bubble that looks to have not fully popped with extreme monetary measures taken in the aftermath. It does look to have leveled off a bit lately but still be above the longer run ""normal"" average by far.

Of course there are other factors, particularly interest rates being so low allowing more demand to enter the housing market through marginal consumers, along with more purchases for things like AirBnBs, both of which should drive up prices above prior norms. Also demographics, with millennials finally entering the housing market. Also construction/code standards, which have been steadily rising over this period, which should increase both building costs and perceived long-term value. I suppose I'm ignoring the impact of high-value home building in recent years in driving up prices across the board, alongside foreign RE investment inflows.

Ultimately, this all begs the question as to what the long-run ""normal"" ratio should be. The farthest back the data series go shows a level around 260:1 for wages and 3.6:1 for incomes, but at a time with a funds rate around 10-14%; we've basically been around 0% for most of the past 12 years, only seeing it rise alongside the dip in ratio near the end.

My opinion is that while there may be fundamentals to support a gradual long-term rise in this ratio (what the rational ceiling will be is anyone's guess), much of the most recent cycle activity has been based on historically abnormal interest rates and marginal/speculative buying/building. While rates are unlikely to change for the foreseeable future, I would expect to see a sharp contraction in the market alongside price drops as soon as we had entered any ""normal but deep"" recession, to say nothing of a pandemic event. Arguably that slide had already begun with rising rates after Q4 2017, and I expect it would have eventually steepened until it burned off much of the ""excess"" house price over that long-run ""normal"" trend.

Of course, now we have a lot of other factors to consider due to the lockdowns, which should only further steepen this drop, likely *under* that long-run ""normal"" trend. Of course, with a collapse in the median wage/HI, even if the ratio simply ""returns to the norm"" the actual house price point for that is going to be considerably lower than otherwise due to the drop in wages.

Basically, RE is probably not a great bet right now. Prove me wrong.",finance
personalfinance,Crazy to purchase a house right now?,"My wife and I have been casually looking for a house the past few months with plans to pull the trigger if we found a house we could afford in the neighborhood we want. Of course, one has recently popped up that is well within our price point. And now we are considering making an offer. I want to know if we are crazy for buying a house a right now. Some background.

We are currently renting a nice apartment and our lease runs up July 1. We could go month to month if need be. 

As for our finances we are in a bit of an unusual spot so I will share to some numbers to help get some perspective. We are buying the house 0 down despite being able to make a 5% down payment. HOWEVER, our loan will not include PMI, it’s a special loan offered to doctor to lawyers. Current quoted interest rate on pre-approval letter is 3.9% interest, 30 years, and like I said 0 PMI. (I say all this because some people believe it’s too good a deal to be true but it largely is. Slightly higher interest rate but no PMI)

We will walk into the house with roughly 30k in cash on hand. We think we can get the house for about 30k under the list price given the current economic state, and if we get it for that it will be great given the surrounding comps. We are also buying at over $100,000 LESS than what we were approved for by the bank, and our mandatory mortgage payment, including taxes and insurance (i.e. “all in”) is 26% of our pre-tax income which I believe is a very safe number. 

The house itself is fantastic. If there was a downturn we could comfortably live in the house for the next decade, good schools and plenty of room for our forthcoming family (no kids yet but those are coming).

Lastly, as far as our jobs go. My wife works for the state but makes great money, I am an attorney. Our firm has done well during all of this and they have reiterated they anticipate no pay cuts and have not even considered any layoffs at this time. Of course, I feel my job is less stable than my wife but I work for a medium size firm and trust our partners and what they have told us thus far which is, no one will be laid off. Even if I was to lose my job, my wife’s salary could cover every mandatory expense, house note, 1 small car payment, phones, insurance, etc, with a few hundred left over. I know that’s not great but we could easily afford all mandatory expenses with only food left over to pay for. 0 CC debt and like I said upon close we will have 20-30k in cash on hand.

I want some advice on whether this is a crazy decision? We are fairly financially conservative but not as much as those on this sub. I want some ppl here to take a peak at all this and see if we are mad for considering buying during all of this.",finance

personalfinance,"Using Multiple Balance Transfers to Minimize Interest, Defeat Debt","*Seeking expertise from anyone who's juggled balance transfer cards and defeated debt!*

**Goal**: I want to pay off my debt and pay as little interest as possible. I want to do this without debilitating my monthly budget and somewhat maintaining my lifestyle (sans the unhealthy spending of my past of course - abundant travel, consumer purchases, etc.)

**Hypothesis**: There is a way to ""work the system"" of balance transfers to minimize interest and keep monthly payments within my budget.

**Situation**:

* CC Debt: roughly $25,000
* Current CC - Bank A: 7.49%APR, 0% transfer fee, $25,000 limit
* BT cards
   * Bank B (approved): 0%APR for 18 months, 3% transfer fee, $8,000 limit
   * Bank C (approved): 0%APR for 21 months, 5% transfer fee, $5,700 limit
   * Bank D (haven't applied, speculative limit): 0%APR for 15 months, 0% transfer fee, $5,000 limit
* I am budgeting $800/mo to paying off my debt

**Proposed Plan**: *Transfer as much of my debt to BT cards to minimize the interest I am paying on my current CC. Pay the minimum monthly requirements for the 0% BT cards while contributing as much as I can to the remaining balance on my original CC.*

* If I pay off my original CC, then I move to paying the BT cards in order of 0% expiration.
* If I am able to transfer all of my debt to BT cards, then I would contribute more to the cards with 0% promos ending first.
* At the end of the 0% promo periods for each card, I would transfer back the remaining balances to my original credit card OR if there is another 0% balance transfer offer at that time, utilize those indefinitely until my overall debt is 0!

**Reasoning**: This may be more complicated, but why pay more interest if you can avoid it? ""But doesn't your current credit card have a very forgiving interest rate already?"" you might ask? - read the previous sentence.

I made a google spreadsheet ([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwewgQ7HLPiUABTidQiH2Uy95oq33W2Sf-He64e4xWk/edit?usp=sharing)) and if my estimates are correct, my findings in this would suggest I can save about $1,500 using this strategy.

**Additional Questions**: Is this a good strategy - does everything check out; can it be improved? What are some better alternatives? Is there anything I am not accounting for?

**Disclaimer**: I know the ""slippery slope"" argument of balance transfers. For the sake of keeping this relatively undeviating, please read this with the assumption that I will not relapse into unhealthy spending or use any of these credit cards for anything other than the balance transfers. I know my past would poise me as the *least* constant thing in this equation, but please offer advice on the strategy with this assumption in mind.",finance
investing,Municipal Credit Update: Mitch Favors BK for States Saddled with Pensions,"McConnell Says He Favors Allowing States to Declare Bankruptcy

By Steven T. Dennis and William Selway

(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he favors allowing states struggling with high public employee pension costs amid the burdens of the pandemic response to declare bankruptcy rather than giving them a federal bailout.

“I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,” he said Wednesday in a response to a question on the syndicated Hugh Hewittradio show. “It’s saved some cities, and there’s no good reason for it not to be available.”

Mitch McConnell speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C. on April 21.

The host cited California, Illinois and Connecticut as states that had given too much to public employee unions, and McConnell said he was reluctant to take on more debt for any rescue.

“My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that,” he said. “That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.”

“I said yesterday we’re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments needs to be thoroughly evaluated,” McConnell added.

“You raised yourself the important issue of what states have done, many of them have done to themselves with their pension programs,” he said. “There’s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.”

The idea of allowing states to file for bankruptcy was raised in the wake of the last recession. It drew widespread disdain from Wall Street investors, public employee unions and both Republican and Democratic governors, who said it would unsettle the bond market and cause even the most fiscally sound states to face higher interest rates because of the risk the debt could be wiped out in court.

It was also criticized by U.S. lawmakers of both parties during a House hearing that was convened to discuss it in 2011 and was swiftly dropped.

The National Governors Association has said states and municipalities will need at least $500 billion in aid to deal with the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic as tax revenue falls and demands for resources escalate. Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for state aid in the interim rescue package that passed the Senate on Tuesday.

McConnell took credit for blocking that. He said there should be a “fulsome” discussion among all senators on whether and how to send more aid to state and local governments and what that money should be spent on.

That will be one of the focuses for the next round of stimulus spending that Congress will be taking up. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he expected aid to state and local governments would be part of that.

No state has defaulted on its debts since the Great Depression and even after the last recession only a handful of cities went bankrupt, since governments have broad ability to raise taxes.

The current economic contraction may leave states facing an even worse fiscal crisis than they did a decade ago, which has prompted growing calls from the nation’s states and cites for Congress to provide aid to help them make up for the taxes lost by the nationwide shutdown. The governors have requested $500 billion and cities $250 billion.

The bond market, however, doesn’t appear to be pricing in much risk of defaults. While prices tumbled during a panicked sell-off last month, they’ve since rebounded, with returns roughly flat for the year.",finance

personalfinance,How to jump over all the hurdles to home ownership?,"Hello everybody. I'm increasingly considering home ownership and have thought about the pros and cons for a while. The more research I do, the more impossible it seems. I make a decent salary for my area, live with family for minimal rent, and have no college debt. But even with those advantages saving ""enough"" seems impossible.

The biggest hurdle is obviously the down payment. For a relatively decent home in my area, my upper limit on the purchase budget is $200k. For a 20% down payment, that $40k. Then there's thousands in closing costs, and all the things I need to purchase when moving in. I current have a little less than $30k saved, but it looks like I'll need closer to $50-60k to cover all costs and still have a healthy emergency fund. I'm even considering more and more to put less than 20% down if I realistically want to own a home any time soon.

I live in an area where planned communities are pervasive, and there are lots of town home and condo communities. These come with a lower purchase price, but rather large HOA and CDD fees that I feel are a waste. In my opinion, you just don't get out what you put in; even for places that cover exterior maintenance (roof/siding) and some utilities, they can raise the fees any time. And the older the community, the higher the fees get to make up for the low fees used to attract buys when the community is first built. Even single family homes are hard to find without HOAs/CDD. I limit myself to buying in older or under-served areas that are usually not the best.

Additionally, our Wiki here is missing a lot of information in my opinion on major steps to buying a home. How to I find a good realtor who will pay attention to my best interests? How do I effectively shop for a mortgage? Do I need a mortgage broker? What is a mortgage broker? How do I find programs to help 1st time home buyers federally or in my state? Which of these steps should come first?",finance

First, is there anything I'm obviously missing?  Anything look ridiculous?

There's also the scenario in which wife loses her W2 job and would be a SAHM.  This would change our monthly take-home to $7,500 and our expenses to $4,300.

So depending on the two scenarios, we would have anywhere from **$3,200** to **$5,500** per month.

We also would like to save a little money for travel.  We're risk averse in general, and want to be very conservative in case husband loses his job, but we also have the option of contributing less than the full amount towards our 401k.

My advice:

* Go with the 250k loan amount and pay off the original loan with 48.7k cash (note a 1700 closing cost). This will make the PMI go away.
* 22k in a high interest savings account for an emergency fund.
* 10.5k to fill out Roth IRA for 2019 and 2020
* 19k to fill out 401(k) for 2020 (or whatever they spend while most their paycheck goes to 401(k))
* Rest into a personal investment account, grabbing from it to fill out Roth IRA and 401(k) as necessary for future years, maybe a chunk in cash for rainy day fund? Advice welcome.

Questions:

* Could I fill out 2019 401(k) contributions or has that deadline not been extended like IRA has? Not sure how this works as I haven't had the privilege of a 401(k).

""We use the daily balance method. First we calculate a daily periodic rate, then we apply it to both the principal (the amount you deposited) and the interest your account has earned each day. The daily periodic rate is calculated by dividing the interest rate by 365 days.""  


Simple interest sounds like they only pay interest on the principal, but then they say they apply the daily periodic rate 'to both the principal and the interest your account has earned each day.'

I'm trying to help a friend figure out the best way to get out of credit card debt.  The high interest rates on each seperate card make it hard to play catch up. I've spoken to a few different people and we've all come to the conclusion that a personal loan would be their best bet.

&amp;#x200B;

They have gotten approved for a $15,700 personal loan from their bank, to be re-payed over 48 months at 7.5% APR.

&amp;#x200B;

Their current credit lines are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. $3,648.40 @ 15.99%
2. $2,619.21 @ 12.49%
3. $1,948.96 @ 18.74%
4. $4,018.79 @ 14.40%
5. $2,139.60 @ 26.99%
6. $2,474.12 @ 24.99%
7. $405.89 @ 24.99%

That brings their total Credit Debt to $17,254.97

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally the $15,700 loan would cover all high interest cards, and they would only leave a balance on the lowest interest card (12.49%).

personalfinance,Refinance mortgage without spouse,"My wife and I bought our first house together in 2013 with a 30 year conforming loan at 5.75%, which we didn’t realize was high until several years later. We want to refinance our remaining $120,000 and aim for 2.25% (Navy Federal) on a 15 year confirming, which equates to roughly the same monthly mortgage payment. I currently make 85k with a credit score around 770. Since purchasing, my wife changed careers and makes very little as a therapist resident and less than a year until being fully licensed and making a decent wage. Her W2 from last year had her at $6,000 for the year (yep, just six) and her credit score is around 720.     
     
Does it make sense for us to refinance under just my name &amp; income? Do mortgage lenders let you “sample” different applications, so that we could try one application with just my name and another with us both?",finance
personalfinance,Separated wife is refinancing the mortgage in her name. Finance company is asking for my bank statements showing alimony payments.,"A little background. My wife and I split back in September. My state requires 1 year of separation before filing for divorce. We have a separation agreement which gives her the home and I was to sign a quit claim. The mortgage would remain in her name until refinancing made fiscal sense. Because of interest rates plummeting this has become a good time for her. 

I make bi-weekly payments to her for spousal support and my share of the debt. At first we maintained a join account. I transferred money from my account to hers. This became a problem when I filed a change of address so after a few months I started sending the money via Zelle. Obligatory I trust her.

The concern is that her underwriter (if that's the right term) is asking me to provide statements showing proof of alimony payments to her for the last 6 months.  Now, I don't want to provide that level of information directly to her. It's just more about my life than I want to share. I do know that data is arguably the most valuable commodity on the planet. That being said I'm not all that comfortable providing this to a 3rd party whom I'm not doing business with. I already provided them a statement saying I made payments in the exact amount and gave a screenshot of my bank account with the authorized users.

Is this a typical ask? Is it safe for me to provide this?  What is my best practice?  This is good for me in many ways and I want to help. I also want to be sure I'm protecting my own interests to a degree.

personalfinance,"Unclaimed property California state controller, is this a scam?","I received very legitimate looking letter from the California state controllers office stating that I have unclaimed property in the amount of $1757.52. It states that the state controllers office does not have my money and I need to contact the business named in the letter (Cenlar federal savings bank) before 6/1/2020 in order to claim it. The letter then goes on to say that after 6/1/2020 Cenlar federal savings bank will turn over the money to the state controllers office and I can claim it from there at any time in the future. 

I was nervous to call the number on the letter so I went to the California state controllers website to search for my name there. 

The website that I went to is https://www.sco.ca.gov. 

The search revealed that I do infact have money to be claimed but they want me to enter my social security number, name, date of birth etc to claim it and I'm unsure about entering that information into a website.

Everything looks very official, there are no pushy deadlines stating that my money will be gone after 6/1/2020 or anything like that, just that it will be a longer process to claim it through the state. Also the website is .CA.gov, so that has to be legitimate right? 

The letter also states that the money is from several years ago and was attached to one of my old properties that I have since sold, however the dates given do match when I had the property and I'm assuming it's an escrow account or something that wasn't refunded to me and I didn't know about it. 

Everything as far as I can tell seems legitimate but I am very cautious when they require me to enter all of my personally identifiable information. Is this normal? Why would they not just send a check addressed to me to my current address, what would they need my social for?

personalfinance,Should I dispute a medical collections on my Credit Report?,"About 3 years back, I had a little accident where I rode the ambulance to a local ER. They couldn't pull up my insurance right away but I left without much of a concern. Forward about a month later, the hospital must have handed it over to the collection agency pretty fast, because they called asking for insurance information. I think it was the collection agency because it was always different unknown numbers calling EVERY SINGLE DAY while I was in class. They thankfully located my insurance but another month or so later, they call and said I still have a balance of $1000 due because of ambulance costs (RIDICULOUS). I was pretty dubious but verified it to be true - the ins. Didnt cover it. I tried disputing it with my insurance, but they shot it down. Last I spoke with the collections agency, they offered a payment plan. And then I googled it up and orally requested a validation letter (it was a quick search, and I didn't send any paperwork). Then no call from them ever.

Now three years later, I'm checking my credit scores while learning to adult - my FICO score is about 660. I was 20 back then and ignorant so I have no letters or paperwork from that time. I'm in CA, so the statute of limitations is going to be over next year. I'm scared of possibly getting sued, and I'm not in a position to comfortably pay off the debt at once. I've read online that I should dispute the claim because medical collections are one of the easiest to dispute. Im also hoping the pandemic is causing these agencies to be overwhelmed/understaffed so that my case can slip through. But I'm also 3 years in, so I don't want the collections agencies to pull up my case.

Should I dispute it now or after the SOL is past? Should I even dispute it at all or leave it fall off my record 4 years from now?

If I dispute, it would be something along the case that I had requested validation but I didn't receive it. I also believe I should have been notified if it was going to be put on my credit report (not sure if this is valid enough). If anything, I would explain my insurance was not located at the time of visit and I was not notified past 90 days. I'm open to any suggestions for dispute reasonings that might help my case because I don't have paperwork.

TL:DR: Damned if you help damned if you don’t with family members. Should I keep my mouth closed at the dinner table for any financial discussions to avoid being criticized or blamed for my financial tips or advice? 


Is it best in this scenario to just be quiet and don’t wake a sleeping dog from getting poked?

I’m the kind of person, that if I learn something that could help others, i blabber away. Did you know you could get a better rate on your insurance doing XYZ, or instead of spending $50 for a light at Home Depot, you could get a better light for $15 on Amazon? That’s me. Anything I know that can achieve things better or faster, I like to share with others. 

I have close family, parents and immediate family, and anytime I share something useful that definitely could benefit them, it ends up in a argument of total chaos. Now I will be frank, I am no Jeff Bezos, in fact, I work a shitty job I could’ve got out of hs, but I’ve spent every waking moment the last year or so improving myself, and managed to save about 30k (I know that’s not impressive), but I am trying and am a work in progress. I think this is why they lash out at me. They compare me to other peers my age who they say have big homes, make 5x more money than me, and honestly they think I’m a loser. I did make mistakes several years ago, but I made better decisions now. They might be right, but I started believing in myself and learning how to invest my money and try to reach to retirement and financial freedom. 

My family will believe a stranger on the street before they take anything I say for granted.  Such as the example below:

I have a family member that has their life savings in a bank that gets them .70-$1 a month in interest, and they want a better option with little risk. My suggestion was to take that money and get the Chase $1000 bank bonus at the time (sapphire banking promo). 

I explained to them that the goal would be to open the  sapphire account, then open a you invest account as well and put the money in a low risk fund “VUSXX”, so that accomplishes two things: 1.) You get the $1000 bonus + you would get interest based on the treasury so for the sake of things, let’s just say and extra $150 for about 3-4 months of keeping funds in there, and then after a few months they can transfer the funds to a HYSA or look for other bonuses. I met them at the bank and the teller tells them, how about you just do the checking and savings for $600, and that the option I’m proposing is not FDIC insured and they could lose their money. Well that started a frenzy, they argued with me up and down on me not telling them they could lose their money and I should’ve done a better job (which I explained all investments have risk, but this is kind of low). Right now I have a small vanguard mma that pays me ok now, and my account has grown, not lost. Based on my age, I should be 70/30, but I have been investing in low risk investments until I can build my portfolio up and also I have been working on building up my emergency funds (I decided to make a 6-mo to a year fund about $6-12k, a car maintenance fund $2k, and a wtf fund for just up to $1000). I wear glasses and know I need to make a HSA fund as well. 

So speed up months later, they told me can I just help them one more time find a bank account bonus instead of a brokerage or investment account (they don’t feel easy investing at the moment). So I found a capital one deal where you can get a $500 (it’s FDIC insured and gives a ok interest, esp. with the feds lowering it again). 

Anyways, during the signup it ask to put a routing number and account from your external bank to transfer the funds and I tell them to put the minimum requirement amount for this bonus, plus put about $50 more bucks just so incase you make a few purchase while it transfers  and you want to leave something so it can confirm the two baby verification amounts it does. And they argue about they don’t want it to be in checking. I tell them when I did it, I left it in checking and it should be safe and it’s only going to be there for a few days until they verify it. 

Well it happens again. They didn’t put it in checking. They call capital one and the rep says they had an issue because they were going to take it from checking or something. So they argue with me again. I tell them that’s what I suggested from the start and they argue with me. 

Anyways, I’m kind of a loaner. I don’t really have much to any friends (well the one I have lives 6 hours away), and I have been heavily immersed myself into books, and improving my financial freedom, so I would tend to talk to family, but now I’m thinking it’s best to just shut my mouth up?

I predicted this virus to be a really bad in late December/early January so I bought n95 mask immediately and warned family members to do the same (at the time, they were $2.17 each). They looked at me like I was crazy, by February I was wearing a mask and gloves when I went out, and they further thought I was crazy, now fast forward and it is mandatory in my city to have a mask starting Monday for the next 30 days.

Just wanted to hear your thoughts. I’ve babbled enough lol. Do you think it’s best I just shut up when it comes to any financial topics with family, even parents, and even if they losing a chuck money due to inflation, getting $1 a month in interest, etc., and just focus on accomplishing my goals?",finance

personalfinance,When to upgrade from a student card to a second credit card with higher limits/cash back?,"Hello!

I'm currently getting close to the end of my freshman year of college. Last August (August 2019), I picked up my first credit card (the Discover Student Card) to start building my credit. I've been very serious about paying off my balance ASAP and, in an interesting roundabout way due to the removal of room and board and dining fees at my college as I'm not on campus anymore for this term, I was actually able to pay off the entirety of the private Citizens Bank loan I had taken out for tuition costs (I still have a federal loan, though, as an aside), raising my credit score to the mid-700s, which I'm pretty happy to see so far.

So my question is: when should I start considering picking up a ""real"" credit card? And by real, I mean one that isn't just a student card. When I originally acquired my Discover card, a branch representative at my bank advised me to use the credit I would build to apply for a credit card with higher limits and cash back around the 11 month mark of owning the student card (so that would be in July 2020). I wasn't entirely sure why he was so specific about doing this before my student card was a year old, but I'm curious what you all think of this.

Furthermore, I realize that I shouldn't cancel my student card regardless of if I apply for another card because it's the oldest card in my history and right now makes up a large portion of my credit score, but is there a time when I *should* cancel the student card? Or is there a way to convert it to a different card with Discover or something so I don't lose the credit history but also don't have to deal with the low limits and such imposed by having the student card?

I should clarify: I'm not planning on going crazy and buying stuff with reckless abandon if I get a new card (nor do I buy an absurd amount of stuff with my credit card currently); I am just under the impression that I can build my credit faster with a card with higher credit limits, and I'm hoping to graduate college in a few years with the best credit score I possibly can, especially because my parents don't have great credit (so I'm on my own in that regard).

Thank you in advance for any advice you're able to provide!",finance

This company is in the specialty chemicals industry. The AirBoss Defense Group segment develops, manufactures, and sells chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective equipment and related products for military, first response, and healthcare applications.

AirBoss of America Corp. (BOS.TO) (the ""Company"" or ""AirBoss"") announced on March. 31, 2020 that AirBoss Defense Group (“ADG”) has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the manufacture and sale of 100,000 FlexAir™ Powered Air Purifying Respirator (“PAPR”) systems, 600,000 filters, and related accessories. The contract is expected to be worth an aggregate amount of US$96.4 million and represents the single largest order received by ADG to date.

Here is the announcement: [$96.4 million dollar contract ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/31/2009462/0/en/AirBoss-Announces-US-96-Million-Contract-for-FlexAir-PAPR-System-from-FEMA-to-Help-Battle-COVID-19.html)

The stock has priced has more than tripled in the last few weeks and shows no signs of slowing down. This is where it gets odd when I started to look at why this company specifically was awarded this contract from FEMA when there are so many other companies that are in this space. I came across this article which states that the company never even put in a bid, but was awarded the contract. 

""The company’s proposal/offer was submitted by a White House task force assisting with sourcing of needed supplies and equipment,” the FEMA statement said. In the government database, a contract officer wrote that the procurement was “ordered by the White House.”

I dug further and found this: 

Gordon Flatt has a 19.8% share of AirBoss of America. Flatt’s the brother of Bruce Flatt, the CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, which saved Jared Kushner from defaulting on 666 5th Avenue. Is Kushner repaying a favor through his “task force”?

[60% of shares are held by a handful of shareholders ](https://m.marketscreener.com/AIRBOSS-OF-AMERICA-CORP-1409237/company/)

Saying all of this, I wouldn't be surprised if Jared kushner (Trump's son in law) awards further protective equipment contracts to Airboss.

Edit: Since 60% of shares are owned by insiders, theres barely any shares available, which is one of the reasons why the stock price has more than tripled in the last few weeks. Reminds me of the Tilray shitshow (was at $300 US a share at one point) because majority of the shares were held by insiders.",finance
personalfinance,Lowering My Credit Limit While I Build Discipline?,"TL;DR: I'm not confident in my newfound discipline to reign in my credit card spending. I think that by requesting a lower credit limit, this might help reduce my ability to run up high limits so I'm not in this position again. Family and friends are advising against it. Thoughts?  


I got my first credit card at 27 with the idea that I needed to start building credit. Before getting the card, I worked entirely on cash with no savings account. I worked through a secured Capital One card until I earned a credit score that could get me a high limit Chase card. I've been using small limit cards to supplement my high limit cards when I max them out. This has systematically been killing my credit score. Each year, I'm using my tax returns to pay off my low limit, high interest cards and then closing them, only to apply for another one in the 3rd or 4th quarter. The last 7 years of the luxurious life of credit card debt has had it's perks - a few cross-country vacations, numerous concerts, nice restaurants, furniture, gifts, an engagement ring, and a final payment to fix a leaky roof. Last September, I finally opened my eyes and acknowledged I needed to reign it in. I was about $17,000 in debt; I had 4 cards, all with debts exceeding $1,000 and was contributing a large amount of my paycheck to paying debts.

Since September, I have paid down 3 cards. I have large credit limits for Care Credit (CL $9,500) and Synchrony Home (CL $8,000) and $0 balances. I have Care Credit as an emergency for medical or vet bills and the Synchrony Home is tied to a local furniture store. I've been keeping it open because it helps offset my debt to credit limit ratio and once it serves it's purpose, I'll close it ( I read the fine print on how they collect interest after the deferred interest period has passed). I had a high interest Discover card (CL $3,500) that I was using to transfer the balance from my high limit Chase card (CL $14,000) and take advantage of 0% APR for balance transfers, but I recently had a discrepancy with Discover charging minimum interest rates and out of principal, I used the stimulus check to close it. This has lowered my debt to credit limit ratio by $3,500 while only eliminating $1,200 in debt.

My only remaining debt is the Chase card. Of my $14,000 limit, I owe just over $12,000. The minimum payment and monthly interest fee comes out to just over $400 a month. I'm throwing at least $500 per month at it and have been using the snowball method to consolidate all my other ""payments"" so this Chase payment can look closer like $800 per month. My credit score, after tanking for a few years, is finally over 700 again and I don't have any other sources of debt (car, loan, house, student loans, etc).

While I'm fairly confident that I'm going to be more responsible with my credit card debt, I've engaged in many addictive behaviors in the past. I want to insulate my finances and protect myself from myself. The plan I came up with is to pay down the debt with Chase and at every $2,500 mark (until I reach $7,500) contact Chase and request a reduction in my credit limit. I've talked this over with friends and family and have received mostly negative feedback. They've advised that I will reduce my credit score, inflate my debt to credit limit ratio, and make it look like I can't manage my finances since the Chase card will always be maxed out until it's safely below the $7,500 mark.

My biggest concern is that I might lose employment and not be able to cover the monthly payments.

investing,Interesting Info on I found on Airboss of America Corp,"Tsx: Bos

Otc: ABSSF

This company is in the specialty chemicals industry. The AirBoss Defense Group segment develops, manufactures, and sells chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective equipment and related products for military, first response, and healthcare applications.

AirBoss of America Corp. (BOS.TO) (the ""Company"" or ""AirBoss"") announced on March. 31, 2020 that AirBoss Defense Group (“ADG”) has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the manufacture and sale of 100,000 FlexAir™ Powered Air Purifying Respirator (“PAPR”) systems, 600,000 filters, and related accessories. The contract is expected to be worth an aggregate amount of US$96.4 million and represents the single largest order received by ADG to date.

Here is the announcement: [$96.4 million dollar contract](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/31/2009462/0/en/AirBoss-Announces-US-96-Million-Contract-for-FlexAir-PAPR-System-from-FEMA-to-Help-Battle-COVID-19.html)

The share price has more than tripled in the last few weeks and shows no signs of slowing down. This is where it gets odd when I started to look at why this company specifically was awarded this contract from FEMA when there are so many other companies that are in this space. I came across this article which states that the company never even put in a bid, but was awarded the contract.

""The company’s proposal/offer was submitted by a White House task force assisting with sourcing of needed supplies and equipment,” the FEMA statement said. In the government database, a contract officer wrote that the procurement was “ordered by the White House.”

[Here is the article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.propublica.org/article/the-white-house-pushed-fema-to-give-its-biggest-coronavirus-contract-to-a-company-that-never-had-to-bid/amp)

I dug further and found this:

Gordon Flatt has a 19.8% share of AirBoss of America. Flatt’s the brother of Bruce Flatt, the CEO of Brookfield Asset Management, which saved Jared Kushner from defaulting on 666 5th Avenue. Is Kushner repaying a favor through his “task force”?

[60% of shares are held by a handful of shareholders](https://m.marketscreener.com/AIRBOSS-OF-AMERICA-CORP-1409237/company/)

Saying all of this, I wouldn't be surprised if Jared kushner (Trump's son in law) awards further protective equipment contracts to Airboss.

Edit: Since 60% of shares are owned by insiders, theres barely any shares available, which is one of the reasons why the stock price has more than tripled in the last few weeks. Reminds me of the Tilray shitshow (was at $300 US a share at one point) because majority of the shares were held by insiders.",finance

personalfinance,Question about prepaid items on loan estimate (refinance),"So, I'm trying to take advantage of the lower interest rates and refinancing my 4.75 down to 3.125. I have 2 loan estimates in hand and I'm comparing them. All closing costs will be added to the principal of the loan. Interest rates are identical. Company A's estimate has a lower overall loan amount by about $1000. But in looking at the details, it includes no prepaids for homeowners insurance or property taxes. Company B's estimate includes roughly $2500 for these items. But no lender controls how much property tax or homeowners insurance I pay, so I'm confused on how this section of estimate can differ.

Is this a ""mistake"" on Company A's part? Will (or can) they come back closer to closing and add that back in?",finance
personalfinance,Vet my plan for 401k loan to buy second home and rent first?,"I currently own for 6 years and have down payment cash of 20% of the range I'm looking to buy. I want to buy a new place, and rent my existing place. It's a condo, I'm handy and will be nearby so I don't fear being a landlord. However, I would need another 3% (would be around 21,000) for closing costs and I would also like emergency cash (HVAC in existing place fails, for example), so I need around 25,000 still.

I'm currently in a 4.125% interest mortgage. I was initially investigating getting a refi and take all but 20% out, but it seems I would have to get an investment property mortgage so the interest rates wouldn't be enough to justify that. It sounds like I can just leave the loan as is and rent it from what I understand.

It would take me at least 6 months to get the needed cash and I don't want to wait that long. I've mid-30s with 160,000 in my 401k, so it looks like a good idea would be to take a 25,000 401k loan out.

Is that a solid plan? Take a 401k loan for 25,000 (leaving 135,000), use that for closing costs and emergency funds, buy a new place with 20% down, polish up and rent my existing place? I'm in an area where rent is always higher than mortgages even with the homeowner tax break coming off.",finance

bigdata,Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

“The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt. 

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive use of resources and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall. 

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it. 

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information. 

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

I want to be able to process 240 of such screenshots in at most 10 minutes (process = extract the word count and write it to a text file).

I need a piece of software (or combination of multiple pieces of software) which 

1. can extract the word count (and only the word count) from the screenshot,
2. runs on Windows 10,
3. is either free/open source or affordable (under 100 dollars, no subscriptions).

What are the candidates?

Options that I am aware of.

**Option 1: Tesseract**

Tesseract works like a charm with easily recognizable text, but when I fed the screenshot above to it using `tesseract screenshot.png screenshot-ocred -l eng`, it generated following output:

```

**Option 2: Sikuli**

Sikuli allows you to recognize shapes based on their locations (e. g. ""10 pixels to the left of button X""). But I don't think it is suitable for my task.

**Option 3: Tesseract with preprocessing**

Let's assume that the word count I want to extract is always located at the same position. Then, for every screenshot in my directory I could

1. run a tool (ImageMagick?) that takes the image and cuts out only the part with the word count (based on fixed, hard-coded coordinates and dimensions) and
2. those files (with only numbers) are fed to Tesseract.

investing,"Covid, Italy, and the EU","Similar to what the Fed is doing, the ECB is providing a lot of liquidity support in European bond markets. This has masked some of the strains that Covid-19 has put on countries in the Euro Zone.

We should all be concerned about Italy. The Italians were already in recession (-0.3% growth) in Q4 of last year. We will know more about the state of the country on 4/30, when GDP, Unemployment and Inflation figures all come out. https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/calendar

Why care?
Italy is the third-biggest Euro economy and it is heavily (HEAVILY) indebted. A default or haircut would lead to a wave of destabilization, bank failures, and economic strain on-par with the 2008 recession. Is it likely? Officials project a virus-induced budged deficit equal to 10% of GDP, and this will likely push the country's government debt to GDP ratio over 150%. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-budget-exclu/exclusive-italy-sees-2020-budget-deficit-near-10-of-gdp-source-idUSKBN21Y2U9

Bond markets will determine whether this train derails. Today, bond spreads between Italy and Germany are just under 3%. That is significant (on par with Greece), but still probably affordable for Italy. But that spread is tight because of the ECB's quantitative easing. The Germans, Dutch, and Austrians won't let the ECB print money for the Italians forever. When the presses stop, investors need to be prepared for Mt. Vesuvius.",finance

 Before this COVID situation hit, my girlfriend was making  17.50 as a behavioral technician (working with kids with disabilities). Once COVID restrictions came in play, they shut down their   office location and told employees to go directly to people's houses to perform their work (behavioral therapy). 

My girlfriend had two clients she would go to each day for her full 40 hr work week, but eventually one client cancelled services due to COVID (she didn't want someone continuously entering their house, ALSO an employee at her husbands work tested positive.. my girlfriends place of work told her this wasn't enough of a reason for her to self isolate and to keep working even though the husband had close contact with the employee).

With her hours cut in half, my girlfriend applied for unemployment insurance, BUT around this same time, the employer gave all employees a TEMPORARY raise of about $2 an hour.. so when my girlfriend applied for the unemployment, she was told she wasn't eligible because her 20 hour workweek at $19.50 was more than what her benefit would have been if she was totally unemployed. This is due to her unemployment benefit being calculated by her previous wage of 17.50. 

Her unemployment benefit would have been 3.85% of her highest earning quarter.  I calculated this to be roughly $330 a week unemployment benefit (excluding $600 per week addition from federal stimulus).

According to the press service of the department itself, the reason for this was the information about hiding the real state of affairs about the epidemic of the coronavirus in Crimea and the Donbas.*

*But, of course, this is the pretext in fact, not the reason. The reason, as the saying goes, is in-plain-view, and is better not to be ignored.*

*It seems like that the reason is the fact that Crimea and the Donbas are present on an equal footing on the website of the Ministry for Reintegration. No, this is not the ""Ministry for the Minsk Process"". Yes, this is the department, the very creation of which accurately reflects the constitutional position of Ukraine: not only Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, which Russia doesn't formally claim, are occupied - but are so the territory of Crimea, which Russia annexed contrary to all the norms of the international (and its own) law.*

*Evidence? It's also in-plain-view. The site of the Ukrainian ministry is the first site of the Ukraine's state institution blocked by Russia. At that, it's desirable to recall that other countries - like the Republic of Moldova or Georgia - also have their departments dealing with reintegration of their territories occupied by Russia. But no specific claims were made against them in all these decades; their representative web-offices are still accessible in the Russian Federation. But why? The thing is the same. All because Russia doesn't formally claim the territories of Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. They are its colonies, protectorates, but they are not Russia itself. Neither the ""people's republics"" of the Donbas, for that matter.*

*But as for Crimea... Crimea is a territory which the Kremlin seems to hold on to until the bitter end, even during the pandemic, the collapse of the oil prices, and the collapse of the Russian economy. That's why Vladimir Putin, against the law and common sense, decided to* [*confiscate the property of Ukrainian citizens and other non-citizens of Russia in Crimea*](https://ru.krymr.com/a/news-putin-zapretil-ne-grazhdanam-rossii-vladet-uchastkami-v-krymu/30506598.html)*. That's why the website of the Ukrainian Ministry for Reintegration is blocked. The website of the department, the very existence of which recalls: the annexation of Crimea is just a period from occupation to reintegration.*

*And I think Putin doesn't really want to hear such reminders. Because without the annexed Crimea, his regime loses its main political trump card.*

*And, according to his logic, no one in Russia and Crimea itself should believe that the peninsula can really ""return to its native harbour"". To the Ukrainian harbour.*

A plan may provide that if a loan is not repaid, your account balance is reduced, or offset, by the unpaid portion of the loan. The unpaid balance of the loan that reduces your account balance is the plan loan offset amount. Unlike a deemed distribution discussed in (5), above, a plan loan offset amount is treated as an actual distribution for rollover purposes and may be eligible for rollover. If eligible, the offset amount can be rolled over to an eligible retirement plan. Effective January 1, 2018, if the plan loan offset is due to plan termination or severance from employment, instead of the usual 60-day rollover period, you have until the due date, including extensions, for filing the Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the offset occurs.",finance

personalfinance,I’m am in an AWFUL auto loan and I need help.,"Hello, I’ll give some background 

I commute to university and I needed a vehicle bc the one I had was expensive, falling apart, awful fuel efficiency, etc. 

So I bought a Hyundai Sonata. Wound up saving a considerable amount on auto insurance and cut my gas spending in half. Great right? Not so fast. Unfortunately at 23 years old my credit is not too strong. Around 640. I got an awful auto loan. Around 18% APR which is the fixed rate for....6 years. The loan is only about 7,000$ total.   I understand that when the interest is compounded in paying almost DOUBLE the value of the actual vehicle in interest. I’ve only been paying the loan for about ~6 months I try and pay as much as I can each month (giving over my monthly payment of 170$ sometimes paying 400$). However this isn’t feasible long term as I need to now save for international grad school now I get to my question.

Given the pandemic here in the United States is there any good opportunities to refinance or get a new loan? This loan is so bad I’ve considered even maybe taking extra money out on my student loans just to get out of this ridiculous interest rate of 18% on my vehicle. I’ve tried to apply for refinancing and personal loans but none accept me with my credit score of 640 and if they do it’s at a HIGHER APR than my original loan. My parents won’t co sign for me nor do I want them to. I am independent. I’m looking for ideas to get out of this and wasn’t sure if expanded gov programs or lower interest rates etc would help rn?  

Info: I am from NY, USA. I’m currently collecting unemployment at an income of 835$ a week. I need to save most of this for my international grad school so I really think changing the structure of my loan would be better then paying it all off w my own cash. Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Can I afford to buy a house within my desired price range?,"Hello Everyone, 

My boyfriend and I would like to purchase a home within the next year. Here's some information regarding our financial background: 

My boyfriend (35M) and I (29F) make roughly 110k annually. I make 55k and my boyfriend makes around 60k. According to my union contract (I'm a teacher), within 5 years my salary is going to increase by at least 18k. In seven years it will be increased by 25K+. I currently take home around 600 weekly. I put a good chunk of my pay into my retirement. My boyfriend takes home 800 weekly. At the end of each month, he takes home an additional 300, however this could be much more depending on the month. My boyfriend also gets annual raises. 

We currently live in New England. The price of a good home in a good neighborhood is currently around 275K or greater. 

My current bills, total to approximately 700 a month (not including rent). My boyfriends is approximately 700 as well. We currently rent and we would be first time homebuyers. 

Our credit scores are 730+. We did get pre-approved for 340K, and the lender said we could get pre-approved for more if we wanted to. I definitely do not want a home that expensive, but within the 300-320 range. The lender stated that a mortgage in the 300k range is 2,100 monthly and a 315,000 loan would be 2,220. I will be splitting the mortgage payment in half with my boyfriend. The interest rate is 3.3%.

We have 15,000 to put down towards the downpayment. I would love to eliminate the possibility of PMI, but I do not see us saving 60K for another five years. I am almost 30 and would like to have a house to raise a family. I would also like to start building equity rather than paying someone else's mortgage. 

While a starter home sounds appealing, it's not something my boyfriend and I are interested in. If we were to purchase a starter home, I do not see ourselves moving out of the home. I would rather purchase a house that I will live in for a long time.

At the end of the day, my question is whether or not my portion of the mortgage payment (around 1,000-1,100) is affordable? I would have approximately an extra 600 monthly for food, utilities, savings and other expenses.  While I do admit that this home is a stretch of my budget, I see it as being affordable within five years. I would rather stretch my budget for five years and live in a house that I'm happy with.

2-Interest-only payments for six months.

investing,Credit Market Insight: Blackstone's GSO Hedge Fund loses 30% last month on Distressed Debt,"Blackstone’s GSO Distressed-Debt Bets Post 30% Quarterly Loss

Energy sector investments sour along with oil prices

‘Distress takes time to play out,’ COO Jonathan Gray says  


By Katherine Doherty

(Bloomberg) -- GSO Capital Partners LP reported its worst performance in at least a decade from distressed-debt investments, even as the pandemic boosted potential targets in March to almost $1 trillion.

The credit arm of Blackstone Group Inc. recorded a negative 30.3% net composite return on distressed assets during the first quarter, the company said in a Thursday statement. The losses were driven in part by energy, which hobbled returns and remains a deeply troubled sector, management said during a quarterly earnings call with investors.

The loss compares with a 3.1% gain in the same quarter a year earlier and negative 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, when energy was also a drag. More recently in April, a supply glut and crashing demand sent oil futures prices into negative territory during April.

“We’re already seeing opportunities appearing” from dislocation in the markets, but “distress takes time to play out,” Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray said on the call. The firm is “looking for businesses that are cyclically, not secularly, under pressure,” Gray said. “Strong companies and properties recover and flourish” with time.

Distressed net returns for the last 12-month period were also down 35.3%, according to Blackstone’s presentation. The figure measures profit after taxes, fees and carried interest. By contrast, GSO posted a negative 14.1% net return on its performing credits for the quarter.

Investors in distressed debt struggled to post gains last year because low interest rates and frothy credit markets helped troubled issuers find new backers to bail them out. Now the coronavirus pandemic has created new targets for credit investors to buy at steep discounts, with the total approaching $1 trillion at one point during March, according to data compiled by Bloomebrg.

“It’s a better investment environment than it was before both the leveraged loan and high-yield market sold off,” Gray said on the call. Those markets have recovered some ground, “but there are still plenty of names that are trading at big discounts, so for our distressed arm that creates opportunities.”

The firm deployed roughly $3 billion during the first quarter, management said. The amount of assets specific to distressed-debt investing is around $7.8 billion, about 1% of Blackstone’s total $538 billion pool, according to a company representative.

The entire credit unit managed $128.7 billion as of quarter end, a step down from $132.3 billion in the same period last year. Credit remains the third-largest business unit at Blackstone.

Blackstone’s supply of unused capital available to invest in credits of all types and insurance stood at $27.9 billion, down from $28.7 billion in the prior quarter.

Distressed Leader

GSO is watched closely by investors because it’s one of the largest and most active distressed-debt investors. Returns in the field can vary widely each quarter, with results depending in part on when troubled issuers decide to take corrective actions and when deals are completed as well as court rulings.

GSO’s composite gross return for distressed assets before fees and deductions was down 31.8% for the quarter, better than the 41% drop in the benchmark ICE BofA distressed-debt index. The results trailed both GSO’s 3.7% gain in the first quarter of 2019 and negative 0.8% in the fourth quarter of last year.

In contrast to GSO’s recent performance, a Blackstone-backed hedge fund recorded one of its best-ever months with bets in corporate distress as the coronavirus pandemic started taking hold in Europe. Bybrook Capital’s master fund gained about 17% net of fees in March and 19% for the first quarter, Bloomberg reported.",finance

investing,The Coming CLO Meltdown,"Prices in key parts of the almost $700 billion market -- which finances companies with less-than-stellar credit scores -- have remained deeply depressed, typically under 70 cents on the dollar, even as other financial markets have rallied. Back in February, before the Covid-19 pandemic throttled the economy, these lower-rated CLO slices hovered near par.

That’s partly because the securities have been largely left out of stimulus programs. But it’s also because the risky corporate loans that were stuffed into the CLOs are being downgraded so frenetically that investor safeguards in the securities may get overwhelmed.

If that happens, the firms that manage the CLOs will be forced to dump under-performing loans at fire-sale prices or suspend the cash payments they make to investors.

Some analysts expect up to a third of CLOs to soon have to limit payouts to holders of the riskiest and highest-returning part of the CLO structure -- the equity portion. The pain could quickly spread to less risky tranches, too.

The exact extent of the damage will become clearer in the coming weeks as managers submit monthly and quarterly updates of their assets, which will determine whether they’ve breached key thresholds on quality and solvency.

These risks prompted Moody’s Investors Service to warn last week that it may cut the ratings on 859 CLO securities, accounting for nearly a fifth of all such bonds it grades.

personalfinance,"$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college, I don't know what to do","Hey everybody, I'm in need of advice

I currently have $92,500 in loans, and I don't know how to pay for my last year of college.

I also have a plan for what to do after graduating, and wanted to hear opinions on it

I'm currently finishing up my junior year of college, and I don't know how I want to pay for my senior year. I, like many other kids, stupidly took out expensive loans so I could go to an out-of-state college, and even though I am getting a good degree (Mechanical Engineering), I still regret the amount of debt I have put myself into just for an education. I wish I had spent my first 1.5 - 2 years at commumity college so I could save a lot of money, but it's too late for that now. It only recently just hit me just how much debt I'm in, and I'm really sad and scared about it and what to do.

Here are my current loans:

Private loans: (Only paying interest while still in school)

$35,000 5.19% 15 year

$38,000 5.6 % 15 year

Federal sub/undsub loans:

$19,500 \~4.5%

My last year of college will be \~$35,000, minus the federal loans ($7,500) I accept for the 2020-2021 school year, so that means I still have to come up with around $27,500 for my senior year. Should I take out another loan? I can't take a year off school to work and save money to pay for my senior year because I will have to start making full payments on my existing loans and won't be able to save enough. I really don't want to go over 100k in student loan debt, but it looks like that is the only option to be able to graduate.

My father has told me not to be scared about this, and he says when I graduate I can still live home rent free, and he will help pay a little bit each month. I know for mechanical engineers the starting salarying ranges from 60-65k a year, and since I am close to NYC I know that starting salaries are closer to \~70k. My first engineering intership I had was in NYC, so I am used to the travel there for work. Since my only debt is my loans, my father told me I can make double and triple payments on my private loans the first \~2-3 years, and that will lower them a substatial amount, especially if I get a good entry level job. At the moment, I'm not very worried about paying off my federal loans faster than my private loans, because the interest rates are lower. With my private loans, I have calculated that if I make double payments on my private loans they will be paid in about 5.5 years opposed to 15 years, and I will save &gt;$22,000 in interest. If I make a little more money I could pay even more than double payments too and pay them off even faster.

To Summarize:

\-I still need to pay for my last year of college and I really don't want to go further into debt, so I am hesitant about getting another loan, but it looks like its the only choice. (Go from 92.5k total in loans right now to \~128k total after graduating)

\-To deal with my loans, my plan is after I graduate I hope to find a good job in NYC while living with my parents. They said they wouldn't charge me anything for rent or food, and I will be able to put most of my salary into my private loans through double or more payments since I have no other debt, and I will likely just pay the minimum on my federal loans unless I can pay more since they are low interest.",finance

I rolled my LargeCo 401k into an IRA and a Roth IRA (both still with Fidelity), but would appreciate some advice/critiques from here:

* I already filed for 2019 at the beginning of the year, but with the deadline updated, I was planning on contributing as much as I can to my Roth IRA until July. Likely won't hit the $6k contribution limit.

* After July 2020, contributing as much as I can to my 2020 IRA and Roth IRA the for the rest of the year. Likely won't hit the limit.

* From 2021 onward, contributing around 10-12% of my paycheck until I hit the limit, at which point I'll redirect that contribution into a brokerage account.

I'm looking for the most aggressive growth I can get for the lowest fees, but also want to make sure I'm not missing out on any tax benefits that would end up being more valuable in the long-run if I just enrolled in the Slavic plan and ate the fees.

Background details:
- Age: 26
- Income: ~$90k
- Tax Filing: Single
- Residence: NYC
- Emergency Fund = 3 months
- IRA = ~$20k
- Roth IRA (started contributing in 2018) = ~$5k
- Federal Student Loans = ~$35k @ 4.5% (currently in forbearance due to COVID-19)

personalfinance,Using Everydollar as a budgeting app. Best advice for manual transaction habits.,"Hi,

So after being fed up with uncertainty and ignorance of where my money is going, I decided to bite the bullet and use a budgeting app. I tried *Mint*, only to get fed up with the weird and erratic budgeting system set in place. Then I tried *Mvelopes Plus* and while it was much better since it used a zero-based envelope system similar to *EveryDollar*, it was too confusing and tedious to use. Also, get this. **When I tried to access the learning center to learn how to use the app, I had to pay a Premium version to access the content and not the mere plus version. Seriously, how the heck am I supposed to use this tool if I have to pay even more?**

Anywho, I switched to *EveryDollar* recently and it was much better than the last two budgeting apps. The UX and UI was simple, straightforward, and gave me many incentives to go into the app to budget. I never encountered an app that made me more enthusiastic to budget that *EveryDollar*.

Anywho, I am using the free version since the $129 version is not too feasible for me at this time. That said, I would need to manually insert transactions. What scheduling and management tips do you suggest for manually entering transactions on a regular basis?

gaming,Tips for doing away with restart obsession ?,"Hello guys ! I'm currently struggling with some annoying obsession while gaming - currently No Man's Sky on PS4 - and wondering if any of you has been facing the same or got any advice to help deal with that.

It's like perfectionism except i want it to be perfect RP-wise and all according to some predefined idea of what the play should feel like. And i get so bummed with any minor mistake or deviation that i keep restarting over and over until the whole day is gone and i'm just feeling miserable, tired and fed up.

It's been going on for the last two weeks. Everyday i wake up and plan to just game two hours and then do other things like study and read. But instead i spend the whole day obsessing like that. Then the next morning i wake up and tell myself this time i'll game without obsessing and i fail and the whole pattern repeats.

The obsession is a cause for more obsession even for when i think about all the erased saves i feel it's a big mess and certainly not the way i wanted to play and now there is no going back to the clean slate.

My mom got me the PS4 as a birthday gift and now she's sad looking at me not managing to have fun. And i feel ashamed and stupid for obsessing over video games like that while it's just supposed to be a nice hobby and i should keep doing more constructive things as well

Please help ! May sound overly dramatic but i just want to enjoy games again as i used to and show mom her birthday gift wasn't in vain.",technology

devops,BI / Analytics / Reporting in a modern microservice stack,"Hi All

I'm a PM at an AgriTech BPM startup.

We're in the process of planning out the next version of our tech stack. We'll be breaking down our current +-5 year old PHP/jQuery/OrientDB monolith into (most likely) Nodejs/Vue.js/Couchbase etc microservices.

We currently use 2 separate components for reporting: Hand built frontend tables, graphs and the like for the basic ""inline"" stuff like KPI's and basic aggregated tables, charts etc, and then M$ Power BI for the more advanced dashboard-like stuff which we then embed. The latter is fed by ETL jobs that push data on a schedule into an Azure SQL DB. The licensing thereof is also damn near crippling TBH.

So with all that in mind, I'd very much like to hear your opinions on how/what/where to incorporate a reporting and BI solution. I'm basically trying to answer the following question:

Is it realistic to want to build one microservice that does everything from quick basic KPIs all the way up to complex dashboards and embedded reports?

* We're thinking along the lines of a Postgres instance with Cube.js and some form of Vue.js &amp; D3.js frontend that can be embedded, or even something like Plotly's Dash (Python substack). Ideally we'd like to be able to eventually hire a data analyst or 3 that can run with this with minimal input from Devs.
* Is there merit in splitting the two ends of the spectrum into basically what we have now, namely one component that sits inline on the frontend, that pulls from the production DB, but only ever remains a mini framework for the basics like the aforementioned KPIs and basic stuff, and then treating the proper embedded reports and dashboards as a separate thing. Also bear in mind the possible AI/ML components that may come along in future.

P.S. I'm trying to stay away from the Docker &amp; Kubernetes conversation on this specific point, but if it's relevant please feel free.

I've been accused of rambling on Reddit before, so please forgive if that's the case here.

Bitcoin,Where is Bitcoin Going and When?,"**﷽**

The Federal Reserve and the United States government are pumping  extreme amounts of money into the economy, already totaling over $484  billion. They are doing so because it already had a goal to inflate the  United States Dollar (USD) so that the market can continue to all-time  highs. It has always had this goal. They do not care how much inflation  goes up by now as we are going into a depression with the potential to  totally crash the US economy forever. They believe the only way to save  the market from going to zero or negative values is to inflate it so  much that it cannot possibly crash that low. Even if the market does not  dip that low, inflation serves the interest of powerful people.

The impending crash of the stock market has ramifications for  Bitcoin, as, though there is no direct ongoing-correlation between the  two, major movements in traditional markets will necessarily affect  Bitcoin. According to the Blockchain Center’s [Cryptocurrency Correlation Tool](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/cryptocurrency-correlation-study/),  Bitcoin is not correlated with the stock market. However, when major  market movements occur, they send ripples throughout the financial  ecosystem which necessary affect even ordinarily uncorrelated assets.

Therefore, Bitcoin will reach X price on X date after crashing to a price of X by X date.

## Stock Market Crash

The Federal Reserve has caused some serious consternation with their  release of ridiculous amounts of money in an attempt to buoy the  economy. At face value, it does not seem to have any rationale or logic  behind it other than keeping the economy afloat long enough for  individuals to profit financially and politically. However, there is an  underlying basis to what is going on which is important to understand in  order to profit financially.

All markets are functionally price probing systems. They constantly  undergo a price-discovery process. In a fiat system, money is an  illusory and a fundamentally synthetic instrument with no intrinsic  value – similar to Bitcoin. The primary difference between Bitcoin is  the underlying technology which provides a slew of benefits that fiat  does not. Fiat, however, has an advantage in being able to have the  support of powerful nation-states which can use their might to insure  the currency’s prosperity.

Traditional stock markets are composed of indices (pl. of index).  Indices are non-trading market instruments which are essentially  summaries of business values which comprise them. They are continuously  recalculated throughout a trading day, and sometimes reflected through  tradable instruments such as Exchange Traded Funds or Futures. Indices  are weighted by market capitalizations of various businesses.

Price theory essentially states that when a market fails to take out a  new low in a given range, it will have an objective to take out the  high. When a market fails to take out a new high, it has an objective to  make a new low. This is why price-time charts go up and down, as it  does this on a second-by-second, minute-by-minute, day-by-day, and even  century-by-century basis. Therefore, market indices will always return  to some type of bull market as, once a true low is formed, the market  will have a price objective to take out a new high outside of its’ given  range – which is an all-time high. Instruments can only functionally  fall to zero, whereas they can grow infinitely.

*So, why inflate the economy so much?*

Deflation is disastrous for central banks and markets as it raises  the possibility of producing an overall price objective of zero or  negative values. Therefore, under a fractional reserve system with a  fiat currency managed by a central bank – the goal of the central bank  is to depreciate the currency. The dollar is manipulated constantly with  the intention of depreciating its’ value.

Central banks have a goal of continued inflated fiat values. They  tend to ordinarily contain it at less than ten percent (10%) per annum  in order for the psyche of the general populace to slowly adjust price  increases. As such, the markets are divorced from any other logic.  Economic policy is the maintenance of human egos, not catering to  fundamental analysis. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is well-known  not to be a measure of actual growth or output. It is a measure of  increase in dollars processed. Banks seek to produce raising numbers  which make society feel like it is growing economically, making people  optimistic. To do so, the currency is inflated, though inflation itself  does not actually increase growth. When society is optimistic, it spends  and engages in business – resulting in actual growth. It also  encourages people to take on credit and debts, creating more fictional  fiat.

Inflation is necessary for markets to continue to reach new heights,  generating positive emotional responses from the populace, encouraging  spending, encouraging debt intake, further inflating the currency, and  increasing the sale of government bonds. The fiat system only survives  by generating more imaginary money on a regular basis.

Bitcoin investors may profit from this by realizing that stock  investors as a whole always stand to profit from the market so long as  it is managed by a central bank and does not collapse entirely. If those  elements are filled, it has an unending price objective to raise to new  heights. It also allows us to realize that this response indicates that  the higher-ups believe that the economy could crash in entirety, and it  may be wise for investors to have multiple well-thought-out exit  strategies.

## Economic Analysis of Bitcoin

The reason why the Fed is so aggressively inflating the economy is  due to fears that it will collapse forever or never rebound. As such,  coupled with a global depression, a huge demand will appear for a  reserve currency which is fundamentally different than the previous  system. Bitcoin, though a currency or asset, is also a market. It also  undergoes a constant price-probing process. Unlike traditional markets,  Bitcoin has the exact *opposite* goal. Bitcoin seeks to  appreciate in value and not depreciate. This has a quite different  affect in that Bitcoin could potentially become worthless and have a  price objective of zero.

Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a now famous mysterious figure known  as Satoshi Nakamoto and its’ open source code was released in 2009. It  was the first decentralized cryptocurrency to utilize a novel protocol  known as the blockchain. Up to one megabyte of data may be sent with  each transaction. It is decentralized, anonymous, transparent, easy to  set-up, and provides myriad other benefits. Bitcoin is not backed up by  anything other than its’ own technology.

Bitcoin is can never be expected to collapse as a framework, even  were it to become worthless. The stock market has the potential to  collapse in entirety, whereas, as long as the internet exists, Bitcoin  will be a functional system with a self-authenticating framework. That  capacity to persist regardless of the actual price of Bitcoin and the  deflationary nature of Bitcoin means that it has something which fiat  does not – inherent value.

Bitcoin is based on a distributed database known as the “blockchain.”  Blockchains are essentially decentralized virtual ledger books, replete  with pages known as “blocks.” Each page in a ledger is composed of  paragraph entries, which are the actual transactions in the block.

Blockchains store  information in the form of numerical transactions,  which are just numbers. We can consider these numbers digital assets,  such as Bitcoin. The data in a blockchain is immutable and recorded only  by consensus-based algorithms. Bitcoin is cryptographic and all  transactions are direct, without intermediary, peer-to-peer.

Bitcoin does not require trust in a central bank. It requires trust  on the technology behind it, which is open-source and may be evaluated  by anyone at any time. Furthermore, it is impossible to manipulate as  doing so would require all of the nodes in the network to be hacked at  once – unlike the stock market which is manipulated by the government  and “Market Makers”. Bitcoin is also private in that, though the ledge  is openly distributed, it is encrypted. Bitcoin’s blockchain has one of  the greatest redundancy and information disaster recovery systems ever  developed.

Bitcoin has a distributed governance model in that it is controlled  by its’ users. There is no need to trust a payment processor or bank, or  even to pay fees to such entities. There are also no third-party fees  for transaction processing. As the ledge is immutable and transparent it  is never possible to change it – the data on the blockchain is  permanent. The system is not easily susceptible to attacks as it is  widely distributed. Furthermore, as users of Bitcoin have their private  keys assigned to their transactions, they are virtually impossible to  fake. No lengthy verification, reconciliation, nor clearing process  exists with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is based on a proof-of-work algorithm. Every transaction on  the network has an associated mathetical “puzzle”. Computers known as  miners compete to solve the complex cryptographic hash algorithm that  comprises that puzzle. The solution is proof that the miner engaged in  sufficient work. The puzzle is known as a nonce, a number used only  once. There is only one major nonce at a time and it issues 12.5  Bitcoin. Once it is solved, the fact that the nonce has been solved is  made public.

A block is mined on average of once every ten minutes. However, the  blockchain checks every 2,016,000 minutes (approximately four years) if  201,600 blocks were mined. If it was faster, it increases difficulty by  half, thereby deflating Bitcoin. If it was slower, it decreases, thereby  inflating Bitcoin. It will continue to do this until zero Bitcoin are  issued, projected at the year 2140. On the twelfth of May, 2020, the  blockchain will halve the amount of Bitcoin issued when each nonce is  guessed. When Bitcoin was first created, fifty were issued per block as a  reward to miners. 6.25 BTC will be issued from that point on once each  nonce is solved.

Unlike fiat, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. As BTC becomes  scarcer, demand for it will increase, also raising the price. In this,  BTC is similar to gold. It is predictable in its’ output, unlike the  USD, as it is based on a programmed supply. We can predict BTC’s  deflation and inflation almost exactly, if not exactly. Only 21 million  BTC will ever be produced, unless the entire network concedes to change  the protocol – which is highly unlikely.

Some of the drawbacks to BTC include congestion. At peak congestion,  it may take an entire day to process a Bitcoin transaction as only three  to five transactions may be processed per second. Receiving priority on  a payment may cost up to the equivalent of twenty dollars ($20).  Bitcoin mining consumes enough energy in one day to power a  single-family home for an entire week.

## Trading or Investing?

The fundamental divide in trading revolves around the question of  market structure. Many feel that the market operates totally randomly  and its’ behavior cannot be predicted. For the purposes of this article,  we will assume that the market has a structure, but that that structure  is not perfect. That market structure naturally generates chart  patterns as the market records prices in time. In order to determine  when the stock market will crash, causing a major decline in BTC price,  we will analyze an instrument, an exchange traded fund, which represents  an index, as opposed to a particular stock. The price patterns of the  various stocks in an index are effectively smoothed out. In doing so, a  more technical picture arises. Perhaps the most popular of these is the  SPDR S&amp;P Standard and Poor 500 Exchange Traded Fund ($SPY).

In trading, little to no concern is given about value of underlying  asset. We are concerned primarily about liquidity and trading ranges,  which are the amount of value fluctuating on a short-term basis, as  measured by volatility-implied trading ranges. Fundamental analysis  plays a role, however markets often do not react to real-world factors  in a logical fashion. Therefore, fundamental analysis is more  appropriate for long-term investing.

The fundamental derivatives of a chart are time (x-axis) and price  (y-axis). The primary technical indicator is price, as everything else  is lagging in the past. Price represents current asking price and  incorrectly implementing positions based on price is one of the biggest  trading errors.

Markets and currencies ordinarily have noise, their tendency to  back-and-fill, which must be filtered out for true pattern recognition.  That noise does have a utility, however, in allowing traders second  chances to enter favorable positions at slightly less favorable entry  points. When you have any market with enough liquidity for historical  data to record a pattern, then a structure can be divined. The market  probes prices as part of an ongoing price-discovery process. Market  technicians must sometimes look outside of the technical realm and use  visual inspection to ascertain the relevance of certain patterns, using a  qualitative eye that recognizes the underlying quantitative nature

Markets and instruments rise slower than they correct, however they  rise much more than they fall. In the same vein, instruments can only  fall to having no worth, whereas they could theoretically grow  infinitely and have continued to grow over time. Money in a fiat system  is illusory. It is a fundamentally synthetic instrument which has no  intrinsic value. Hence, the recent seemingly illogical fluctuations in  the market.

According to trade theory, the unending purpose of a market or  instrument is to create and break price ranges according to the laws of  supply and demand. We must determine when to trade based on each market  inflection point as defined in price and in time as opposed to  abandoning the trend (as the contrarian trading in this sub often does).  Time and Price symmetry must be used to be in accordance with the  trend. When coupled with a favorable risk to reward ratio, the ability  to stay in the market for most of the defined time period, and adherence  to risk management rules; the trader has a solid methodology for  achieving considerable gains.

We will engage in a longer term market-oriented analysis to avoid any  time-focused pressure. The Bitcoin market is open twenty-four-hours a  day, so trading may be done when the individual is ready, without any  pressing need to be constantly alert. Let alone, we can safely project  months in advance with relatively high accuracy. Bitcoin is an asset  which an individual can both trade and invest, however this article will  be focused on trading due to the wide volatility in BTC prices over the  short-term.

## Technical Indicator Analysis of Bitcoin

Technical indicators are often considered self-fulfilling prophecies  due to mass-market psychology gravitating towards certain common numbers  yielded from them. They are also often discounted when it comes to BTC.  That means a trader must be especially aware of these numbers as they  can prognosticate market movements. Often, they are meaningless in the  larger picture of things.

* *Volume* – derived from the market itself, it is mostly  irrelevant. The major problem with volume for stocks is that the US  market open causes tremendous volume surges eradicating any intrinsic  volume analysis. This does not occur with BTC, as it is open  twenty-four-seven. At major highs and lows, the market is typically  anemic. Most traders are not active at terminal discretes (peaks and  troughs) because of levels of fear. Volume allows us confidence in time  and price symmetry market inflection points, if we observe low volume at  a foretold range of values. We can rationalize that an absolute  discrete is usually only discovered and anticipated by very few traders.  As the general market realizes it, a herd mentality will push the  market in the direction favorable to defending it. Volume is also useful  for swing trading, as chances for swing’s validity increases if an  increase in volume is seen on and after the swing’s activation. Volume  is steadily decreasing. Lows and highs are reached when volume is lower.

Therefore, due to the relatively high volume on the 12th of March, we can safely determine that a low for BTC *was not* reached.

* *VIX* – Volatility Index, this technical indicator  indicates level of fear by the amount of options-based “insurance” in  portfolios. A low VIX environment, less than 20 for the S&amp;P index,  indicates a stable market with a possible uptrend. A high VIX, over 20,  indicates a possible downtrend. VIX is essentially useless for BTC as  BTC-based options do not exist. It allows us to predict the market low  for $SPY, which will have an indirect impact on BTC in the short term,  likely leading to the yearly low. However, it is equally important to  see how VIX is changing over time, if it is decreasing or increasing, as  that indicates increasing or decreasing fear. Low volatility allows  high leverage without risk or rest. Occasionally, markets do rise with  high VIX.

As VIX is unusually high, in the forties, we can be confident that a downtrend for the S&amp;P 500 is imminent.

* RSI (Relative Strength Index): The most important technical  indicator, useful for determining highs and lows when time symmetry is  not availing itself. Sometimes analysis of RSI can conflict in different  time frames, easiest way to use it is when it is at extremes – either  under 30 or over 70. Extremes can be used for filtering highs or lows  based on time-and-price window calculations. Highly instructive as to  major corrective clues and indicative of continued directional movement.  Must determine if longer-term RSI values find support at same values as  before. It is currently at 73.56.
* Secondly, RSI may be used as a high or low filter, to observe  the level that short-term RSI reaches in counter-trend corrections.  Repetitions based on market movements based on RSI determine how long a  trade should be held onto. Once a short term RSI reaches an extreme and  stay there, the other RSI’s should gradually reach the same extremes.  Once all RSI’s are at extreme highs, a trend confirmation should occur  and RSI’s should drop to their midpoint.

## Trend Definition Analysis of Bitcoin

Trend definition is highly powerful, cannot be understated. Knowledge  of trend logic is enough to be a profitable trader, yet defining a  trend is an arduous process. Multiple trends coexist across multiple  time frames and across multiple market sectors. Like time structure, it  makes the underlying price of the instrument irrelevant. Trend  definitions cannot determine the validity of newly formed discretes.  Trend becomes apparent when trades based in counter-trend inflection  points continue to fail.

Downtrends are defined as an instrument making lower lows and lower  highs that are recurrent, additive, qualified swing setups. Downtrends  for all instruments are similar, except forex. They are fast and  complete much quicker than uptrends. An average downtrend is 18 months,  something which we will return to. An uptrend inception occurs when an  instrument reaches a point where it fails to make a new low, then that  low will be tested. After that, the instrument will either have a deep  range retracement or it may take out the low slightly, resulting in a  double-bottom. A swing must eventually form.

A simple way to roughly determine trend is to attempt to draw a line  from three tops going upwards (uptrend) or a line from three bottoms  going downwards (downtrend). It is not possible to correctly draw a  downtrend line on the BTC chart, but it is possible to correctly draw an  uptrend – indicating that the overall trend is downwards. The only  mitigating factor is the impending stock market crash.

&amp;#x200B;

## Time Symmetry Analysis of Bitcoin

Time is the movement from the past through the present into the  future. It is a measurement in quantified intervals. In many ways, our  perception of it is a human construct. It is more powerful than price as  time may be utilized for a trade regardless of the market inflection  point’s price. Were it possible to perfectly understand time, price  would be totally irrelevant due to the predictive certainty time  affords. Time structure is easier to learn than price, but much more  difficult to apply with any accuracy. It is the hardest aspect of  trading to learn, but also the most rewarding.

Humans do not have the ability to recognize every time window,  however the ability to define market inflection points in terms of time  is the single most powerful trading edge. Regardless, price should not  be abandoned for time alone. Time structure analysis It is inherently  flawed, as such the markets have a fail-safe, which is Price Structure.  Even though Time is much more powerful, Price Structure should never be  completely ignored. Time is the qualifier for Price and vice versa. Time  can fail by tricking traders into counter-trend trading.

Time is a predestined trade quantifier, a filter to slow trades down,  as it allows a trader to specifically focus on specific time windows  and rest at others. It allows for quantitative measurements to reach  deterministic values and is the primary qualifier for trends. Time  structure should be utilized before price structure, and it is the  primary trade criterion which requires support from price. We can see  price structure on a chart, as areas of mathematical support or  resistance, but we cannot see time structure.

Time may be used to tell us an exact point in the future where the  market will inflect, after Price Theory has been fulfilled. In the  present, price objectives based on price theory added to possible future  times for market inflection points give us the exact time of market  inflection points and price.

Time Structure is repetitions of time or inherent cycles of time,  occurring in a methodical way to provide time windows which may be  utilized for inflection points. They are not easily recognized and not  easily defined by a price chart as measuring and observing time is very  exact. Time structure is not a science, yet it does require precise  measurements. Nothing is certain or definite. The critical question must  be if a particular approach to time structure is currently lucrative or  not.

We will measure it in intervals of 180 bars. Our goal is to determine  time windows, when the market will react and when we should pay the  most attention. By using time repetitions, the fact that market  inflection points occurred at some point in the past and should,  therefore, reoccur at some point in the future, we should obtain  confidence as to when SPY will reach a market inflection point. Time  repetitions are essentially the market’s memory. However, simply  measuring the time between two points then trying to extrapolate into  the future does not work. Measuring time is not the same as defining  time repetitions. We will evaluate past sessions for market inflection  points, whether discretes, qualified swings, or intra-range. Then  records the times that the market has made highs or lows in a comparable  time period to the future one seeks to trade in.

What follows is a time Histogram – A grouping of times which appear  close together, then segregated based on that closeness. Time is aligned  into combined histogram of repetitions and cycles, however cycles are  irrelevant on a daily basis. If trading on an hourly basis, do not use  hours.

* Yearly Lows (last seven years): 1/1/13, 4/10/14, 1/15/15, 1/17/16, 1/1/17, 12/15/18, 2/6/19

Weighted Times are repetitions which appears multiple times within  the same list, observed and accentuated once divided into relevant  sections of the histogram. They are important in the presently defined  trading time period and are similar to a mathematical mode with respect  to a series. Phased times are essentially periodical patterns in  histograms, though they do not guarantee inflection points

Evaluating the yearly lows, we see that BTC tends to have its lows  primarily at the beginning of every year, with a possibility of it being  at the end of the year. Following the same methodology, we get the  middle of the month as the likeliest day. However, evaluating the  monthly lows for the past year, the beginning and end of the month are  more likely for lows.

Therefore, we have two primary dates from our histogram.

*1/1/21, 1/15/21*, *and 1/29/21*

*2:00am, 8:00am, 12:00pm, or 10:00pm*

In fact, the high for this year was February the 14th, only thirty days off from our histogram calculations.

The *8.6-Year Armstrong-Princeton Global Economic Confidence*  model states that 2.15 year intervals occur between corrections,  relevant highs and lows. 2.15 years from the all-time peak discrete is  February 9, 2020 – a reasonably accurate depiction of the low for this  year (which was on 3/12/20). (Taking only the Armstrong model into  account, the next high should be Saturday, April 23, 2022). Therefore,  the Armstrong model indicates that we have actually bottomed out for the  year!

*Bear markets* cannot exist in perpetuity whereas bull markets  can. Bear markets will eventually have price objectives of zero,  whereas bull markets can increase to infinity. It can occur for  individual market instruments, but not markets as a whole. Since bull  markets are defined by low volatility, they also last longer. Once a  bull market is indicated, the trader can remain in a long position until  a new high is reached, then switch to shorts. The average bear market  is eighteen months long, giving us a date of August 19th, 2021 for the  end of this bear market – roughly speaking. They cannot be shorter than  fifteen months for a central-bank controlled market, which does not  apply to Bitcoin. (Otherwise, it would continue until Sunday, September  12, 2021.) However, we should expect Bitcoin to experience its’  exponential growth after the stock market re-enters a bull market.

*Terry Laundy’s T-Theory* implemented by measuring the time of  an indicator from peak to trough, then using that to define a future  time window. It is similar to an head-and-shoulders pattern in that it  is the process of forming the right side from a synthetic technical  indicator. If the indicator is making continued lows, then time is  recalculated  for defining the right side of the T. The date of the  market inflection point may be a price or indicator inflection date, so  it is not always exactly useful. It is better to make us aware of  possible market inflection points, clustered with other data. It gives  us an RSI low of May, 9th 2020.

*The Bradley Cycle* is coupled with volatility allows start  dates for campaigns or put options as insurance in portfolios for  stocks. However, it is also useful for predicting market moves instead  of terminal dates for discretes. Using dates which correspond to  discretes, we can see how those dates correspond with changes in VIX.

Therefore, our timeline looks like:

* 2/14/20 – yearly high ($10372 USD)
* 3/12/20 – yearly low thus far ($3858 USD)
* 5/9/20 – T-Theory true yearly low (BTC between 4863 and 3569)
* 5/26/20 – hashrate difficulty halvening
* 11/14/20 – [stock market low](http://aliamin.info/2020/04/what-is-the-stock-market-doing/)
* 1/15/21 – yearly low for BTC, around $8528
* 8/19/21 – end of stock bear market
* 11/26/21 – eighteen months from halvening, average peak from halvenings (BTC begins rising from $3000 area to above $23,312)
* 4/23/22 – all-time high

I refinanced 3 different loans (the lion's  share were private already) and consolidated them to a single payment.   I went from several loans with 8 and 12% interest down to a single loan of 5.9%.

I  am terrified of rocking the boat right now.  However, I know that  refinancing when the economy is slow is advantageous due to lower  interest rates.  I was able to get a great rate, but I want a second  opinion before I pull the trigger:

investing,"Homeowners in Forbearance Top 3.4 Million, Up 17% in a Week","By John Gittelsohn
(Bloomberg) -- U.S. homeowners seeking to delay mortgage
payments topped 3.4 million, up 17% from a week earlier, as the
coronavirus pandemic continued to ravage the economy, according
to a report by Black Knight Inc.

About 6.4% of mortgage borrowers have entered forbearance
plans since Congress passed legislation in March allowing them
to defer payments for initial periods as long as 180 days. The
rate jumped from 5.5%, or approximately 2.9 million borrowers, a
week earlier, according to Black Knight, a mortgage information
service based in Jacksonville, Florida.

“The forbearance numbers are climbing steadily, day by
day,” Chief Executive Officer Anthony Jabbour said.
The number of Americans seeking payment relief likely will
continue to soar until people are able to go back to their jobs.
Under the federal relief act, borrowers are obligated to
eventually make up the missed payments to avoid damage to their
credit rating or possible foreclosure.

More than 26 million workers have filed unemployment claims
in the past five weeks as businesses, schools and other job
sites were ordered closed to arrest the pace of infections.
Servicers that collect payments on home loans sold to
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still required to advance money
to holders of government-backed mortgage bonds for four months
of the forbearance period, under an agreement reached this week.
“Even knowing that time limit, with today’s number of
forbearance plans, servicers are still looking at more than $7
billion in advances over those four months,” Jabbour said in the
report.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has no plans to fund
the nonbank mortgage servicers that will be required to make the
advance payments, he said in an interview late Thursday with
Bloomberg News.

“We’re not looking at a Fed facility for this at this
time,” Mnuchin said. Large servicers probably “have the
liquidity to withstand a fairly large increase in forbearances
and/or delinquencies.”

About 5.6% of the 27.9 million Fannie and Freddie borrowers
missed payments, compared with 8.9% of the 12.1 million
borrowers of Ginnie Mae loans, which are government-backed
mortgages for borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller
down payments. The forbearance rate was 5.7% for the 12.9
million loans without government backing that are held on bank
balance sheets, owned by investors or packaged into bonds.",finance
personalfinance,Right time to buy a car?,"I moved to Denver a few years ago and sold my car before the move. I don't ""need"" a car per se, I live 1.5 miles from my job and am happy walking, scooting, biking to work. Grocery store is a mile away and I have a roommate with a car so I usually go with him. The only times I find myself really needing transportation is when I go hiking or snowboarding, which I go with friends anyways and provide gas money every time.

Here's my conundrum. Financially I'm pretty stable. My job is tied to government communication (software company) which means there's a low risk of losing it. I have $18k in savings not counting retirement, plus $5k in index funds (lol) also not counting retirement. I'm able to save $1k per month clean after 401k (10%) and HSA contributions. So I believe I can afford a car.

If I don't buy a car now, am I missing out on a great deal? I feel like where interest rates are and considering the tough spot dealerships must be in I would have a lot of leverage right now which could end up saving me money. While I don't ""Need"" a car, it would be nice to be completely independent and not feel like I'm mooching by always asking for rides for activities.

**Unemployment Insurance Taxes**

&gt;Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a federal-state program jointly financed through Federal and state employer payroll taxes (federal/state UI tax). Generally, employers must pay both state and Federal unemployment taxes if:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(1)** they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500, or more, in any quarter of a calendar year; or,  
&gt;  
&gt;**(2)** they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether or not the weeks were consecutive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Federal Unemployment Tax Act**

&gt;The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), authorizes the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) to collect a Federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. Employers pay this tax annually by filing IRS Form 940. FUTA covers the costs of administering the UI and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits (during periods of high unemployment) and provides for a fund from which states may borrow, if necessary, to pay benefits.",finance

I am not sure if this is the right sub for this, so please let me know if it is not.

Background:

In 2013 I attended Berkeley City College in California and ended up dropping two courses, which resulted in a Federal Pell Grant overpayment. This debt was eventually sent to the department of education collections and was paid off entirely.

I have since decided to re-enroll in courses for a second AA degree at De Anza college in Cupertino, CA.

While waiting to receive my Pell Grant, I was notified by De Anza college that there was a hold placed on my financial aid and that my aid could not be awarded because of the overpayment, and that this hold was from Berkeley City College.

I have contacted the Department of Education collections and obtained a letter stating that the debt was paid in full and that it is no longer owed and sent this to De Anza college to release my award. They then informed me that this letter was not good enough, and that I needed a letter from the original school (Berkeley City College) stating that the debt had been paid.

The original school is flat out refusing to give me any sort of letter, telling me that the debt is no longer with them and has been sent to the department of education collections.

I am basically in the position that all three institutions are having me run in circles and trying to place the blame on each other. I have already had to drop my courses for the quarter because I cannot afford school without the aid. I have been trying to reach out to these institutions for weeks with absolutely zero help from any of them.

Someone in this situation clearly has inaccurate information about a debt, which I am assuming is the original school, as I can literally see the hold when I log into my student account. Yet they continue to tell me they have nothing to do with it.

I am looking for any resources or laws on fair reporting that might be of use, as I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. I just want to get my aid so that I can go back to school.

Thanks in advance.",finance

We have barely anything saved for retirement (read: ~$5,000), and have a 9 year-old daughter. We want to start a business within 10 years, and knowing many business-owners have leveraged their retirement accounts and/or houses, we're open to that despite it being a gamble. We do not own a house – we live in Seattle, and probably never will own a house here. We've considered starting a small farm as it's very related to what our business would be.

All that said, I don't know if I should start a fund that is as strict as a retirement account, or start something more liquid if we think we're going to draw from it for business-purposes. We do qualify for a home-buying program that would get us into a home for under $300,000 (very competitive compared to Seattle's median home sale value over $700,000), but we're not sure we want to be tied to a home that doesn't have land or even a yard.

Would love some guidance about what sort of account to open, what sort of funds to include, and who to go through. I do like M1's interface, but know that smarter investors tend not to use them because there's no tax-loss harvesting (which I have no clue what that is).

investing,Hedging Portfolio with TED Spread,"Hi all.

Just wondering if it is possible to hedge stock market exposure by holding a short Eurodollar position and long 2 year treasury position. I know TED spread is technically 3 month vs. 3 month though. My idea is that credit risk rises during a crash so TED spread widens, and the Eurodollars hedge interest rate risk of a purely long treasury position. Also ignore the fact that TED spread is pretty high right now - I'm looking at implementing this later on.

I have the following questions since I am inexperienced with interest rate futures:

1. What ratio of GE:ZT should I be holding? I know GE face value is $1m vs. ZT of $200k but how does DV01 come into things?
2. How much leverage should I generally be using to sufficiently hedge market exposure? e.g. turn 1 -&gt; 0-0.5 market correlation
3. Does shorting GE implicitly go long 3 month T bill since you are lending/borrowing at the risk free rate?
4. Any other things I should be considering?",finance
personalfinance,I need advice on student loan management,"Hey yall, I am financially illiterate and this is probably the best place i could turn to. I am a graduating med student with quite a bit of loans  sitting on me. After doing a bit of reading, I have decided to go with REPAYE as a repayment plan for the duration of my residency and fellowship (6 years total). i am currently considering 3 ways of tackling these loans. for reference, my targeted monthly allocated budget for student loans is about $500-1000. probably will settle around $800.

The loans in questions are in order of latest to oldest:

1. 5000 principal at 6.08% fixed  \[$116 interest so far\]
2. 30000 principal at 6.08% fixed \[$999 interest so far\]
3. 15000 principal at 6% fixed \[$1408 interest so far\]
4. 19827 principal at 5.31% fixed \[ 2978 interest so far\]
5. 28000 principal at 6% fixed \[4,124 interest so far\]

***Principal total of 97827 and 9625 interest total.***

**course of action #1.**

Consolidate my federal loans and apply for REPAYE with an attempt to get a $0 payment for a year. With REPAYE, the government subsidizes 50% of my interest based on my readings.   
I am unsure if under this method, id still be able to pay off my interest monthly or if that would be in violation of the $0 monthly payment.  
***So the total would be approximately $107,452 at 5.89%. Monthly interest of $530. I would be responsible for $265.05 monthly.*** 

Then hypothetically i'd have somewhere around $500-700 left from my budget that i could put towards the principal? This would only be for a year until next tax period where i'll update my lender with new income and monthly payment will then look like course of action #2

&amp;#x200B;

**Course of action #2.**

Consolidate federal loans with REPAYE without $0 monthly payment. minimum payment is about $300. then government splits difference of $230 with me. so total, id pay $300+115= $415 interest. and i could put some $300-500 remaining from my budget towards the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

**course of action #3.**

Take the 6 months grace period from june till november where i am not expected to make payments to attempt to pay some of my interest off. My first paycheck is not until the end of july  so id maybe get 5 payments in of average $800/month or $4000 total. 

During this period the principal would still be yielding interest (according to my knowledge) which would be around $480 monthly, and over 6months would be $2880 total. so based on my possibly wrong math, id pay off $4000 from a total of (9625+2880). so $8505 would still capitalize. 

This option feels like a futile effort but im not sure if im missing something. Feels as if it would be a great choice if i had some money somewhere to help pay the interest. But i do not.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice - freelance tax questions,"I’m a (19f) college student who’s currently living at home until classes are no longer online. I’m posting this on multiple subreddits because I’m honestly really overwhelmed - feel free to remove if it isn’t relevant. Due to…various situations, most of which are related to abuse and parental manipulation, I’ve never been allowed to have a job/income. I need to get out at some point, and an income seems like a good first step. I have plans to open an online checking account - the one I have now is a shared account with one parent. Right now, my only goal is to have some income my parents can’t control, to save, and to occasionally spend on some of my hobbies. I’m looking into freelancing - I don’t have many skills, but I can type quickly and was always pretty decent in school, so I’m considering transcribing and proofreading, things like that. My issue is with income tax - honestly, I’m just overwhelmed by all of this, and I feel kind of awful for asking. I’m sure most people know these things, but my parents were never the type to teach me “adult” skills or even let me learn on my own. I’ve started researching things on my own, but I’m still confused about most tax-related things and I’m really paranoid of messing something up. There’s no adult I can ask for advice, and reading online articles has left me more confused than before. 

I’m in the US, for starters. I know my state income is a flat tax, I know what the rate is, and I know what the standard deduction is - does that mean, if I make less than that amount, I don’t have to pay state income tax? For federal taxes, the standard deduction is higher - so in theory, I could be making enough to pay state income tax, but not federal? Also, I know the federal self employment tax rate - but I’m assuming at the state level, there isn’t any different rate for self employment because it’s a flat tax? 

I’m also probably claimed as a dependent on my parents’ taxes - does that affect how I file income tax, or could they get in trouble for having me as a dependent if I’m filing my own taxes? And when it comes to actually paying - I’ve heard recommendations for freelancers to pay the federal income tax online in four payment periods, but I don’t know how to find out if state tax works the same way. I do know that both can be filed online - would that just be a transfer of money from a checking account, plus the necessary paperwork? I can’t even make sense of what paperwork is supposed to be done when, or what date(s) the money is actually due.

And speaking of paperwork - it’s the 1099-MISC for freelancers I think, and I’m pretty sure a W-9 is necessary too - are these done for tax returns, or when the payments are submitted, or something else? A 1040 or 1040-ES is for returns, but which do I do? Do I have to file a Schedule C if there aren’t any business expenses? I don’t know if there are any important dates or other things I’m missing. I know freelancers have to do an estimated tax payment, but I’m not quite sure how that works - I’ve heard to expect 25-30% of freelance income for taxes, but I don’t know if there’s any other way to calculate it. 

Also - after all these questions, would Turbotax/H&amp;R be worth it: should I pay for tax help, find a free resource, or try to do it on my own? I’ll have income from a couple different freelance sites - do I have to report that any different way? Is it good enough to keep a monthly spreadsheet of income/expenses, date, etc. or do I need to record things any other way?",finance

personalfinance,Stolen Car. Now total loss. Question about car financing.,"My car was stolen well over a month ago and was deemed a total loss about 3 weeks ago. The amount insurance settled for paid off the loan +$2,000 extra. On my credit report my loan still says I owe $11,000, even though it was paid off about 3 weeks ago. I'm not expecting it to come off of my credit report for another few weeks, but I need to finance another car. 

For some background info, I have a credit score around 770 but have only 2 accounts, one of them being the auto loan. I'm starting a new job next month where I'll be increasing my yearly salary by about 45k.

My question is should I apply for another loan even though it may say I still owe on my previous auto loan? Will I not be approved or have a really high interest rate? I also heard that if you do pay off your auto loan it may decrease your credit score and take months to recover. So should I strategically apply for a loan before it shows up the credit report? 

I'm wanting to get the car soon because theres a 0.0% apr financing deal ending in a few days, but I wouldn't want to apply for it if I would just turn around and get rejected (car is under $25,000). I have a car i'm borrowing but in 3 weeks I'll have to get another car regardless. So is it best to wait 3 weeks with fingers crossed it's off my credit report, or apply this week knowing it'll still be on my report? 

I'm concerned because I have been denied an auto loan previously after being involved in a wreck and the car being totaled. The previous car loan was still on my report when I applied, but my yearly salary was under 15k at that time. My credit score dipped because of all of it, but eventually recovered and I was able to apply for another loan and get approved (once everything cleared on my credit report).

Basically, I live in China and have lived in China for 3 years, give or take. I'm originally from the US and that's were I got my federal student loans (I have no personal loans).

After I graduated, I moved here and when I tried to e-mail my student loan place they refused to work with me via e-mail in any way so I got frustrated, stopped trying, and then... promptly forgot about them.

I live and work at a Chinese university, I could basically afford to pay the interest on my loans and that's it.

To sum it up, it has been 3 months since starting this process and finally now there is some light at the end of the tunnel.  In some respects, I want to stop thinking about it and just be done with it. 

New mortgage detail: 20 year $350,000 loan at 3.5 percent at no cost. Initially, my lender quoted me 3.25 three months ago then Covid-19 happened and the rates temporarily went up. Now, seems like rates have come down again. Although, my lender already locked in my rate.  For some reason, my lender never asked me about locking the rate and did it on his own. Not sure if this is something lenders could do. 

Overall this refinance would put me on a accelerated pace to pay-off my mortgage and about $50 a month more in payment. I am aware of the argument that I can always go 30 year route and pay-off on accelerated pace. But knowing my self and my finances, there always will be an excuse to not pay extra. 

Two questions: (1) providing closing is so close and rates have gone down. Should I do something about it? Especially when the lender did not ask for my consent for a rate lock?  I feel like I maybe able to score 3.1 -3.25 on a 20 year.

(2) With interest rate being historically low, should I even bother with 20 year?  I would love to invest that difference, but boy have I made some terrible terrible “investment” decisions.  Part of me know that the difference will just go directly to some monthly expense.

personalfinance,"After audit in 2019, my 401k contributions were forfeited. Did my company reimburse me fairly in 2020?","I was hired full time in June of 2019. The HR/payroll employee set up my 401k after the 90-day period before enrollment as she would with any other new hire. 

Ultimately, I was told that I was not eligible to be enrolled until the beginning of 2020. This is because I was an existing employee of the same company (summer job) in 2015.

The HR person admitted fault for incorrectly enrolling me because she was unaware of my prior work at the company. She could easily have found in our payroll system that I had worked previously, and this was not asked of me as she helped me enroll.

I do not know if my company has an obligation to reimburse me for the forfeiture - but they did in January of 2020. At the time, I was just glad to have gotten back money that I had lost. 

Around $1300 was the sum of my contributions in 2019. The company contributes $3% of gross income regardless of individual contributions. I added an additional 12% which was taken out of my paycheck. My contributions were pre-taxed (not Roth-IRA)

I was reimbursed in January of 2020 on an individual payperiod with the net contribution to my 401k equalling the amount forfeited ~$1300.

At the time that my money was forfeited I had earned about %25 in gains from the high risk 401k plan I had selected I do not think it is worth the trouble to ask for additional payment for this because, apparently, I not should have been eligible for the 401k to begin with. I don't have other investments or debt so the opportunity cost is not of my concern.

I bring this up because I am unsure if the way I was reimbursed puts me at a tax-disadvantage for 2020 or 2019. I have yet to receive my refund or stimulus check, and I do not know if the irregularities of the forfeiture have anything to do with this. 

I am curious what you have to say about this. Is there a better way for my company to have reimbursed me? Was the structure correct? Am I at a tax disadvantage in 2020 because my gross income is already inflated by the same amount of income that had been reported, and subsequently lost, in 2019? 

additional info: 

I had a 2019 company bonus (profit sharing) which was taxed differently than my 2020 reimbursement for my 401k.On my paystub, The 401k reimbursement is labled ""Regular $"" in its own category similar to the bonus which was labled ""Bonus"". The difference is that the 401k reimbursement paid $0 in federal taxes whereas the profit sharing bonus did. Hopefully that is helpful information.

investing,Stay defensive,"Yo, I came across a very interesting read: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1813987?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents 

It talks about interest rates during the Civil War and WW1. To summarize, the market rate of interest should generally follow the below formula:

Interest Rates = Pure Interest + Risk Premia + Frictions

Where pure interest is the risk-free rate (set by time preferences) and the risk premia consists of: risk of default, currency devaluation (relevant if $ pegged to gold), risk of high inflation etc. During war periods, you would expect all three factors to rise.

During the Civil War interest rates generally did increase. However, during WW1, the U.S. increased the money supply so voluminously that interest rates stayed level until 1917. The takeaway is that monetary policy is far more powerful than the supply / demand actions of the population.

The kicker -- the U.S. entered two sharp recessions following WW1 as reserve requirements stretched thin needed to be scaled back and the money supply curtailed as to maintain convertibility to gold. 

We have a similar situation in COVID world. The fed has set reserve requirements to 0 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm Also, the fed is dumping dollars into the market ($40B daily), buying securitized corp debt (unprecedented) and even non-IG debt! We are witnessing a 1-m rally in the equity markets during 20% unemployment. 

What will happen when this ends? Will this even need to end? Clearly it will need to end to some degree. Reserve requirements cannot stay at 0%. But does the Fed's balance sheet need to shrink? The answer is unclear. But, we do not need to maintain convertibility to gold unlike post-WW1. Also, during WW1, the economy faced immense inflation (+10%) which is not a factor here. 

I am not advocating for a complete shift to cash. The market and the fed's balance sheet can stay elevated far longer than what you think is possible. I am however advocating for caution and an awareness that asset prices could collapse anytime. Buy nothing that you wouldn't hold for 1 economic cycle.",finance

Bitcoin,"The Intellectual Foundation of Bitcoin比特幣的智識基礎. By Chapman Chen, HKBNews","&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:** Bitcoin was invented by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto as recently as 2008, but it is backed up by a rich intellectual foundation. For instance, The 1776 First Amendment separates church and state, and contemporary American liberation psychologist Nozomi Hayase (2020) argues that money and state should similarly be separated. Just as Isaac Newton’s study of alchemy gave rise to the international gold standard, so has the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto's desire for a “modernized gold standard” given rise to Bitcoin. Indeed, Bloomberg's 2020 report confirms Bitcoin to be gold 2.0. Montesquieu (1774) asserted that laws that secure inalienable rights can only be found in Nature, and the natural laws employed in Bitcoin include its consensus algorithm and the three natural laws of economics (self-interest, competition, and supply and demand). J.S. Mill (1859) preferred free markets to those controlled by governments. Ludwig von Mises (1951) argued against the hazards of fiat currency, urging for a return to the gold standard. Friedrich Hayek (1984) suggested people to invent a sly way to take money back from the hands of the government. Milton Friedman (1994) called for FED to be replaced by an automatic system and predicted the coming of a reliable e-cash. James Buchanan (1988) advocated a monetary constitution to constrain the governmental power of money creation. Tim May (1997) the cypherpunk proclaimed that restricting digital cash impinges on free speech, and envisioned a stateless digital form of money that is uncensorable. The Tofflers (2006) pictured a non-monetary economy. In 2016, UCLA Professor of Finance Bhagwan Chowdhry even nominated Satoshi for a Nobel Prize. 

**Full Text:** 

**Separation between money and state** 

The 1791 First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrines free speech and separates church and state, but not money and state. ""Under the First Amendment, individuals’ right to create, choose their own money and transact freely was not recognized as a part of freedom of expression that needs to be protected,"" Japanese-American liberation psychologist Nozomi Hayase (2020) points out (1). 

The government, banks and corporations collude together to encroach upon people's liberties by metamorphosing their inalienable rights into a permissioned from of legal rights. Fiat currencies function as a medium of manipulation, indulging big business to generate market monopolies. ""Freedom of expression has become further stifled through economic censorship and financial blockage [enacted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/visa-mastercard-move-to-choke-wikileaks/#4e9994892cad) by payment processing companies like Visa and MasterCard,"" to borrow Hayase's (2020) words. 

**Satoshi is a Modern Newton**

Although most famous for discovering the law of gravity, Isaac Newton was also a practising alchemist. He never managed to turn lead into gold, but he did find a way to transmute silver into gold. In 1717, Newton announced in a report that, based on his studies, one gold guinea coin weighed 21 shillings. Just as Isaac Newton’s study of alchemy gave rise to the international gold standard, so has the desire for a “modernized gold standard” given rise to Bitcoin. ""In a way, Satoshi is a modern Newton. They both believed trust is best placed in the unchangeable facets of our economy. Beneath this belief is the assumption that each individual is their own best master,"" as put by Jon Creasy (2019) (2).   

**J.S. Mill: free markets preferable to those controlled by governments**

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) the great English philosopher would be a Bitcoiner were he still around today. In On Liberty (1859), Mill concludes that free markets are preferable to those controlled by governments. He argues that economies function best when left to their own devices. Therefore, government intervention, though theoretically permissible, would be counterproductive. Bitcoin is precisely decentralized or uncontrolled by the government, unconfiscatable, permissonless, and disinflationary. Bitcoin regulates itself spontaneously via the ordinary operations of the system. ""Rules are enforced without applying any external pressure,"" in Hayase's (2020) words. 

**Ludwig von Mises (1958): Liberty is always Freedom from the Government**

In *The Free Market and its Enemies*, theoretical Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises (1951) argues against the hazards of fiat currency, urging for a return to the gold standard. “A fiat money system cannot go on forever and must one day come to an end,” Von Mises states. The solution is a return to the gold standard, ""the only standard which makes the determination of the purchasing power of money independent of the changing ideas of political parties, governments, and pressure groups"" under present conditions. Interestingly, this is also one of the key structural attributes of Bitcoin, the world’s first, global, peer-to-peer, decentralized value transfer network. 

Actually, Bloomberg's 2020 report on Bitcoin confirms that it is gold 2.0. (3)

Von Mises prefers the price of gold to be determined according to the contemporaneous market conditions. The bitcoin price is, of course, determined across the various global online exchanges, in real-time. There is no central authority setting a spot price for gold after the which the market value is settled on among the traders during the day. 

**Hayek: Monopoly on Currency should End**

Austrian-British Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek’s theory in his 1976 work, *Denationalization of Money*, was that not only would the currency monopoly be taken away from the government, but that the monopoly on currency itself should end with multiple alternative currencies competing for acceptance by consumers, in order ""to prevent the bouts of acute inflation and deflation which have played the world for the past 60 years."" He forcefully argues that if there is no free competition between different currencies within any nation, then there will be no free market. Bitcoin is, again, decentralized, and many other cryptocurrencies have tried to compete with it, though in vain.   
   
 

In a recently rediscovered video clip from 1984, Hayek actually suggested people to invent a cunning way to take money out of the hands of the government:- “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop” (4). Reviewing those words 36 years hence and it is difficult not to interpret them in the light of Bitcoin.

**Milton Friedman Called for FED to be Replaced by an Automatic System** 

Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman (1994) was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished (5). Friedman (1999) believed that the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a computer program, which makes us think of the computer code governing Bitcoin (6).[\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:2-12) He (1970) favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply. This, he argued, would put a lid on inflation, setting spending and investment decisions on a surer footing (7). Bitcoin is exactly disflationary as its maximum possible supply is 21 million and its block reward or production rate is halved every four years. 

Friedman passed away before the coming of bitcoin, but he lived long enough to see the Internet’s spectacular rise throughout the 1990s. “I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government,"" said Friedman in a 1999 interview with NTU/F. On the same occasion, he sort of predicted the emergence of Bitcoin, ""The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A."" (8) 

**“**Of course, Friedman didn**’**t predict the block chain,**”** summed up American libertarian economist Jeffery Tucker (2014). “But he was hoping for a trustless system. He saw the need.**”** (9). 

**Bitcoin Computer Code as Constitution in the Buchananian Sense** 

American economist cum Nobel laureate James Buchanan (1988) advocates constitutional constraints on the governmental power to create money (10). Buchanan distinguishes a managed monetary system—a system “that embodies the instrumental use of  price-level predictability as a norm of policy”—from an automatic monetary system, “which does not, at any stage, involve the absolute price level” (Buchanan 1962, 164–65). Leaning toward the latter, Buchanan argues that automatic systems are characterized by an organization “of the institutions of private decision-making in such a way that the desired monetary predictability will emerge spontaneously from the ordinary operations of the system” (Buchanan 1962, 164). Again, ""Bitcoin regulates itself through the spontaneous force of nature, flourishing healthy price discovery and competition in the best interest of everyone"" (Hayase 2020).  

Shruti Rajagopalan (2018) argues that the computer code governing how the sundry nodes/computers within the Bitcoin network interact with one another is a kind of monetary constitution in the Buchananian sense. One of Buchanan's greatest inputs is to differentiate the choice of rules from the choice within rule (Buchanan 1990). One may regard the Bitcoin code as a sort of constitution and ""the Bitcoin network engaging in both the choice of rules and choice within rules"" (Rajagopalan 2018) (11). 

**Tim May: Restricting Digital Cash may Impinge on Free Speech**

Cypherpunks are activists who since the 1980s have advocated global use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political liberation. Tim May (Timothy C. May \[1951-2018\]), one of the influential cypherpunks published ***The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*** in September 1992, which foretold the coming of Bitcoin (12). Cypherpunks began envisioning a stateless digital form of money that cannot be censored and their collaborative pursuit created a movement akin to the 18th Enlightenment. 

At The 7th Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy, Burlingame, CA. in 1997, Tim May equated money with speech, and argued that restricting digital cash may impinge on free speech, for spending money is often a matter of communicating orders to others, to transfer funds, to release funds, etc. In fact, most financial instruments are contracts or orders, instead of physical specie or banknotes (13). 

**Montesquieu: Laws that secure inalienable rights** **can only be found in Nature** 

In his influential work The Spirit of Laws (1748), Montesquieu wrote, “Laws ... are derived from the nature of things … Law, like mathematics, has its objective structure, which no arbitrary whim can alter"". Similarly, once a block is added to the end of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is almost impossible to go back and alter the contents of the block, unless every single block after it on the blockchain is altered, too. 

Cypherpunks knew that whereas alienable rights that are bestowed by law can be deprived by legislation, inalienable rights are not to be created but can be discovered by reason. Thus, laws that secure inalienable rights cannot be created by humankind but can be found in nature.    

The natural laws employed in Bitcoin to enshrine the inalienable monetary right of every human being include its **consensus algorithm, and the three natural laws of economics** (self-interest, competition, and supply and demand) as identified by Adam Smith, father of modern economics. 

Regarding mathematics, bitcoin mining is performed by high-powered computers that solve complex computational math problems. When computers solve these complex math problems on the Bitcoin network, they produce new bitcoin. And by solving computational math problems, bitcoin miners make the Bitcoin payment network trustworthy and secure, by verifying its transaction information.

Regarding economic laws, in accordance with the principle of game theory to generate fairness, miners take part in an open competition. Lining up self-interests of all in a network, with a vigilant balance of risk and rewards, rules are put in force sans the application of any exterior pressure. ""Bitcoin regulates itself through the spontaneous force of nature, flourishing healthy price discovery and competition in the best interest of everyone,"" to borrow the words of Hayase (2020). 

**A Non-monetary Economy as Visualized by the Tofflers**

In their book, *Revolutionary Wealth* (2006), futurists Alvin Toffler and his wife Heidi Toffler toy with the concept of a world sans money, raising a third kind of economic transaction that is neither one-on-one barter nor monetary exchange. In the end, they settle on the idea that the newer non-monetary economy will exist shoulder-to-shoulder with the monetary sector in the short term, although the latter may eventually be eclipsed by the former in the long run. What both the Tofflers' The Third Wave (1980) and Revolutionary Wealth bring into question is the very premise of monetary exchange. The vacuum left over by cash in such a non-monetary economy may be filled up by Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. 

**Satoshi Nakamoto Nominated for Nobel Prize by UCLA Finance Prof.** 

UCLA Anderson School Professor of Finance Bhagwan Chowdhry nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on the following grounds:-

It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.... Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Protocol has spawned exciting innovations in the FinTech space by showing how many financial contracts — not just currencies — can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another (14).

The party has been co-opted by these groups, for sure, but that is the party today. 

There is economic and psychological depression running rampant across the country - unemployment is skyrocketing, the markets are in clear or near depression-era states, and people are anxious and on edge about each other and the future. This is further stoked by the media but especially by Republicans themselves in a very us vs them, zero-sum approach to politics. Head I win, tails you lose. 

And denial. Denial of science. Denial of basic facts and reality. Denial of better ways to do things. Denial of the global risk position we are in as a result of the party. Denial of humanity and civility. I don't see Nazis, Proud Boys, and Karens/Chads protesting against nurses and doctors at any Democratic rallies or toting AR-15s around to intimidate. 

To vote Republican now is a vote for hate, racism, and authoritarian rule like in Turkey, Phillipines, China, Russia, etc. And a 'hope' that this will get better. Hope is not a method and all you have to do is read some history to see the Republican party fails to govern time and again. 

So it's time to do something about it. In November. At the federal \*and\* state levels. We need to clean house in Congress and the Executive. 

IMHO, the only reasonable candidate is Biden and - hopefully - Warren as his VP and Bernie somewhere in the Cabinet. A vote against Biden is short sighted. We need a return to normality. To not vote at all for Biden is essentially a vote for Trump.

*****
&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.
*****
&gt; It’s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald’s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia’s plan to reopen.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.
*****
&gt; “If you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it’s a fundamental story,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “The fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.”
*****
&gt; Golub said it’s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that’s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. “People are watching what’s going on in places like Georgia, but they’re also watching what’s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,” he said. “At the end of the day, there’s really one thing that really matters. It’s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.”
*****
&gt; # Fed bazooka
&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it’s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.
*****
&gt; “I’m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “I think we’re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what’s working and the things that still need to happen.”
*****
&gt; Tilley said the Fed’s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. “It looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they’ve come back in,” he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank’s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.
*****
&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn’t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they’re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,” he said. “Whether you’re borrowing from a bank or whether you’re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.”

&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.
*****
&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.
*****
&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday’s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.
*****
&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.
*****
&gt; “We’ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,” Tilley said.
*****
&gt; # Earnings
&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.
*****
&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.
*****
&gt; “The most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It’s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,” said Golub. “My estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it’s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that’s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.”
*****
&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. “We had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that’s really bad.” Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.

# Election-year Mays: DJIA’s Second Worst Month

&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).

# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective

&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We’ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we’ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.

&gt; “We recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.

# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we’ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?

&gt; “This remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When we’ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.

# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020

&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy has performed so far this year.

&gt; The ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.

&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.

&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.

# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far

&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.

&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators

&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed’s National Activity index started off the week coming in at –4.19 which was well below estimates of –3. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**

&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell’s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)

&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.

&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).

# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To

&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.

&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.

Is there any current scenario where an ARM is more advantageous?",finance
personalfinance,40% effective tax rate in D.C.? Am I missing something ?,"Going to move to D.C. from France. In the popular imagination France is high tax and the US is low tax. Not from my calculations...

Situation - 2 kids and wife doing PhD. One income will be mine on $85k first year. Government job.

Estimates 

Federal income tax - $2947

FICA - $6542

D.C. tax - $4122

Compulsory 8% pension - 6842

Healthcare inc dentistry and optical - maximum of $13076. Youngest daughter is ill so will max out for a long while.

I’ve included healthcare because coming from Europe taxes include comprehensive healthcare.

Total = 33530 = 39.21% of my exact salary.

Cost of living is high so seems like you guys get fleeced in taxes etc ? Or have i missed something ?

Édit: i will get a banging pension from that

Edit 2: I have learned I will need to sit down with a tax advisor or accountant when I move to D.C. I’m still replying to things but this has been very useful - thanks. USA USA!",finance
personalfinance,Pull from 401k to pay my credit cards off?,"Hey, I am currently wondering some perspectives about a possible scenario. A little about me. I am 32, single with two kids. I am currently working and have had the same job for 13 years now. I’m lucky enough to still be working my same full time hours as my business is labeled essential. 

I’ve built my 401k and am just above 85k in it. My work has decided with this pandemic going on to allow employees to pull from their 401k with no IRS penalties. I’m sure there are a lot of investment companies doing this. 

I currently owe just over 6k on a credit card that has quite a large APR and I don’t have the best credit to ask for a better rate however due to a divorce or just poor money management earlier in my life. I believe the APR is between 18-20% on that credit card. I’d love to have the card paid off and done for as i know I’m paying ridiculous interest on it. 

My question is would it be wise right now to take advantage of my 401k during this time and pull out a loan for 10k to pay it off in full? I know the literature I read said it would be taxed 10% for federal income tax. I feel as though the 1k in tax i would pay is substantially less than the interest I’ll pay on that credit card. I won’t be able to pay that card off in less than 2 years I don’t believe. Would there be any other taxes I’d need to pay on that amount also? Aside from state taxes? Or would that initial 10% fed income tax cover it? 

I’m on mobile so it’s a bit harder to make sure I included all info. Any needed questions or info, please just ask. I’m highly considering it but would like someone’s perspective on it who understands finance more than I do. Thank you so much!",finance

I can afford to continue paying the loans at the moment, though I could also save money in a rainy day fund. Should I continue paying my loans?

With that being said, would it be better to save the extra payments I would have been making and just dump all of that into my federal loans when the forbearance is up? I have also thought about doing a mix of both; putting a little extra to the loans that require payments and save the leftover amount to dump into those federal loans later. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to refinance my mortgage but know nothing about it.,"Hello! Hope everything is safe and well.

I know close to nothing about mortgages, but recently my in-laws said we should take advantage of the low interest rates and refinance my(36f) and my husband’s(39m) mortgage. 

When I asked my husband about refinancing, he asked if I could look into it, since he really doesn’t have the time or brain space right now. Thankfully, my husband is busier with work than ever. He works for a video game company. (I guess people are still buying video games since there is not much else for them to do right now. ) He’s actually been pretty stressed. Sometimes he works until 10:00pm, and only stops to eat dinner. 

I would love to call our bank and talk to someone about it, but I have no idea what I would ask and I’m nervous that I’m going to sound like an idiot and the bank employee will laugh at me then hang up the phone. I could use all the help I could get.

What should I ask? How do I figure out by myself if refinancing is worth it or not so I don’t get roped into something I’ll regret? Are there helpful resources or articles I should reference? 

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,What do I need to know for filling out paperwork for a second job?,"I'm a healthcare worker working full-time at a hospital and I just recently got another part-time job for weekends at another hospital.

1) Do I need to fill out a new w4 for a second job? 

If so: 

a) There's a multi-jobs form on the w4. I was wondering, does this withholding mean that additional money will be added to the already federal taxed amount? How do I know where the withholding amount is coming out of... the first or second job? 

b) Which job will I have to fill out for the multi-jobs form on the w4? 

2) Do I need to tell my full-time job about my part-time job? If so, do I tell HR? 

3) With a second job, this puts me in a higher tax bracket. My full-time job offers a 403(b) and my second job will offer a pension. Should I be putting money into a 403(b) is that similar to a 401k?

personalfinance,22 Year Old College Senior - How do i manage my money?,"**Background:** Hi everyone, Im a 22 year old female in my senior year at a 4 year college. I'm studying finance and will be moving to new york post grad (who knows when exactly at this point) for a job I accepted at a consulting firm! In the meantime, I'm trying to get a better idea of how to manage my money. I grew up in a household where no one had knowledge on how to manage money, so I could use some outside opinions as I figure this out! 

Luckily, I was interning prior to coronavirus and am now able to work from home through my internship. I make about $800/biweekly from my internship and I try to save about $250 a paycheck. I file as an independent and pay for all my personal expenses. I am currently staying with my parents since school closed, so I help out with food and bills. My estimated expenses for that right now are about $300-400, depending on what family bills need to be paid. Any remainder I typically spend on fast food or online shopping (:/)

**My Financials:**

With this income, and previous summer internships, here is where I stand financially:

\- Ally Savings Account: $5,108

\- Roth IRA: $5,070

\- Federal Student Loan Debt: $27,000 (interest rates range from 3.7-5.5%, but due to COVID, they will be 0% until September 2020). Also, no pmts are currently due. They officially begin 6 months post grad.

\- No credit card debt

Here is my logic: I have cash on hand in Ally because I am preparing for a move, and also having cash on hand gives me confidence that I'll be okay in an emergency and won't need to use credit cards. I opened a roth ira before paying down my debt because I assumed that I'd be able to make about 7-8% investing my money, which is more than the rates I pay on debt. Therefore, my money could make more in the markets than paying down debt. 

**My question(s) are:**

\- Should I shift my focus to paying down debt now that the markets are so uncertain? I lost all the gains I had made in the prior year since I opened my Roth. Where should my focus be?

\- Am I saving enough?

\- Am I on a good track?",finance

The first known device that can be stated as the early computer is  Abacus ,it store numeric data  in the form of  beads store the calculation in non-binary,electronic  tool used by human-beings for calculation  it can be called as the first computer the, basic work of a computer is that it can help decrease the physical and metal labour of human-beings.The first time the word computer was encountered by humans  wasn't used  for a machine instead it was a job title for the human that do the important calculations and the amazing thing was that for doing the  complex calculations the logarithms were developed .The use of word computer was for a job title  was carried to late 1800s the first type of calculating device was build by German polymath Gotrified Leibneiz called the step Recknor he thought its beneath the dignity of a person to waste his precious time in calculations when it can be done by someone else  it was a device that can to the calculation with the help of gears it stores the number from 1-9 until its crossed it decimal limit it stores the number in major value holding gear kind of similar to clocks after a 60 seconds time is completed then the minute hand of the clock moves by one it can also be compares to the Adometer of a car which shows the how number of miles the car has driven it stores the value with gears of 10 teeth each teeth representing the value from 0-9 its kind of similar to how Abacus works(if you know this non-mechanical device worked) and this process was reversed when it do the calculations this also shows how much mathematics and computer science is related.we can call it a mechanical calculator it was used till 3 centuries ,till 20th century most of the computing experienced by people was through pre computed tables assembled the human computers(here computer is a job title ).The first use of computer for non calculative use was by military they wanted to calculate the accuracy of canon balls they shot but the problem was that with each canon they have to write a big book similar to modern day Logarithmic tables a pre computed table to help the military men in shooting  but still its quite time taking thing I mean peeping the complex calculation ,just similar to the dictionary with each and every calculation  in dictionary but for military the speed and accuracy always mattered  but Charles Babbage acknowledged the problem in 1822 and writing a paper called ""NOTE ON THE APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TI THE COMPUTATION OF ASTRONOMICAL AND MATHEMATICAL TABLES""to the astronomical society about  a mechanical device called the  difference engine for approximate the polynomial .Polynomial describe the relationship between variables like range and air pressures he started the construction in 1822 and spent 2 decade assembling a 25000 component device weighing around 15 tons but sadly the project had to be abandoned but in 1991 historians created a replica of the difference engine using the Babbage's writing and drawings and the engine worked.He also thought of a machine called the Analatical l engine which was similarly never completed it was used as  a general purpose computer because it can be used for multiple purpose like it could give data and run operations in sequence it had memory and a primitive printer although it was never completed but at for the engine Ada Lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for that computer she was a mathematicians and today we her know as the first computer programmer .The Analytical Engine  influenced people of upcoming generations and that is why people call Charles Babbage father of computer by  the end of the 1900th century the computers were used in science and engineering but hardly be seen in governments ,business purposes but in 1890 the US government faces as serious problem in calculating for census (it was calculated in every 10 years)the type of efficiency can only be provided by a computer the census was on distribution of Fedral funds and representing the congress in goods stuff but the problem was it take enough time for the calculation  that the data remains irrelevant imagine the calculation of data of 10 years take 13 years to calculate ,then here comes Herman Hollerith he built a electro-mechanical machine a tabulating machine his machine used punch cars which is till used for calculating result of exams like SAT in which you just shade the correct answer the concept of punch cars is very similar to that idea in his machine was 10x faster that the average tabulating it lead  Hollerith to create a tabulating company which later merged with many companies and creating a company  called IBM you may have heard this name before and it later changes the computer industry",technology

I have a WF Credit Card that I've maintained for many years. I have a high limit that I paid off previously, but being the idiot I am I have racked it up again. My interest rate is sky high and of course my payments have become higher than a car payment. I'm an idiot, I know, but still here I am in this situation. I called them the other day to ask that a couple of unknown charges (from the same place) be removed from my account. They complied but had to cancel that card and send me a new one.

I have been so nervous to ask, but bit the bullet and then asked if I could get a lower interest rate. The rep told me ""Wells Fargo doesn't lower interest rates"". Is that a thing? I thought every credit card was open to some negotiation at some point. I never heard of a flat out ""we don't do it"". I commented that I guess my only other option was to transfer the balance to a lower-interest card. The rep commented something about that being a good idea because my minimum payments are crazy. I get credit card transfer and small loan transfers all the time (Best Egg and similar) through the mail. I guess now I'll wait to see a good offer come in and apply for it.

This action—advocated by the American Bankers Association—is intended to grant more flexibility to consumers to access their savings deposits at a time when many are facing financial hardships due to the coronavirus pandemic.

 The Fed noted that its recent action reducing all reserve requirement ratios to zero has eliminated the need to distinguish between reservable “transaction accounts” and non-reservable “savings deposits.” The Fed also made corresponding updates to the Call Report to reflect these changes.

I had to take a temporary pay cut at work (from 100k to 90k), but am in a Sales role and am performing quite well despite everything so am anticipating good bonuses. I also go back to 100k in July (if our company does somewhat ok).

I have significant debt (in my opinion) and nowhere near enough savings, but I'm saving a lot of money right now and changed a lot of bad habits (like ordering delivery 5x a week and a $15 salad at work for one). I no longer pay a dog walker, I broke up with my very expensive therapist, no longer commuting, etc. The most significant is the pausing of my student loan payments until Sep 30, which will be about 4k in savings.

I have about **18k of Consumer Debt**

* $14k - Upstart loan to clear CC debt - 10.5% interest
   * $320/mo
* Chase - $850 - 25% interest
* Paypal - $2400 - 20% interest
* Affirm - $360, unsure of interest rate tbh

I have **78k of Student Loan Debt**, on average 6% interest rate but right now they are paused. This number is also just so absurdly high I am not prioritizing getting rid of it. My main concern is consumer debt and savings, but tell me if you disagree.

**I'll get $15k bonus next week taxed at 40% so I'll take home 9k.** Going to pay off the Chase, Paypal, and Affirm and only have the Upstart debt. I also owe my Therapist like $2000 so ***I'll have $3390 left over.***

investing,FT article: Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression,"[https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

While the headline is somewhat exaggerated, the premise is correct. 

**Here the whole article:** The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s' Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock. ""We really are in uncharted territory,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""We have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.""

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere ""bear market rally"" often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns - has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market.

The rise has erased half the stock market fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded ""junk"" by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14th, according to the IMF.

""The Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,"" said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. ""The question is whether this will be enough.""

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent.

Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say.

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan.

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested.

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

""Despite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,"" Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. ""To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.""

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it underscored the fragile state of the global economy.

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a

""horrific"" second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs.

""Anyone who thinks we're going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,"" she warned.

\------------

I guess that's what the majority here feels anyways. Doesn't mean you should not be building clever positions at this moment in a few stocks, but these should be true conviction buys based on good entry price, solid company products with longterm growth potential, neat balance sheet and a capable leadership team. Keep 70% to 80% cash.",finance
investing,Calculating projected per share earnings question,"I'm reading this book and am stuck on trying to figure out this one calculation. Please help!

\--

""In 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pre-tax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola's earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%.

Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that the pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola's average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987).

In, in 1987, he had projected out the earnings growth of 10% forward, he could have argued that by 2007 Coca-Cola would have a pretax per share earnings of $4.35 and after-tax earnings of $2.82 a share. This would mean that by 2007 his pretax return on his Coca-Cola equity bonds would grow to 66%, which equates to an after-tax return of 43%.""

personalfinance,Consolidation loans - need some help with clarifying questions and where to start,"I am finally in a place where I am making decent money and once the pandemic pans out it will literally double as I get paid really well once I'm traveling again. I currently have about $75k total debt spread across federal school loans, private school loans, car loan, credit card debt, medical bills, and credit card debt I allowed to become judgments against me. I'm spending this time currently to build a plan. I have curbed my spending as much as I can and have built an emergency fund (a very very modest one as I believe Covid-19 has changed the perception of an emergency fund entirely). At this point I'm trying to make the best possible decisions to wipe the slate clean. 

A consolidation loan sounds like a good idea to me but I want to make sure I approach it correctly. First I do understand most federal school loans are going to have the lowest interest rate as it is. I believe mine are around 5% but I will have to confirm. The private school loan is almost 10%, the car loan is almost 17%, the credit card debt about 20%, and the judgments total about $10k. Too many of these things just seemed way too high priority. I was having a really hard time figuring out what to tackle first until I came across consolidation loans. It seemed like it would be the best case scenario as everything can be addressed at once. Before continuing, please correct me if I'm wrong. 

First question - can a consolidation loan take a variety of this debt or does it have to all be credit card debt or another singular debt? 

What interest rate can I expect or should be reasonable? After all the massacre of my credit I'm in the 500s whereas I once peaked 750. 

Where do I start? A local bank? Are there specialist companies for this? Are there predatory companies to look out for (specifically is this the type of place one can expect a higher possibility of fraudulent companies given the ""desperate"" nature if you will)? I searched online but immediately started to get uncomfortable. I've always made major financial decisions with a professional sitting in front of me.",finance

investing,Local real estate markets,"Whether it's a good or bad investment real estate remains one of the largest investments a person will make in their lifetime. Just like with stocks people want to buy low and sell high. 

While local pressures exist and every housing market is different, it is still worth taking a look at broader trends. Where will house prices be a year from now once the coronavirus is behind us and we begin rebuilding our economy?


**The case for lower prices**

*Decreased demand*

Record unemployment and reduced wages will strip demand for purchases. In order to move real estate prices must come down. 

*Increased supply*

After coronavirus restrictions are lifted the banks will be allowed to proceed with business as usual. With record unemployment and a failure of the economy to bounce back as quickly as hoped, foreclosures will be at 2008 levels or worse. 

We may be able to slow the virus but we can't stop it. Many older and people with health issues will lose their lives which will add supply to the market. 


**The case for higher prices**

*Increased money supply*

The Fed is printing money at unprecedented levels. This puts upward price pressure on all assets. Stocks and real estate. 

*Decreased supply*

In the short term, the lockdown is preventing people from leaving their houses. People don't want strangers in their houses and are reluctant from putting their homes on the market. Less supply pushes prices up. 

New home building has ground to a halt which is putting less supply on the market. 


**The case for sideway prices**

Somehow all of these forces will balance and prices will remain stable.

This order is fulfilled by Office Depot. I was sent a shipping confirmation saying it would be delivered March 31. April 1, I called in to check the status of my order. I was told that I would receive an update within 24-48 hours. The next day, I get an email from Office Depot saying that the item was on backorder, and that I would receive the item by the end of the week (April 3). I called back April 6, and now Lenovo informed me that the item was attempted to be delivered, but was returned to the sender because of this. They told me that my refund would be processed within 24-48 hours. I (now regrettably)  asked if I could replace the order, since the desks were on sale at the time, and the price returned to full price. The representative processed the payment, and I awaited the new shipment and the refund. These never happened, and now I have almost $1000 tied up in these Lenovo orders.

I've been contacting Lenovo every other day, and constantly keep getting the runaround. When asked about the refund, they tell me that ""it's being processed and will take X days"", after which never return to my account. 

During one of the conversations, they connected me to a representative at Office Depot. She told me that the orders failed to deliver because the address on the shipping label was wrong, even though the address I had entered was correct. The shipping label cut off the last number of my address and it did not print correctly, on both orders. She contacted the carrier and asked them to change the address, and told me that they would resend the order again. But again, that never happened. I contacted the carrier with the order numbers and they just told me that the shipment could not be delivered, and that I would have to talk to Lenovo. 

I was fed up with all this and filed a dispute with my Simple, my bank. Their whole dispute process is rediculous, compared with Chase. Chase immediately resolves my issue and reinstates my funds when I have a problem. I submit my documents to the email provided, and I constantly get responses saying ""Please submit X proof"", when I JUST sent them exactly what they asked for the day before. Now, I've gotten a message from Simple saying that they've forwarded my case to their processor, and that the process can take 90 days!

personalfinance,Stop retirement savings for more mid term goals?,"Hi all, I hope this does not sound too much like a woe is me thread. I know my wife and I make a lot of money compared to most in our peer group and just the the average US household in general. We are very fortunate but in a way I feel like we are trapped into saving for retirement to avoid taxes instead of saving for more near and midterm goals.

We max our available retirement space each year: 2x 401k, HSA, Roth. I save another 10% via ESPP which gets sold ASAP and diversified into a simple 3 fund portfolio and then we save probably another 15k a year or so with just what we have left over at the end of each month.

In my head I know it is a lot, around 40% gross, but most of it is in retirement accounts. If we were to stop the contributions there we would be paying 34% marginal rates fed+state.

Sure I would love a garage that I can work on our cars in so I didn't have to pay someone to do most of the work but in the ""normal"" world it was enough. Now it feels cramped and soooo small.

Being in SoCal it would take us nearly a decade to save a down payment with our after retirement savings, and that doesn't include inflation or raising home prices.

I know I am being dumb but how do people buy houses and save for retirement? Maybe it is just the rona getting to me! 😵

Some more numbers. We are both 30. Projected gross income is right around 200k for the year. By maxing 401ks I mean the payroll deductable portion of 19.5k each. Neither of us have access to Mega backdoor Roth access.

10% of 125 ESPP =12.5 we have a pretty terrible plan though, last two years with the discount the total was maybe 13.5
15k annual with what is left over at the end of each month.

personalfinance,"0-down, 95/5 Conventional Mortgage- What?","TLDR:   Lender bait and switched me from a DPA program with forgivable down  payment to a 95/5 with a high-interest piggy back mortgage, effectively  giving me a 0 down conventional mortgage.  What even is this?

Hi all,  Throwaway here, and partially because I feel like such a huge idiot. I'll try to keep this short:

Contacted  lender about a program in my state that provides a 3-5% down payment, forgiven over 36 months.  I seemed to qualify and thought it would be a  good way to save money in the deal.  About a week later, I'm preapproved for about  $300k conventional with 5% dpa.  I'm psyched.  I get my preapproval  letter for the primary mortgage, and assume that's all that will be  coming as the dpa is probably handled between state and lender somehow...  I should've  asked more questions.

Now- under  contract on a home.  Receive my loan estimate

.  What I have is a  conventional loan for 95% and a secondary piggy back mortgage for the  remaining 5%.  I'm beyond pissed because this is not what I was looking  for, especially because I can go a 3% down conventional route in just a  few months more with my savings.  BUT I don't have it at this moment (with the addition of inspections, closing costs, appraisal, etc- I'm about 3500 short),  and now I have earnest money at stake.  

My loan officer has seemed  great, but in the past two days has shown himself to be a slimy rat.  He  essentially told me this was a better deal than HomePlus because of  interest rates and because he will ""refinance me in 6 months into one  loan and remove PMI"" yadda yadda.  He's ""sorry"" he didn't tell me about  the change, but this ""is a better deal for me"".  He says to go the original DPA route now would cause delays, even though we just entered  underwriting literally a day ago and I still have about 40 days to  close.  It's very clear to me he's full of it and just saying whatever to get me to do this.

But  seriously - WTF.  I didn't even know you could do a 100% conventional  finance like this anymore.  Seriously- is this even legal?   Ideally, I  can purchase this home, but at this point I'd be happy to just get my  earnest money back.  I am talking to another lender about options on  Monday- specifically USDA rural.  I know no one here can give me too  much advice on my particular situation; however, if you have ideas, I'm  all ears.  I'm interested in your feedback regarding this kind of mortgage.  100% financing broken up into two loans?  Is this even legal anymore?

30% US Large Cap Stocks

40% US Long term bonds

15% US Medium-term bonds

7.5% Gold Commodity

7.5% Speculation/Cash(Originally Broad Diversified Commodities)

My Belief is that we grow our portfolio to protect out money from devaluing due to inflation. Therefore, we are making the portfolio to include assets that would appreciate faster than the inflation rate and the Bank's interest rate. Also, lose less than the SPY during downtimes like a recession we are facing today.

My stock selection is based on the simple belief that: ""Where there are popularity, there are value. Combine sentiment with fundamental and technical measures, long term growth is valid.""

Listed Stocks:

FB($190) - Most Competent Online Communication Company, lots of users

GLD($163) - Safe asset, rare Earth Metal, Non-rusting conductor, Quantum Computer Use

BYND($110) - Fast growth, international expansion, Vegan Trend

AAPL($283) - Main Tool used by companies, students, and many other workers. However, not buying in yet because this is not down with the decline as consumer as buying less luxury brands.

TLT($171) - Long Term Bond, however, very expensive, looking for a retrace to $150 to buy.

AMZN($2410) - Very expensive, not yet going to buy in, I'd rather hold cash than getting into AMZN at this level.

Trading,What is a global macro strategy ?,"How to use a global macro strategy for slow but lumpy returns .

      Hi guys I wanted to share my investing process in a nutshell. Having done this over the last five years, I believe this is an excellent way to preserve one's wealth and make better-investing choices. You cannot see a collapse or time the market, but when risks are rising, having a macro view can provide the necessary tools to take advantage of any dislocations that occur in the marketplace. Okay, down to biz.
1. Develope a top-down global economic view based on interest rates, surveys, money supply, relative stock marker performance ( or global stock indices priced in dollars), central bank balance sheets and any other endogenous economic drivers. (do this across major economies ie Europe, US and China)
2. Find assets or stocks to best express this view 
3. Get long or short with a time horizon in mind .
4. Size your position with leverage you can tolerate. 
5. Rinse and repeat .
 
Example  
Let's say a macro trader analyzed China, and the conclusion of that analysis was she was slowing down growth-wise. As a consequence of China slowing down, the Australia economy will also slow down as Australia conducts a lot of trade with China. The reverse is the case if China is experiencing economic growth. So an idea you could develop from a slow Chinese economy is short the Australian dollar or short the Australian market, Austrlian autos, real estate,banks etc . It’s all about finding the instruments that are the most exposed to your thesis. 


I hope this helps you at some point in your trading journey .

Peace!!

personalfinance,Worth it to change or not?,"First let me say I apologize if this belongs in another community and if so, please let me know and I can delete this and post in the correct one.

Currently I bank with Chase for both my Savings and Checking accounts.  I have Premier level of both (which offers some perks over the regular level).  I have been using Chase for over 2 years and generally like them and haven't had any issues with them.  I also currently have an Amex and a Uber Visa credit card and those are the only 2 credit cards I have.  Ive been with Amex over 10 years. The Uber I got back at the end of last year cause it was a good card....been nerfed recently and wanting to change to another card.  However this is where my dilemma is and I want to see if anyone sees an issue with it or if i should just stick with what I have.  I currently use the Uber Visa for everyday spending and my Amex for any large purchases.

I do not use a credit union currently.  However I am contemplating moving to NavyFed and changing over my savings and checking to them (from Chase). Reason for changing is I have always heard its better to bank with a Credit Union. Then I would sockdrawer the Uber and get the More Rewards card from Amex which has great rewards (3X dining, entertainment, grocery, gas, etc) in my opinion.  This would leave me as Amex cards only as my 2 credit cards (I really dont want to have more than 2 credit cards at any given time).  I also dont want to get rid of the original Amex as my relationship with them is over 10 years.

Does this whole thing sound reasonable to anyone or should I just stay with Chase/Amex/Uber? Is it worth the hard credit hit to get that More Reward Amex?  I would use the More Rewards card as my everyday spending card going forward btw.

personalfinance,Pls point out the weakness in my investment strategy.,"Hi – 

I'v been trying to clean-up various finances the past few weeks (e.g. rolling over old 401ks, etc). I also read a few key books recommended on the forum, dove through this and other personal finance forums, spoke with a few financial advisors, played around with a few Robo Services, and did a ton of portfolio and asset allocation backtesting. In the end, I’ve come full circle and have a much deeper appreciation for: (1) index investing, (2) asset location, (3) diversification and (3) fewer funds (from a re-balancing, tax efficiency, and overall ease of management). 

In the end, I’ve completely re-imagined my approach and have landed on the below strategy that I would love advice on. For context, I’m in my early 30s, in a high federal tax bracket, have about $50K in a Vanguard 2055 Target Retirement Fund (split between 50% Roth 401K and Traditional 401K – it’s the only fund at work with an expense ratio below .60%, except for one S&amp;P fund option). I contribute the max my work allows (there is a weird limit) of $15,750 and they match with an additional $10,125. 

The rest of my investment funds are in Vanguard, after several recent rollovers and consolidations (trying to spend “stay-at-home” free time wisely ):
-	$150k Roth IRA (using Backdoor IRA to add $6k a year)
-	$20K in Taxable Investment Fund (putting in $500 a week)

I’ve landed on managing this moving forward on my own, once I finish this initial setup (but may move to Vanguard PAS in the future if don’t have the time or interest and to really be hands off). So, here’s what I’m thinking – 5 funds across the portfolio – for my Vanguard funds outside of the 401K: 
-	60%: VTI/VTSAX (Total Stock Market) 
-	12.5%: VEA/VTMGX (International Developed Markets)
-	12.5%: VWO (Emerging Markets) 
-	10%: VNQ (Real Estate Sector REIT)
-	5%: BND (Total US Bond Market) 

Across the portfolio, I was thinking I would put all 5 ETFs in the Roth IRA. In the Taxable Account, (to maximize tax efficiency) I would put VTSAX and VTMGX since I want to do weekly deposits (they are the same as their ETF brothers, and they represent the lowest tax cost ratio of the 5 funds above), and I can focus on re-balancing across the Roth IRA and Taxable hopefully twice a year. 

Thoughts overall on 401K and these above Vanguard Funds Strategy? Back testing has confirmed excellent results for this mix, I feel 5-funds are manageable (I was going to do VXUS, but landed on both international for several reasons), and diversification feels good…but thoughts? 

P.S. My only lingering question/pondering, which has come up a ton of times before is if I should use VTCLX (Tax Managed Capital Appreciation) + a Total Small Cap Mutual Fund (VSMAX (already super tax efficient) or VTMSX (high turnover which I don't like), in place VTSAX in my Taxable Fund. Given my 35% tax bracket, it feels like it could be somewhat beneficial after looking up the latest tax ratios in Morningstar, but it does add some complexity…which also shows that some of Vanguards mutual funds are now more tax efficient than some of the ETF counterparts!

personalfinance,"24 years old with a Bachelor Degree and almost $10,000 saved up","I’m 24 and graduated last May with my Bachelors of Science with integrated marketing emphasis. I have a full time job (currently furloughed at the moment due to Corona virus) working as a Marketing Coordinator at a casino. I take in $43,000 before taxes and that averages out to at least $2,800 a month take in. I’m really at a crossroads as I’m not satisfied with my small 2 bedroom apartment and car that is starting to crap out. I have at least $50,000 in student loan debt, $29,000 in student loans at an interest rate of, I think, 6%. I also have another $21,000 in parent plus loans at an interest rate of, I think, 7%. I just went to check but my interest rates are showing as 0% due to the Corona virus interest rate pause that’s currently going on for student loans. 

I’m getting married in June of 2021 and am currently living with my Fiancé who just moved in with me. She will start assisting with bills soon. She’s still in college and makes about $200-$400 a month working at a pharmacy because she is still in school and thats her main focus. She will graduate in May next year with her Bachelors and might continue to get her doctorate to become a PT, but we haven’t decided that 100% yet. She will have well over $100,000 in student debt when she’s done.

But for now, these are the bills I’m used to paying by myself and I’m going to assume that it stays this way for this time being. 

My bills are as follows every month

Rent: $615
Electric: $120
Phone: $71
Internet: $70
Renters Insurance: $12
Student Loans: $180
Parent Plus: $320
Groceries: $50
Dog Food: $30
Gas: $30
Total: $1,499

This leaves me with a take home of roughly $1,300 each month that I put straight into my savings. I want to get a newer car, preferably a 2015 or above and a house so that my fiancé, dog and I have more room and aren’t stuck in this small apartment. Any advice on what I can do to maximize my savings and make the house and car become a reality would be much appreciated. The debt scares me, but we do really need a new car soon and a house would be great. Maybe a career change is necessary? I’m not quite sure if Im underpaid or not because my jobs salary has a large pay spread depending on what state a person lives in. Iowa is where I live for reference.",finance
personalfinance,Can we qualify for a mortgage?,"My wife and I are both physicians and we are thinking about purchasing our first home as we are moving to a new town (low cost of living) this summer. A bit about our situation:

Me: current income &gt;350k, credit 606 (poor credit card choices in my early 20s and poor decisions on paying private student loans as a resident. I’ve beat myself up about this constantly) I currently pay my federal loans on time and do not carry a credit card balance. Debt to income ratio is rather low (well less than 20%, probably closer to 10-15%). 

My wife: just finished residency and signed a contract to start Sept 1 and earn &gt; 330k in our new hometown. She in on an H1B visa (Canadian) and has only 1 year of credit in the US but is as good as it can be given the circumstances (mid 600s simply due to lack of credit history but we are slowly building credit for her with a car lease and a new credit card). 

Obviously we don’t have great credit scores, but our ability to pay is there. 

We have had steady jobs for 5-6 years, no changes in employment. Obviously our job situation/income is rather dependable. 

Currently we plan on having 40-50k to put as down payment on a home. 

My concerns are: 

Our credit scores, obviously 

My wife’s visa status

I’m not sure if I should just let her apply by herself bc she doesn’t have any dings on her credit in terms of late payments etc. Her income alone is over 330k/year based on her new contract. Or do we have a better chance trying to prequalify as a couple?

personalfinance,Do I continue saving or pay off 8k student debt?,"My situation: 31yo single male with about 15k in my Ally savings account. My rent is super cheap at around $400/mo including utilities, food is another $300/mo, bike and walk everywhere so no car expenses, phone is $15/mo. I'm on unemployment at the moment but I effectively saved all of this working part time at whole foods for the past 4 years and teaching piano lessons here and there, which should give you some idea of how frugal I live (seldom go out, always cook my own food etc).

As for debt, my only debt is 8k from fed student loans, for which as you probably know interest is paused from accruing until the beginning of October.

My question for all of you concerns whether it would be more prudent to just pay this 8k all at once, or to wait until the suspendion period is over and just continue chipping away at it.

Part of me would prefer to keep my savings liquid as my next aspiration is to build a tiny home and the 15k would cover a good deal of the cost. I'm also concerned of the possibility of some form of partial or entire debt cancellation/relief. I'd hate to drop half of my savings to clear my debt immediately before either of these possibilities become reality!

I'd love to hear your suggestions on what my next move ought to be, as well as your opinion on the likelihood of student debt cancellation in the near future. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Most effective way to help your friends help themselves?,"Hey guys, I feel pretty confident in reigning in my own spending and investing at this point, and have been discussing it with one of my childhood friends (in a non pushy way). He seems to have a lot of similar financial aspirations as me in terms of savings and financial independence, so I have been giving him advice for how to his retirement savings into tax-advantaged vehicles, pointing him away from speculative market activity, and overall just encouraging him to overcome his circumstances (we come from a town that is both impoverished and financially illiterate). 

However he still has around 15k in student loans left, and makes between 60-70k a year (meaning he should easily be able to pay this off in a year and a half). He is already good at managing his fixed expenses, as he lives in very affordable housing with his girlfriend and cooks most if not all of his food. Unfortunately he is absolutely addicted to buying cars, and it is absolutely holding him back from paying off his student loan debt. Around a month ago he had two cars, one of which he sold and managed to make around 2k on. I encouraged him to use this money to aggressively pay off his outstanding debt, but instead he went and bought another truck (which he does not need). This has been his MO for the past 3 or so years, and all of the cars he has purchased have absolutely not been necessities (in fact he bought a motorcycle for ~4k two years ago and got ""lucky"" that someone hit him on it and insurance paid out well for him).

His interest rates are painfully high ~11%, and I can see how him not tackling the principal on his debt is going to absolutely fuck him in the next five or so years (if he does not pay as he should). I've discussed this at length with him, told him how stupid it is for him to buy vehicles that he doesn't need, told him how he is stepping on his own toes, but I am kind of at the end of my own rope on how I realistically can help him. He will send links to fb marketplace asking me what I think of a car or truck, and I will simply ignore them. I want to help the guy out but it feels like I give him advice he consistently does not listen to, and I don't want to snap and ruin our friendship over something so banal and which ultimately does not affect me.

Have you ever been in a situation like this? How can I balance our friendship and my frustrations that he will ask me for advice and literally just ignore it? Im just kind of exasperated at this point and don't really know where to turn.",finance

My understanding is this: I can put up to $6,000 a year into my federal money market fund and then I use that $6,000 to buy ETF’s and stocks.

Now I’ve been reading and watching videos on VTSAX. If I wanted to invest in this I would gather up $3,000 (the minimum investment to start) and instead of putting it into my federal money market fund I would put it into VTSAX instead, right? And then do I just let the money sit in there for 40 years while contributing $6,000 a year or do I use that money to buy ETF’s and stocks like with the federal money market fund?

Am I way off here? Am I missing anything important?

personalfinance,Federal Tax Refund Delay,"Hello,

I filled my tax return early last January. I still haven't gotten anything back despite getting my state refunding months ago. Obv with everything going on, I can't get through to the phone lines. To make matters worse, because I never got my refund, I was never sent a stimulus check either. I tried applying manually but it denied me there as well.

personalfinance,How much money am I spending to get into a 2 year newer vehicle?,"I really appreciate the input in advanced and hope this is the right suv. I have a peculiar question. It’s more of a hypothetical one but nonetheless I think it can be solved. Talked with a friend for an hour and a half and he’s quite smart but didn’t exactly remember how to use excel functions. Therefore I figured I’d ask the experts. 

I purchased my previous vehicle for $33,500 with a 6.39% interest rate for 60 months. I paid off 32 months which totals $18,700 and I have $15,000 to go for 28 months (excluding interest of course) The older vehicle has a trade-in value of about 10,200 on kbb. New vehicle has a 2.9% interest rate for 60 months and cost $29,683. Both of these figures are out the door price but I’m not sure of the cost of the vehicle for the other vehicle I purchased because the records were purged after a while. But it included a SUPER HIGH warranty package for a vehicle that I haven’t had to use it one time for. New car will be purchased for $22,500 plus $1,000 certification fee that comes w/ 4 1/2 more years of warranty (let’s just say the dealers had some very bad customer service and ended up losing on the car by almost a $1,000 dollars) My question to you is if you could hypothetically come up with some sort of answer as to how much more I am actually paying just to get inside of a newer vehicle that is 2018 and 12,000 miles less, what would you say I am paying to do that. Keep in mind that my old vehicle is a 2016 Ford fusion and the new vehicle is a 2018 Cadillac ATS. Blue book value for car I just bought is around 23,000.. insurance remains same amount

Long story short, my wife and I usually just deposited 75% of our income into the bank and lived very frugally and just let it build, outside of any expenses. Our incomes have gradually increased but we've kept our expenses low. 

It's our own fault but the bank has been giving us an abysmal interest rate apparently. I've already moved a considerable portion of the savings to a high yield savings account. What is the best way to invest/get a better return on our savings?

 Wife and I are both 50 and hope to retire at 65. The high yield savings account is already great. We have parked money in CDs before, but haven't decided on that yet as rates are pretty much the same as the high yield. We are also very very risk adverse in our investing and are not looking to get a 7-10% return or anything over that.Would it be best to just park money in high yield, CDs(when market improves) and some amount in something like Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund (VSCGX)?

How do you decide how much to allocate to each of these? Are there any other good investments that I should look into? Wife and I already contribute to our 401ks yearly.",finance
personalfinance,I have some noob questions regarding investing money for the future.,"I'm 24 and starting to save and invest for the future. I have been doing tons of research the past week and it's a little overwhelming.

Some key points I've taken away so far: 
-Contribute at least 15% of income to retirement either through a 401k (and take advantage of employer match) or separate IRA. 
-Have a six-month emergency savings

Say that after having done those two things, you have some extra money on the side you'd like to invest. Would the wise response be to put any extra money after leisure expenses toward the 401k (increase contributions) or start investing in dividend-paying stocks through a service like Robinhood? The thought have having money roll in through dividends seems appealing because I can use that money for things before retirement. I also looked into a high-yield savings account but there's only around a 1.5% interest rate, whereas a company like CVS has a 3.21% dividend yield on your investment if you bought their stock.

I would love if someone could chime in and give me some advice on if I should invest in dividend stocks after saving in 401k or just contribute more to the 401k now and not worry about generating the extra income before retirement?

I apologize if this is confusing. I haven't been researching this stuff very long so any insight I can get would be invaluable to me. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Advice about financing grad school plus loans,"Grad school starts this fall. Tuition for 2 years is 40K. I will be working while attending school full time. I'm not sure how much to pay out of pocket vs how much loans to take out. I was approved by FASFA for 20K federal loans. Will they divide up the 40k per semester and I decide each semester how much of the loan to use vs out of pocket? There seems so many ways to go about it and the whole semester by semester pay confuses me. I want to pay as I go as much as I can but I think I can only make $600 per month payments.

I tried to do the math. If I pay 5K up front will they divide that up? I'm guessing if tuition is 40k, it would be 10k per semester. What if I then put 5k of loans for each of the 4 semesters (adding up to 20K). So 5k divided over 5 months, would be 1k, and maybe around $800-$900 a month if I make a downpayment. Unless I'm doing the math wrong, it seems so much out of pocket for payments especially on top of rent. How can I reduce the payments?

personalfinance,Citi CreditCard Upgrade / Switch Offers,"So for the better part of two years Citi has been sending me mail flyer offers, trying to get me to convert my current [Citi Diamond Preferred](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-diamond-preferred-credit-card) Credit Card to a variety of different cards in their portfolio. For the most part I have ignored these as I have been happy and am a legacy customer of this card at an interest rate less than the advertised minimum currently on Citi's. I rarely use the card (maybe 6x a year) and mostly just diligently pay down the $9,000 balance at 2x the monthly minimum (started at $18k, hey I was younger and stupid)

Now they have sent me an offer to convert the card to a [Citi Rewards+](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-rewards-plus-credit-card&amp;category=view-all-cards) Card and I am mildly interested. It earns ""ThankYou"" points on the rare occasion I would use it for whatever that's worth. I just see it as free spending money for Amazon. I'm aware how worthless point conversion rates are, but it's a free improvement on earning nothing.

Now like all things financial, the devil is in the details.   
The big marketing print on the brochure says ""**Continue to pay no Annual Fee and your APR will remain the same.**""   


VS:  
But the small print terms and conditions say ""**Pricing Disclosure: The Standard  variable APR for purchases is 11.49% and also applies to balance transfers...The rates shown here are accurate as of 2/29/20. These rates will vary with the market...Any fee changes will be applied 51 days after you convert**""

SO I have three questions for the Hive mind:

1. Do you think it's likely Citi will change my interest rate after conversion? Perhaps after 51 days?
2. Has anyone here converted a card with Citi using an offer before? Did it go good or bad?
3. If I called, would Citi be open to conversion to a different card? ( Costco Anywhere Visa)

TL:DR - Do you get screwed when a CC company sends you a conversion offer?",finance

personalfinance,Personal Finance- Auto Financing Help,"I'm a 28 year old male who just graduated college during which and since 2011 had been driving a Mazda that was essentially a death trap. I sold in January of this year and also began freelancing for a creative agency making $75/hour up until March when I was furloughed/let go due to covid-19. I had been car shopping to determine what I'd like for 5 months now since I saw the right opportunity and the decrease in auto sales has given me so much more bargaining power so this is the time. I'm pretty picky about what I purchase in any segment of life so after researching for over 5 months, test driving multiple other vehicles, and ubering everywhere(ouch) I landed on a used 2013+ Acura RDX(I'm 100% set on this car). 

However, during my time in college I was essentially taken advantage of and ended up running an entire companies marketing program while being paid next to nothing for it and also working hours in stores just to make enough to make ends meet. I was able to do incredible things that completely changed the business and were integral in the growth of my career since then so I do not regret it going forward(just wish they paid more). 

Admittedly during this time I ran a credit utilization rate of 90%+, stupid I know but I wasn't with very many options making under 35k/year paying $900 in rent. That ended up tanking my score along with 2 late payments on one card made during a brief unemployment stint in Sept-Dec of last year. I've sent a goodwill letter to the credit company with the late payments but not figuring that into my situation unless they agree to erase the poor marks. Other than that I have no other late payments or derogatory marks on my file aside from 3 hard-pulls for auto financing we'll talk about later. I also have about 54K in federal student loans.

I gained a position with an agency in January but am considered ""self-employed"" as I'm freelancing various strategy and AR work with clients in the time COVID has taken me out of a full time role.  Proving my income for one or more tax years for financing this vehicle has proven difficult as I've just started to make the bulk of my money, and am currently in-between full time roles. I paid my credit card debt down to under 20% utilization and my score has begun to reflect that currently sitting at 660 FICO. 

For the vehicle(12-15k range) I can make the purchase with cash but would like to refrain from spending a chunk of my savings/investments in a time of technical unemployment/pandemic so I'd like to finance(also for the benefit of having a closed auto loan on my file). I have what has been considered ""thin"" credit history of 4 cards with the oldest being only 4 years old and student loan debt reflecting a balance above initial borrowing amount due to interest. 

I've had a very tough time getting approved for financing even with a 8K down payment. I'm perfectly capable of paying off a 36 month loan for the rest in half the time. I've tried two credit unions(denied), Bank of America(denied &amp; I bank with them), capital one(pre-approved but 11% interest), and some dealers finance bank(approved at 22% I hung up the phone). Finding a reliable company to lend from that will charge under 7% interest seems impossible but I'm seeing many other people on reddit have worse situations and get approved for decent rates. What gives? 

Does anyone here have any experience with getting auto financing when you fall under the class of ""recently self-employed"" I have made 18K this year so far so I'm on track to blast last years earnings out of the water but still can't find anyone to finance to me at a decent rate and don't have any 2019 1099s showing income, just a tax return stating about 42k.

personalfinance,What price range can I afford for a car?,"I’m in the market for a car, but I’m trying to see what a realistic price range would be.

I’m 19, with brand new credit, my score is a 640-650, with only student loans that I’ve began making payments on already and they’ve all been on time. I make about $36000 a year and my monthly spending is only about $600 for bills. So there’s quite a bit of spending room for a car. 

I know the big argument is that a car is a long term commitment, and you don’t know what your situation will be in 5 years etc, but my goal is to pay it off in 3 years or so, because my financial situation is going to look like this for the next 2-3 years. I’m not opposed to financing it for a longer amount of time though. And I know the whole “but what if you lose your job”, but I’m gonna slightly ignore that, because with that logic I’ll never find the right time for a car.

I take a lot of pride in my car and what I drive, because I’m annoying and one of those people, so I don’t mind spending a bit on it. I currently drive a ‘93 Jeep Cherokee XJ Sport, but he is near his death bed. 

As for insurance I already have around enough saved up to do 6 months at a time, give or take a little.

I had a hit once to my credit almost a year ago, because I tried to get a car, and just to get an idea of payments and I had a 540 credit score, no payments were made on my loans yet, and was quoted 17% interest for a 21K 2017 Jeep Wrangler Sport. So I’m assuming in a year that might have changed, but I’m not sure. I’m also entirely accepting the fact that realistically my interest rate is gonna be ugly regardless.

I just wanna know what a good price range would be to look for, and like the monthly payments of say a 10k car vs 40k car. Also what would be best to do if say I wanted a car that costs 30k, like how much of a down payment would be ideal to help me out? I’m not in a major rush, so I’m willing to save over the next couple months for a hefty down payment. Also car suggests would be cool too if y’all have anything, because that’s also something I haven’t decided on I just don’t want a small car close to the ground haha.

Sorry for this being so wordy I’m awful at getting to the point!

EDIT: I understand buying in cash is my best bet, thats what I did with my current car, but preferably I’d like something new. It’ll also help with my credit so I’d rather two birds one stone this thing.

I also do live on my own that’s what the $600 comes from, I know it’s very little, but I split a small place and that includes all my monthly bills.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off car in full?,"Hey Reddit,

Just a quick question on if I should pay my entire car balance.

I have a 2016 Mazda that I purchased for $16k in 2016. I have the balance down to $8,387.34 exactly. The interest rate is 6.29%. My monthly bill is $297.

I currently have 10 shares of a tech company that if sold would give me enough to pay off my car. (I've done the after tax math)
Should I pay this off in full or should I continue to pay month by month?

For context: My credit is awful, it currently sits at 575. This is due to some pretty bad moves made in college (graduated in 2015) and immediately after when I was unemployed. This bad credit has limited me from obtaining good CCs and better apartments.

My only debt besides my car are my student loans (all federal), and a small credit card with a limit only going to $1k. And rent, which is $1350. 
Both my student loans and CC are current and I have no issues paying them. 

I am moving to a new apartment in August and I'd love to not have to worry about $300 leaving my account every month for this car but I am unsure if it's worth spending a ton of cash right now during the pandemic.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage quickly at first to improve principal to interest?,"I likely (fingers crossed) will have a mortgage in 2 weeks. I know that the first years payments are mostly interest, however I also know many people advise to still put extra money into retirement accounts or ETFs etc since the return is likely greater than the interest rate in the long term. But since early payments are mostly interest, if I pay down the principle aggressively for a couple years, will that greatly decrease the total interest paid on the entire loan?

ie, let's say normally after 2 years I'm still paying 75% interest. If I paid down the principle to where it would be 30% interest, would at that point going forward be much less interest even if I go back to normal payments? Hope that makes sense I know I wrote it very confusing.

And does that make sense rather than investing (past my 401k) for a couple years?",finance
personalfinance,House Down payment - Navy Federal: Special EasyStart Certificate,"Hello Everyone! I planning to buy a house in the upcoming future (2-4 Years). I am keeping my credit up and saving for the down payment. I currently have the T-Mobile Money account where i'm getting 4% I believe and it's going well. However, it's only for the first $3000 I believe. After that it's 1% which is okay, but i'm wanting something better. I was looking and saw that Navy Federal and saw their Special EasyStart Certificate. It says from what i understand as high as 3.5% (What does this mean, does it mean 3.5 for sure at the end of the year or what) However, the bigger issue for me is that it's 3,000 maximum. I was wondering if this is the best option to put away another 3k for as high as i can get? Or is there another better option to keep saving the down payment with the ability to grab within 2-4 years?

personalfinance,Using some federal student loan money to pay off private student loan money?,"Hello! I'm about to start an MS program and am eligible for federal loans. I was not with my last bachelor's degree because it was my second, and I paid for it with a combination of out-of-pocket spending and private loans. I did not carry any debt for my first bachelor's degree due to having a full ride.

My question is: I was offered a federal loan that is significantly higher than my tuition (more than $10k over). I am not thinking about taking out the maximum loan amount, but a couple grand extra and using that to pay off one of my private loans that is at a higher interest rate and thus take advantage of IBR/potentially PSLF on those loan dollars.

However, that seems to me like it might violate the terms of a federal loan — I know you can use them for living expenses but does paying existing loans count as living expenses? I don't want to inadvertently commit fraud.",finance
personalfinance,Unemployment taxes,"I have recently filed for unemployment due to being furloughed in NC. During the application process it asked something along the lines of “how much state tax would you like taken out?” To which I put 10% and just assumed I’ll have to pay federal taxes manually.

I get my first payment and it is $760, which is 80% of full payment. State max, which I qualify for, is $350 + $600 federal relief so full payment is $950.

My question is where did the other 10% go? I looked on their website, but could not find a breakdown of payment. Calling them is a lost cause. Is anyone familiar with N.C. DES and could shine some light on this? Did state take 20% or did they give federal taxes the other 10%?",finance
personalfinance,Debt or savings??,"I’m in the US. My husband and I have been working to pay off debt pretty aggressively for the last 2 years. We essentially have our mortgage, which will stay, 1 car payment ($250) and 1 personal loan ($450). The personal loan is the death of me lol. We used it to consolidate some trouble we go into a couple of years ago. It started with a higher payment we could barely afford and a very high interest rate. Since then, we’ve made great leaps. I’ve refinanced it twice for lower rates and continue to make the original payment ($540) rather then the minimum for an extra boost. It was originally a 60 month loan. I’ve cut that down significantly through the refinancing and adding bulk payments when we have the $$$ and now there’s about 1 year left ($7400 total).

My intent was to pay that off, then use the snowball method to pay off the car so we could buy a new one. I’m just more comfortable with only having 1 car payment, so I’d like to pay off this one, trade in our older (owned outright) car to get a newer one. We have a young toddler at home and a 2nd baby arriving in a few months so I’m thinking we will need a bigger family car rather than our 2 small sedans.

However, maybe at the beginning of 2020, my husband suggested we just save for a while. Don’t put any bulk payments on the loan in case we need it (new water heater or whatever) and once the savings gets to be in a significant place, pay the whole thing off. So we’ve built up the savings quite a bit since then. Now we’re at a point that I think we can afford to pay it off, but he’s not sure yet. I manage the finances (now...after the consolidation which was really due to something he did). So after showing him the numbers he said he didn’t realize how much we actually have and wanted to just think about it a bit before saying to go for it. So I’m just looking to see if there’s anything’s we might not be considering.

Both of our jobs are pretty stable. He’s actually making more during the pandemic. He’s in sales and his company is thriving as they are useful to businesses cutting back in other areas during a time like this. But of course is that guaranteed to continue? Who knows. I technically work for an essential company as an admin, so I work from home. My company did close for a couple of weeks to get affairs in order to provide services remotely, etc but have since reopened so I’m back to work full time. Nothing is guaranteed in this climate, but we’re in pretty good shape at least.

We have about $16k in the savings, bills are about $4600/mo including the large loan payment, so theyd go down to about $4100 if I pay it off. The loan has $7200 on it so it would leave us with a bit more than half our savings.

We discussed what I’d want to do if I did pay it off. My next step is to tackle the car payment, but we haven’t seen this much in our savings in a long time so I would want to rebuild that. We have plans to buy a new house in a few years, etc. There’s a lot we want to do financially in the next 3 years that we definitely need to be savings as much as possible. So we discussed splitting up that old debt payment and putting some of it toward the car loan and some toward the savings, rather than all of it toward the loan. 

A couple updates due to thoughtful comments:

1. We are also invested in the market with a value of about 16k right now. At its highest point earlier this year, we were at about 21k. We’ve made a couple small purchases since the downturn in anticipation of a recovery so fingers crossed all that pays off in however long.

2. Baby #2 being born may not actually affect us much financially. We are in NJ where there actually is a state program for maternity leave. I can potentially be out of work from August-February and be paid at least a portion of my salary. The period I am on short term disability (4 weeks before due date and 6-8 weeks after), I should be paid in full. TDI pays 85% and I have supplemental short term disability insurance through Aflac. Once I’m off disability and using state FLI time to bond with baby (up to another 12 weeks), I won’t have supplemental insurance, but will still get 85% of my pay. I work from home so I’m not sure if I’ll take all of the time. I’ll have to see how hard it really is with 2 kids haha. But my husband also works from home and really isn’t planning on taking any time other than when we’re in the hospital. He doesn’t get any paid leave (works out of state where they don’t provide anything). But since he works from home and can handle flexible hours, he’s basically planning on staying on and just doing the best he can while helping me. I do imagine he might end up taking more than he’s saying now, but we’ll see lol.

3. interest rate on the personal loan is 9.89 and the car loan is 3.99. We’re now at a point that we owe about the same amount on each ($7400 on personal and $7200 on car).

I feel like we’re at a really critical point in our financial life and really want to play this right for maximum benefit as well as not leaving us with nothing lol.",finance

personalfinance,Financial advisor mentioned taxable account instead of aggressively paying off debt. What are your thoughts?,"My wife and I are currently in a lot of student loan debt.

His advice was that instead of tackling the debt very aggressively we just make minimum payments and invest that money into a taxable account with a moderately aggressive plan. I've never heard about this before and was wanting to hear what other people thought. Seems like a huge risk IMO.

Edit: The 4.875% is only one of the loans for about $30K, most are around 5-7%",finance

It had 12 months at a 0% APR.

The total balance on it when opened was $2200. 
I had a balance of $1013 on it until last month (March 2020). 
I just paid it off in full this month (April 2020).

I have never used it with the exception of that procedure. I double checked all my statements It had a $5000 credit limit if that is relevant. 

I knew I had missed my window and would be paying interest on that $1013, since I paid it off in April instead of March. 

But my interest charge was $474.15. 

It shows up on my statement as “Promo Finance Charge Adj”, but I don’t understand where that came from, because below that it says:

Fees charged for this period: $0
Interest charges for this period: $474.15

"" **t was mid-March and the vultures were circling Carnival Corp., the largest cruise-line operator in the world.**

**That all changed on March 23 when the Federal Reserve defibrillated bond markets with an unprecedented lending program. Within days, Carnival’s investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase** **&amp;** **Co. were talking to conventional investors such as AllianceBernstein Holding and Vanguard Group about a deal. By April 1, the company had raised almost $6 billion in bond markets, paying rates far below those executives had discussed just days earlier.**

**The previously unreported tale of Carnival’s rescue shows how effective the Fed has been in turning the debt spigot back on for large corporations.**

**The idea of a cruise company raising so much new debt even as the pandemic worsened caught many by surprise. Nevertheless, fear of missing out attracted more investors. When Carnival officially sold a $4 billion bond on April 1, it had enough demand to cut the interest rate down to 11.5% and issue a $1.75 billion bond that could convert into stock.** """,finance

personalfinance,Any catches for activating a 0.00% promo rate on an existing Credit Card?,"I have a credit card with Citi (Simplicity) that I opened about 8 years ago when I needed a low rate card to transfer a balance. Since I paid that off, I have been paying my statement in full every month for the past 7.5 years. I have since opened a cash-back CC that I use for virtually all my spending and also pay in full every month. Because the Citi card doesn't have any real useful rewards/benefits, I don't use it for very much. Essentially only for purchases made with my Apple ID. 

They sent me an email recently advertising that I can activate a promotional interest rate of 0.00% APR on new purchases until 12/1/2020.

investing,What do you think of my modification of Ray Dalio's All-Weather Portfolio?,"Dalio's public All-Weather portfolio is 30% stocks, 40% long term treasuries, 15% intermediate term treasuries, 7.5% gold, 7.5% commodities. If implemented suing ETFs, conventional wisdom would implement it like this:

30% VFINX, 40% VUSTX, 15% VFITX, 15% GLD (for lack of a way to get commodity exposure, I just doubled up on the gold allocation). Starting in Feb 2008, according to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), this portfolio yielded about 7.3% CAGR, and had a standard deviation of about 7.3%, and a maximum drawdown of 12.8% in 2008. Assume yearly rebalancing.

Here's my improvement and my reason why: IF we can find an even more volatile bond fund, we could increase the allocation of equity &amp; equity-like assets. There are two such funds out there: EDV and ZROZ. Both of these are extended duration, which means more price volatility &amp; interest rate risk. Because these funds zig when equities zag, we can increase the amount of equity-like exposure in our portfolio.

Instead of adding stocks, I will add leveraged middle market debt instead, specifically Business Development Companies (BDCs). These are essentially banks that solely lend to middle-market companies. Middle market debt has the characteristics of junk bonds - high yield, but equity-like risk. Because the bulk of the returns are paid out in the form of dividends and NOT share appreciation, BDCs can provide a consistent equity-like return. The best managed BDCs are MAIN and ARCC.

So, here's my modified All-Weather portolfio:

40% EDV, 30% VUSTX (stocks), 10% MAIN, 10% ARCC, and 10% gold. According to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), starting in Feb 2008, this portfolio yielded about 11.9% CAGR, had a standard deviation of about 11.2%, and had a maximum drawdown of 17.7% in 2008.

In performance, my modified All-Weather portfolio behaves a lot like the original All-Weather portfolio, but leveraged up to a 50% debt/equity ratio, but without using any leverage at all - hence it's suitable for retirement account portfolios. I'm 28, and I'm seriously considering committing this asset allocation for ever inside my 401K and Roth IRA - it's got a nice balance return &amp; volatility.

If there's better subs to post this, by all means I'm all ears I will do so.

Here's my problem. For awhile I have been opening different accounts at different banks to take advantage of the fairly significant checking/savings bonus offers (hundreds of dollars at multiple banks).

However, doing so has brought to my attention a weird problem transferring the money out of ""old"" bank to ""new"" bank when I receive the bonus and no longer wish to keep the account. So I have just such an account with Citi, and considering my nearest branch is 5 hours away, closing the account in person isn't an option. I could have a check issued for the entirety of the account balance, but I'd rather it not get lost in snail mail, not to mention the time it'd take.

So no problem you might say, just do an ACH transfer, same way I pulled funds out of NavyFed for deposit to Citi in the first place? Nope. I link the account in my Citi app but I guess NavyFed will not seem to allow deposit of funds into anything but a lending product. Checking to checking? Nope. Checking to savings? Nope. 

So ok maybe Zelle will work, lots of banks use Zelle right? I've never used it before, but I go to set up my Zelle profile and link the account (s), and guess what? Can't send money to my own accounts, only other phone numbers/emails.

Ok well then I realize I have a Wells Fargo account with a local branch maybe I can transfer money from Citi to there. I link the account, and I do finally get some money to transfer (I run a test transfer). SUCCESS! Then I try it again and realize they limit how much you can transfer in any 30 day period. Needless to say it would take about 6 months to transfer all the funds over.

So then I realize hey I still have some Citi starter checks, perhaps I can just mobile deposit a couple of them into NavyFed through the app. So I try that, and it seems like it's gonna work, I get a message saying $200 will be available the following day, with the rest available a few business days later. A few days pass, and I get a notification my NavyFed account is overdrawn by ~$400. And nearly simultaneously, I get a fraud alert from Citi asking if the check is legitimate or not, obviously I select yes. 

I call up NavyFed to see why it DEBITED my account for the amount of the checks, and I'm told that it was returned as unpayable due to Citi freaking out and freezing the account. Oh by the way, now I have $30 in returned check fees because Citi wouldn't cooperate.

Now, I was LUCKY to still have the checks and debit card laying around, it's highly unlikely I'll ever find this ""signature card"".

personalfinance,"Use HELOC to pay off car loan, continue making car payment on HELOC","Just refinanced my house and opened up a $40K HELOC during the process with the same lender to take advantage of the refi appraisal. I currently have a $23K car note at 3.25% with a monthly payment of about $500, which will pay off in 2024. 

The HELOC has a promotional interest rate of 1.99% for 12 months, then is prime minus 0.5%, with a minimum rate of 3.0%. It is currently at 3.0% and judging by historical Fed interest rate policy during economic downturns, I don’t expect it to go higher than 3.0% in the next few years.

Why shouldn’t I pay off the car loan with the HELOC, and then continue making my previous monthly payment amounts not he car loan to the HELOC? I’ll save 1.25% interest for the first 12 months, and then 0.25% after that. The HELOC is interest only for the first 10 years as well, so should I end up in a cash flow pinch, I can take advantage of that flexibility. 

Am I missing anything here?",finance

personalfinance,"Am I a candidate for a high-yield savings account, or should I just stick with a regular savings account?","On an article in regards to student loans and COVID, I saw a recommendation to place the money you would usually apply toward your student loans in a high-yield savings account. I researched some of the interest rates for these, and they seem almost too good to be true.  Many of the interest rates are higher than some  CD’s, but there are not penalties on transferring or withdrawing money from the account.  I want to know if there is a catch to this.   I have a major expense coming up in about a year, so I want to do everything that I can to grow my savings.   I’m currently furloughed from my job, so a CD would not be a wise choice for me right now since I need my money to be more liquid..   While my employer says they will be recalling me, this is in a state with at-will employment, so in the event I would permanently lose my job, I can’t risk having any money tied up in a CD.  

My one area of hesitance is that I have only ever used credit unions, not commercial banks.   The credit unions that I have accounts through do not offer high-yield savings accounts.  As a result, I am a bit wary of unnecessarily involving myself with for-profit banks that want to make money off of me and may have lots of hidden fees.

For people with knowledge of high-yield savings accounts,  are these typically only available to long-time members of banks as a “reward” so to speak? Or are they offered to people who are new to the bank?  To be clear, I would only want to use the bank for the purpose of a high-yield savings account.  My credit unions have very competitive credit card and loan rates without hidden fees, so I literally just want to move my savings from the credit union to the high-yield account and handle all other transactions/services through my credit union.  I don’t want to be forced to open up a checking account through the for-profit bank if I don’t have to.  Do banks tend to have a catch for people opening up a high-yield account, like would they require me to set up my direct deposit through them or enroll in other services?  I want to make sure that the money I’d be earning through interest wouldn’t be negated by other fees.  

My other major concern is if they typically have a higher requirement for the minimum savings you must put in a high-yield account. Some of the APY rates look fantastic, but I do wonder if there is a catch and if banks only offer these to people with a very large amount of savings.  I currently have $3,000 in my account.    Thanks to the extra $600 in weekly unemployment from the federal government, I am fortunate that once I start getting my unemployment I will be receiving essentially the same income I got previously.   I do anticipate being able to make additional deposits into the savings account from unemployment, but in the event my furlough goes beyond 13 weeks (the maximum period of time you can get the $600 weekly from the feds in addition to your state unemployment), I would not be able to afford to put anything else in the account.  My state’s unemployment rate is 50% of your regular income, so I would need to start eating into my savings.  In the event the furlough becomes a permanent layoff, it’s likely I’d have very little left in my savings when this is all said and done.    In the event I need to spend through my savings and would have to transfer a large amount of money from the high-yield account to my regular credit union, are there fees on transactions like this? What sorts of minimum balances do these high-yield accounts require you to maintain?  And do banks reduce the APY if your savings falls below a certain threshold?

Are there any other catches that I need to look out for when considering a high-yield account?  Before I open up a high-yield account, I want to make sure that these are a viable option for me,  and aren’t just designed for the wealthy who have tens or hundreds of thousands in the bank and can afford large fees and know they won’t have to majorly dip into their savings.",finance

investing,The textbook disconnect and how it may affect the market.,"Just some obervations I have. Open for discussion.

In the past we learnt that bonds and stocks usually moves in opposite direction. However over the past few years, companies issued more bonds to garner cash, and that cash was used to purchase their own stocks. Boeing is one such company. The whole operation started slowing down in january.

Why I think a V shape recovery is unlikely. The stock movements for the past few years were fueled by stock buy backs, often with issuance of corporate bonds. What we’ve read from company earnings now, is that companies started to conserve cash, some scrapped dividends and reduced buy backs. The junk bond market swelled and all desperate to look for buyers. Yes the feds are printing money, whether it is enough to save all will be another question. This rise is fueled by FOMO and speculation.

I believe some stocks will stand to benefit from this lock down. Such as amazon and costco etc. More sales going online is not equal to more sales online. I’ve been tracking big ticket items and electronics on amazon, majority are buying necessities and not luxury items. So the upcoming reports will be interesting to see whether this theory holds up.

My 2 cents.

TLDR: With every other company hoarding up cash for the unknown ahead, stock buy backs will be greatly reduced. Hence no V shape recovery.",finance

investing,Jeffrey Gundlach says a retest of March's low ‘very plausible’,"&gt; Jeffrey Gundlach said on Monday the stock market could sell off again to retest the low in March as he believes investors are too optimistic about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m certainly in the camp that we are not out of the woods. I think a retest of the low is very plausible,” Gundlach said on Monday on CNBC’s “[Halftime Report](https://www.cnbc.com/103226639/).” “I think we’d take out the low.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“People don’t understand the magnitude of ... the social unease at least that’s going to happen when ... 26 million plus people have lost their job,” Gundlach said. “We’ve lost every single job that we created since the bottom in 2009.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The so-called bond king revealed he just initiated a short position against the stock market.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Actually I did just put a short on the S&amp;P at 2,863. At this level, i think the upside and downside is very poor. I don’t think it could make it to 3,000, but it could. I think downside easily to the lows or beyond... I’m not nearly where I was in February when I was very, very short,” Gundlach said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX) has bounced 30% off its March 23 low of 2,191.86 as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented easing measures as well as signs that the pandemic could be easing off.  
&gt;  
&gt; Gundlach also said Monday the popular corporate bond ETF LQD [looks like the most overvalued bond asset](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/27/gundlach-says-lqd-corporate-bond-etf-looks-like-the-most-overvalued-bond-asset-because-of-fed.html) because of the Fed’s massive bond-buying program.

personalfinance,Are there loans I can take with bad credit and no co-signer?,"I'm a college student whose classes went entirely online in March.

I am pretty sure I failed the class--lots of missed assignments that I never knew about due to the professor silently posting them/changing the syllabus without informing us students--and as a result I will not be graduating on time due to missing just this one class. I could make up for this by taking a class during the summer, but I already have three classes scheduled, the max my Pell Grant will pay for. I was also informed I can't take out more federal student loans until the fall semester.

I am less than $1,000 off from being able to pay for the class. I don't have parental support and I don't have extra money because I have to pay for my living situation. I don't have awful credit, but it's not acceptable to take out any loans I know of without a co-signer, and I don't have any family to do so.

For me, it's not worth having to take another class AFTER the semester I was supposed to graduate as it will only delay my ability to get a job (and as it would only be one class, I would not qualify for Pell Grant and have to pay out of pocket then, too).

I am proud and fortunate to say that I have bought a home.

Here are my current mortgage stats

**Current Annual Interest Rate** 4.250 %

I heard different strategies to pay off a mortgage.

\- A biweekly option by lowering the principal by the time interest accrues.

So for example I will pay 1160 twice a month.

\- 13 payments every 12 months. Get the 13th payment, divide by 12 and distribute that monthly.

So for example my Monthly mortgage is 2139. Therefore I will pay \~$2320 with this strategy.

However, I  have no idea what is better between the two or a third better option. Literally just taking what I read online.

Hi, first time posting. I'm 23, in Canada, and thinking of getting my first credit card. I'm still employed right now and I just passed my 90 days, plus with the hazard pay, I'm making pretty much the same as I did before COVID. There's no signs of me losing my employment. I've never had a credit card before, but I have a student loan that I've been slowly but surely paying off. (Payments have been frozen due to COVID, so I may make a big lump payment soon, but that's another post for another day.) I've been thinking of getting a credit card for a while and I'm very tight with my money, so here are my reasons:

1. I just got my bachelor's, and I have a very decent of being accepted for my next school this fall. And due to COVID, they've promised me an automatic interview next year if I fail to get in this year. This means I will be moving out permanently soon, and I would like to have a CC if there's ever an emergency and I'm far from home. I had a situation earlier this year where I had to call my SO in the middle of the night, get him to pay for my application for me, and e-transfer him the money because my visa debit was not accepted. I had the money, but the payment could ONLY be made with a real credit card.

2. Travel expenses from moving out. I've already had a situation where I had to stay in a hotel to write a major exam, only to find out that my visa debit (from my bank) was not accepted for the deposit once I got to check-in. I didn't know this was going to happen and I was forced to drop $200 on the spot to get my keys, then had to get it refunded after my exam the next day. There's a good chance I'll need to do something similar again. I will also need to get a car for school, and while I don't plan on buying a car on a CC, I'd like to have a CC for emergencies.

3. I have no debt other than my student loan, but no credit. I would like to build that up, assuming my student loan payments aren't already doing this. I would probably do things like buying gas or small groceries on the card, and paying it off in full. I hate spending money and shopping makes me anxious, so I doubt I'd find a credit card tempting. If I DID make credit card purchases, it would probably be tiny things, like putting my $5/month music streaming subscription on it.

4. Due to COVID a lot of places are ONLY taking credit. This includes my dog's vet, which is not accepting visa debit. We just had to go to the corner store during a pandemic to buy a prepaid visa to pay for my dog's medication. They wouldn't take a cheque either. It's starting to look like we'll also have to buy my dog's food on a credit card too.

So those are my reasons for wanting a credit card. I think they're fair, but I'm not sure. I'll never buy more than I can pay off, and I know how dangerous CC's can be, so I plan on being very, very careful with it. I was going to make an appointment with my bank to talk about this, but they're closed to non-businesses right now.

---

As for how these things work, I was wondering what a flexible interest rate is, and how to find out your rate. My bank has one option that's ""4.50% to 12.75% on purchases and cash advances"". Apparently, there's something called a prime rate, and it's 2.450% today. What does this mean, and what would I have to do to get that lowest rate? Does applying for the card mean I'm forced to accept, or do I get to see what rate I'd get before I sign off on it? Will it hurt my credit score to apply/check the rate? You're gonna hate this, but I don't know my credit score or how to SAFELY check, because every online service I've seen wants a CC. Meanwhile, I've apparently been pre-approved for a card that has a fixed 20% interest rate, but that sounds like a terrible idea.

---

I think that's all of my questions. Would now be a good time to apply, or would it be too dangerous during COVID? And what is a flexible interest rate on a credit card? Thanks so much.",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card Act of 2009,"Hey there!

I opened a card with Navy Federal Credit Union with those 0% for 18 month promotional balance offers. I also transferred a balance from another card. I used the card quite frequently, got into a rough patch and had a high balance for a little while. But I have only made the minimum payment I'd say about 8 times and I have had the card for 4 years. So a total of 48 payments. 

About a year ago, I came into some money and made a $10,000 payment. Brining the balance really low. But since the promotional balance ended, I have been charged a interest charge on the new purchases and the transfer. Which made it hard to get ahead. 

From my understanding of the Credit Card Act of 2009, any payment I make that is over the minimum amount, goes to the balance that has the highest interest. If this is true, the interest charged on the balance transfer (which is the higher interest) should have been long gone by now. But yet they are still charging me about $20-40 a month. 

I have contacted them through email since call wait times are more than an hour. I have requested statements from more than 3 years ago. I plan to start to add up all the interest charges, the payments I've made, and collect records.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a summary of where I'm at right now (28 y/o, making \~$40K salary)

* I've got an emergency fund (6-months pay). Funds are split between a Money Market account (interest rate has dipped to 1.35% more recently) and a few CDs getting 2%. I'm still working, job is relatively secure but if the economy takes a significant hit there is some small risk of potential furlough or job loss.
* I'm putting 10% of each check into my company's 401K (Roth; would contribute more but have needed the 5% for some living expenses until more recently). Company does not give any 401K match.
* No high-interest debt.
* I am still paying off a car loan (\~$4500) at 2% interest. I also have a few credit cards w/ 0% intro APR that I'll have paid off before the 0% period expires, no rush there.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions about where to go next. Do I:

1. Pay off the car loan very aggressively so I can stop making car payments? Or,
2. Continue to save right now while the economy is tanking, pay off the car loan later when things are more stable.

If option 2, what is the best way to save? Add to savings/emergency fund, open an IRA, or increase Roth 401K contributions?

If IRA, would it be better to open a traditional or Roth, given that my 401K is currently set up as Roth? (Guessing traditional to cover both ends)

As with a lot of people, when I was younger I had accrued quite a bit of credit card debt. Mainly from interest rates to the point where I cut it off and basically ran from it.

personalfinance,Soon to be Grad,"Hello everyone,

Quick background: M/21, will be graduating this August with my BSc (yay!).

The situation:

* Student Debt: Federal Subsidized loans: \~25k.
* Cash Savings: \~35k
* 401k/Roth/Other employer stock: \~15k (depending on market)
* Annual Earnings: \~40k (will gross 5-10k more depending on OT).

Monthly Earnings:

* From Job: \~2-2.2k
   * On top of this \~$500 a month is also being spent on my retirement/employer stock purchases.
* From Internship: \~800-1k

Monthly Expenditures: \~$700-800

* Rent: $200
* Helping with bills: $250
* Insurance (helping pay for parents vehicle as well): $150
* Food/Grocery/Clothes/Gas: $100,
   * Whole family comes together to help with food.
   * Clothes are barely an expense, I primarily wear my uniform because I work 5 nights a week, and would be hard pressed to leave my sweats on days off (LOL).

Heres the question. I want a house, to get out of my parents place (for both our sakes). But, I also want to rid myself of the student loans. I am in pretty good shape financially for a 21 y/o, and I do see myself going back to school in the future (I want to pursue computer science). I can part ways with much of my savings either as a means to pay a down payment on a home, or erase my student loans without destroying my lifestyle. Is it wise to do either of these right now? Should I be contributing more aggressively to my retirement (I'm currently contributing 13%)?

Just looking for some guidance, not sure where to go from here.

Edit: If I were to buy a home, I would be saving another 1/2 years to have enough to put a 10% down on a 600k home and begin working full-time abandoning the aspirations of computer science for the most part.",finance

personalfinance,Filing taxes in two different states,"Hello, hoping someone can lend some tax guidance to a particular situation. So for the tax year 2019, I lived and worked in California from Jan 1st until Sept 9th. I then started work in Pennsylvania for the remainder of the year.

My wife lived and worked in Pennsylvania for the entire year. We filed our taxes as joint for Federal. Question is how do we file for state taxes?

My assumption is we would file separately as she would just file for Pennsylvania and I would have to file for both California and Pennsylvania. Using Turbo Tax has been a bit confusing as there is not an option like this to choose from as far as we saw. 

From what we have read, California tax laws are perhaps implying that we have to include my wife's income even though she did not work a day in Californina in 2019. Which does not make any sense at all.

So more or less, just looking for some direction.

personalfinance,Mortgage Forbearance / Will I Qualify For Loan Modification? / Fannie Mae Won't Require Lump Sum Payment,"So I was approved for forbearance due to covid-19. I was laid off until the business re-opens. I expect to collect unemployment hopefully in a week or two. Until then I have a safety net (savings account) of roughly $10k.

Still waiting on unemployment, in my state even with the added federal benefit It still only comes to about 60% of my regular pay when I was working. I expect to just cover my bills or only fall short a little which my savings will help cover the rest. Which is why I applied for forbearance and was granted.

If at the end of the forbearance period in 3-12 months I'm reading that Fannie Mae won't require lump sum repayment. If I make it to the end of this and still have some of my savings say in the range of $5-10k, will they require I drain it in order to pay back my mortgage? Then having no safety net to fall back on again?

Will I qualify for modification?

Will they audit my accounts and say hey you have XXX money in a savings account at ZZZ bank and you must repay the forbearance amount entirely since you are able?

investing,Back to Basics: Real Estate Investing,"Hi All,

First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&lt;source&gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. 


As part of a balanced portfolio, I've invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I'm entering the age to buy a primary residence, I've been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don't own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you'll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you'll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): ""The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth"" (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world's largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even with my casual research, it's clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. 

&amp;nbsp;



More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: 

* Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. 
* Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home

* To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing

* Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) 

* Learn from the community! 

Note: I considered posting this in /r/realestateinvesting, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Analysis**

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. 



&amp;nbsp;


Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I've seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  ""real estate investing is the best investment ever!"" vs. ""the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon"". I've summarized a few of the common tropes I've seen below with my analysis.


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!

As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that ""real estate"" will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? 

Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. 

Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. 

However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down

Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. 

It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. 

It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; It's supply and demand. There's a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! 

This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. 

However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. 

Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let's separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It's worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. 

I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. 


Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it's a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  ""housing"" for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!

This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. 

I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: 

* Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing
* Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; You won’t build your wealth in the stock market

One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. 

I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! 

The long term annual average of the S&amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). 

Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. 

But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Case study of real estate purchase:**

I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. 

&amp;nbsp;


A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. 


&amp;nbsp;


For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).


&amp;nbsp;


For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. 


&amp;nbsp;


Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. 


&amp;nbsp;


**So lets’s run the new numbers.**

You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.


&amp;nbsp;


We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.

&amp;nbsp;



So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. 


&amp;nbsp;

That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. 


&amp;nbsp;


Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. 


&amp;nbsp;


I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). 


&amp;nbsp;


The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;


**&amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):**
 
* Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR
* 20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%

This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on 
* With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;P 500 (4.26%)
* Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. 
* To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’


&amp;nbsp;


**401k analysis**

As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: 

* Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) 
* Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. 


&amp;nbsp;


At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. 


&amp;nbsp;


This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). 


&amp;nbsp;


If we assume the average S&amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. 


&amp;nbsp;


So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).

Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?


&amp;nbsp;


Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. 


&amp;nbsp;



We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.


&amp;nbsp;



The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:**


* Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value
* Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. 
* The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage 
* Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future
* If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs
* The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface 


&amp;nbsp;


**Some thoughts on the future:**

Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). 

* While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &gt; 3 years) 
* In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp; 2.3% respectively (42) 
* As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. 
* We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) 
* The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse 
* Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. 
* On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? 
* Local &amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? 
* As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. 
* The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties 
* I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. 
* There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? 

From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “""At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.

I have currently 20k in my accountt, is there an amount that would make creating a CD worth it, or is my amount not that high that it would only really be dollars difference? I would probably do a year for now for maybe 10k? I have no plans on needing this money at all.

I have a school fund that covers all school expenses and yea. Even if I kept the money in my savings I would have no plans to use it, so would it make sense to just create the CD to keep that high interest rate? For now the interest rate is now 1% but I assume it will go lower, so would it be worth it? (bank is Discover)

edit: When I go to discover's savings account site it says 1% but looking at my bank account when logged it says 1.4% still.

However, I expect this to go down, so I guess my question still stands, would it be worth it anyway to put money in a CD?",finance

personalfinance,Gifting closing costs for a home when you already have the money on your own? Do I need to disclose this to the lender?,"First time home buyer

I’m in an odd position. I’m already approved to buy our home, (we have about double the amount needed, so that we’re not depleting our savings) and my parents have just contacted me to tell me that they would like to gift closing costs, including the earnest and due diligence we’ve already sent off. (I am... floored?). This amount is under the $15k / $30k IRS gift limit. 

They’re private and old-fashioned and don’t want me to tell the lender. “Tell him it’s for furniture!” 

Well, okay, I agreed to let them talk to their CPA first. But I think our lender will probably notice, as he.... has all of our account info? And he’s been very great and I’m worried about not disclosing the information.

Also, I had spoken with him about doing a 401k loan for final closing costs, as my plan has a principle residence loan, and I just wanted to stay extra liquid to whack some higher interest rate debt down. And he ran the numbers and approved it. So my parents basically want to prevent me from doing that, and I’m obviously like, yeah, if you’d like to gift me that amount you won’t hear a single complaint out of me. But my lender will be expecting me to do this, because we talked about it.


So, do I need to tell my lender? How do you recommend approaching him about this?

Am I just being overly worried?

PS: my liability information on my disclosure only included credit I am on solely (not ones where my husband is a joint / designated user, like our co-car loan) they pulled these on their own from my credit report. Is that normal? I don’t super want to be like, hello, lender, I have more liabilities than you listed?

With rates lower and the fact that I have owned the home for 3 years, and that I am trying to remove PMI, I am considering a refinance. Here is the new scenario under the refinance:

Cost: $5,500 - added to new loan to make new balance $244,500k

New PMI: $29/month - falling off within 2 years when hitting Loan/Value of 80%

I feel it is a fair deal, however I am curious if I should shop around. Over the life of the loan, I would save about $25k in interest. I know refinance is worthless if I sell in a year, but I plan on staying for at least 3-5 more years.

They weren't able to answer all of my questions b/c the guy went ghost on me and I was disconnected shortly thereafter. 

But, from what I gathered their repayment plan includes the borrower posting a payment of 2 out of the 3 skipped payments, then spreading the third payment over a period of up to six months. 

**The Issue**: My concern, as well as of those I've found elsewhere, is ""how does the lender expect a borrower to make 75% of the skipped payments at the end of the forbearance period?"" 

**Solutions?**: I'm preparing to draft a letter to my congressperson and was curious to see if others have done so or were willing to do so now. Specifically, I'd like an option where a borrower could pay their standard mortgage plus an additional amount over a period of up to 24 mos. which would bring the account up-to-date.

As far as the repayment plan, does anyone have any prior experience with lenders?

1. Have you had any luck in negotiating preferable terms with their lender re the repayment option? What tactics did you use?

worldpolitics,President’s intelligence briefing book repeatedly cited virus threat,"&amp;#x200B;

[Greg Miller](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/greg-miller/) and 

[Ellen Nakashima](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ellen-nakashima/) 

April 27, 2020 at 5:22 p.m. EDT

U.S. intelligence agencies issued warnings about the novel [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_1&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_1) in more than a dozen classified briefings prepared for President Trump in January and February, months during which he continued to play down the threat, according to current and former U.S. officials.

The repeated warnings were conveyed in issues of the President’s Daily Brief, a sensitive report that is produced before dawn each day and designed to call the president’s attention to the most significant global developments and security threats.

For weeks, the PDB — as the report is known — traced the virus’s spread around the globe, made clear that China was suppressing information about the contagion’s transmissibility and lethal toll, and raised the prospect of dire political and economic consequences.

But the alarms appear to have failed to register with the president, who routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified material.

34 times Trump downplayed the coronavirus

Over the past two months, President Trump has regularly sought to downplay the coronavirus threat with a mix of facts and false statements. (Video: JM Rieger/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) 

The advisories being relayed by U.S. spy agencies were part of a broader collection of worrisome signals that came during a period now regarded by many public health officials and other experts as a squandered opportunity to contain the outbreak.

As of Monday, more than 55,000 people in the United States had died of covid-19.

The frequency with which the coronavirus was mentioned in the PDB has not been previously reported, and U.S. officials said it reflected a level of attention comparable to periods when analysts have been tracking active terrorism threats, overseas conflicts or other rapidly developing security issues.

A White House spokesman disputed the characterization that Trump was slow to respond to the virus threat. “President Trump rose to fight this crisis head-on by taking early, aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,” said spokesman Hogan Gidley. “We will get through this difficult time and defeat this virus because of his decisive leadership.”

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is responsible for the PDB. In response to questions about the repeated mentions of coronavirus, a DNI official said, “The detail of this is not true.” The official declined to explain or elaborate.

U.S. officials emphasized that the PDB references to the virus included comprehensive articles on aspects of the global outbreak, but also smaller digest items meant to keep Trump and senior administration officials updated on the course of the contagion. Versions of the PDB are also shared with Cabinet secretaries and other high-ranking U.S. officials.

One official said that by mid- to late January the coronavirus was being mentioned more frequently, either as one of the report’s core articles or in what is known as an “executive update,” and that it was almost certainly called to Trump’s attention orally.

The administration’s first major step to arrest the spread of the virus came in late January, when Trump restricted travel between the United States and China, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year.

But Trump spent much of February publicly playing down the threat while his administration failed to mobilize for a major outbreak by securing supplies of protective equipment, developing an effective diagnostic test and preparing plans to quarantine large portions of the population.

[The U.S. was beset by denial and dysfunction as the coronavirus raged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/04/04/coronavirus-government-dysfunction/?arc404=true&amp;tid=lk_interstitial_manual_22&amp;itid=lk_interstitial_manual_22)

Trump insisted publicly on Feb. 26 that the number of cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” and said the next day that “it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

In reality, the virus was by then moving swiftly through communities across the United States, spreading virtually unchecked in New York City and other population centers until state governors began imposing sweeping lockdowns, requiring social distancing and all but closing huge sectors of the country’s economy.

As late as March 10, Trump said: “Just stay calm. It will go away.” The next day, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.

By then, officials said, the warnings in the PDB and other intelligence reports had taken on the aspect of an insistent drumbeat. The first mention of the coronavirus in the PDB came at the beginning of January, [focusing on what at that point were troubling signs of a new virus spreading through the Chinese city of Wuhan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_28&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_28), and the Chinese government’s apparent efforts to conceal details of the outbreak.

In the ensuing weeks, U.S. intelligence agencies devoted additional resources and departments to tracking the spread of the coronavirus. At the CIA, the effort involved agency centers on China, Europe and Latin America, as well as departments de­voted to transnational health threats, officials said.

The preliminary intelligence on the coronavirus was fragmentary, and did not address the prospects of a severe outbreak in the United States.

U.S. intelligence officials, citing scientific evidence, have largely dismissed the notion that the virus was deliberately genetically engineered. But they are continuing to examine whether the virus somehow escaped a virology lab in Wuhan, where research on naturally occurring coronaviruses has been conducted.

“We’re looking at it very closely, but we just don’t know,” said one senior U.S. intelligence official.

The warnings conveyed in the PDB probably will be a focus of any future investigation of the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in early April called for the formation of an independent commission analogous to the one created to investigate the Sept, 11, 2001, attacks.

In response to that probe, the George W. Bush administration was pressured to declassify portions of the PDB from August 2001 — a month before 9/11 — warning that al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was “determined to strike in U.S.”

Senior officials with direct knowledge of Trump’s intelligence briefings say that Trump listens and asks questions during the sessions. “We go in and he treats us with respect,” one senior official said.

But Trump has also been combative or dismissive toward U.S. intelligence agencies throughout his presidency.

In mid-February, as the pathogen was spreading, Trump fired acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire after learning that a senior analyst had briefed members of Congress that Russia was seeking to interfere in the 2020 presidential election and had “[developed a preference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/after-a-congressional-briefing-on-election-threats-trump-soured-on-acting-spy-chief/2020/02/20/1ed2b4ec-53f1-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_41&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_41)” for Trump.

Officials have noted that Trump was also contending with the Senate impeachment trial in January and focused on other security issues, including tracking Iran’s response to a Jan. 3 U.S. airstrike that killed a top Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani, in Baghdad.

David Priess, a former CIA officer who was a PDB briefer in the George W. Bush administration, said that even if Trump is ignoring his briefing book, other officials including national security adviser Robert O’Brien are probably digesting the material and interacting with Trump daily.

O’Brien’s deputy, Matthew Pottinger, has a background in intelligence and was among a small circle of senior officials urging early action to contain the coronavirus, U.S. officials said. Pottinger pushed to close off air travel from Europe in February, officials said, but Trump did not do so until mid-March.

“The fact that \[Trump\] gets only two or three briefings a week from the intelligence professionals doesn’t mean that’s the only exposure to the PDB he’s getting,” Priess said. “He can get the best intelligence in the world and still not make good decisions based on it.”

Priess, author of a book on intelligence briefings for presidents, said that Trump’s predecessors have been varied in their approaches to consuming intelligence. President Barack Obama was considered an avid reader of “the book,” which was prepared for him on a specially equipped computer tablet. President George W. Bush reviewed the highlights of the PDB and often discussed its contents at length with his briefer. President Richard M. Nixon likely didn’t read the PDB, Priess said, but was extensively briefed by his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger.

Trump’s top health officials and advisers were also delivering warnings on the coronavirus through January and February, though their messages at times appeared muddled and contradictory.

On Feb. 25, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned publicly that virus was spreading so rapidly that “we need to be prepared for significant disruption in our lives.”

Trump, traveling in India at the time, was [outraged by what he regarded as the alarmist tone of her remarks ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-frantic-attempts-to-minimize-the-coronavirus-crisis/2020/02/29/7ebc882a-5b25-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_52&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_52)and their perceived impact on the U.S. stock market.

Two days later, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified before a Congressional committee that the risk to the public remained “low,” and that the coronavirus would “look and feel to the American people more like a severe flu season in terms of the interventions and approaches you will see.”

On March 11, with cases surging in New York and the stock market plummeting, Trump declared a national emergency and announced a ban on travel from Europe, which had become the new epicenter of the outbreak.

personalfinance,Interest on a bank loan,"How is interest on a bank note calculated? I have a loan for my business through a bank and due to the Coronavirus, they have agreed to go interest only for six months. The principal is $4,682,894.33. The interest rate is 5.25%. It was 31 days in between payments. They said the interest owed is $21,853.50. Also, after making the payment, one days interest is said to be $682.92. It’s considered a mortgage. Taking the $21,853.50 and dividing by 31 days gives us $704.95/day in interest. Also taking the principle and multiplying by 5.25% and dividing by 365 gives us $673.57.

personalfinance,With super low mortgage rates does it make sense to put extra money into a mortgage?,"I recently purchased a home which is super exciting. The mortgage is about $500,000 (30 years) at 3.375% which is a pretty fantastic rate. I had fantasies that with the current pandemic recession heading towards us I might get an even better rate. But this is still great. 

Looking at my mortgage amortization table, in these first years my payment ($2000 and change plus escrow) will go, by the great majority, into interest payments. So an extra principal payment of $200/mo, for instance, increases my principal payment by about 25% which is a lot. Over the course of 30 years I would save approximately $43,000 in interest payments.  

Here’s the thing: with such a low interest rate does it make sense to pay extra into the mortgage?

I feel like $43000 is not that much in actuality to save over the course or 30 years. If I take that $200/mo and invest it for instance in my IRA, that comes out to $72000, not to mention any gains in the market. 

It’s almost like the mortgage rates being so low makes it kind of like “free money,” by which I don’t *actually* mean it’s free but the cost of the mortgage is so low that it is relatively cheap compared to other kinds of debt like credit card debt. Keep in mind I know that this sub is very anti-debt and will usually pay anything off as fast as you can. But if I need to make a choice, eg to put an extra $200 into the mortgage or put $200 into my retirement account, it’s a tricky situation.",finance

worldpolitics,Democrats Fail to Inject Safeguards into New Republican $480 Billion PPP Bill,"The US House of Representatives passed a US $484 billion relief  package to boost funding for small businesses, hospitals and coronavirus  testing, sending the bill to President Donald Trump for signature.

The lower chamber approved the bill by a vote of 388-5, two days  after the Senate swiftly cleared the legislation in a voice vote.  Congressional Democrats reached an agreement with the Trump  administration on the package earlier this week. This without many safeguards to make sure small firms can access these funds. 

The package will provide more than 310 billion dollars in additional  funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to boost small  business lending, as well as US $75 billion for hospitals and US $25  billion for virus testing.

Calling the new bill “an interim emergency funding package,”  Democratic leaders have pledged to advance a larger bill, which could  include another round of direct payments to households as well as more  aid to state and local governments.

The PPP, designed to provide loans for small businesses to keep their  workers on the payroll during the COVID-19 outbreak, ran out of money  last week. Much of that money taken up by publicly traded companies.

About 80 per cent of PPP applicants said they are still waiting, and  many do not know where they are in the application process, according to  a survey released Monday by the National Federation of Independent  Business.

stocks,What's next? (not bear vs bull) but an investor's insight! Opinions needed,"Alright so a bit of overview, I am one that believes that the US government is a shit show right now in terms of the policy, divided with allegations and misleading information everywhere.

Back when the entire stock jumped around dec / Jan I was a believer than a recession is bound to happen, every bubble pops.

As COVID struck, my bet is that it was going to speed this recession into action, my guess was that stocks would skyrocket once a vaccine is out, not when states start to reopen etc.

My view on covid? Its stupid how governments are acting, back a month ago where many states didn't have social distancing, we were at 20k levels, going back to 20k level doesn't mean the virus is done, but rather slowed down and opening too soon will have implications, that is a fact and not a political hoax.

Now yes the stocks and economy at some point have a bit of a mismatch at times, HOWEVER, the economy can bring companies down on their knees with Q2 earnings, not counting so much on this that

What am I counting on? In Dubai they opened one of the biggest malls that saw insane amount of traffic on usual, the traffic after the opened it? EMPTY

I for one, when things open before a vaccine I am NOT taking a holiday, NOT going to the theatre, NOT travelling and NOT going to be spending in malls / retails more than I am rn.

Now away from the rantish, an average American has debts and mortgages up to their nose, so where is this money coming from? Sureee.. the feds but who else?  If the feds interventions work so well, why did we get a dip when oil hit negative? 

One can't defeat the feds, but the market as a whole can def defeat the feds, otherwise, its just the feds playing by themselves LOl

&amp;#x200B;

My opinion:

The market is unforeseen, youngsters and noobies are buying into stocks thinking they are the next buffet, proof?  Tesla is being bought because ""its cool man"" and ""420 tesla is the future"" 

Technicals are out the window for the short term, now how will the market face up? unpredictable otherwise we all would be rich rn, and that's a fact. 

The question is, how will investor act in the next three weeks?

Oil hit 24% decrease today, oil WILL hit lows again, maybe not negative but very close to, the shock of reopening the economy in a switch is not believable, 

sure ""This is different, this is an induced recession"" 

Alright, open your ears for a sec before typing out your bullish rant, I am not a bear, I am just sharing my thoughts.

I worked on fundraising from massive companies, and talked to over 300 senior managers over Q4 of 2019, the main feeling I got is they are holding funds as they expected a recession before they even knew COVID is a reality.

The reality, this is not a COVID induced recession, it's a bubble that was due to burst and COVID just hit the nail into the coffin.

What's my next move?

I am hesitant, I have technicals and spreadsheets that are kinda useless, they will catch up long term but not sure when to get in. In 2008, it took months before we reached the actual dip, we had a bear trap dip that bounced back before the real dip. 

I am holding with cash until the market gives up, that's when you invest, will my cash lower value? No, I am not holding USD as I trust it better where the feds are printing things right and left.

To start off with I’m 19 and signed up for a Discover student credit card a few weeks ago (around the beginning of April) to help myself establish credit early. Today I decided to take a look at my FICO credit score and it was a 644 which surprised me because I haven’t even received my first statement yet. I took a look at the length of credit and it said 8 months and I came to the conclusion that the length was from federal student loans totaling 5,500 dollars. I don’t think this should have hurt my score since I’m not required to start making payments until November 2023. Digging a little deeper I decided to take a look at my free credit report and saw I had three hard inquires, one from a Macy’s credit card which I unknowingly agreed to about a year ago(never officially signed up for). One from a private loan for school from PNC bank that I wasn’t able to obtain and one from a parent plus loan that I got, which I co-signed with a parent. The parent plus loan itself however is not showing up on my credit report like the federal loan so I’m assuming I’m not taking primary burden of the loan. Both of these took place in August 2019. I’m not sure if any other factors are affecting my credit but should I be worried about such a low score even if it is early on?",finance

personalfinance,"Mortgage Refinance Bait and Switch, Or Am I An Idiot?","Apologies in advance for how wordy I am.


My wife and I bought our house 4 years ago in a HCOL area for 400k. We didn’t put much down at all, and have a wild $177 PMI on our current 30 year / 4% fixed rate mortgage. We currently have 363k to go. This is a house that we plan on living in for all 30 years, and then some, and have made improvements to the house over the past 4 years as property values have steadily risen in the area. 


With the goal of getting rid of PMI, we figured we would take advantage of current interest rates. Fortunately we have excellent credit and were able to get a 3% interest rate on a 25 year mortgage  (knocking off 9 months of our 30 year), getting rid of PMI (so we were told prior to signing the rate lock), and lowering our monthly payment by $300 - while rolling closing costs into the mortgage (not ideal but we value cash in hand with the pandemic). Wins all around, right?


I get the rate lock document to sign and it has ~$50 PMI on it. “Oh that’s just a formality using the original value of the house, the bank will accept a higher value because they’ll know your house will now be appraised for ____ and you won’t have PMI.” I don’t think much of it because a) the PMI is very low compared to now b) I sort of trust this guy based on several decent people I know recommending him using him c) there’s no way that my house is valued the same as in 2016. He assured me he will send a new estimate in the coming days with no PMI on it. We sign the document. A few days later, I have yet to receive the updated document without PMI and this guy is now stating that we signed what we signed and the appraisal will dictate whether I have PMI or not. He’s saying the bank didn’t accept the higher value he proposed, so now we are locked into PMI unless the appraisal comes in higher...and then he proceeds to try to talk me out of appraisal because he got a waiver that would save me $450. 


My questions:

- will this guy directly benefit from me having PMI?

- should I be concerned that he chooses a biased appraiser?

- am I able to back out of this if anything changes, though we signed the rate lock estimate?

investing,Negative effective bond yields - What does this mean?,"I know there has been speculation as to if the US treasury yields will go negative, but there is something I've been contemplating: the effective yield of them already has \*been\* negative for some time. The fed's stated policy goal is an inflation rate of 2%; it usually hits between 1%-1.5%. There were many times even in the last decade where the 10 year T-bond yield was below the stated inflation goal rate, and now it's around 0.6%, implying a return of -1.4%.

What I am wondering is, why are people investing in these securities which are going to lose money after inflation happens? Is it simply because of an oversupply of dollars? Or is it an undersupply problem? If the demand for these bills are in high demand, ie US dollars are in short supply, and the yield falls below the inflation rate, then that is effectively pulling dollars out of the system, no? Less dollars in the system means the yields will fall lower, and inflation will pull even more out.

In the last recession in 2008, inflation hit around 5.5%, with the 10 year bond yield sitting around 3.5%. If inflation hits between 5%-6% again, the spread between that and the yield is going to be much larger.

Does this mean that we shouldn't expect inflation as high as 5-6% this time around? Or does it mean that the markets are so volatile right now that traders would rather take a 5% loss on their investment than be exposed to the stock market?",finance

I have almost three months of expenses in an e-fund and have a retirement account.  I owe ~$8,600 on my car with a 6.5% interest rate.  Unfortunately, there isn’t much equity in the car because I drove it across country several times and it has an accident on the report (rear-ended).  Car payment is $210 a month (comprehensive insurance is $220).  I cannot afford to pay it off outright without digging deep into my financial reserves.  

I am financially stable (in that I take in a lot more than I spend).  This financial stability is recent - in the past year or so.  I can afford the car payment and comprehensive insurance with no concern.  But, frankly, I miss not caring about how my car looks.  I miss having a car paid off.  I miss driving a manual.  I miss my old 2004 Honda Civic with a manual transmission lol. 

My thought:  sell the car for slightly above its value, then use the equity as a down payment for a $4,000 much older car (I’m thinking an older Honda)?  Is this a good idea?  The loan would probably be $3,000 unless I take from my savings.

For those of us holding small cap, small cap value, REITs, the stocks are indeed down more than the ""market"". Idk why people think every stock has to crash -50% for it to be real. Some examples,

VBR (Vanguard Small Cap Value) is down 29% from its 1yr high on Feb 20, 2020.

SCHA (Schwab Small Cap) is down 24% from its 1yr high on Feb 20, 2020.

The above is just a sample, as of this writing I am counting 19 SPDR ETFs from various sectors and styles that are down 30%-71%. Notable mentions; XLE: -50.72%, KRE: -43%, SPYD: -36%, SRT: -32% to name a few.

Mistaking a victory in an early battle means that the war is won, imported cases started to infect the community and with uncurtailed community spread, it quickly became one of the countries with the highest % rate of infections (adjusted for population size) and eventually had to implement draconian social distancing measures.

Watch out for the increase in rate of infections for the re-opened countries and states and that will be a good barometer for how much more protracted this crisis will be. The next 3-4 weeks will be a crucial period.",finance

personalfinance,Dependent Care FSA after Qualifying Life Event,"My wife is a federal employee, and we are exploring use of the dependent care FSA with our baby. We hired a very part-time nanny starting near the end of last year, but really had no clue how long she'd be available (she was pregnant herself) so did not sign up for the FSA at that time. In early March, we hired a new one who has much more availability, so we want to use that as a qualifying life event to start the FSA. But we have several questions, and in the phone call with HR they were less than helpful. Anyone with experience using dependent care FSA as a federal employee would be especially appreciated. 

Primarily, my wife plans to separate from service at some point during the summer, so we want to maximize the FSA benefit but be absolutely sure before electing which expenses will be eligible. We have already hit $5000 in nanny expenses this year, but we need to know how the timing of the QLE might affect what's eligible (and we are no longer using the nanny due to the stay-at-home order, so likely won't accumulate any further expenses before she quits).

1. If the hiring of a new nanny who worked more days/week than the old one is the QLE, would only the difference in weekly pay be eligible for reimbursement? (That seems unlikely to me, but thought I would ask)
2. The HR rep was really talking in circles and made it sound as though, if the FSA becomes effective on April 28th for a March 1st QLE, we would only be eligible for reimbursement for expenses incurred after April 28th. That seems wrong to me (and if it's true, we basically can't use the FSA at all since the nanny is no longer working). Is that correct?
3. After starting the FSA from a qualifying life event, would it be possible to go back to get reimbursements for expenses that occurred this year before the QLE (i.e., the pay for the original, part-time nanny)?
4. When paying nanny taxes (which are eligible for the FSA), what is required for proof? I have proof for the payment of quarterly unemployment taxes, but the payment of payroll taxes as a household employer just goes on our taxes filed next year. Do I just ask for reimbursement for her gross wages rather than net, or would I need to show Schedule H, which we obviously won't have until next year and thus it would be ineligible since my wife will be separating from service before then?
5. Specific to federal OPM, is there any trick to accelerating contributions?

Bitcoin,All You Need to Know on Bitcoin Halving and Why It Is Essential,"Expected for many months by the whole community, and even beyond now, Bitcoin’s third Halving will take place in few days. At the current pace of adding of the new blocks on the Bitcoin Blockchain, this third Halving should take place on May 12, 2020.

The excitement around this key event for Bitcoin is growing. This is evidenced by the volume of searches on Google for the term “Bitcoin Halving” which have never been higher since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009:




Disappointed with the current monetary and financial system, many people are beginning to consider the plan Bitcoin.

The most concrete evidence of this newfound appeal for Bitcoin is  the decision by Americans to use their stimulus check of $1,200 to purchase bitcoin.

There are signs that do not deceive. In a world where everything is going negative, from central bank interest rates, to the price of U.S. crude oil, and to equity market returns, safe havens will play their full role in the coming months.

Gold and Bitcoin, which have posted positive performances of +15% and +5% respectively since the beginning of the year, will therefore have the wind in their sails in the coming months.

Objectively, Bitcoin is superior to gold in many ways: greater divisibility, durability, portability, recognizability, and much scarcer.

For a large majority of citizens, Bitcoin will therefore be a better solution than gold.

If you are among those who are still hesitant to take the plunge and buy your first Bitcoins, you should ask yourself a lot about what Halving is, and why it gives Bitcoin a vital advantage.

In what follows, I propose to find out everything you need to know about the Halving of Bitcoin that will take place in May 2020. More importantly, I will tell you why this event is essential for Bitcoin.

How are new Bitcoins created?

As always, I think it is essential to get back to basics. To fully understand what Bitcoin Halving is, you need to understand when new Bitcoins are created.

New Bitcoins are created every time a new block of transactions is added to the Bitcoin Blockchain successfully.

When a new block is correctly added to the Bitcoin Blockchain, the first transaction in that block is the reward that will be paid to miners who correctly solve the math puzzle associated with that block.

This math puzzle is at the heart of Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm, the so-called Proof-of-Work.

Specifically, in order to correctly add a new block of transactions to the Bitcoin Blockchain, a miner must find the cryptographic signature that begins with a specific number of consecutive zeros for the data in a block of transactions.

Simplifying things, the more zeros added at the beginning of the cryptographic signature to be found for the data in a block, the more difficult it becomes to mine a block of Bitcoin Blockchain.

In order to guarantee an average production of one block every 10 minutes, the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 mined blocks. This results in an adjustment of the difficulty of the Bitcoin Blockchain approximately every two weeks.

The higher the computing power available on the Bitcoin network, the more secure the network is, and the higher the difficulty increases. This computing power available on the network is called the Hash Rate.

Halving contributes to the predictability of Bitcoin

With an average of one block mined every 10 minutes, we can say that 144 blocks are added on average every day to the Bitcoin Blockchain.

I say average because if the Hash Rate increases significantly, we will be able to have a higher production of new blocks per day. On the other hand, if the Hash Rate falls sharply, we would have fewer blocks produced each day.

Difficulty’s adjustment of the Bitcoin Blockchain then takes care of fixing things.

The Bitcoin reward given to miners who validate a block correctly will decrease over time. This is inexorable because everything is written in the Bitcoin source code.

This decrease in Bitcoin reward for miners occurs every 210,000 mined blocks, and is called Bitcoin Halving. Taking into account the average production of one block every 10 minutes, we can estimate that a Bitcoin Halving takes place every 4 years on average.

In fact, the sharp increase in Bitcoin’s Hash Rate over time makes this Halving a little faster than every 4 years.

Originally, the reward for miners was 50 BTC.

Bitcoin’s first Halving decreased this reward to 25 BTC on November 28, 2012. Bitcoin’s second Halving took place on July 9, 2016 reducing the reward to 12.5 BTC.

At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin Blockchain has 627,548 blocks.

Since a Bitcoin Halving takes place every 210,000 mined blocks, you understand that at block 630,000, the third Bitcoin Halving will take place.

Therefore, there are only 2,452 blocks left to mine before this third Halving takes place. By the time you read this story, there will be even fewer left. All of this allows us to estimate that the third Bitcoin Halving will take place on May 12, 2020.

After this third Halving, the reward for the miners will only be 6.25 BTC.

Now that you know in detail what a Bitcoin Halving is, I will tell you why this event is essential.

Halving makes Bitcoin’s monetary policy even more unique

Bitcoin’s monetary policy is as simple as it is powerful:

A maximum quantity of 21 million units that will never change.

An inflation of the daily supply of new Bitcoins that decreases over time to reach zero when all Bitcoins have been mined in 2140.

Bitcoin Halving that takes place every 210,000 mined blocks is what allows the daily supply of new Bitcoin to decrease over time.

This policy is reinforced by the fact that it is programmatic. It does not depend on any human decision which by definition would be arbitrary. Everything is automatic and predictable.

No matter what happens, the third Bitcoin Halving will take place. So what Bitcoin is proposing to you is the opposite of what is happening with the current monetary and financial system.

The economic crisis that is now beginning to unfold brings back to the forefront the solution that central bankers around the world have been systematically using to deal with economic problems: quantitative easing.

Quantitative easing is an unconventional monetary policy that involves buying a predetermined amount of government bonds or other financial assets in order to add money directly into the economy.

Before conducting this type of monetary policy, central banks prepare the ground by lowering interest rates to the lowest possible level. The Fed lowered them to zero in March 2020, while the European Central Bank has had negative rates for several years now.

The first disadvantage of quantitative easing is that the induced increase in the money supply will lead to currency devaluation.

Those who have most of their wealth in cash are the first to be penalized. Obviously, it is the poorest who are therefore impacted first. Indeed, they cannot afford to buy gold, real estate, or invest in the stock market.

economy,"Ok, so can someone please explain to me how the US economy is going to recover so strongly after COVID-19, when we have all of this going for us?","1. We're at the highest consumer debt rates since recovering from the Great Depression.

2. Federal deficit could hit $4.3 trillion and over 20% of GDP this year: The Federal deficit was on track to be over $1 trillion without any additional spending for the coronavirus this fiscal year. Now with the $2 trillion CARES Act, the $484 billion relief package and $134 billion for the Families First Act, the CRFB also estimates that, “nearly $600 billion in additional deficit spending as a result of feedback effects from lower economic output, slower inflation, higher unemployment, and lower interest rates” will occur. 

3. Oil storage is filling up, we're having to stop production, prices have fallen 75% (and even went negative for May contract, possibly will happen for June contract as well), showing that consumer demand for travel is at all time lows. We don't even know for sure how long it will take demand for travel will come back to 2019 levels, and they could be at low levels for years. 

4. Market is already overpriced. P/E levels before COVID-19 were already elevated above average levels, due to being in a bull market for 10 years. It is very unlikely that with all of the sustained pressure on the economy that P/E levels will be able to go much higher from the ""P"" side. Most likely they will jump higher when earnings are reported this coming month, on a downgrade of the ""E"" side. 

To me, it seems like the overall markets are prime for a long sustained recession, and yet they're currently holding on to relatively minimal losses YTD. I know they're reacting to monetary and fiscal policies, but I'm worried that due to most companies not giving future guidance on earnings, that the earnings estimates are still way too high. I believe that once earnings start to be divulged (especially in financial sector), the market will begin to turn downward. 

Think about it this way: Our federal debt has multiplied nearly 4x this year alone. How are we going to pay for that? Not by cutting taxes for years coming out of this... nope, quite the opposite, or we'd need to reduce federal spending on other programs for many many years. What happens when you reduce federal spending? Depends on what you're cutting, but it means potentially: job losses (of which we're already going to be at Great Depression levels coming out of this), people going hungry, infrastructure degradation, etc... 

This is going to be a very difficult path to recovery, and people are just not internalizing that yet, I don't think the market is either. 

I would love to hear other people's analysis and opinions as well!",finance

I've been put in a rather prosperous position during this quarantine and am looking to take the best advantage of it.

I've saved 3500 dollars so far and continue to receive about \~800 per week from state unemployment+PPP stimulus. I was looking for guidance on the best way to go about managing my finances as I continue to accrue wealth that I probably don't rightfully deserve.

I have a standard savings and checking account with \~3500 dollars between them and a credit card with 0 outstanding balance. I have a 756 credit score as of writing this post (if that matters I don't know).

I know to keep a $1000 slush fund so that'll be better, but should I be looking into putting that other 2500 into something that has a higher interest rate? I've also been considering an IRA for a long time and I kind of want to start contributing to that.

personalfinance,Bonds &amp; CDs: Am I missing something?,"I had about 30% of my savings in the stock market. I talked to a financial advisor (not officially, he was just offering some advice) and he said if I wanted to buy a house in the next 2-3 years, then having my money in the stock market wasn't a good idea. So I am looking into other, less risky, ways to invest and grow my money. 


I am trying to figure out what the benefit of buying a bond is vs. keeping my money in my 1.5% savings account. The bond rates are way less than 1%. Am I missing something? What is the incentive of buying a bond if the interest rates are so low? Same with CDs, why would my financial institution offer CDs with interest rates equal to or less than my savings account?

personalfinance,"Inheritance: can I afford to make purchases, investing, or should I focus on paying off debt.","For background: I am currently at the end of my second year of law school, I will finish with close to six figures in student debt. My Grandmother passed recently and left me roughly $10,000, I've honestly never dealt with this amount of money before (see, student). I had part time work but that went out the window with corona virus and my job prospects for after graduation are likewise paused at the moment. However, I do expect to be employed. 

Ideally I would like to use part of this money as a down payment on a car as my current one is up over 200,000 miles and repairs are costing more than the value of the car. I have never purchased a car on my own and do not have great credit although I have had a low balance credit card since high school. I think a car payment could help build my credit for the future. And I would be able to get a cosigner to help with the interest rate. 

I also haven't looked into it too much but I think this may be a good time to start investing which is something I have always wanted to do. but it just doesn't feel right starting to invest with debt hanging over my head. 

So I guess my question breaks down to this, should I use this money as student loans for my last year of law school or can I afford to loosen my belt a little and purchase a car and start investing while still taking out loans.

personalfinance,Refinancing Mortgage - Lost in Numbers,"Like many others, I am looking to take advantage of the low interest rates and refinance my current mortgage. I'm currently 7 years into my 4.375%, 30 year note with a remaining balance of \~$149k. 

While these numbers aren't guaranteed, talking to my current lender, I'm possibly looking at 3.125% on a new 30 year OR 2.625% on a 15 year loan amount of \~$154k. I believe the closing costs/escrow are built into the loan, so my only out-of-pocket costs are probably like \~$30.

I believe the new 30 year note lowers my payment by about $300, but adds 7 years back onto the mortgage. I'm not sure if they can do a 23 year note, would that be beneficial? The 15 year would be about a $50 increase to my current monthly payment.

Now, I'm not really versed on investing or anything, so the money saved would probably not be going into something with a better return. I have a healthy emergency fund, I'm already maxing my ROTH IRA and meeting my employer's match for my 403b, so that is taken care of. 

I really love the idea of paying off the house earlier, so I guess that is my main goal. With that in mind, I'm guessing refinancing would be beneficial given the above numbers. Would one scenario be better than the other -- starting over with a new 30 (and potentially putting the new savings towards the principal) or getting the 15 year loan?

If you need more info, please let me know, but I greatly appreciate any assistance... all of this is pretty foreign to me (though I am learning).",finance
stocks,Something Greasy Going on Here 🤔,"01:00 PM EDT, 04/28/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Zoom Video Communications (ZM) picked Oracle's (ORCL) cloud platform to support the surge in demand for its product from both consumers and companies as the COVID-19 pandemic drove people into their homes to stem the spread of the respiratory disease.

The company said in a statement on Tuesday that it needed immediate additional cloud capacity after seeing daily meeting participants spike to 300 million this month, up 50% from March. Zoom had about 10 million free and paid users by the end of December last year, it said earlier this month.

""We recently experienced the most significant growth our business has ever seen, requiring massive increases in our service capacity,"" said Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive. ""We chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its industry-leading security, outstanding performance, and unmatched level of support.""

Zoom's operations have gained attention during the pandemic as users sheltering in their homes signed up for the video platform to connect with coworkers, family and friends. More than 212,000 people have died and 3.06 million have fallen ill from the respiratory disease.

The stock has surged 134% this year as the outbreak grew, although the shares were 2.8% lower on Tuesday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned lower.

Yuan said earlier this month it was shifting engineering resources to trust, safety and privacy issues after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it received reports of video conferences being interrupted by hate images, pornography and threats. Last week, Zoom released an upgrade to its program that included ""robust security enhancements.""

Zoom said it's now enabling ""millions"" of meeting participants on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which will help it meet the changing demands of a growing customer base.

""Video communications has become an essential part of our professional and personal lives, and Zoom has led this industry's innovation,"" said Safra Catz, Oracle's chief executive.

personalfinance,Pay cash or take a loan for a used car,"If we weren't dealing with a global pandemic, this would be a no brainer for me.  We will have to replace a car sometime in the next 6-12 months.  We have been preparing for this, setting aside cash for the time when we knew we would make the purchase.

We use an ""envelope"" budgeting system, so the money for the car is in the same HYSA as our emergency fund.

So here is where I want to plan this out, in case the car purchase becomes necessary sooner than later:

Outside of the car envelope, we have about 11 months worth of minimum expenses in our EF.  (Our EF also includes reserves for home repair as well as our various wish farms.  If the shit hits the fan, we will just move wish farm $ to EF and put off repair if possible.  We also have about 3 more months of illiquid funds that could/would be tapped in a real emergency, but we would have to be at the end before that happens.

The car envelope would cover about 3 more months of expenses.  Having 11-14 months of basic expense covered would make me feel fine about spending the cash for the car and saving the interest.  Now, though, my worry is that I lose my job the day after I drop all that cash on a car.  (yes, worst case scenario).  

My thought was I could possibly take a loan for the car and keep the cash.  My payments would come out of the car envelope  (Obviously would to put more in to cover the interest).  While this would increase my minimum monthly nut, I would have multiples more cash to cover that and other expenses.  

My real question is how do I frame this question.  At some interest rate, it doesn't make sense to take out a loan, and yet at a low enough rate, it makes sense to keep your cash.  There are some risk factors that need to take into account as well.  For example, we are a one income family  (no dependent children).  It took me eight months to find the job I have no with no pressure  (already had a job), and that was with no global depression on the horizon.

So I put it to you:  What do I need to consider when weighing this decision?",finance

personalfinance,In-law got fleeced on a mortgage; need help with refinancing,"I will begin by saying that my mother-in-law and I do not get along particularly well and for the past year we haven't really had much to do with each other. However, things have changed with the whole COVID situation; my partner and I were living together with a roommate in an apartment but she is immunocompromised and she felt uncomfortable staying in the apartment when my roommate still goes out all the time and could potentially bring the virus home, so we moved into her mom's place for the time being.

Last year, my mother-in-law bought a house in Southern California for about $1.8 million. She put $200,000 down and financed about $1.6 million on it. She owns her own business and typically makes good money doing it, regularly pulling in a little over $1 million a year (she does home healthcare consulting), but she's not from the US originally and has a history of being manipulated by people when it comes to finances. Case in point: she got a 30-year mortgage with an adjustable rate, and that rate is set at 9% until February of 2024. With property taxes and fees, she is regularly making mortgage payments of over $15,000/month.

Late last year, she fell on a bit of hard times because she lost a big client and had to start redoubling her efforts to make up for the lost income, but now with the COVID lockdown she's not really making anything, and over the past few months she's spent through a good chunk of her savings (she's got less than about $50k on hand at this point). Right now she is taking advantage of mortgage forbearance so she does not have to make the April, May, or June payment, but of course on July 1 she's going to owe 4 months at once, and there is no way she can pay back 60 grand.

As we've been living together I have discussed helping her refinance the house, but she doesn't really know how to go about doing that, and to be honest, I'm a high school teacher who can't afford a home myself so I don't either. Her credit score is solid, somewhere around 750. She told me when she bought the house that she thought the mortgage people had her back but of course they figured she wasn't going to ask questions and thought nothing of saddling her with a 9% rate.

I am wondering what all I need to do to help her refinance. Should I just start calling up banks? Right now the loan is serviced through Select Portfolio Services but she banks with Chase so could I just call them and see what kind of offer they'd make? Given how low interest rates are right now this seems like the best time to do it, but I'm unfamiliar with the process and a bit overwhelmed myself so I don't know where to begin. She has had the loan now since January of last year if that makes a difference. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

stocks,The implications of the world seeing the U.S Stock Markets as a savings account.,"We are a few months into a global pandemic, and many think because the curve is flattening that things can start getting back to normal again. Well there is no more normal. This is a post-corona world baby, anything is possible.

The world has seen the U.S stock markets as a safe haven, almost like a savings account. Why do we all have savings accounts again? For rainy days, bumps in the road ahead, or maybe a GLOBAL PANDEMIC completely wiping out a substantial amount of your economy.

So, lets say you're on the 2nd half of the pandemic, the worst is behind you and you can start rebuilding your economy. Many will realize it's much more expensive to fix the damages than they thought, and will be forced to take money out of the savings aka U.S Stock markets.

It's not a matter of if countries will start collecting on their investments, but when. And I don't know if there will be enough buying pressure to sustain the sell offs.

Bitcoin,Some scenarios to crash the US dollar over the next year...,"Scenario 1 (the banksters):

So, the fed has pretty much stated that it is willing to do \*whatever it takes\* to prop up the stock market. At the same time, stock dividends are paying record low amounts. The fed wades into the stock market, and starts buying stocks DIRECTLY attempting to pump up the value. Only problem is that while they are doing this, they are inflating the dollar. This means those dividends are not worth it, and there are better places to put money. (hello staking coins). As a result, stock prices go higher and higher, until the market runs out of sellers. 

The fed is left holding a bunch of stocks that nobody will buy, and the people are left holding a bunch of dollars that are not worth anything anymore. Lose/Lose. 

Scenario 2 (The Politicians):

Covid ends up being used as an excuse to cancel in person voting because \*its just too dangerous\* (which is true) Instead, only mail in ballots will be accepted! Only problem? The postal service has been cancelled! Donald wins via mass voter suppression, and crazy ideas like lindsey graham's treasury default to china go into play. A treasury debt default occurs, the US credit rating is downgraded to junk status, and investors start demanding serious $$$ returns to account for the risk. US dollars are printed to the moon to service the debt. 

Scenario 3 (The petrodollar):

Covid winds up wiping oil out hard. The world does not quickly recover, and oil stops being the major commodity it once was. Oil production crashes after the world runs out of storage, and the decoupling of the dollar from energy causes a major shift in world outlook on the need to not be under us sanctions.

investing,A preliminary hypothesis regarding inflation and the pandemic....,"I am beginning to think that the current Covid-19 business environment could lead to inflation in several areas and wanted to see if this hypothesis holds water. 

One of the factors that can lead to price increases is a decrease in supply. We are all seeing this in grocery stores for staples like flour, sugar, toilet paper, etc... You might argue that this is merely a short term phenomenon and once people stop hoarding, supplies will be back to normal. However I don't think this applies to everything. I am reading supply chain disruption stories about huge businesses like Tyson Foods, Nestle, etc... Those issues don't appear to have a short term remedy. 

I am also hearing stories about states starting to re-open with requirements that certain businesses only allow something like 25 percent of their establishment to be available for customers. If you can only seat 25% of your restaurant or theater or airplane, and millions of people are clamoring for a night out/vacation, why not charge 4x the price to make up for lost volume? 

So, if the supply of goods and services is decreasing, and the money supply is increasing (stimulus, Federal Reserve balance sheet expected to surpass **$10 Trillion**, etc....) could this virus be the catalyst that unleashes a massive spike in prices/inflation?",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out if I messed up,"So as the title says, I am trying to figure out if I got shafted hardcore and was too busy looking at monthly numbers.

In 2018, I got a '17 altima with a loan through the dealer for 19000. My credit was very low (under 600), so they gave me an 18% interest rate. $450/mo in payments. Okay. I needed the car and had no savings really so I took it with a plan to come back in a year or two after my credit had increased and established consistent payments. Up to this point, I had made about $3k in payments towards the principal and $6k in interest payments. The payoff balance was $16k.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to the dealer the other day with a much higher credit score, and walked out with a 2020 car. The interest rate is 1.9% and the monthly payments of $389. However, I am basically starting over a new cycle of paying off a loan, and the difference in the payoff balance - trade value of the altima (a $6k difference) was added to this car. So now I will have lower monthly payments, yes. But I am restarting a loan cycle and a much larger loan. This loan is worth about $27k.

I have been prioritizing paying off some (really) stupid debt I racked up on credit cards in my 20's over the last couple of years. I've been snowballing cards for the last few years and have paid two off completely along with my smallest student loan, which was private and had a higher interest rate. Now, I have a card with a $9K balance that would have been paid off by mid-July on route I was on, but my company just dropped everyone's salaries by 15% for the forseeable future to keep us in business and the \~$5K bonus I get 2x a year will not be happening this summer, which I was planning to put towards debt.

My grandma passed away unexpectedly last fall and I inherited a small sum (20K) at the turn of the year that boosted my savings and accelerated debt payoff for me. My partner was laid off in March due to COVID so I am helping to support both of us a bit more than normal, but I do have some money set aside I can tap into to stay relatively on track to paying this off. 

* $25K in HY savings account (current rate is 1.5%); $4.2K is needed to pay my taxes from freelance income last year in July. Will leave me with $20K, which is about 3-4 mos living expenses for us if my partner can't get back to work any time soon (he works at high-end cocktail bars in NYC)
* $8K in an Acorns account (I know you guys hate them here but I started it a few years ago when I had hardly any savings and it's been a great way to squirrel away money). Prior to the current drop I was up about 12% on the lifetime value of the account. 
* $35K in retirement that I'm not touching for obvious reasons. I'm about to turn 31 so have plenty of time for this to grow. 

I've been paying $1-1.5K a month out of my salary on snowballing, but once my salary drops next month I'll only be able to pay about $700-800 until it gets normalized. I am paying 1K out of my last full paycheck this week, which leaves me with $8K on the card- I am debating if I should take $4-5K out of my Acorns account and put it here so I can still have the card paid off within a few months, or if I should take $2-3K from savings and $2-3K from Acorns each. Normally, I'd say f\*ck it and take it all from savings, but I'm concerned about dropping my cash liquidity there too low right now with employment and economic uncertainty.",finance

personalfinance,Minimizing taxes on whole life policy surrender,"My mother owns an old whole life insurance policy with a $88.5k Taxable Gain if Surrendered ($243k gross cash value) that I'm helping her surrender as I, her only child, am long independent and I'd rather she have access to the cash now than me getting the death benefit some time (hopefully long) in the future. 

This one time distribution would hit her with something like a $12.5k fed tax bill + whatever state/local is. Assuming she has no other income, what's the best way to minimize the tax burden from this one-time distribution that she'll be getting a 1099-R for? 

She's 69 this year and lives in Virginia. I'm assuming (correct me if I'm wrong) that she can use that 1099-R income to fund a traditional IRA with $6000 this year that she can then take out essentially tax free next year. That would bring her down to $11.2k tax. Any other tips?

I've also considered trying to figure out the logistics of helping her surrender half of the taxable gain this year at the end of the year (December) and the other half in January to split the tax burden across 2 years while minimizing the temporary increase in premium from the cash value reduction. Would that work? Assume her net income from other sources will be 0 next year as well. If that's viable that would bring the per-year fed tax down to about $3.7k for $7.4k total, or $3k a year if she can contribute $6k to an IRA, effectively reducing her tax burden in half.",finance

financialindependence,Savings Rate Calculation...,"I posted this in a daily thread but didn't receive any feedback, so I'm hoping this works better.

I've read numerous posts here about calculating savings rate and realize there is no definitive method. That said, this is what I've come up with, and I'm curious on everyone's thoughts about it.

The basic calculation being (Total SAVABLE Income - Total Controllable Spending) / (Total Savable Income)

1. Total Savable Income: (Gross Wages + 401K Employer Contribution + Other Income) **minus** (Federal/State/Local Tax + SS Tax + Medicare Tax)
2. Total Controllable Spending: (Non-taxable Wages&amp;Deductions + All Expenses paid from Net Pay) **minus** (Mortgage Principle paid + any Refunds/Rebates)

""Savable"" Income implying these are the funds that I have control of to be able to save. Since taxes are not in my control, they were deducted from my income calculation. I included the 401K (actually TSP since Govt job) match because that money would belong to me if I left and therefore is technically saved income. I did not include employer payments into my federal defined benefit plan annuity (FERS) as savings as I don't have access to those funds unless I retire. Other income includes items such as Credit Card Rewards, Gifts, Employer travel reimbursements, etc. I put the travel reimbursements as income since the value is technically higher than my expenses nearly always due to per diem, etc.

For ""Controllable"" Spending, the Non-Taxable Wages and Deductions include all healthcare costs (since I choose how much I spend based on plan selection) and life insurance offered by my employer (Govt job). The expenses paid from Net pay value comes from my budget tracking in YNAB and covers all spending. I deduct the Mortgage principle since that is technically saved money as well as any refunds/rebates which offset the amount spent on items.

Using this methodology, I came up with a savings rate that was 31% for 2019 and year to date at 44% for 2020...which is far higher than I was expecting.

Does this make sense...or did I completely misinterpret something? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,22 years old. Student debt and advice as to what to do?,"Quick run down:
 
I'm a new graduate Registered Nurse currently working at a hospital. This is my first real job and salary. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.

Net monthly salary after taxes: $4100-$4800 (Varies depending on whether I work nights or days during that pay period.)

Bills:
 - Car payment: $345
 - Student Loan: $1527/mo over 10 years (Currently in forbearance until September due to COVID; does not accrue interest until then)
   -~92k principle under my parent plus loan at an interest rate around 4%
   -~28k principle spread over four separate direct unsubsidized loans accruing interest between 3.7-5%
 - My parents are pretty well off and are kind enough to not charge me rent and even help with my car insurance and phone bills, which helps me save an extra $230 a month. 
 - So my only real bills are my car and my student loans.

Savings:
 - Currently I have 5k in savings. 3k of that is in my Chase Savings, and the other 2k is in my Ally Savings account. 

Despite them being very financially supportive, I don't exactly have the healthiest relationship with my parents, and as a result, have a hard time living with them at home. My main goal after college was to always move out, but I'm afraid of how much student debt I have. Since my loans are in forbearance and do not accrue interest or require payment until after September, I pour $3000 into my savings and use the remaining for my car payment and other things. I'm unsure to whether use the ~20k I'll have saved by September then to make a lump payment into either my direct unsubsidized, my car, or whether to just keep saving money for when I eventually move out next year. By the beginning of next year I could pay off my direct unsubsidized loan, but I would have no money at all in my savings, which would prolong my goal of moving out. However, paying off my direct unsubsidized loan would take off $295 from my monthly payment. If I were to continue aggressively saving, by around March/April 2021 I would have around 30k saved. When I move out, I could just prioritize paying my loans and not worry about savings. I understand that moving out isn't the smartest financial choice for myself right now, but I believe that the mental relief of not living with my parents would make it worth it.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to finance a solar installation; but only financing the portion that would be funded by the rebates. Are there any options out there?,"There are still pretty attractive federal and state incentives on residential solar installations.  Unfortunately, there is a time lag between when cash is spent on the system and the arrival of the federal and state incentives. How do homeowners typically float the middle?

I obtained numerous quotes for a $50k gross cash outlay to land a new solar install. Federal and state Rebates would be around $15k for a net of $35k.

If I pay $50k cash day one, I’d have a new system and I’d get cash back later from the rebates. But that’s kind of tough to pull off since I don’t have $50k.

But I can pay $35k up front cash. In this scenario I would then finance the remaining $15k with a personal loan or HELOC until the rebates arrive (assuming the IRS ever re-opens). But these loans are actually kind of expensive since they’re unsecured or second lien.

If I pay $0 cash up front the solar companies will gladly finance the full system with a secured loan. But then the loan principal is $54k. They add a $4k bump that compounds the rather unpleasant vig on the loan. They will not do partial financing.

Are there really no options out there to just borrow $15k for 12 months or less on a solar installation as a secured loan on the solar with a reasonable interest rate? I’ve asked around several contractors and they’re either all cash or they finance with that wacky principal bump.",finance

The Fed meets later today and, having thrown everything including the kitchen sink to protect the US economy in the battle against the economic damage of this crisis, no action is expected this time. As such, the market reaction may depend mainly on Powell’s remarks. From a risk-management perspective, Powell has more incentive to soothe investors’ nerves and hint that more stimulus is possible, which could briefly hurt the Dollar.

Investors will be hanging from Powell’s every word, eager to find out whether the central bank is willing to do even more if the crisis worsens, or whether policymakers feel they have done enough. For example, would the Fed consider going down the Bank of Japan’s path and introduce yield-curve control? How about buying stocks (though Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was quoted yesterday that this was an unlikely option for the Fed)?

Overall, he is likely to maintain a very cautious tone, and probably keep even these extreme options on the table.

The school normally costs 65-70k. I got a 21,000 scholarship, in addition to a 3.5k room and board scholarship, and an additional 5.8k grant. This brought my yearly total down to $40,920 for Pace. I already plan on working 1-2 jobs during school and getting an apartment with roommates starting sophomore year, which would take my yearly loan down to roughly 25k. I also plan on consolidating/refinancing my loans as soon as possible after college. I cannot take out any parent plus loans, since my parents won’t be supporting me through college. Which means a portion of my loans will have to be taken out in private bank loans. This college is the only college for me (trust me I’ve looked at quite a few) and my major/dream job cannot be done in any other location.

Actually, I’ll fully admit I’m a noob. Just trying to understand what’s going on. Maybe no one knows.

I have no open positions in SPY yet. Tempted to buy puts. Just confused.

personalfinance,Credit Score Question,"Hi Everyone. Wanted some opinions here on an issue that I can't find a specific answer to. My wife and I are in the process of applying for a mortgage, and our lender mentioned my credit score being less than 10 points away from qualifying for the lowest interest rate. But this is from a credit score he pulled in Jan that is now expiring. He said he will pull another in May. 

I have 12 years on my oldest account, never been late on a payment on multiple accounts, but a relatively high credit utilization. My wife and I had gone through a period of adding new credit cards a few years back, and when we did so we generally added the other as an authorized user. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now my highest utilization on my account is as an authorized user for my wife's card. Would dropping it/removing myself (subsequently moving my utilization from \~31% to \~18%) increase my score more than the removal of an account with 18 months of regular payment history? As I mentioned, it's my newest credit account--so my own on-time history should be much in question, I think.

Thanks for the help!",finance
investing,Reuters: Boeing eyes major bond issue to raise funds,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-debt-exclusive/exclusive-boeing-eyes-major-bond-issue-to-raise-funds-sources-idUSKCN22B094

&gt; Boeing has lined up investment banks to potentially market an offering to bond investors in the coming days, provided that market conditions are favorable, the sources said, cautioning that the exact timing and size of the offering had not been decided. The proceeds could amount to $10 billion or more, depending on investor demand, one of the sources added. 

&gt; Boeing is also examining the funding support available to companies from the Federal Reserve, one of the sources said. One of Federal Reserve’s newly established programs, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, will provide support to companies issuing bonds without placing any strict conditions on them, such as limits to dividend payouts or executive compensation.

&gt; Calhoun told investors during the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Monday that the company would need to borrow more over the next six months.

&gt; Credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc estimated this month that Boeing’s funding needs could top $30 billion in 2020. The company secured about half of this by drawing down on a $13.8 billion credit line in March, Moody’s said. Boeing also suspended its dividend.",finance
stocks,"How is your online shopping experience on RossStores.com going? Oh, never mind.","You will find that this is a difficult question to answer because somehow in the year 2020, online shopping is not an option. The experience is at best, nonexistent. To add insult to injury, I tried visiting the website Ross.com to only realize it was some other website (not the clothing retailer) providing me information on breastfeeding. I would have preferred for that to be a joke, but it’s just factual. Over the course of the next few paragraphs, I would like to outline my bear thesis on Ross Stores and get your input. 

During this coronavirus pandemic, retail has been hit VERY hard, many stocks dropping in excess of 50% off the highs. However, some companies have fared better than others, especially those with heavy investments in technology. A few examples of the winners are $NKE and $LULU who have a strong online presence and go beyond providing a product (Nike’s training app for example for at home work outs has seen double digit increase in app downloads). These companies also benefit from having a younger demographic and consumers who are accustomed to buying online on mobile and desktop. These stocks have maintained their valuations for now. 

On the other side of that, you have companies like Ross and TJX who have an older demographic (unfortunately one that is more susceptible to serious complications from Covid 19 and NO online presence. Ross and TJX are financially healthy and debt free and I do not intend to group them with the JC Penney’s and Macy’s of the retail world. With that said, in terms of their demo and shoppers, there are a lot of similarities there. In fact, some bulls argue that Macy’s downfall, store closures, potential bankruptcy, etc, could be a huge tailwind for Ross as those shoppers have fewer places to go, leading to more consolidation. 

Maybe, I’m willing to concede that. But this isn’t a dynamic that will play out overnight. Besides, any tailwinds created by such environment, would be countered with the headwinds of 26M unemployed and entering a recessionary environment. Unlike $TGT and $WMT who sells essential items and groceries, Ross is under the category of discretionary spending. Clothing is the one thing we can absolutely go without for extended periods of time, especially if A. People are staying home more often and B. You simply don’t have the same income (or any income at all) as you had previously. 

Yet somehow, you go back to May 17 2019 (less than one year ago) with all stores open nationwide and a booming stock market environment and Ross’ stock price was 92.78. This morning April 28th, Ross was trading as high as $99 a share. Understandably, we have record low interest rates and unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve (historically a bullish scenario for stocks in general) but its ludicrous to me that this particular company has a valuation that is greater than at many different points of last year and any other time in its history with unprecedented store closures and record unemployment. 

I have intentions of entering a significantly large short position in the coming days. This stock has high institutional ownership and can rise as the broader market rises. Knowing this, I am willing to be early and initially wrong on this move if it goes against me, but plan on holding through the next few ER’s. There are risks as with any trade that it moves against you, but in this case I feel the upside is fairly limited in this space. Whereas the downside (a potential second wave of the virus) could be absolutely destructive to the retail space and Ross in particular. 

To recap my short thesis: 
- No Online Presence. If stores are closed, there is no way to generate revenue. Simple as that. They have no insurance policy or additional revenue stream to counter this environment. 

- Older Demographic, mostly female (70-75% of their shoppers according for their March 2020 investor presentation) and catering to people who “want” a bargain versus “needing” a bargain. My theory is that even in a post Covid 19 world, it will take considerable time for these individuals to start flocking back to these stores. 

- Valuation. High institutional ownership due to its dividend and friendly stock buyback program (2.55 billion as of March 2019 approved for a 2 year period) has kept the stock near it’s all time highs. I feel this is overly optimistic and not discounting the potential risk and fallout from this virus. 

-Expenses. This is not one I covered in the article but thought I would add. I know of companies like TJX having to spend hundreds of thousands on cleaning wipes, disinfectants, gloves, etc. These are additional expenses to the business that they did not have to account before. These companies are going to need to take extraordinary measures to keep their stores clean and safe. I expect these expenses are going to negatively impact EPS in the short term.

personalfinance,After saving most of my life I’m ready to invest in land. What’s the best way to do this?,"Currently I have a residual income of 7,200 a month. I have 74,000 in savings and a HELOC for 100,000 and no debt.

I plan on renting my current house out because the interest rate (3.4%) is so low and I bought at a good time. I have another house that’s worth 240,000 with the HELOC (0% over prime) on it. I also have a VA loan available.

I’ve never bought property that didn’t have a house on it but from what I understand you cannot get a loan? From what I understand once I buy the land I can get a building loan to build the house then refinance into a mortgage? Won’t I be paying a lot of closing costs? My plan is to buy 50-70 acres, build a modest home, and to start farming. Most of the property I’m looking at is 100-150,000.

I also do not have a vehicle right now and want to buy a diesel truck. As a rule I don’t buy new vehicles but the current offers of 0% interest for 84 months is pretty temping. I don’t want to skew my debt to income ratio for the land/home loan.

My current mortgage payment is 1240 a month with insurance (I don’t pay property tax). I can easily rent this home out for 2,000 a month. I have healthcare through the military. I have no other bills.

personalfinance,Do I pay my high interest student loan off in full?,"Im a recent grad and live at home to save money.

After taxes and plus my other savings I have about 21,000 in my savings account (I also have 5k in an acorns account but I cant touch that.)

Im currently unemployed and collecting unemployment that is currently $741 a week- but because of the back up due to covid, my recent employment is not factored into that number, and it should be roughly double.

I live at home so my expenses are minimal. I have one Federal loan that is in forbearance for another 5 months and is a low interest loan that has a minimum of $225 a month.

My private loan is currently 17,900 with a 10.5% interest rate, so I can pay it in full, with some money left over, and the knowledge that I'll have income, whether it be unemployment or a job in my field. 

If I pay off the loan in full, I will have roughly $3,000 in savings left- with a guarantee to have a minimum of $10,000 in 10 weeks, again whether it be unemployment or a job.

personalfinance,Can we afford this house?,"My wife and I make a combined $145k. 

&amp;#x200B;

The house is $445k and we are putting 10% down. After the down payment and closing costs we will have about $30k left for emergencies/home improvements and repairs.   


The house is from the 1960s but has been remodeled in the early 2010s. I'm not much of a handyman, and fortunately don't see anything needing substantial repair for the house. I anticipate house costs to be:

* Mortgage: 1825
* Taxes: 400
* Insurance: 75
* Maintenance: 1% \* 445k / 12 \~ 400
* Utilities: 500 

Total comes out to 3200/month

  


After taxes we bring in $8.2k/month.

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses are:

* Student Loans: $2000 ($180k total... my career would take off in about 3 more years and our combined income should grow to at least $250k). Consolidated at 5.5%. At this rate it should be paid off in about 9 years.
* Car Payments: $1100 (New Civic and CRV purchased 1 year ago, that will be paid off in 3 more years. We play to keep these cars for 10-15 years. Interest rates are 1% and 2% respectively)
* Life Insurance: $100
* Things for Kids: $250/month (529, toys, diapers)

This leaves us with $1500/month for groceries, vacation, fun money, and other misc expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried about house prices in general due to the current pandemic but houses are still getting snatched up quickly in my area. We're planning on staying in the area for the next 3 to 5 years. We have a nice apartment now but rent is expensive at $2k/month.

personalfinance,Student Loan forbearance - is this a sound plan?,"I have two student loans - my federal loans which have $32,700 left, and a private loan with $2,400 left.

The federal loans are on a graduated payment plan, which was going to be pretty obnoxious before but got completely screwed up by the forbearance somehow. Currently my monthly payment is $450, and for some reason at the end of the forbearance period it will go down to $350, but then for the last 20 months of the repayment it's going to be $850.

My private loan is $150 per quarter, which I've been doubling up on, so paying $300 per quarter.

My plan was to apply the $450 federal loan payment to my private loan during the forbearance period, which on top of the regular $300/qr payments would have it paid off. Then I would switch from the graduated payment plan on my federal loans to a level plan, which would increase my monthly payment to $550, but it would remain $550 for the rest of the repayment period. It would also save me $1000 in interest according to the calculator. The $100 increase in payment would be largely offset by the $75/mo decrease in the private loan payment.

1. The herd mentality at this sub is strong

3. People here are not very saavy, not experienced, and not knowledgable about stocks and investing
4. People here THINK they are much more intelligent than they are
5. People here actually thought they could outperform the market by shorting, using risky option plays, and inverse-leveraged ETFs based on NEWS cycles and their ""superior"" understanding of the news regarding covid-19, unemployment, debt, and economic indicators.
6. Anyone who holds such a belief doesn't even know enough to KNOW how clueless they are.
7. This place is basically a chorus of emotion and ignorance.  Anyone who read any analysis or suggestions here became a less successful investor as a result.
8. This place is full of thin-skinned individuals who can't accept the undeniable fact that they are NOT good investors and are NOT knowledgable about stocks, and DO NOT understand the complex economy.
9. These same individuals will continue to rail on about how the market is ""rigged,"" complain about Powell's printing press, and make a million other excuses about why they failed.
10. In reality, this sub completely illustrates why well over 90% of retail investors and even analysts are outperformed by simple S&amp;P 500 funds.  However, here performance is far below average because of posters' mistaken beliefs about how intelligent they are.

Stocks have really rocketed up lately, the herd panic here really got it wrong.  I don't expect everyone to come to the realization that they are clueless and incapable of being successful investors, because if they had that introspection, they wouldn't have been posting the amateurish economic analysis and market predictions based on news-cycles that have inundated this sub ever since I started viewing it.

There may be a handful of people here who have learned something.  They will realize that they don't have the skills to predict market movements. They might feel better about this glaring fact if they understand that few people do, even people who have studied markets their entire lives.  

No,you aren't a mini-Buffett, no you aren't a boy-genius, no you aren't going to predict the stock market's directions based on economic indicators, no you aren't going to predict the stock market based on covid-19 news

No, the performance of the stock market can't be explained simply by a ""printing press, fed, and treasury"" (although you would love such a simple explanation to justify your poor investment decisions).

Look, ""investing"" is difficult for those who try to beat the market by buying and selling (I used the term investing, although speculating would probably be a better choice).  

The herd's ability to understand and predict the movement of the market on this sub is completely inadequate.  If anyone here could accept that, it would serve their portfolio well, better than any other piece of advice they have ever read here.",finance

I don't technically graduate until August, and will have the 6 month payment deferral beginning after that, so paying them or the interest is optional at this point, especially with the federal student loan interest freeze. I have approximately one month's salary in emergency savings at this time. 

I currently rent a home with a roommate and want to begin saving toward a down payment at some point. My rent is \~13% of my post-tax monthly income. I am currently putting 6% into my 401k (used to be employer matched, not currently) and 4% into their roth IRAs. I have a car payment of \~$470 monthly, and I have \~$10k in credit card debt from the past year (due to poor choices with travel, emergencies, all in prior job where I made almost half what I make now and spent beyond my means). Of that debt, \~7k of it has an interest rate of 17.5%; the remainder is on a 0% APR card I opened in an effort to reduce the interest payments. In my only defense, I have made great strides to pay down approximately $5k in the past few months of my new job (so living within the same means of my almost half salary). 

So here's my question: what do I tackle first? 

* student loans (interest first?) 
* credit card debt on interest-building card
* add additional money to my emergency savings account 
* save toward a home down payment (low on my priorities at this point)
* add extra money to my 401k since the market is poor and my money will go farther, especially since my employer isn't currently matching

By the end of this article , you will be able to:

•Identify the causes of the stock market crash of 1929
•Assess the underlying weaknesses in the economy that resulted in America’s spiraling from prosperity to depression so quickly
•Explain how a stock market crash might contribute to a nationwide economic disaster

investing,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1) In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February. 

2) On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.

3) Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).

4) $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.

5) Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US. EU is past the 6-8 week mark and there's yet to be a recovery.

6) According to OICA, plant closures could cost US auto makers at least 900k auto sales in 2020, and global light vehicle production may be down as much as 20%.",finance

personalfinance,Allocating my retirement contribution (Teacher),"Hello!

Recently I have been thinking a lot about which method would be best for my retirement. I am currently deciding between two options, the first (option A) would be putting the full contribution into my 403(b) and the second (option B) would be to split it and do the max contribution into my Roth IRA and the remaining amount into my 403(b) . I want to say from my research and calculations that option B would be better, but I am not sure if I am forgetting about something that would make option A better. I have been told by others (many colleges) that it is better to have it in one lump sum so that the interest will grow faster compared to splitting it up. This is why I am coming to you guys for advice, to see if I am wrong and option A is a better than option B.

A bit of background on my situation- I am a high school teacher (M25) with an annual income of $55,000 living in California. My goal is to commit about 40% of my annual income towards my retirement, 30% towards my 403(b)/Roth IRA and about 10% towards my CALSTRS benefit plan (pension).

I have used online calculators to estimate about what I think my accounts would be, but option A seems to have more variables to consider. This is because of taxes, with the 403(b) account I would be contributing with pre-taxed money, and be taxed on the way out. In California a pension is considered an income, and considering all of the factors my estimated annual teaching pension at 62 will be about $78,034 annually (or $6,502 a month). Again, this is just an estimate but assuming it is about correct then even in retirement I would still be in about the 22-24% federal income tax bracket (assuming rates do not change that much, but this is another variable to consider). I will also quickly note that since I pay into CALSTRS I do not pay into social security and currently I do not get an employee match, though I would of course take advantage of it if it was offered.

So, for my calculations:

&amp;#x200B;

**Option A (32% contributed into 403(b) \~ or about $17,000)**

· Current Salary: $55,000

· Contribution 32%

· Annual salary increase: 2%

· Rate of Return: 7%

· Age of retirement: 62

Pre-Taxed Total: $3,100,458

Post-Tax Total (Assuming 22-24%): 2,418,357 - 2,356,348

Option A total (average): $2,387,352

&amp;#x200B;

Option B (max Roth IRA + remaining into 403(b) \~ or $6,000 IRA and $11,000 403(b)).

**Roth IRA (max)**

· Starting IRA balance: $10,000

· Annual Contributions: $6,000

· Rate of Return: 7%

· Years in account: 37

Roth IRA Total: $1,084,962

**403(b) (20%)**

· Current Salary: $55,000

· Annual salary increase: 2%

· Rate of Return: 7%

· Age of retirement: 62

Pre-Taxed Total: $2,315,181

Post-Taxed Total (Assuming 22-24%): $1,805,841 - $1,759,537

Option B total (average): $2,867,651

\*note\* Because the $6,000 into the Roth IRA is post taxed (22%) it is more like $6,000 + $1,320 = $7,320 if you want to think of the amount being paid into taxes upfront. This was roughly offset by contributing 2% more into option A so that the total amount of income I invest equal to about the same each year (I think).

When looking at the calculations for both of these options even though in option A I have a larger amount of money in the account (as I am told to do by others) in the end option B seems to provide a better retirement. I live very frugally (by choice) and put money into a high yielding savings account for my emergency fund / future investments (hopefully owning rental properties in the future) but since I do not make six figures being a teacher I want to try and be smart with my money for a happy retirement.

TLDR: I think option B is the better method for me to save for retirement. Is there anything that I am missing or not taking into account by splitting my contributions into my Roth IRA and 403(b) compared to putting it all into a 403(b)?

personalfinance,State taxes if you're 100% nomadic?,"So my accountant has had some opinions but he's a bit confused by it too, so wanted to see if the hivemind had any thoughts as well. I no longer have a permanent address/apartment. I fully live with 2 small suitcases and stay mostly at Airbnbs.  I don't plan to spend more than 180 days in any one state, so I don't think I technically have a home state anymore. I know I still owe federal taxes on any income of course, but what happens to possible state income tax liabilities? I know that if I make money that is tied to a specific state I need to pay taxes in that state for sales etc - but do I have to pay income tax for that income within that state?

What happens if there is income that is not state specific like say the sale of stock? If I just don't live in and claim any single state as my home state does that mean basically I'm only owning federal?",finance
personalfinance,Need Advice: How to add a friend to my mortgage refinance and make it fair for both parties?,"I am soliciting for advice on whether or not I should add my best friend on my mortgage and if so, how to make it fair for both parties.

Background:

I own an a single family home that I rent out in Chicago, IL.  It was my primary residence for the first 4 years and I have been renting it out for the past 2 after moving to Tampa, FL.  

My best friend is also in the military and recently received orders to move to Chicago.  He was looking to rent my home anyway, but suggested we refi together and he could cover the mortgage for the next 4 years.  

I am receptive to splitting the risk and costs associated with homeownership and I trust him with my life.  We've known each other for 12 years and have been there for each other through thick and thin.  We are both extremely reasonable, speak daily, and talk regularly talk about our finances.  If I were to go into business with someone, it would be him.


**Current mortgage:**

Type -                   VA

Loan amount -     $233,500

Term -                   30 years

Interest rate -       4.75%

Currently owe -    $199,000

Remaining term - 24 years

Home value -        $250,000


Major upgrades (A/C, Furnace, plumbing, appliances) - $13,800


**Refi adding friend:**

Type -                   Conventional

Loan amount -     $199,000

Term -                   30 years

Interest rate -       3.375%

Monthly pay -       $1,634


**Refi without friend:**

Type -                   VA

Loan amount -     $199,000

Term -                   30 years

Interest rate -       2.875%

Monthly pay -       $1,584



He was agreeable to the following terms if we refi together:

**Mortgage and Escrow:**

During the first 8 years of the mortgage term, my friend will be solely responsible for the associated costs of ownership: mortgage, escrow payments, HOA annual fees, acquiring tenants, collecting rent, etc.

After the first 8 years of the mortgage term, both parties will evenly split all associated costs of ownership for the remainder of the mortgage: mortgage, escrow, acquiring tenants, collecting rent, etc. (excluding maintenance / upgrades to be covered below).

**Maintenance:**
My friend will be solely responsible for the next $13,000 of major upgrades and maintenance, after which both parties will evenly split all maintenance and upgrade costs.



Is this a fair deal for both parties?  Or am I screwing myself out of half the value of the future sale of my house?  If so, how much extra should he put down to make this a fair deal?  I figured we would be splitting the following costs of ownership that will be shared if I add him to the mortgage:

**Cost of Maintenance:**

$150/mo

$1,800/yr

$54,000 over the life of the loan

**Cost of gaps in tenants for rental:**

$67/mo

$800/yr

$24,000 over life of loan",finance
personalfinance,w4 question please- confused how to fill out new form,"So i recently messed up my w4 form for taxes. I used to claim 5 with federal (with the old form), and since i owed some money this year to federal i wanted to go in to change it to 4. i am in ny and have nothing claimed for ny taxes. I completely messed something up and now that the federal form is changed, I'm not sure what to do. I am paid once a week and i will say after the change (everything back to 0) that my paycheck is now about 35-38 dollars less. so when i'm just being paid my base without commission (i'm in sales)- my pay went from from about 446 to 408 after the changes (this is after taxes and everything taken out). so my options for my work form are the following (i'm excluding all of the dependents fields since i have no children or dependents and the other income fields as i have no other income or jobs)-

Marital status- putting single here

deductions- and then there is a spot for a dollar amount- the explanation here says "" If you expect to claim deductions other than the standard deduction and want to reduce your withholding, use ""view blank form"" Deductions Worksheet on page 3 and enter the result.""

Extra withholding- then a space for a dollar amount along with the explanation. ""Enter any additional tax you want withheld each pay period. ""

To get paid that $30-40 more again each pay period, what number do i need to enter and where?  I am also not sure if I'm supposed to enter an amount for the full year or per week since I am paid per week. Hopefully i have given enough info to receive some help, Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,It’s Rejected Federal Tax Return because Social Already Filed,"IRS Rejected Tax Return-Already filed w/ Social and no Stimulus Received

Hi everyone. Hoping someone can be of some help. My tax return was rejected because the IRS said a tax return had already been filed with my social. I am married and filing jointly, and we have definitely not filed a tax return yet, so I am assuming this is some sort of identity theft. I went to the FTC and created an alert, which also filed an affidavit with the IRS alerting that someone had illegally filed a tax return with my social. 

&amp;#x200B;

After doing that, I just refiled my taxes online, but I am not sure if they will be accepted yet. I have received no word at all from the IRS outside of the rejection notice. I have tried calling them, but it says due to COVID they are not receiving phone calls at this time. This is also keeping us from getting our Stimulus, which is worth a few grand, and would be great to have at this point.

There is currently optimism in the market with states relaxing stay at home and FEDs pumping money, but I have a feeling this will only last temporarily. I believe the market heads downward mid to late summer. 

Do I sell now and take the $300 profit, then buy back if the market falls? I ask because I won’t have more $$ to contribute outside the $2.5k, so do I take the $300 and reinvest the $2.8 when stocks fall?

personalfinance,Buying vs Renting a house right out of college,"Hello,

I am graduating with an engineering degree with a job starting next month that will make mid 60's pre tax. 

As the title says I am debating weather to buy asap or rent. I will try to provide enough info but feel free to ask.

I want to make the best financial decision but I have no desire to use a strict FIRE mentality (like buy a house then get 3 roommates) 

&amp;#x200B;

Rent for the area would be \~800 if I didn't have a roommate.

You can buy a decent house for\~90,000-150,000 in this area (assuming 120k morgage at 3.5% would be 538, and just estimating tax/insurance would be \~200. so \~750 a month)

My work is within commuting distance of my parents house and they have agreed that I can crash there if needed, however I don't want to do this for more then 4 months (long commute to work)

&amp;#x200B;

 I am graduating with zero debt, and with enough money in the bank that could either a down payment or a 4-5 month of expenses emergency fund

&amp;#x200B;

  I have crunched some numbers and the break even point is 2-3 years depending on the interest rate and selling costs(assuming 30 year mortgage on 120k). So the total of renting for 3 years is the same as interest, taxes, insurance and closing costs paid on a 120k mortgage.

I have interned with the company before so I know what I am getting into and I know I won't be leaving the company in the next 5 years minimum.

personalfinance,Annual income and expenses for a young doctor in the USA,"I've always loved seeing the Sankey diagrams on r/PersonalFinance, so here is mine for this past year. I hope it can spark some conversation. 

[Detailed Sankey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/2OfCUrH.png)

**Background:** I am a fairly young physician in a major urban center. My partner is a medical student, so she doesn't have any income yet so we are a one-income household with two adults and our baby girl (who is thankfully watched by our family who live nearby and babysit while we are at work)

**Income:** My income is on the low-end for medicine because I work in a low-paying speciality at an academic center in a desirable city. Being in academics, I still work full-time but my schedule is a lot lighter and more flexible than my peers in private practice. While COVID has thrown everything into the air, my usual schedule is 4 days of 9-5 at our practice, split between seeing patients and teaching trainees. I could be making approximately $50k more working at a community hospital but with worse hours and much more responsibility. 

**Benefits:** My benefits working at an academic center are pretty great, if slightly expensive. One of the most attractive benefits is the phenomenal health insurance. All healthcare for our daughter is completely free, and we have a pretty manageable deductible and OOP maximum for ourselves. While we pay about $6k for our health insurance, my employer pays about $20k to subsidize it. 

**Taxes, SS, Medicare:** I pay a lot to the local, state, and federal government. It ends up being almost $30k, so it felt nice to get my money back for once through our stimulus check.

**Student Loans:** I owe approximately $300k in student loans, but I am 3 years into repaying them through IBR and PSLF, since my employer is a non-profit. My plan is to have the loans forgiven, so I am currently making the minimum payments of about $500 a month. My wife will have about $200k in student loans when she graduates, so the majority of what we pay towards student loans goes towards paying hers down, since she is planning on going into a speciality that makes significantly more in private practice and she will most likely not be working at a PSLF eligible employer. Once she graduates, she will make about $60k a year for 3-4 years working as a resident, and our plan is to have her entire income go towards paying off her student loans as much as possible during that time. Our average student loan interest rate is 6%, although we are able to pay 0% right now because of the stimulus bill. That alone will save us about $12k over the next 6 months. 

**Retirement:** I max my 401k and Roth IRA, and my employer matches up to 7% of my income on top of that. We had originally been more aggressive in paying my partner's student loans down, but when we sat down and thought about it, we'd prefer to max out our tax advantaged accounts first, before putting everything else towards student loans. So in order of priority, all our excess income goes towards retirement savings in tax advantaged accounts first, and then towards student loans second.

**Housing:** We have a pretty modest $200k home that we are happy in for the time being, and owe about $170k on. The majority of our mortgage is property tax unfortunately, but having both lived in the city, we really wanted a quiet, safe, and beautiful neighborhood to spend our time in, so it is worth it for us. Although I am bitter that despite all the property tax we pay, the town pool still has to charge an annual family membership (and it's not inexpensive either!)

**Transportation:** We just recently purchased a Toyota for about $25k for me to drive to work, so my car payments are going towards knocking that down in 3 years. I would pay it off quicker, but the interest rate is low enough that paying down student loans makes more sense, even with the 0% student loan interest rate for the next six months. Outside of that, we pay a lot of money for transportation - gas for our cars, car insurance, a lot of tolls, parking, and my partner's subway pass to school all add up. 

**Groceries and Household Goods:** Between myself, my partner, and our baby (and usually whoever was helping with babysitting that day) we go through a lot of food for 3-4 people. We go grocery shopping every weekend, and it ends up costing $100-$150 for food, baby supplies, and household supplies. We eat well though, so maybe it's worth it, who knows. I have recently started getting my fruit from a local farmer's market that is significantly cheaper than our local grocery store, so that should save about $100 a month going forward which is really nice. 

**Fun Money:** We're both pretty modest with purchases, but we do spend a good amount on things like clothing, travel, entertainment, restaurants. We both set a budget of $200 a month on shopping for ourselves, and then the rest goes towards taking our family out to dinner, going on one or two trips a year, and eating out when we are craving a certain restaurant.

investing,The road to recovery for heavily indebted EU countries?,"What I rarely see discussed is the implications of very indebted EU countries like Italy and Spain on the rest of the EU, and what implications it could have for businesses in Europe. And I think it's a discussion worth having, since I can't seem paint a picture that isn't horrific for the EU (and especially Southern Europe). As I have at most marginal knowledge in this field, please read the bullet points as my train of thought.

**Pre COVID-19 situation:**

* ECB interest rate at 0.0% interest since 2016
* ECB buying up debt ever since the Eurocrisis
* Debt to GDP ratio: France, Spain, Belgium nearing 100%; Italy 130%
* In the best of times, aforementioned countries could barely make a dent in paying back their debt
* Saving grace is that the yield is very low and even negative on short term bonds.
* Ageing population and high youth unemployment

**COVID-19 situation:**

* Spain, Italy, France most hit areas. As a result, they had to implement the most restrictive lockdowns seen in the West. Industry at standstill. GDP likely contracting \~8-10% or more on average for these countries.
* ECB buying up debt, securities and everything in between.
* Northern European countries very reluctant to implement low yield eurobonds, as this would increase interest on their respective outstanding debts and would be electoral suicide. Meanwhile southern European countries see anti EU sentiments lighting up again due to receiving a cold shower from their Northern counterparts.

**The future**

* Countries like Spain, Italy (and to a lesser extent), France would need to keep existing social safety nets buoyant while seeing massive increases in unemployment and business foreclosures.
* Stimulus money is needed to jumpstart the economy
* These countries will bury themselves into deeper debt levels.
* ECB has less room to manoeuvre than FED, and even less after QEing and keeping interest rates low for years.

I can only see 2 outcomes in this: 1) Some kind of EU reconciliation. Northern European countries will be forced to service South European debts for decades to come (Eurobonds or some other mechanism) at knifepoint (i.e. otherwise face imminent depression or EU collapse). This will increase the role of the EU and diminishing the power and role of individual member states for good. 2) Spain and Italy will truly be stagnant for decades to come, making the future of the EU uncertain due to anti EU sentiment.

personalfinance,Girlfriend can't efile her taxes,"I'm sorry this is long, tl;dr at bottom but it's complicated.

So every year we have our accountant do our taxes since we're busy, its easy, and he's an old boss of mine who does it cheap and has always done well for us.

Well this year, we got him the info a little late, and with the deadline extended (Federal and Ohio) he took his time and didn't get around to filing ours until yesterday.

Well mine went fine. But hers in another story.

Last year she was a victim of ID theft, or more specifically someone got into one of our computers and looks like they managed to get her banking credentials and some other stuff like email, passwords, what not.

Luckily (and I've since done this too!) She had alerts on her phone from the bank so when they drained her bank account she noticed right away, called the bank, cancelled all the outgoing ach's and never lost a dime, didn't have to go though the fraud dept and what not.

She cancelled her bank account and after a few weeks everything went back to normal.

Fast forward to covid-19 - since the govt is providing these checks, she wants to update her bank info. Our accountant hasn't filed our taxes yet, so on April 15th she goes on and enters the new info on the ""non filer"" form on the website.

The IRS had already tried putting it in her old bank account, so it wouldn't have made a difference anyway. 

Now yesterday the accountant goes to efile, and it gets rejected with a code about not allowing the same SSN to file twice, it's already been filled under and messages where he is told to tell his client ""contact IRS fraud hotline and social security"" by the software company that he uses for filing.

Now, initially we thought it was because of the ID theft and we figured this was going to be a mess for that reason. But thinking back, the stimulus check had been attempted deposited into her old checking acct according to the IRS website, if it was someone with her info they would have changed her payment place when they filed the return fraudulently, either a different bank or a physical address. In addition, though the whole debacle before no one tried opening any accounts in her name or use her ssn. 

All I can think is that her putting the non filer info ended up making the irs check ""this ssn is already in our system - no e-file allowed"" . 

My question if you're still with me is what do we do now? My accountant says just file a paper return, but I'm not sure if she should actually file a 1040x instead as amending what they already have on file. In addition, she has the complication of owing OH taxes (works in PA) and needs to file PA state as well to get her PA refund.

TL;DR - Our accountant didn't file our taxes until this week. GF has new bank account and used the non filer stimulus website to update her info instead of waiting for taxes to get filed  and now her e-file was rejected, I think because of that website telling the IRS she is not filing for 2019. She has to file for OH,PA and Fed. Not sure how to fix or if this is the root cause.",finance

For your consideration here are Hyman P. Minsky's five stages of a bubble. I believe we are firmly in the beginning to mid phase of stage 3.

1. Displacement

- Fed is willing to pump infinite amounts of liquidity into the banking sector

- Interest rates likely to stay at 0% for months or even years

- Feds buying junk bonds therefore few if any blue chip corporations will need to worry about liquidity

2. Boom

I've been investing in the stock market for about 4 years now and i'd consider myself a rookie but i been reading books, news articles, listened to interviews and basically been trying to form myself an opinion on how this entire business works. The world keeps moving therefore the future changes which makes it impossible to crack the code. It changes like enigma but it's a lot more complicated. I'm a long term investor, sold a majority of my stocks in the beginning of 2020 expecting either a recession or correction, got lucky with covid-19. Lately I've been taking advantage of Q1 reports and my entire net worth is $60 315 dollars.

*Subject*

It's very basic how companies succeed, it's demand and supply, if the demand increases the price of the product will also increase, A large supply will decrease the price of the product while a small supply will increase it. For an example, a shortage supply of toilet paper increases the price, same thing with safety masks and the short supply is caused by a high demand but can also be caused by low production, however not in this case.

All companies in the entire world relies on people spending their money in some form or another, consumption makes the economy go around and what will happen if the consumption decreases? The demand will decrease, the production of the products will decrease or there will be a high supply which will decrease the value of the products. The housing market has already shown a decrease in value due to low demand, Car sales has also lowered their prices due to low demand.

The demand is decreasing due to unemployment and fear of losing their jobs which are leading to less consumption, there are probably a thousand different reasons due to a decrease in spending but these i believe are the main factors. 

In February the unemployment rate in just the US was 3,5%, has increased to 4,4% where it is today and will likely reach double digits in April according to experts, *(how dafuq do you become an expert..)* 

This is just the beginning of a major chaos, the market is booming because of term purchase agreement operations made by fed and the reasons why many Q1 reports are positive is because it includes the January month and especially real estate companies haven't had an impact from covid-19 yet because they have contracts with their tenants therefore they still received the expected income. I myself bought a company the day before Q1 release with this in mind and made myself a juice return of 8%

The unemployment is increasing world wide and my theory is that first people will sell unnecessary items, downgrade their car and at last they will downgrade their residence. All these actions will have a major effect and i strongly believe here is no chance in hell we've reached the bottom of this situation. Q2 reports will also be way worse than Q1 reports so when the day comes be careful cause the reports will only include bad months and during those months the unemployment has also increased rapidly. 

What i want from this post is to create a discussion, i'd love to hear your opinion, i want to learn, increase my confidence or either change my mind, i'm open for discussing and i'm not going to stand my ground, all opinions are respected and i'll try to answer as much as possible, thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should I swap my Target REDcard debit card for the credit version?,"20, US, full time college student/part time retail. Throughout this post, any mention of ""credit card"" or ""debit card"" will refer to a Target REDcard.

I work at Target, so I generally purchase exclusively from Target. The price matching policy is actually quite generous, so I can get Walmart/Kroger/Amazon/etc prices at Target, plus my employee and redcard discount. (14.5% off of just about all merchandise/food)

I've had a redcard debit card since I was 18, which pulls the money directly from your checking account 1-3 business days later via an ACH payment. Not exactly a debit card, but eh.

I've avoided the credit card because I was never taught good money habits as a kid, and stupidly maxed out my (far too high of a limit) student Discover card before I turned 18 and a half. Throughout 19 and half of 20, I've figured my crud out and have almost paid off my credit debt.

Now that I'm in a better place, financial habits-wise, I wonder if it would be beneficial to swap my debit card for the credit card and simply pay it off every month with my bank card. The credit card offers the same benefits, no additional fees. Only difference is it's a line of credit and has an interest rate if I hold a balance.

Of course, right now I have zero intention on trying to fix what ain't broke, since nothing is guaranteed right now, but with nothing to do, can't hurt to research and make plans for the future.

I worry that a new account might screw up my credit score, since I have so little on my report.

Discover gives me my FICO score, as of 3/27 I have a 682, my oldest credit is 2 years 4 months, and I have two accounts, my Discover card and my student loan. I've never missed or been late on my payments.",finance

personalfinance,Merchant won't honor warranty for defective product - is a chargeback appropriate at this point?,"I purchased a new projector from BenQ on December 29th, 2019.  About a month ago, it started failing (screen artifacts that make it unusable).  It came with a three year warranty so I figured there'd be no issues, I went to their support website and filed a warranty claim.  I got an automated email that a ticket had been opened.

Two weeks go by and I get no response. I get that things are running more slowly due to COVID-19, but 2 weeks seemed like a long time with zero communication, so I emailed again and asked what was going on. Two days later, I get a response on the ticket. BenQ apologizes and says they've been busy, and asks me to send a picture of the issue so they can see it. I send in the picture the same day.  

Another two weeks go by, no response at all. I email them again this past Monday (4/27) asking for an update. I've still gotten no response. So in summation, I filed a warranty claim a month ago, and I've received one email back asking for a picture, otherwise they've been completely non-communicative. 

At this point, I think they're making the process unreasonably slow. A month without even getting an RMA number is ridiculous, even if they do eventually respond, who knows how long the rest of the process will take?  I am considering starting a chargeback with my bank (PenFed), but I want to make sure I'm not being an unreasonable dick.",finance
investing,Shorting the market at anypoint in the last month on any negative data has not worked - how are you coping with this?,"Chipotle, Tesla near all time highs. SPY and DIA 12% off all time highs. I used to think when this first started there would be a V shaped recovery and that the virus's impact on business will not be so bad, but I changed positions in early April when oil crashed and we saw that massive unemployment was coming as well as worsening data from the virus showing the worst case outcome. The unemployment figures will change consumer spending, many people are surviving on debt right now and that debt has to get payed off -  instead of buying new cars and going on vacation spending will be much more modest.

Yet the market shrugs it off. If everything is going up because of where earnings will be 2-3 years from now my questions are:

1) If there is this much confidecne in the future why not value companies at what they will earn 10-20-50 years from now? Why do stocks go down at all if ""future earnings will always be better""? Thats been the market behavior for the last decade. 

1) Its hard enough to predict where earnings will be next quarter, why are we seeing trading based on where things are expected to be 2 years from now? How can anyone make any investment decisions with any accuracy, seems like there are a lot of assumptions taking place that are not following the fundamanetal data, or I am missing something.

2) Things are NOT CHEAP anymore, they were the last 2 weeks of March relative to the last few years. If people shrug off the bad news now, why didn't they back then when nothing is really different and we already saw that what happened in China has spread globally. Why are people buying Tesla now at 900 when it was 350 a month ago?

3) I thought at around SPY 250 we would turn around to test the lows again but its been straight up at a 45 degree angle. There is an arguement saying that the crash already happened and thats why everything is rebounding. Okay great, the bottom is in but the economy is different and worse than a lot of people expected. With oil remaining this low the shale economic boom we've enjoyed for the last 10 years is over and all of those companies can't turn a profit and will lay off a couple hundred thousand people at least.

4) Earnings right now are NOT GOOD, most have had a full Q1 and have barely had any time for the economic shutdown to affect them. Most are also giving no guidance saying they don't know how things will be. Stocks go up. 

5) A headline declaring ""the economy is reopoening"" doesn't mean everyone will suddenly fill up movie theatres like before. Many people living with elderly family will still be cautious through  the rest of the year, and hanging out at a bar while maintaining 6 feet of social distancing isn't going to be the same as before. 

Do you think the market is overly optimistic on returning back to normal? If not, what are we missing and failing to understand? Why are we so close to all time highs? US markets exchange $168 billion a day. The fed adding $5 billion to that per day, mostly in treasuries, is a drop in the bucket no?",finance

investing,Stocks go up and stocks go down.,"TLDR: Tick tock, we’re living in a simulation that will come to an end sooner or later.

Opinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market’s success as the true picture of our economy.** 

That being said, as far as I know the election isn’t until November (7 months from now). 

If the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn’t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can’t all be seriously thinking we’ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. 

Let’s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they’re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. 

Yes the recovery won’t be V shaped, so it’ll be booming after a “healthy drop.” Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. 

Even bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn’t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. 

Now with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we’re all of a sudden back?? It’s just not healthy, PERIOD. It’s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone’s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! 

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows. 

In the end, bulls will have their days, and so will the bears. You can all throw insults at each other when the tables turn towards you then.

SECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today’s market.  After the close last night, we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and finished the evening $1267 +35.  It continued higher today and finished $1345.02 +112.43 (9.12%).  After today’s close we heard from a few of the other FAANG names.  FaceBook was a miss both top and bottom but the guidance they gave on ad spending was upbeat.  After closing 194.19 +11.28 it to 214.57 + another $20.  MSFT beat on both numbers and after closing $177.43 +7.62 it shot higher to 186.52 before closing $181.25 + 3.82.  TSLA was the last one to report and the stock has been on a tear from a low of $350 in mid-March to close today $800.51 +31.39 and put out a profitable quarter and talked about it big truck.  The stock moved to $886.89 and closed $870.30 for a total gain of $101.88 (13.25%).
 
And, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR)  reported that it had a 100% survival of its patients treated with CAP-1002.  All were in deep respiratory distress and 5 of the 6 were on ventilators.  Four of the six have already been discharged.  The stock, which has been reversed twice, most recently 1:10, and the last time 1:50 finished the day $8.50 +6.09 (252.7%) Clearly a home run.  But with a side note since the adjusted high after both reverses is $2,720.  Quite a destroyer of equity.

The stocks were also much higher with gains of between 6% on the big names and as much as 30% on some of the small ones.  XLE closed $39.95 +3.77 (5.63%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,713.40 -8.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday I was a buyer.  We took the downside move this morning and averaged down @ $1.06, and they closed $1.61.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8825 +1045. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today’s action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.60 +1.20 today.

investing,What I learned from all this . . . so far,"The Fed can essentially print the world's most important reserve currency (accounting for &gt;60% of the world's foreign currency reserves). Therefore, in deflationary times, when USD denominated credit is being destroyed, the Fed is free to print in order to meet worldwide demand in USD, without much danger of causing severe monetary inflation. It injects this liquidity into the markets by some form of QE. Essentially removing liquidity risk from the broad economy and adding credit risk onto its balance sheet.

This QE provides a floor on asset prices. The market price of a stock is risk-neutral. It's not the expected return alone that prices a stock. It's expected return per unit of expected risk. **By providing a floor on asset prices, the Fed has reduced the expected risk in equities. So even though expected returns have gone down, expected risk has gone down even more.** Right now I believe this is the major reason why equities have gone up, yet inflation hasn't changed.",finance

I hope this video helps you in some way, shape or form and that you're doing well in the current times we are living in. If you have any questions or comments I am glad to discuss them with you :) 

This video is an investment guide mainly targeted towards beginners on how the stock market works and operates. I mainly focus on dividend growth investing and talk about how to decide what is a good dividend stock by looking at dividend yield's, price to earnings ratios, and dividend history. I also touch upon basic economic concepts by referencing 2 books: Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and The Intelligent Investor. I explain what investing is and the 4 main types of investing strategies that exist: day trading, swing trading, growth investing, and dividend investing. I mention the benefits of ETF's vs individual stocks, explain the difference between fundamental and technical analysis, explain what dollar-cost averaging is and how you can use this to your benefit and also briefly mention the various types of biases most investors would experience which would result in them making bad trades, I also talk about the different sectors that each company in an economy would belong to: Energy: gas, oil, coal and fuel companies - Exxon, shell, bp, they have generous dividends but its a volatile market that’s very geopolitical 
Materials: chemical, construction materials, packaging, metal and paper companies. These companies are the beginning of the supply chain. Examples are, eco lab, international paper and valvoline.
Industrials: defence, machinery, aerospace, airlines, construction and manufacturing companies. For example, Boeing, 3m, UPS, and Lockheed Martin. Stable dividends usually.
Consumer discretionary: one of my personal favourites. Retailers, apparel, restaurants, media, and entertainment. Amazon, Starbucks, mcdonalds, Disney.
Consumer staples: another favourite. Food, beverage and tobacco companies. Coca Cola, proctor and gamble, etc,  a defensive sector which is usually safe in economic downturn.
Healthcare: pharmaceuticals, healthcare equipment and services. Johnson and Johnson Pfizer, are examples. Good plays and safe bets generally
Financial: banks, insurance and real estate companies. Closely tied with interest rates. High interest rates then banks will do better. 
Tech sector: Microsoft, intel, amd, adobe, strong earnings generally. 
Communications: verizon at&amp;t 
Utilities: electric, gas and water. Usually less competition and are monopolies in their areas. Heavy government regulation but usually are seen as safe bets.
Real estate - REIT’s and real estate developers: they pay out 90% of profit as dividends, but are quite risky since they operate on debt. 
Lastly, I talk about what stock brokers to choose from, Robinhood, Webull, or TD Ameritrade if you're in the United States, or Hatch, Stake, ASB securities, InvestNow, and Sharesies if you're in New Zealand. I then go into my investment portfolio and the reasoning as to why I love shares such as coca-cola and johnson and johnson.

To oversimplify, I don't want to miss the boat this time if there are great deals to be had on housing.  I don't see it as an investment as much as a way to spend *less* on housing over the next 10-20 years. I know home ownership is expensive in ways that renting isn't. 

I'm thinking about the $200k-$250k range - based on the price of the housing I want, and assuming current prices. In my area that's a starter home in an okay neighborhood. If prices fall due to the 'Rona I'd still be into this size of home, so I may even be looking at less.

But I don't think I can reach 20% down by the end of the year. If I reach $25-$30k down, is paying PMI worth a sub 3% interest rate?",finance

stocks,Rat(g)e My Next Four Week S&amp;P Predictions.,"Disclaimer. I'm 25 and haven't really lived through a depression/recession+pandemic but neither has anyone else so here we go.

This week (5/1): Stocks will continue rising until Friday. Too much high is going off and it's a pay day so you know the FOMO is real. 

Next week (5/4-8): Expect moderate falls on Monday (S&amp;P down 2-3%) and then slow climb back through Thursday and then down again next Friday. With unemployment being an all time high, I think the only thing driving this week's jump is 1) news from major companies and 2) feds (don't fight the feds) 

Week 3 (5/11-5/15) here's where it gets dicey. Depending how many new cases of COVID we get (I'm estimating it's gonna increase but not crazy) people will begin fear acting and start selling. Also people are going to need to pay off bills and will begin liquidating assets and take profits. Here is where I estimate FOMO dying. Finally, people will realize others are not spending money on business but rather holding onto similar spending habits that were seen during the quarantine. People have bills and collection will come. This will all result in a steady decline for that week (S&amp;P down 4% after full week). 

Week 4 (5/18-5/22) reality comes. Stocks going down either all at once (it will only take 1-2 bad outbreaks for fear to come back) at 10%+ or slowly (end of month bills needing to pay) at 10%+ in a week. 

Good chance I'm wrong or right. Stock market is made up money anyway and I think this recession will create a larger gap between upper and lower/middle class.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy GAP insurance?,"I bought a new Explorer in February and paid well below MSRP and put $1k down as well.  My total loan was for $32k financed through First Citizens Bank (4.5%), I did not buy GAP coverage from the dealership because my car insurance (USAA) has ""Car Replacement Assistance"" where they pay 20% more than the ACV if your car is totaled or stolen.  I just refinanced with Navy Federal CU (2.2%) and they offer GAP insurance for $299 that will pay *up to* 150% of the ACV if it's totaled or stolen.

&amp;#x200B;

The only negative thing I've heard about the USAA coverage is that they'll apply the 20% ""Car Replacement Assistance"" automatically when paying off a lender... so people that have both GAP and CRA will get screwed.  If someone owed $32k on a car worth $26k and totaled it, USAA would pay $31.2k to the lienholder instead of just paying the $26k and letting the GAP insurance cover the difference... so the owner wouldn't benefit from the Car Replacement Assistance and the GAP insurance would only have to cover $800.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't want both, but right now I'm paying $8.96/month for the Car Replacement Assistance with USAA, which theoretically is better because they pay the extra 20% regardless of the loan balance.  Looking at Autotrader last night it appears that my loan balance is right about the same the ACV of my Explorer, and I am paying an extra $100+ a month towards the loan so I imagine I'll owe less than the ACV eventually.  Is it worth paying $107.52/year to get an extra 20% from my insurance if I total my car?  I've only totaled one car in my life and it was when I was 16... which was &gt;20 years ago.  The GAP would be cheaper (overall) at $299 for the life of the loan... but if I don't owe more than the ACV it is worthless whereas the CRA from USAA pays extra regardless of whether you have a loan balance.  Currently, I have CRA for all three of our vehicles USAA insures, it's comically cheap for my old pickup truck and about the same cost for my wife's SUV as my Explorer.

* I have good credit (mid 700s), and am otherwise smartly financially positioned

The dilemma: 

Employer's corporate parent has made a reckless acquisition and gone dangerously, laughably cash-poor. Playing on the fear in our news system, corporate parent is opportunistically putting a freeze on filling staff positions, cancelling cost of living adjustments, cancelling retirement contributions, and **cutting hours**. In an entry-level position, I'm already taking a low enough wage that I'd applied to a better spot internally and have been interviewing extensively externally. There is nothing for me at my current job.

When I leave, I will owe \~$15,000 in unvested tuition reimbursement. I do not believe I can get the delicious federal loans I would otherwise have had access to had I not been in bed with this sinking ship and taking tuition reimbursement. To get the reimbursement vested, I would need to be here another two years from next month (not happening).

personalfinance,(IT) Complete newbie - investing inheritance,"Hi everyone!

I'm sorry for asking this for what is possibly the billionth time today, but after skimming all the help pages of this subreddit (and many others) I was left even more confused than I could ever be.

*What happened: due to unforeseen circumstances, i.e. covid-19 and relatives' death, my family was left with a conspicuous sum of money. We're talking in the 600k and more euros range.*

My grandfather, bless him, was the giga turbo investor type that stayed up in the night after his third job in order to write down number and more numbers on hundreds of sheets of paper. 
That skill, alongside a *ridiculous* range of interest rates he took advantage of in the 70s for thirty year long investments left us with said lump of money... albeit without the head behind it to pilot so many euros around. 
(Not that it would have helped now, since he could never grasp that he came from an era of 49% rates and almost three times current salaries' worth, but I digress) 

By sheer coincidence I am starting to dip my feet into the daytrading world (paper trading, at the moment, for obvious reason) and the small knowledge I'm gaining has shown me how the available banks currently offering us their investment services are complete and insane **scams**.
While grandpa's health was faltering we were tasked with reinvesting a small part of his savings and were lead to believe that long term bank investments with *0,8% potential gains* were some fucking huge sum, and when said banks sometimes failed us and ate away 1-2% of the sum we were gullible enough to believe the good old mantra ""it's finance, it's complicated, just keep investing"".

Now, after looking at international funds and other sources of investment, those 7-10% consistent gains seem INCREDIBLE. 
Since I'd rather shoot my dick off than give more money to our local leeches, I suggested to my family that maybe investing in small flats for university students (looking at a 1 in 4 chance of never getting paid rent and no way of getting it back, at least in Italy) wasn't the right choice and we should just send the whole sum to a few different funds.

&amp;nbsp;

After this HUGE premise, here comes the question.
How do you even *approach* such funds? I've tried reading online on Fidelity (if that's its correct name) platform and a few others, but I couldn't wrap my head around the numbers, charts and other lingos!

Are you supposed to contact them and ask for an e-mail chat? Are you supposed to open an account and bank transfer the sum to it before you manually invest *by yourself* the money into the different funds?

What we are looking for: a stable, yearly income from a trusted fund or entity, possibly in the 5-10% range, with a chance of reinvesting the interest or whitdraw it if needed (and if such a thing is possible, please forgive my ignorance).

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, please understand that I'm a neofite, even though I'm starting to trade stocks and options, and even though many points of what I wrote may seem naive or simply not make sense, they weren't made in bad faith or for trolling: I just don't know better!

Any help or insight will be deeply appreciated!

Some data for context purposes.
In Italy, the monthly salary gravitates around 1000-1200 euros. Bank interests are in the 0,1% range, more often than not 0,0% flat, and treasury bonds are at 0,0%.
600k euros at 5% yearly interest would net 30k euros, which is essentially two salaries'worth.",finance
investing,CLO Engineering Is No Match for Covid-19 as Payments Get Cut Off,"By Sally Bakewell and Lisa Lee

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s engineering was supposed to
turn loans to junk-rated companies into relatively safe bonds
known as collateralized loan obligations. As the new coronavirus
slams the economy, some investors are finding that safety to be
fleeting.

Interest and principal payments are at risk of being cut
off for investment-grade CLOs in around a dozen different
transactions totaling a few billion dollars, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. The notes at risk have ratings as
high as the A tier, well within high-grade territory, and were
sold by name-brand money managers like Marathon Asset Management and Pretium Partners, the people said.

The securities are being battered as the Covid-19 pandemic
is bringing an economic downturn far worse than many CLOs were
designed to withstand, with some estimates for unemployment in
the second quarter reaching 30%. Loans are getting downgraded
and their value is dropping, which is triggering protections
designed to protect the safest securities issued by CLOs, those
rated AAA.

It’s the first time these safeguards, known as senior
overcollateralization tests, have been this widely triggered
since the 2008 financial crisis. Many more deals could meet the
same fate in the coming months. CLOs, a $700 billion market of
securities carrying ratings ranging from junk to AAA, were
largely left out of Federal Reserve stimulus programs.

“I don’t know anybody that modeled a CLO, or any other
structured product, around unemployment soaring from about 3% to the levels we could be facing in the next few weeks,” said Elen
Callahan, head of research at the Structured Finance
Association, a trade group. “If you told an analyst to model
that, they wouldn’t know what to do.”

The lowest-ranking securities sold by CLOs are most at
risk. Of the roughly 900 deals that have posted data over the
last month, around 21% have had cash payments cut down or cut
off from the riskiest portion of their deals, known as the
equity, according to Bank of America. In certain cases, junk-
rated notes, which are less risky than the equity, have been
affected as well. In mid-April, some analysts were expecting as
many as 1 in 3 CLOs to have to limit payouts to holders of their
riskiest securities.

Prices can end up dropping on securities in a deal where
payments have been cut off, because investors worry about the
quality of the loans backing the transaction, said Jason
Merrill, a CLO specialist at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
“It’s broadly considered a sign of deal distress,” Merrill
said.

While investors might expect high-yield securities to
suffer in a downturn, investment-grade instruments are supposed
to be less vulnerable. During the last financial crisis, CLO
bonds rated AA or AAA saw no defaults due to downgrades of the
underlying loans. The default rates for A and BBB rated notes
were infinitesimal, amounting to less than 0.01%, according to
the Structured Finance Association’s Callahan.

Bondholders could face curtailed payments as CLOs fail the
senior over-collateralization tests, which require the value of
the loans a CLO holds to exceed the value of the bonds it issued
by a sufficient amount. Failing that requirement results in
interest and principal payments getting deferred on the bonds
and cut off to equity. Those are instead diverted to pay down
the safest notes issued by the CLO.

CLOs issued by firms including Marathon, Pretium and
Jefferies Finance have failed these tests. If the portfolio
grows in value sufficiently over time relative to the
liabilities, the failure is “cured” and payments to investors
can resume. With the Jefferies transaction, it used cash built
up from loan repayments that couldn’t be used to buy new loans,
since the CLO’s reinvestment period had ended, to remedy the
deal’s breaches.

Representatives at Pretium, Marathon and Jefferies declined
to comment.

CLO portfolio managers can sometimes cure their shortfalls
through skillful trading, but loan downgrades have come so fast
that many managers were unable to shed poorly performing loans
quickly enough in recent weeks. Even more transactions are
failing less stringent tests of whether the deal has enough
collateral, known as interest-diversion tests.

“We are only at the beginning of the first inning of seeing
significant distress in the leveraged loan market,” said Michael
Barnes, executive chairman at Tiptree Inc., and founding partner
of Tricadia Holdings, an investment manager that also issued
CLOs. “It may severely impact equity, BBs and possibly BBBs with
capital losses in the coming years.”

The record surge in downgrades has pushed more CLOs to sell
loans they own: debt to companies rated CCC can usually only
account for about 7.5% of the holdings of a portfolio backing a
CLO under the terms of the securities.

With recent rating cuts, many portfolios saw these limits
exceeded. CLOs have to mark those excess loans at their market
trading price, which effectively lowers the value of the
collateral. That can spark more overcollateralization-test
breaches, potentially creating a downward spiral.

There will almost certainly be more CLOs selling loans,
depressing the value of their assets further. There’s little
sign that the businesses paralyzed by the pandemic can soon
return to normal levels of revenue generation that would improve
their financial standing. Moody’s Investors Service placed about
$22 billion of CLO securities -- which get rated separately from
their underlying loans -- on watch for a downgrade earlier this
month, citing the deterioration in corporate credit quality.
CLOs have these tests to protect the senior bondholders.

Market participants tout them as mechanisms that specifically
fortify CLOs against credit shocks, although whether they can
outlast a shock of this magnitude remains to be seen. Bank of
America said in a report earlier this month that failing
overcollateralization tests for investment-grade portions of
transactions likely hasn’t happened since the 2008 financial
crisis.

Here are some of the deals that have failed overcollateralization tests for investment-grade securities:

* The Pretium deal, called Crown Point CLO 6, was a reset of a
deal originally issued by NewMark Capital in 2014. Pretium
agreed to acquire two of NewMark Capital’s CLO assets in 2018.
The Marathon deal, CLO VI, was issued in 2014, and its re-
investment period, or the period during which the CLO manager
trades in an out of loans, ends next month meaning it had less
flexibility to remedy the breach.

* The Jefferies deal, Apex Credit CLO 2015-II, used loan
repayments that it hadn’t re-invested in new debt to effectively
“cure” the breach and ultimately then passed the tests, one of
the people familiar with the matter said.

* A middle-market CLO managed by ArrowMark Partners, Peaks
2014-1A, breached its senior OC test. The deal has more exposure
to larger loans than typical middle-market deals. It’s the only
deal of ArrowMark’s CLOs to have breached an OC provision. A
representative for the Denver-based firm declined to comment.",finance

Or would we be better off seeing if we can get a HELOC down to 95% LTV, pay the additional insurance for a few months, and then get it appraised with a new kitchen to bump the LTV back to a lower value? I am not crazy about this idea, as I remember from mortgage shopping that you needed to get your LTV down to 80% to stop the additional insurance.

personalfinance,"Relocating to the US: Buy or lease car, and new vs used?","I'm relocating to the US for work. I've no idea how long I'll be there for exactly (temporary worker visa), but it's  probably the ballpark of 3-5 years, so I'll use that for planning purposes.

Given that it's a temporary stay, I don't know whether buying or leasing a car is a better decision. The car I have in mind is a Toyota Prius Prime, which has low depreciation/good resale value and easy to sell off, so I'm leaning towards a buy, because if I do end up staying for longer I can continue driving it. 

I know that most people say to buy used because of the whole depreciation driving off the lot thing, but for the Prius Prime buying new gives me the $4500 federal tax credit, which makes it cheaper than/comparable to a used Prius Prime. I have checked out the value of used Prius Primes, and it does hold up its value very well. E.g. I see 2017 Prius Primes listed for &gt;$20,000 when a brand new one is around $27000 (before the $4500 tax credit). So I figure it's quite a good deal to buy new because I'm paying around $100+ a month on depreciation (I'm using $18000 resale value for 3 years of usage as a conservative estimate).

I'm eyeing the Prius Prime because I can park and charge for free at work and at public charge points so that's minimal expenses on fuel and parking too. My commute should be on pure EV, although I want the flexibility of long roadtrips on weekends. (I'm new here, so there's lots to see and visit!) I also like the idea of driving electric but that's not really a personal finance point. I also read that it's a very reliable car so there should be minimal expenses on maintenance/repairs (plus buying new means it'd be under warranty too).

I know I could also buy a cheap used car for like &lt;$5000 and sell it off for around the same, but I'm not considering that as an option because 1) I like driving and I'd like to enjoy my first car; 2) I don't want to deal with repairs and maintenance, I'd rather pay a bit more for reliability and peace of mind; 3) I appreciate not burning fossil fuels for commutes.

My only reservation is that it's a huge chunk of money tied up in a depreciating (though slowly) asset. I have enough savings to buy it in cash (so I don't have to pay extra for interest), and I'd still have enough savings left for rainy days, but I'm not sure if that's wise. If I take a loan, it probably would not be at a very good interest rate because I'm new-to-country and I won't have a credit score. That said, I do plan on renting a car for the first couple of months to try to build up my credit score.

I'm a new grad and new to this adulting business (first car purchase, first relocation, first job) so sorry for any dumb questions or mistakes! :) I've done as much research as I can think of so hopefully there aren't too many of them in this post!

Any other recommendations would also be welcomed. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Does interest on federal student loans still accumulate after they've gone to collections?,"My student loans (about \~36k) were in deferral for years. I moved out of the country and honestly ignored all of my US debts for the last 5 years. I checked my student portal on [GreatLakesBorrowers.com](https://GreatLakesBorrowers.com) and it says they were sold off to a collection agency. Interest was collecting each month before this, once they're sold off do I still get interest or do I just owe the balance that was sold off?

Also, I don't need you to tell me how stupid I was to do this, etc... I know the situation I'm in and how irresponsible it was but there's nothing I can do about it now other than move forward.

personalfinance,Do not give out any personal information or authentication code if your bank calls you talking about a fraud alert on your account.,"There seems to be a scam going on and I just barely avoided it, my girlfriend said she would have fallen for it 100%.

I got a call that showed up as a ""Spam Risk"" number on my phone yesterday, I didn't answer, they kept calling. I figured I'd answer the third time just to see if it was a mistake by caller ID.

They asked me my name, I confirmed yes that was me. They said I have a CC charge that hit my account from a state I dont live in, they asked if I knew about this. I said no, and they said ""Ok, we are going to reverse and cancel that charge right now."" They then said ""We are sending a verification code to your account now to confirm your identity."" 

    I said ""Why? Have you not already reversed the charge"" 
    
    Caller: ""Yes but we need to verify this is truly your phone / identity to complete the process""
    
    Me: ""Okay, I will call the main bank fraud number to go through that process then""
    
    Caller: ""Well sir, they phones lines are very busy right now and you will have a hard time reaching anyone if you call..."" Blah blah blah kept saying some more stuff about how they need the verification code to reverse the charge...

When I went to the phone details about the call it was spoofed because the call came from the actual fraud main phone number from the bank, so if I had called back I would have actually been routed to the bank.

The text I received to my phone was from the actual bank text number that i receive text alerts from and said ""Thank you for adding your credit card to your digital wallet. Please use this one-time activation code to complete enrollment: ######""

The scam caller was a very professional sounding women and was a native english speaker. If I had given out that activation code I would have just added my credit card to someones iPhone most likely.

personalfinance,Is it time to buy a house? Or wait?,"The wife and I (both 30) are talking about buying our first home. We live in the Deep South and the type of homes around here we’d be interested in are around $150,000. 

Our monthly obligations are: my car note of $325 a month on a 2016 Honda Civic. Her 2016 Toyota Camry’s note is $500 a month, but will be paid off in July. Our car insurance with GEICO is $240 a month. We have no student loans, no medical bills, no children (I’ve had a vasectomy).

We have about $10,000 in savings and our take-home pay combined is $3,500 a month. She works in healthcare and was recently promoted while I work in higher education. We’ve never bought a house before and never lived on our own before. Since we married in 2015, we’ve been living with my family. 

So if we bought a house, we’d have to buy a fridge, washing machine and dryer, living room set, plates, pots and pans for the kitchen, etc. We’d be starting fresh really.

The wife’s car being paid off in three months is what started this conversation as it’s something we’ve talked about for some time.

I’d like to wait until we have more money in savings for a down payment, furnishings, etc. on the house, which would likely be next spring or summer. The wife wants to start looking immediately. I’ll admit I’m very conservative with this type of thing.

Any advice on what we should do? 

Would it be a good idea to see how much of a loan we’d be approved for as a starting point?

personalfinance,Question on mortgage loan forbearance,"Hello all, I'm in a bit a bind and I'm not sure what to do here. So here is the back story. I live in the greater Los Angeles area and they passed the rent freeze, this affected me, and my tenant doesn't have to pay currently, he will have to pay after the freeze is over. My fiancee has lost her job due to Covid and I've found out started next pay period I'm furloughed one day a week for the next 26 weeks. We both were making good money before this happen and unemployment doesn't cover half what my fiancee was making. We're now stuck with getting health insurance because my job doesn't offer it (Civil service exempt) or paying our mortgage. Oh this is a VA loan.

I spoke to my mortgage company about the forbearance and that's when they informed me. I do qualify however once the forbearance ends the full amount is due and at this time they have no plans to set up payment arrangements. This leaves me with a few questions. 

1. Are other mortgage companies doing it this way? 

2. If I can't afford to pay it for the next three months, then why all of a sudden after 90 days would I have three months worth of payments?

3. If the federal government pass this law were no mortgage company can foreclose for the next 90 days, isn't this just delaying the inevitable?",finance

Bitcoin,How to make Bitcoin's adaption into payments processing quicker! - A lesson from Credit Cards,"Most people are motivated by money. Even if they have lots of it. Even though, Bitcoin being the premier speculative asset brings in late adapters to Bitcoin, they are not there for Bitcoins ultimate purpose which, is to destabilise BS. (a.k.a. Gov and Fed) So with that in mind and to play to the animal instincts of consumers who are motivated by money for the largest part, I suggest we take a lesson from banks and how they coxed us to use credit cards. That is, by way to credit card offers. Credit card issuers spend some of their income from merchant fees on offers to consumer. Which is akin to spending some of the mining income on offers to Bitcoin users. But it is not as if miners are footing the bill for all this and much like with credit cards, increased adaption will benefit them more than anything. What do you think and how could such a thing where a Bitcoin user gets paid to buy using Bitcoin can be introduced?",cryptocurrency

investing,LIQUIDITY TRAP!,"Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a **liquidity trap**. There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period. Or we'll try and print our way to inflation -- with consumer spending as the operative variable.

Welcome to the debt bubble! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* Wage increase (through Federal stimulus check or other) will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble.

Cash out high. Assets will be worth less than cash. Then pay down your debt or invest when we finally touch bottom. The environment looks exceptionally bearish for months and years to come. Everyone is scared to say liquidity trap because that will cause equities and lending to tank. But I encourage you to scream it.",finance
personalfinance,Auto Refinancing? (Utah),"For the first time I have an auto loan, as in the past I always bought cash up front from private dealers.

personalfinance,Boosting Savings vs 401(k) Match vs Student Loan Payoff,"Hello all,

Just back to gather some advice: 

I am 23. I currently have $13,000. My monthly expenses are $3,800 (over the last 6 months, 2 car insurance premiums in this ($800 each)) according to Mint. My monthly post-tax income averages out at around $4,900. So I have roughly 3.5 months worth of expenses saved. I have an IRA with $3,000 in it as well.

I have recently become eligible for my 401(k) match at my company which is a 100% match of the first 3% and a 50% match up to 5%. So this would mean up to $460 a month out of my income if I took advantage of it. With around $300 in employee match. I have not taken advantage of the match yet due to the cover situation and economic uncertainty to build my emergency fund.

Additionally I have $70,000 in student loans ($36k private and the rest federal loans). Monthly payment on private is $240/20 year and federal student loans are $320 (well $0 for now) on IBR. 

So my questions are:

A. Is my emergency fund enough? I have an exit strategy of paying to break my lease and moving back in with my parents. And a good chance of having a standing job offer available.

B. If so, should I focus on the 401(k) match, since it's a 65% instant return? With the knowledge that in desperate times I could withdraw this money at tax + 10% for extra emergency funds or the pay off my private student loans early?

C. In terms of paying off student loans, with the 401(k) investment I'd still have an excess of about $500 a month. Say $200 is fun money... Should I pay $300 extra on my private student loans or invest some of it back into savings?

Given this is my first economic downturn I want to make the best moves possible and not the worst moves.

Other Debt: Car Lease at $300/month for the next 28 months, not sure of my exit strategy for this yet. Maybe buying it off lease/trading it in/selling it/ or leasing a new vehicle. 

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm 17, recently got an hourly job, and am thinking about doing stocks?","Hi. First post. I'm 17 years old and I recently got myself a job amidst this crisis. I work from home and my job is based on the amount of hours I work ($x/hr). I don't have a set amount of hours per day, just whenever I'm needed. Since I'm only 17, I'm thinking that it's not a bad time to try and use the money I'm earning to get into the stock market as I don't have to pay rent or anything like that - still living in the comfort of home. I was planning on saving about half of what I earn into savings, but the interest rate is really weak since I didn't go with an online bank. Anyway, is it a bad idea to invest in stocks at my age and balance? I really only have $200~ right now as I got the job very recently, and I'm a bit fearful that the workload is going to decrease. I'll still be earning, just not as much. I was talking to a friend of mine, and he said $200 is basically going to get me nowhere, to which I agree. On the flip side, I feel like this is an apt time to invest due to the current crisis. Maybe I could wait a while, build up some more cash, and then go in with a notable amount of money and start investing? Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.",finance
