personalfinance,[Auto] Advice for car financing. (AUS),"My girlfriend bought a new car from a dealership. She signed the papers to buy it and the contract gave a 24h cooldown period in which the dealership said they would get back to her with an interest rate for financing. It got to late in the day and she called twice, both times they said they would get back to her before the day was up. She said to a woman working there that she would cancel the purchase if the interest rate was too high (""Around 9%"" was the example she said and the woman assured her it would be that high). Anyway, of course the dealership didn't get back to her and she didn't cancel the purchase. The interest rate they are offering her is 8.4% and she has lost all bargaining power it seems.

It is a stupid situation to get into in the first place but now that she is in it, I want to know what she can do.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"My wife and I got married and bought a house last year, yet we still have to pay in this tax season. How?","Everyone was telling me how big of a refund we'd get with mostly the house but also filing together.  Current we owe approximately $155.

Here are the numbers...

Me

Taxable income - 72,714

Federal withheld- 10,225

SS withheld - 4,790

Medicare withheld - 1,120

401k contributions - 4,550

HSA contributions - 195 (just started this)



Her

Taxable income - 51,317

Federal withheld- 7,033

SS withheld - 3,314

Medicare withheld - 775

401k contributions - 2,111


House numbers (bought on 7/1/16)

Interest paid in 2016 - 3,185

MI paid - 348

We both claim 1 allowance on our W4.  Last year I had it at 3 and I owed like 2k (though my taxable income was 88k last year).  I lowed the allowance after than expecting to get something back this year...

Is this normal?  Would it be beneficial to file married separately?  I just really felt like we'd get a refund this year.  Hell my dad was telling me we were gonna get like 10k back...

edit- i should mention that i haven't filed yet, this is just what turbotax told me.  maybe it's worth seeing someone?",finance
personalfinance,"22 years old, is it OK to Forego my 401k to pay off Student Debt?","Hello PF folks,
I recently started my first full-time job out of college. I will be making about $39,000 a year, not including my sales commissions (which could reasonably bring it up to roughly $45,000 according to my colleagues). 

My company matches up to 4% after 5 years of employment, which is pretty 'meh' from what I've gathered on this forum. I don't really intend on sticking around for more than 2-3 years. With this in mind, I also have about $28,000 in student debt, with interest rates between 3-6% (luckily only one loan is at 6%). 

I've decided to opt out of my 401 contributions, with the idea that I would like to budget myself strictly and make large payments to my loans instead. I've calculated that I can put in $1,440 per month, which will have me paid off by September 2018. I might have to tweak the numbers after I see my actual paychecks, after taxes/benefits/etc., but that is my initial goal. 

TL;DR I want to vanquish my student loans. At 22 years old, is it ok to opt out of all 401 contributions in order to maximize my loan payments?

Cheers!",finance

EDF agrees to Fessenheim closure compensation protocol

^(25 January 2017)

&gt;The board of directors of French utility EDF approved the terms of the protocol negotiated between the company and the government for setting compensation for the closure of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant. Under France's energy policy, Fessenheim - the country's oldest nuclear power plant - must close when the Flamanville EPR is commissioned in late 2018.

Agreements signed for EBRD uranium legacy fund

^(24 January 2017)

&gt;The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has signed framework agreements with the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, a precondition for the implementation of projects under an EBRD fund to deal with the remediation of former uranium mines and processing plants.

**VIEWPOINT:**

What's really killing America's nuclear plants

The premature shutdown of America's nuclear power plants is nothing short of a national catastrophe, writes Jarret Adams.

The agreement to close prematurely the Indian Point Energy Center north of New York City felt like a gut punch. The latest in a string of closure announcements, Indian Point hurts so deeply because of its high-profile and proximity to the world's leading financial centre.

As many as two-thirds of America's 99 reactors could shut down by 2030. Today we are building four. The only way to change this trajectory in the near term is to convince more Americans that nuclear energy makes sense. But we are not doing enough to earn more supporters and remain too focused on finding technical solutions.

personalfinance,Is there any way to get back a fraudulent Uber ride when their customer service department refuses to help?,"Hi! Not sure if this is strictly Personal Finance, but it involves bills and money so figured I'd ask anyway!


The other day, I needed to get a ride from Brooklyn to LaGuardia airport. It's about a 45 minute drive, so I requested the car 90 minutes before I needed to be at the airport - plenty of time. 


When I hopped in the car, the driver informed me that 'he needed to get gas or we wouldn't make it'. I was pretty dumbfounded (why did he pick me up then? He knew my destination from the app), but I told him if he has to he should stop on the way. He then proceeded to drive to MANHATTAN to get gas (even though there were other gas stations on the way). This added 45 minutes to our trip. When we got to Manhattan, he informed me that 'he couldn't find the gas station' so we'd need to look somewhere else. At this point I was fed up, and knew that I was going to miss my flight. I hopped out at the next red light, told him not to charge me, and got a cab instead. I missed my flight, and had to pay the $100 change fee. 


What REALLY annoyed me though is that he still charged me for the ride into Manhattan! SO I tried to contact Uber and explain what had happened, and requested that they a) refund the ride and b) offer compensation for the missed flight fee, since it was 100% their fault that I missed the flight. They are refusing to refund the trip, saying that ""they can't refund for things beyond their control"". Last time I checked, having enough gas to finish a trip, and then not taking a 45 minute detour to get it is within your control. 


So. Anything I can do?


tl;dr: Uber driver didn't have enough gas for the trip, took a 45 minute long detour to get it, I missed my flight, and Uber thinks this is my somehow my fault so are refusing to refund.",finance
personalfinance,Need Help to Pay Off High Interest Debts,"My husband and I are trying to refinance our house. It's in his name currently (he owned it before we got married). We were going to go the FHA route because his score is around 680 (mine is around 760), but we can't do that until June. Our goal in the meantime is to get his score over 700 and then try to get a traditional loan. The problem is he has around 35k in credit card/High Interest debt (several accounts). What would be the best way to manage that and bump up his score as fast as possible? We were thinking that he could take a high line of credit out so we would just have one payment for a couple months before refinancing a traditional loan. I have looked online and it is an option but the interest rates seem outrageous (go figure). Or we could try to take a home equity loan for just the 35k (we have about 140k in equity) and then finance that into the loan after his credit jumps. What should we do? Would I be better off taking the high line of credit? My credit utilization is hovering around 35-40%.",finance

personalfinance,Should we consolidate our personal and parent student loan debt?,"My wife and I have just turned 30 and we have about some student loan debt that breaks down like this:

* $115,000 total, of which:
  * $10k is in our names, of which $5k is at an interest rate of  about 2% and the other $5k is at about 5%.
  * $105k is in our parents names, at rates between about 6.5% and 7.5%.

We have been paying the full payments for all the debt, totaling about $2200 per month, which really sucks, but is manageable for us. The $2000 or so per month portion that goes to our parents' loans would be difficult for them to pay. The remaining term on the loans at our current rate of payment ranges from about 5 years to about 20 years.

We currently rent, but we would like to buy a house or condo sometime in the next couple years. We live in an expensive area, so this will likely require a large (&gt;$300k) mortgage. We currently have good credit (about 780), and hope to save a decent downpayment (between 10% and 20%). We have no other debt than the student loans.

We've recently been considering consolidating the medium-to-high interest rate loans, totaling about $110k, into a private loan from SoFi. They have quoted us a loan for that amount with a 7-year repayment term and a fixed rate of 3.75%, resulting in a payment of about $1600 per month.

This would rid our parents of a worry and a burden on their credit, save us $600 per month, and cut our worst-case remaining repayment term by two-thirds, but we're not how much it would affect our ability to buy a house.

What do you think folks, should we move forward with the consolidation or should we wait?",finance

While I was unemployed last year I made the bad decision of taking out a personal loan from from a lender. At the time I felt backed into a corner and didn't know where else to turn. I had recently lost $42,000 a year job and my expenses reflected that income and burnt through my savings within two and a half months and still hadn't found a job. The loan was for $2,600 and had some ridiculous interest rate of something like 135%. I don't remember exactly, but I'm sure one of you can calculate it based off of my payment terms. I'm now stuck paying $294.46 a month for 47 months. I was able to find a job I was very reluctant to take for $15/hour just so could pay my bills and move forward. I'm extremely grateful for this sub because I have taken a lot of advice and reduced my expenses and been able to save some money that I was planning on using towards paying off this debt but due to an unforeseen expense on my car, my savings have been reduced back down to $86. With my current income I've been able to save about $150 a month but I do have a little bit of hope. Next month I'll be starting a new position back in my desired field where I'll be back up to $18/hour which will definitely help. This isn't the full story though, I'm $3,000 deep in credit card debt with an embarrassing credit score of 617, which I know for this sub is not astronomical but in my early twenties definitely feels almost insurmountable. My main goal is to pay off this horrible loan as soon as possible so I can work on reducing my debt. I would be able to pay off an additional $200 a month on the principle with this new job and be able to pay it off slowly but I guess the purpose of my post is really to ask for advice on what my options may be to restructure the payments or the interest rate so I'm not paying so much for what feels like nothing. I respect what you guys do here and with all the help you've given others I've been able to create a reasonable and working budget for an income that normally I wouldn't be able to make work.

My plan is this;

* **Teaching Abroad** - I go into grad school for my masters and afterwards, I plan to take time off to teach abroad in countries such as China, Japan and South Korea (1-2 years each). I hope to pay off some of the loans and based on numbers I calculated, at the very least, I could get the debt down to $50k, or at the most, I could get it down to $35k. 
* **Paying Off the Rest When I Come Back** - Afterwards, I can come back to the states to complete my Ph.d, and hopefully find a job, and based on the new (predicted) debt, it may take me 4-7 years to pay off the rest of the debt. I might either live with my parents the whole time, or live with them and find an apartment for around $800-$1k a month, with a car for probably around $12k. 
* **Settling Down** - When I settle down, I plan to live in a suburban house in Florida, which may cost around $1K-10K, depending on which house I plan to get in the future. The income-based method sounds like a good one for me, where I can pay around $700 a month but I'm still not too sure. I plan to have 2-3 children, which will, in total cost me around $5-6k annually.

* Navient Stafford:

* Navient: 
* (variable) 4.25% ($47096.39)
* WellsFargo: 
* 3.75% ($37475.13)

(Staffords are govt, all others are private. I'm not on any IBR.)

For further context, I make 3400 USD/mo, 2800 after rent.

Now that I'm under 100k in total balance, I should be able to consolidate with one lender. But, as you can see, I've got 3 loans left at 6.8% (govt loans) with relatively small balances. I should also note that my variable interest rate private loan with Firstmark Services increased from 6 to 6.25% this past month (Jan 2017).

What would you do, especially with interest rates likely to increase in the short term? Should I try and finish paying off the 3x6.8% loans as quickly as possible and then consolidate? Or should I consolidate now?

I'm thinking of advising her in terms of budget and maybe transferring the credit card balance to another one with lower interest rate (or maybe several)

personalfinance,New college grad looking to get a credit card and start building credit.,"Hi all - 

Before I start, yes I know I am late to the game when it comes to building credit. Better late than never, right? A little background that may be helpful: I'm a recent college graduate, currently unemployed/looking for FT or PT employment, and have less than $5,000 in federal loans (grace period for payments is ~6 months, so I've got a few months). I live at home and try to save everything I can, with (thankfully) very few expenses at the moment. I'd be using a credit card (CC) for planned expenses only (things that I have budgeted for). I have little experience in this, but I've been reading different posts in this subreddit to learn more. Currently, I'm leaning towards the Suntrust Cash Rewards Card because they're my regular bank. I've also been looking in to the Amazon Prime Rewards card and the Discover IT card I also have a few questions:

1) How do these cards differ from one another?

2) What should I be looking out for in a CC? What are the benefits of certain CC's over others? Should I even bother with cards that offer cash back or travel rewards, or should I save that for when I'm older and more established?

3) How hard will it be for me to be approved for a card if I'm currently unemployed? I live at home, so I'm not paying rent or bills, and I try to save as much as I can (gift money, previous paychecks, etc.), but if I don't have a steady income at the moment, will I be unable to receive a CC?

3a) Re: unemployment -- if I apply for one or two CCs that I'm interested in, and am rejected because I currently have no income, how does that affect me/my credit score?

4) As mentioned above, I'm currently looking for employment (in my field, many tend to get full-time internships after graduation, first, and then employment with that company). Will I be rejected by most banks/companies I apply to? Would I be better off applying for the Suntrust Cash Rewards Credit Card, because I've had a relationship with them for ~4 years?

5) What are some good financial/credit habits you would suggest for someone in my position? Like I said, I'd really like to start building credit, and I figured getting a CC and using it for pre-planned purchases, and paying the balance in full, would be the best way to do so.


I'm very new to this, and if someone could provide some helpful advice to get me started, I would really appreciate it.",finance

Quarterly student loan payment through ECSI- $193  
Perkins- 2175 @ 5% (payoff date 3/2020)

I've been mulling over taking out a bank loan and paying off Navient/ECSI, the main reason being I want to be done with my debt sooner. I'm in a financial zone where I can afford the payment right now because it's part of my budget and has been for so long but can't really increase the amount i contribute towards it each month. My credit score is between 810-830 at all three bureaus so I don't think getting a decent interest rate is going to be a problem but to get similar payment I would need a rate of around 4.5%. That would cut roughly 18 months off of my total repayment time. Is this an attainable interest rate? Looking for some input from people who may have done the same thing.

Also, is it worth it to give up my right to defer? I know there's been a lot of (deserved) Navient bashing here the last few weeks but I guess I'm one of the rare ones who has had a decent experience. I still have 12 months of deferment available to me. My wife and I are going to buy a home/have kids within the next year or so and the option of temporarily not having to pay a few hundred dollars a month just in case is nice to have. I'm aware that the interest builds when I do this. It's a worst case scenario. I don't know if its possible to negotiate terms like this with a bank or credit union.",finance
personalfinance,Worth investing while in debt?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I recently paid off one of my student loans with my tax refund and savings (yay!), but I still have a direct sub loan of $4,965.53 at a fixed interest rate of 4.5%.  The monthly payment is $62.74.  

I have read and used several tools, including the wiki, ""How to handle $"", and unbury.us to better understand how to tackle my debt, but I'm curious if investing in a Roth IRA would be a good idea despite still being in debt.

Assuming I have already saved up enough for a well budgeted e-fund (I am about $600 away from meeting that goal), should I consider opening a retirement account by paying the minimum amount on my loan while I save an additional $1,000 to invest or should I continue to pay $300/month towards my loan till it is paid off first?  

In other words, should I invest $1,000 into a retirement fund or should that all go towards paying off my student loan of nearly $5,000 (4.5%) first?  I have no actual idea how much I'd earn from the investment, but let's say somewhere between four and seven percent. 

I only make about $1,400/month (after tax) but have very little expenses (yup, income is my biggest hurdle, but the best thing about earnings is one could always get more).

Thanks r/pf!",finance
personalfinance,Thank you PF! My score jumped from 350-736 in ~2.5 years from lurking this sub reddit!,"[My CS jumped from 350 in July 2014 to 736 today.](http://imgur.com/a/yCswp) Background: I made two mistakes at the same time back between 2010 - 2014 when I was just starting my credit journey. Mistake #1 was falling prey to peer pressure at my first job (Express) to open a store card and purchase store clothes to 'look the part'. I spent about $200 on clothes, never received the card in the mail, and ignored it. Yikes! Also, I developed sudden anaphylaxis attacks that send me by ambulance to the ED for treatment probably about 7 times. I didn't realize my parents' insurance wasn't covering these bills and came down with multiple (15+) counts of bad medical debt. And to compound it, I dropped out of school for a semester and my student loan went into default for a little while. 

After reading PF for months, I decided to do something about my credit, which I was being denied even the worst credit cards for. I had to clean up this mess. I relied heavily on CK. I disputed every medical debt I could, claiming I had no knowledge of the accounts. I have disputed every chance I get these accounts, and they have slowly, ever so slowly fallen off. [I have successfully disputed 11 collections thus far](http://imgur.com/a/o793c). I still have 2 stubborn debt accounts that will fall off in 2020 or so. Also, whenever I have an attack and need medical attention, I file with the hospital for bill forgiveness, as I am a poor student. I really wish I had known about this in the first place!

The debt collector that acquired my Express debt was ruthless and unforgiving. They harassed me for years and threatened to take me to court. I knew I originally did owe the debt (which with interest had ballooned to $500), so when I had the money I just paid them off. I tried to negotiate a Pay-for-Delete, including via certified mail, but no dice. The debt still is on my report, showing that it was paid. 

I had one credit lifeline from Victorias Secret I had opened and immediately paid off in 2010. I contacted them, and it turns out that it would still report for another year or two, but my credit was so low they could not re-issue me the card or let me use it. Bummer.

I read up religiously on how to use scummy credit cards, and how to avoid paying interest and fees. The only card that would accept me was an expensive fee scummy company with a secured card. I had to spend $250 opening that card, with a lousy allotment of 250. But every month, I bought a coffee, or something small, and paid it off by phone right away, navigating crazy menus to avoid their insane payment fees. The card was designed to scam people of their money, but I managed it with just the opening fee. My score began to jump up. After 6 months, I had made it to about 560.

OK, much better! I still wasn't getting any dice from regular card companies, even secured cards. I took a leap of faith and visited my student credit union and explained my situation. I showed them my financial aid package, good grades, and asked for their most basic card. They had to speak to the manager, but I was approved, thank god! I got a tiny, no points credit card with a $1000 limit. I did the same as my crummy secured card - I bought small things and paid the off, and watched my score inch up and up. 

Next plan was to re-open my VS card. I had made it to about a 600 score and managed to be approved for a 500 line, with an insane interest rate. OK, cool. I did the same with VS as my other two cards, bought something small, paid it off monthly, score continued to rise. I ended up closing my secured account because of the scummy company, and I wanted my 250 back, so you can see that steep dip in the line graph. I knew I could come back from it now that I had my store card, and my credit union card. 

Then it just was a game of continuing to buy and pay off my cards, never carrying a balance, and disputing medical debt when I could. I forgot to mention, I got back in school and got my loans out of trouble and into forbearance. 

Eventually, I started applying for new cards, sometimes I was denied, sometimes not. I would take into consideration why I was rejected from certain companies. I always kept my card balance down, and every 3 months or so I apply for a new card. I went from a shitty secured card from a scam company to being approved for a $10k line from Amex, a $3800 Discover It line, the Chase Freedom card, and several other cards. I use them responsibly, and always pay off my balance. And now I get to reap the points and cash back rewards and watch my score rise! :)

Oh, and that small dip in October 16 was from closing my old credit union account, as it wasn't offering me rewards. Thankfully I shot back up again quickly. I am hoping as the last of my medical debt falls off as well as my paid collection in 2020 that I will hit close to 800, right on time for applying for a home loan :D

personalfinance,Math question about paying down loan vs investing,"This is going to be one of those questions where once I hear the answer, it's going to be a d'oh moment.

My husband and I recently received a lump sum gift of $5,000. At the same time, I learned that 2016 will be last year I am able to contribute to a Roth IRA due to the income limit. So we are deciding whether to pay down his student loan or invest the money.

When considering the IRA option, it seems like this $5,000 could turn into ~$21,000 in 30 years, when I would be eligible to withdrawal it all. 

When considering the loan payment, it seems like this would save us about a couple of hundred dollars in interest and move our payment complete date a couple of months (an emotional gain).

So the IRA options seems like the win. But this got me thinking... the investment option has so much time to see gains while the loan repayment option just ""pays"" gains until the loan is paid off, so it has an obvious advantage. But I often see advice for folks with loans that have a higher interest rate than their predicted market returns that they should put extra money towards their loans since their interest rate is higher. 

So my question is... if my loan interest rate is &gt;5% and I have extra money, should I be considering when I would withdrawal that potential investment before decided what to do with it? Or should I just consider interest rates?

P.S. This actual doesn't apply to me (loan rate is well below this), but I'm more curious about the math of this. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"Have enough money to pay off mortgage, but should I invest it and continue paying monthly instead of one lump sum?","Hello

I have recently received enough money to pay off my remaining mortgage (approximately $320k).  I was able to refinance at a great time last year, and have a 20 year 3.25% interest rate, with payments about $2350 or so a month.  

I have the ability to pay off the loan completely right now.  However, as I've started putting my tax information together, I thought about how I would lose out on the interest tax deduction.  It got me thinking to check into the 20 year treasury rates, and I'm showing about a 2.78% rate as of yesterday.  Obviously this is the safest option, but am thinking if I invest it in a semi-conservative portfolio that I could potentially earn more than 3.25% annually, and therefore not only keep this tax deduction, but also have the potential to realize gains in excess in some years (while sometimes falling short, but over a 20 year time horizon I believe 3.25% is relatively conservative for a return requirement).  

Completely separate from these funds, my wife and I have good retirement accounts between the two of us at about $100k, an emergency fund of about $10-15k, and a joint investment account of $30-40k.  We are in our early 30s, have a brand new baby, and make enough to satisfy our living requirements even with the current mortgage payment, and obviously without that monthly whether be it one big payoff or the investment approach, will be a big boost to our savings ability.  

Thoughts?  Does anyone have any pros/cons to this strategy with the obvious that if there were shortfalls overtime, we would have to chime in.

personalfinance,Employer refuses to refund excessive state taxing? Help...,"Hello /pf,

 I've come to you because I cant seem to find an answer to this question anywhere else. I'm in the process of filing my taxes through Turbo Tax. Federal goes smoothly, as usual. But state (New Jersey) is always where I run into snags. This year is a new one.

Apparently my employer charged me excessively for payments into NJ Disability and NJ UI/WF/SF. Basically, the state sets a maximum cap on what employers can charge. 

* For Disability, its $65.20
* For UI/WF/SF its $148.56

On my W2 from my employer, I was charged significantly more on each. 

Through filing with Turbo Tax, it explains that they will only consider the max allowance, and that *""it is up to you to go back to your employer for a refund of excess contributions""*.

So that is exactly what I do. This is the response I received:

&gt;"" *I don’t know why Turbo Tax isn’t giving you the option to deduct the overages from your state return.*
&gt;  
&gt; *We would gladly refund the overage to you if we could.  The problem is those funds have already been transmitted to the State of New Jersey in the form of our quarterly returns.*""

So I guess my question is, who is liable? Is my employer legally allowed to refuse to refund me, even tho it is clearly their mistake for charging me over the limit? Or do I simply have to file with another platform that allows me to deduct the overage directly from the refund (if that is even possible?)

personalfinance,Helping the in laws with their financial situation,"My (future) mother in law recently asked my fiancé to cosign a private loan to pay off her credit card debt so that she could pay it at a lower interest rate. Turns out MIL has $30,000 in credit card debt. She has tried to get a personal loan on her own, but was denied because her salary is too low compared to the debt. I'm not sure about their other debt load, but I know they have a mortgage on their house. Zillow lists the house at $215,000, but I believe they bought it over 10 years ago for somewhere around $150,000-160,000. Both MIL and father in law have low paying jobs, and FIL only works part time due to health issues(a recent change). To the best of my knowledge, they have no savings or investments, and are in their late 50s, early 60s. Three of their four children live at home.  

They want my fiancé to cosign because he has a decent salary (around $120,000). The other kids work part time at best. Fiancé has agreed because they are family, which I understand. However, I'm very uncomfortable with the whole situation. We have plans to buy a house in the next 3-5 years, and I'm really concerned about what a $30,000 personal loan will do to our mortgage application. We do have some student loans and car loans, but the cars will be paid off before the mortgage application (as in we won't do it before then). The student loans we will likely still have, but we have a solid pay off plan on them, and will likely have them paid down before then. I also don't think MIL can/will curb her spending, which is a huge problem if she thinks she is going to pay off a $30,000 loan plus interest--ever. I told fiancé that we would probably have to plan on paying it off in full before we can even consider getting a mortgage.  

And a lot of her spending is excess. She tries to buy us new coats every year--we turn her down because we can buy our own coats--and I believe she buys them for his siblings as well. She buys clothes that we always return. She buys brand name gifts for holidays. She is always dropping off groceries at our place. She sees a ""good deal"" and can't resist getting one for everyone.  

She is also really insistent that I not know these things, which makes this more sticky. Fiancé has told me because he knows it affects me too and he doesn't hide things from me. To the best of our knowledge, she has told only fiancé and his older brother, not the other two sibilings. 

Fiancé says he has talked to his mom about it, but he can't ""make her listen."" I can't really participate as the conversations are not in a language that I speak. I told him that, unless she can show she can curb her spending, he shouldn't sign the loan. My suggestion was that he (or we, as I was willing to play the bad guy) should sit down with her weekly and review her spending. If there's something she shouldn't have bought, they return it (if possible). I suggested that they destroy her cards, and make her use debit or cash for every purchase. I said he should give it 3 months. If she can't show improvement by then, then he doesn't cosign. I also suggested he get his sibilings involved to help since they live at home.  

I know I kinda pissed fiancé off with this advice, because it's a hard line to take. But I feel like we have to if they expect us to help. And I know I won't convince him not to sign. It's his mother, and he's going to help her. I've also resigned myself to the fact that they will one day live with us, because I just cannot see them surviving without help as they grow older.  

I guess I'm looking mostly for advice on how to address the issue with his parents. Or how I should tell him to address the situation. If there is an option that makes more sense than an unsecured personal loan, I'd like to know that as well, but I don't think completely avoiding helping them is an option. If you need more information, I can try to get it, but they obviously don't know that I know, nor know that I am asking the internet for advice.",finance

Ideally I'd like to use one of my existing cards but I can't pay them down fast enough to make that a viable solution.

And no, work will not give me an ""account card"". [That was my moms suggestion.] 

Suggestions for cards would be great too, if that's what you think I should do. Currently have a discover, an apple barclaycard, alaska airlines, davids and fred meyer jewelers. 

TIA, willing to answer questions also. 

EDIT: Also, I am NOT currently using any of the above cards/line of credits. Just paying them down. And yes, I have a plan for it. 

EDIT#2: I do have student loans also if that makes a difference? 

EDIT#3: I have also thought about trying to consolidate into one loan but am unsure if that would be a good idea or not. Interest rates on cards are from 14% to 25%. Consolidation was estimated at 21% when I last looked into it.",finance

personalfinance,Starting Out Federal Income Tax Questions,"Hello financial gurus of reddit. Could you help me understand some of these tax rules.

I will not be filing federal income tax this year 2017 (2016 earnings), so is it correct that next year I will be exempt from underpayment penalties next year 2018 (2017 earning)?

Because of that, during this year 2017 can I submit a W-4 with 12 claimed allowances so that no federal taxes are withheld from my paycheck, then pay what tax liability I owe on my 2018 tax return in full?

During next year 2018, if I continue to claim 12 allowances and don't have any taxes withheld, can I then pay three estimated tax payments quarterly, equaling 1/4 of 100% of this year’s tax liability each time (April 15, June 15, September 15), then pay the remainder of my tax liability the final quarter (January 15)?

Would that avoid all underpayment penalties?

Would I incur any interest charges in either of these years?

I don’t believe that I can submit the W-4 as exempt because I anticipate a tax liability for both years. Will claiming 12 allowances trigger a lock-out?

Is there any other problems with this that I am not anticipating?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"I'm a first-time homebuyer, 25, have a 7/1 arm at 3.75%. At the end of 7 years, it could raise up to 8.75%. Should I pay down my mortgage early?","Hey PF! Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm in the process of buying my first home. Quick description about me, I currently make ~200k/year pretax, and put down 300k on a 900k mortgage at a 7/1 arm at 3.75%. I'm worried that because interest rates are rising, at the end of my 7/1 arm, I don't want to potentially pay 8.75% interest. I have been investing since the beginning of my career (a little more than 3 years ago) and luckily made good investment decisions and was able to save up enough for a down payment by managing my money daily.

Now here's the question, I can potentially pay off my mortgage within the 7 years I have my loan, assuming I don't lose my job and continue to grow my salary over time (is this a naive way of thinking?). Parents tell me that paying off the loan is a terrible idea because I have no more tax deductions after the 7 years, and that I cannot use the excess money to invest in other things. However, the average return of the market trends at about ~6-7% per year. To me, if interest rates rise so quickly that interest rates are around 8%, does it make sense to pay off the mortgage early? 

I'm not entirely familiar with the tax implications of owning a home, I just know that the interest is tax deductible. Let's say in the worst case scenario after 7 years, the interest rate is 8.75%. Wouldn't it make sense to just pay off the home since it would give me a guaranteed 8.75% return? Would the tax deductions even save me that much at that point by continue paying off the mortgage with an 8.75% interest rate? Thanks for your advice!",finance

personalfinance,Am I able to apply for another personal loan?,"I have accumulated credit card debt during my years as a student and I originally applied and obtained a loan from lending club.  10 months ago I moved and I applied for another smaller loan of 2,000 from lending club and was also approved.  My original lending club loan started August of 2015.  Between the two loans I have combined three of my credit card debts together with consolidated credit.  My issue is that I have now accumulated another 6,000 in debt in between the time of graduation and obtaining a job and the finance charges are killing me.  I currently owe 6,464 to consolidated credit which I pay 268 a month, including the 50 dollar service feed.  All of my various credit cards and my consolidated credit equal up to 14,547 dollars.  The consolidated credit helped by getting me 9% interest rate on my original debt, however the additional 50 dollar surcharge seems to be unfair.  I wanted to apply for a loan of 15,000 which would pay off all 14,537 dollars of debt, but every company declines me because I am associated with consolidated credit.  Lending club allowed me the second loan 10 months ago but they wont allow me a third loan.  Currently I am 29, after taxes and money that goes towards my 403B, I make $1,700 a paycheck and I get paid biweekly, I pay 500 a month in rent and I pay about 150 dollars a month for groceries,100 for the phone bill and 140 for car insurance.

personalfinance,Screwed on taxes,"My former employer listed me as exempt from federal taxes, and I was not.  I did not choose exempt on my w-4 form either.

Now I'm in deep debt to the government, what are my options? Can I list this as part of a larger suit?

Edit: Update! 

Okay, so this is a HUGE example as to why to be proactive in monitoring the documentation being kept on ourselves.

Per advice ITT I contacted the former employer about my W-4 form. The copy I was sent I was advised to fill Exempt in on the exemption portion of the form. The instruction kit and documents package they had me fill out as a new hire were sent from the wrong line of business and wrong contract. So they had me fill out and send in a second W-4 form where I was advised NOT to claim exempt from Federal Taxes.

Everything was supposed to be settled.... But! Apparently their HR software had already received the incorrect W-4 and wouldn't accept another form entry for 30 days. But I was never notified about the situation (and that's not illegal by any means, it's just human and machine error). The HR staff were so flooded with new hire contractors during that time that they lost track of error correction, and my paperwork got shuffled into the mix.

Of course, I am still liable for the taxes.  And that's fair too, since it was an error that set up a situation where I wasn't paying what I normally would.

So, no matter how much pressure there is to get started on contact work, always ALWAYS go slow with the paper work and double check your first pay stubs.

There is a great piece of pleasant information here though. 

I called the IRS to find out how to work out a payment plan, and the person on the line asked if I'd finished filing yet. I said no, I was trying to get all the information together so I could responsibly take care of what I owed.

The rep on the phone reminded me that contract work is the same as staffed work and if I had a lot of expenses buying my own work materials and tools, I could write them off as deductions, and not to just claim a standard deduction. ""The deductions for that are there for a reason."" 

So I dug up my receipts, itemized my deductions, and saved over a third of my initial tax burden was going to be!!

I still owe, but it's considerably less and it's going to be a bit easier to pay.

I also was a damned idiot in this case! There's a lot of financial experts that lurk/post/reply here. But there are also a lot of us who really need the occasional help. So to everyone who had advice, Thank You!

TLDR; If you wind up with a big screw up, check your documents, get advice, and call the IRS. Their phone staff are nice (in my experience at least) and they're not there to be more difficult than they have to be. Just be nice first!",finance

* Should I get a 20 year or 30 year fixed (is there a benefit for one over the other beyond the monthly payment/paying off principle faster)?

personalfinance,Already have problems with Navy Federal CU...just opened an account,"I am having my bathroom renovated towards the middle of February and figured this would be the best use for some savings bonds that I've been sitting on. I needed a place to cash them since I currently bank with USAA and have no where to deposit them. I figured Navy Federal would be the best place (there's a branch right down the street).

I went in today and opened a checking account after checking them out online. I had two $10,000 bonds and $500 cash to deposit. First things first, I waited an hour and a half before I was seen by a representative (not a big problem, but there were only 3 other customers in the bank). I got everything set up with the representative and opened the account. She then said she would take my deposit for me. I handed her the cash and bonds. She looked at me kind of funny and told me they could not deposit more than $1,000 per day until you have been a member for 6 months. I told her that I needed them deposited because I need to write a check to the renovation company soon. She told me she would check with the manager. 

She came back and explained that there was no way around this policy and I'd have to wait 6 months. I left the bank disappointed after only depositing the cash and a credit inquiry. 

I figured this would be the best place to ask for advice. I've heard of having limits on mobile deposits but never on in-person, savings bond deposits. Do they think that I have fake bonds or something?

The real question here is where should I go next? I have no problem opening an account at another bank (local banks are: Wells Fargo, BoA, and Chase). I just want to make sure that the next one I try doesn't pull this same stunt. 

Edit: I have figured this out. I spoke with a representative at BoA in a management position (I don't remember who) but they told me that there was a federal law passed this year (2017) that limits all federally insured banks to only allow a maximum deposit of $1,000 per day for customers/members that have been with the institution for less than 6 months. I hope this helps anyone. 

My solution to this problem was buying a plane ticket back to California to deposit the bonds. It's a hassle, but I feel spending $85 on a ticket is better than taking out a loan I don't need.",finance

I'm trying to help my parents decide if they should proceed in selling timeshares they acquired 8 years ago, advice is greatly appreciated. 

Everything started because a few weeks ago my father received a cold call from a company called Rocky Mountain Marketing Services (http://www.rockymountainmarketingservices.com/). 

Essentially they are telling my father that they have a buyer to purchase his timeshares already, and for a much higher sum then he invested. What they are requesting from my father is that he open an account with the title company (National Federal Holdings) of the buyer. They are asking him to deposit $2000 USD into this account in order to release my father from his contract with the resort. That is indeed a legitimate clause in his contract. Afterwards they are promising to send my father a check for the promised amount.

Warning bells are going off everywhere, this is obviously a scam right? My father never listed his timeshares for sale, when he asked where they got the information they stated it was from a registry that collects all timeshare sales. 

If it's to good to be true, it must be right? Never send money first, that like rule #1 of any shady business deal. We asked if there was any other way to move forward with the sale but they refuse to work out any other methods.

personalfinance,Needing tax advice on paying off a house with a 401k,"Hoping someone might have some sage financial advice for my mom's situation.

My dad passed away three weeks ago. My parents had just recently moved into a new house that they had built and planned to retire in. They've had their old house on the market for a year, trying to sell it. My mom is a teacher and unfortunately doesn't make enough to pay the monthly mortgage of just their new house, so she's concerned that even if their old house sells soon, she still still won't be able to afford the house she's in. My dad put his heart and soul into this house and making sure that it is everything she's ever wanted. So it would be more than loosing just a house if she isn't able to stay in it. 

Financial specifics - It looks like she may get about $90,000 in life insurance if it goes through (for some reason my mom wasn't listed as beneficiary, so we're not 100%). But social security told her she wasn't eligible for my dad's money, and we're guessing she won't get his pension either. The new mortgage is $380,000 (at around 3% interest rate) and she has $80,000 left on the old mortgage that she's hoping to sell soon for around $225,000. Her salary is roughly $40,000/yr. She has about $300,000 in my dad's 401k.

One option she's considering is using any life insurance she gets, the money from the old house when it sells and the money in the 401k to pay off the house so that she can afford her bills on her salary. The 401k money would be taxed at her income level (we think 25% for this next year, but she won't get penalized since she's over 59) instead of the original plan, which was to pull out the money after retirement when they wouldn't have any income. The pitfall is that she won't have much left in retirement to live off of once she quits teaching. However she will receive around $2,000 every month for her teacher's retirement. 

So the question is, is the best financial decision to pay off the house by pulling money out of the 401k at such a high interest rate? If not, what would you suggest?

No need to waste time telling a story though, here's where I'm at now after lurking and working hard for 9 months:  
  
Checking $1000  (this is my baseline I keep for peace of mind)

Savings $3800

Secured MC $0 ($500 limit)

Secured Visa $450 ($500 limit) I pay these off every month

* Should I keep making my monthly payments on my student loan and keep my savings as a safety net for upcoming tuition/expenses/life?  
* Should I pay off my current student loan before getting more financial aid?  
* Is there any point to paying off all my current debts now before moving forward if I'm going to be back in debt with student loans in 2 years anyways?  
  
I think I may be over-analyzing this situation as I often do but any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,Is it time to refinance?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Since graduating in 2010, I've finally paid my total student loan balance down to under 100k.

Here are the details, ranked from highest interest rate to lowest:

* MyFedLoan Stafford:
* Interest rate: 6.8% (Balance: $542.45)
* Navient Stafford:
* 6.8% ($909.48)
* Navient Stafford:
* 6.8% ($160.38)
* Firstmark Services:
* (variable) 6.25% ($7796.58)
* MyFedLoan Stafford:
* 6% ($2401.79)
* MyFedLoan Stafford:
* 5.6% ($2161.66)
* Navient:
* (variable) 4.25% ($47096.39)
* WellsFargo:
* 3.75% ($37475.13)

(Staffords are govt, all others are private. I'm not on any IBR.)

For further context, I make 3400 USD/mo, 2800 after rent.

Now that I'm under 100k in total balance, I should be able to consolidate with one lender. But, as you can see, I've got 3 loans left at 6.8% (govt loans) with relatively small balances. I should also note that my variable interest rate private loan with Firstmark Services increased from 6 to 6.25% this past month (Jan 2017).

What would you do, especially with interest rates likely to increase in the short term? Should I try and finish paying off the 3x6.8% loans as quickly as possible and then consolidate? Or should I consolidate now?

Thank you in advance for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,1098-T help,"im using taxact and it had me at receiving around $400 Fed/$100 State. i went to add my first 1098-T for the aid i received for Aug-dec of 2016 (aid is continuing for Jan-May of 2017) but the taxact program says that box 1/2 can be off. If i use what the my form has listed i lose my state refund. 

&amp;nbsp;

My box 2 on the form says $15 and my box 5 says $2908. During the semester i received the Board of Governor's Grant/waiver and the Pell grant. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was charged for registration, enrollment(per/unit), class fees, material fees, and other school fees which my BOG waiver didnt cover everything so i paid out of pocket about $45 for last semester and and $50 for the semester that started in Jan (paid in december)

&amp;nbsp;

for the pell grant, it was released to me in about 3 or 4 payments throughout the semester which basically didnt help with my books and school supplies because they dont release the first funds till a after the 1st school week is almost over. pretty much i had to beg for the money from people i knew and when i received the money from the grant i paid them back, it was embarrassing. for that semester i was enrolled in ""fast track"" classes where u take the class in half a semester so i had to buy more books than usual. the grant was spent on the following: school books (16.5 units), supplies including a backpack as I havent been in school for years, and a computer for my work as many of my assignments are computer based (going for a COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS) and there is no computer where i live and the school is not in walking distance (i dont have a car)


&amp;nbsp;
also via my school site i found this

X College will report the following as qualified tuition and related expenses to the IRS:


Enrollment fees

Non-resident tuition

Material fees

Note: For students whose tuition fees were waived by a high school waiver or Board of Governor's Grant, also known as ""BOG"", X College will only report material fees billed as qualified tuition and related expenses.

&amp;nbsp;

i am assuming the $15 is just the fees the BOG didnt cover that count as eligible and only the ones for last semester. is that all that can go in box 2?  

&amp;nbsp;

last year i received $1000 total refund. i work a min wage job that received new management who this year decided to cut everyone's hours so i picked up a 2nd job to be my main job and keep this job on the weekends. the new jobs had many problems that ended up with me not getting much hours. A family member reached out to me and got me some counseling from the college i am attending now. the counselor advised me to get back into school (been out for years because of problems) to earn some certs in the computer field so that i can get a better job and then i can continue on to get the COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS degree as all the cert classes are also classes required for the degree. i was approved for aid as i dont make much a year and registered as a full time student while still keeping the 1st job. Got my my w-2s and between the cut in hours and being a full time student i made about 1/2 of what i did last year. so i made less, am receiving a smaller refund and then the IRS is taking even more because i was approved for grants that were used to pay for school? that doesnt make sense to me and it feels like i am being punished for trying to better myself",finance

I most likely won't need the deferment or income-based repayment plan benefits that having a federal loan would provide. 2 other federal loans are at 3.4% and 1 is at 4.5%, so I was planning on leaving those alone unless the consensus says otherwise.

The housing and stock markets are interconnected in multiple ways. Major home builders’ shares are traded in the stock market.

The housing sector dips deep into the economy as furniture manufacturers, plumbers, electricians, landscapers and more are all dependent on housing. Housing starts and the stock market are both leading indicators of economic activity.

personalfinance,Frustrated with Credit Karma's Tax Center,"I've been a longtime Credit Karma user for their credit monitoring website, so this year I decided to use their tax software.  So far I've been incredibly disappointed with the service.  I've already submitted my (and my wife's) federal tax returns.  It was easy enough, and outside of owing a lot (our doing not Credit Karma's), it was a pleasant experience.  My frustration is with our state return (Georgia).  Since we used Credit Karma to prepare our federal returns we're basically stuck using them for the state return as well.  Other major websites, to my knowledge, won't let you file your state taxes with them unless you also file your federal return with them as well.  Also, as it has been in the past, the state return will cost a fee.

&amp;nbsp;

I continue to get an error on Credit Karma's website about how Georgia isn't accepting e-file at the moment.  This, of course, isn't true.  I contacted customer service twice.  My first attempt remains unanswered, and my second attempt the individual responding just directed me to the website's FAQ.  Literally, the only question I've had for them is, ""When will I be able to submit my Georgia tax returns (date), or will you not be offering Georgia as an option?""

&amp;nbsp;

Part of the frustration comes from Georgia being notoriously bad at handling tax returns.  In the past we've had to fight to prove we sent a payment, or when we've had a refund it's taken weeks (one time months) to get the check.  Georgia's own tax website strongly recommends e-file over paper, likely due to how poorly they've handled mailed-in forms in the past.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm looking for advice here since I'm not sure what to do.  Credit Karma won't get me any answers, Georgia prefers I e-file, and websites like TurboTax (again, last I checked), won't let me submit just my state taxes without also doing my federal return with them as well.  **Needless to say, I'm very close to swearing off Credit Karma entirely and strongly recommending friends and family do the same.**  Any help?",finance

personalfinance,Credit card payoff advice,"I've been a USA student and waiter at a restaurant for a long time. I'm the last two years I was working the restaurant and going to school about 70 hours a week and I've had pretty low income. To be clear, I've never had much income and I've recently moved into free housing for a few years while a family member is out of country. During my time at my previous apartment, I've been told to grow my credit opening a credit card. This started with a secured card in 2014, then two credit cards, with all three: $500, $6,000 and $2000 limits. In a few weeks I'll receive $2600 in tax return. 

With my new job as a engineering designer, no more housing costs,  and eminent graduation, I'll be able to pay off all of it by April. Before then, I am wondering if I should pay off the $2k card below some amount then pay towards the larger debt on the $6k card. Both cards are near their limits, the $500 card is at $120 balance. All have similar 20% yearly interest. 

Would it be better to pay off the smaller card first then the larger card, or pay the smaller card to 30% and work on the larger debt? 

Thoughts? 

After this I plan on getting rid of my loan on my car so I can afford to pay off my student loans, month to month, without getting a long term loan to consolidate the $35k or so. A coworker (an engineer) has more student loan debt and a 120k house and a new car and he struggles to afford it, I don't want to find myself struggling to buy a home. The plan to help with that is paying off smaller debt asap, building up to the student debt while making minimums on all others. 

I appreciate that my student loans have a low interest rate in general, and that investing may outweigh the interest on those loans. Any insight on getting more than 6% ror? I spend a lot of time looking at news for companies to see how I might one day invest. If I had any money, I would have invested in things like tesla in 2010, and AMD last year under $3 a share. It seems these investments would have been worthwhile. 

I have a 401k started for savings up to the maximum match. 

I have offers for jobs, including at my employer, so I'm not worried about not getting a job after school. 

Edit1: so based on my high utilization and low credit rating I'll waste too much time trying to juggle in another card. I likely don't qualify for the chase slate, and I would pay too much transfer fee for another card. A better path seems to be using my tax return to reduce my utilization. This may increase my credit score over the next two months. By that time I'll have almost zeroized the cards and it won't matter. Thanks for the advice, all.",finance

I have moderate/good credit, 44k in Student Loan debt, and ~10k in car loan debt.

Currently I'm living in a family friend's house for $400/mo. with no lease (I mention this only because there wouldn't be any buyout for breaking a lease). I pay $100/mo. on my federal Student Loan and my private student loan is on deferment while I'm in school.

My parents recently approached me with the opportunity to buy a house with their help. They said that they'd cosign the mortgage (15yr fixed rate FHA) and pay the down payment (looking at ~3.5%) to get me started. They would leave maintenance and the rest of the responsibilities to me. The house is being sold by another close family friend (who is a realtor and had her father living in it until he needed to move to a nursing home) so we know it's in good shape. It's estimated to cost 210k but they're willing to sell it for 200k. I'm estimating that a mortgage would cost between $1100-$1300. It's a 3bed/2bath ranch style house in a growing community with high ranked schools. No HOA. 

The plan upon purchase would involve myself and two other roommates (of whom I've spoken to already as they are friends of mine) moving in. As the owner, I'd charge the two roommates $750-$850 a piece and I'd pay for my portion of the utilities.

Those who think stocks and bonds are ""supposed to"" move inversely and be diversifiers may not realize that that it is not necessarily the natural order of things. The chart starts in only the late 1980s. The correlations were even more positive in the 1970s.

**Edit:** For comparison here is the Fed policy rate:

**Edit 2:** Some people have asked for a longer period. Here are the stock-bond correlations from around 1900. (Note: the earlier chart above shows return correlations. The last one shows correlations of yield changes and stock returns so flip the chart). 

http://imgur.com/a/mMkLa

**TL;DR:** Stock-bond returns exhibit negative correlations over relatively short periods in the prior data, i.e. in the early part of the Great Depression and from the mid-1950s to 1960s. The period of negative correlations after the financial crisis is quite unusual in how long it's lasted, but the correlation now seems to be rising.",finance

personalfinance,"Complicated scenarios for new construction, family business, and borrowing from MIL","My husband and I are planning to build a house by his family homebuilding business. The cost of the house will be $325,000 and we have 20% saved up. If we decide to go with the construction loan route, we will pay very high interest for the duration of construction period (usually 12% for 6 months or so), and then roll the mortgage into a conventional mortgage once the house is built. To avoid paying the 12% interest for the first 6 months, my mother in law offered to lend us the money with a 4% interest rate. We are not sure what the best way is to handle this transaction. We plan to hire a lawyer to handle the transaction, but we would like to have an idea on what we want first before we talk to a lawyer.

Here are a couple of scenarios we thought might be possible.

- Scenario #1

MIL would lend us $325K and we will have a legal contract between us on repayment terms, the house will be built with this money so it will be in our names, and then we will get a cash out mortgage on the house and pay her back her loan plus the agreed on interest. In this scenario, will the house get re-assessed for property taxes when we apply for a cash out mortgage? We suspect the house to value for way more than $325K and we would like to avoid paying more taxes. Is there a way to avoid that?

- Scenario #2

MIL would give the $325K to their family homebuilding business and the company will build the house to our specifications. In 6 months when the house is built, the company will sell us the house for $325K which we will get a mortgage on that will be paid to the company. MIL will then take her money out of the business and pay herself back and we will pay her the interest directly.
Can you poke holes in both scenarios? Remind us of things we did not consider, especially with taxes.

I had 2 large moves, a job that paid me next to nothing, and I had left a 10 year long relationship. I had nothing when getting back on my feet, and used my credit card for almost everything. My credit score was in the excellent category of 750 2 weeks ago. It just dropped 30 points because I am utilizing 65% of my credit. 

3 credit cards, one personal loan, and student loans in deferment. 

* Personal loan balance $8,864.17. Interest rate 6.24% this is through my credit union.
* Credit card 1: Balance $2,233.05. Limit $9,000. 10.49% interest – This is also through my credit union. 
* Credit card 2: Chase Amazon credit card, balance $847.90. Interest 22.74% - limit $4,000.00
* Credit card 3: Chase Disney Rewards card. Balance $2,655.87  interest 16.24% - limit $4,000
* Student Loan: $17,431.42 – in deferment
* $1000 in a savings account. I had $0 until I put in my tax refund. 


Now, after just having my yearly review and receiving an unexpectedly low increase, I am panicked. I went from $16 an hour with a 3% increase starting next week. 



After taxes, I take home $897 every 2 weeks. My budget is as follows:


* Rent: $475, utilities included. This is a family friend’s apartment. I don’t know how long this will last. 

* Car lease: $290 – got stuck with my old lease. Went over miles due a move and couldn’t afford to pay it out.

* Car insurance: $130. That includes life and renters. I am canceling the life insurance portion next cycle.
 
* 401K: I contribute 2% and my company matches it 100%. 

* Personal Loan: $180 a month. This was to pay off an old medical debt/credit card debt. 

* Gas for my car $60 a month

* Netflix: $10

* Internet: $60

* Gym: $20. This goes away after February

* Vet payment plan: $40, going down to $30 in April

* Credit cards: It varies, I usually pay the minimal balance each month because it’s all I can afford. 

* Groceries: Varies. I have specific dietary requirements. Usually around $200-$250 a month. 

* Extras: Almost nonexistent. I don’t drink or smoke, I rarely go out to restaurants and I don’t eat fast food.
 
* Student Loans: Currently in deferment, won’t last forever. 

* Cell phone – Dad is taking some pity on me while I try to get my feet back under me and is taking care of it on a family plan. It won’t last forever. 

I have read up on the snowball method for paying off my cards, but I can’t afford more than the minimum balance on any of them. I often run out of money if a majority of my bills fall in one pay period and I am forced to use a credit card. This seems like a never ending cycle. 

I want to transfer my credit card balances to a (promotional) no interested credit card. However, when I attempted to do this once before, the limit was not enough to even transfer half of my balances. How do I avoid applying for cards that I won’t end up being able to use? 

Could someone help me maybe see something I am missing?",finance
personalfinance,Should I cancel my high APR % Cap. One credit card?,"I am a college student (23) and have a very low income ($10k/year). I got a refund check in the mail, and I would like to pay off my two credit cards (Discover and Cap One), but I am wondering if I ought to cancel the Capital One. 

**Discover:**
I opened up a Discover card in Spring 2014 (March?) and have a $1,050.   I used it twice to pay for summer classes and make my minimum payments on time, and have maxed it out twice to afford summer classes.  So the balance on the card has fluctuated from 0, to mid 300's, up to the max amount, gradually paid down in a year, to being maxed out again.  It is my highest credit limit and technically longest account, but only by a couple months.  Overall, I like the benefits (they have an NHL affiliation, Amazon benefits, etc.)  The APR % is 20.4%.  Like I said, it's maxed out fully currently.


**Capital One:**
I opened up this card a few months later.  The limit is $400.  The APR % is 25%.  It's got the Cashback bonus and whatever.  Right now I have 390.22/400 on it.

Anyway, I really wanna start being more financially accountable for myself, starting with my credit score (FICO has it at a 659.)  In the future, I'll be moving out or having to take out small loans here and there, and already have student debt (nothing too bad) but I really need to get my act together cos I know being able to rent or lease property depends on credit history sometimes and what have you.

I have been searching on this subreddit and elsewhere and it seems that canceling a card will hurt you if you don't have a long credit history.  I don't think nearly 3 years is too substantial, but the Cap One card is a really low limit and high interest rate.  Do I just attach a $20 monthly subscription to it and set up automatic payments and keep it alive for the sake of credit history?  Or do I pay it off and cancel?

Also I know you're not *supposed* to pay credit balances off all at once but I have a terrible spending habit so I'd rather just pay them off and not let the extra money sit around for myself to be irresponsible with.  Unless I would reap more benefit by paying these off more gradually...  I'd just like to minimize my chances of impulsive credit buys, build my credit score, and let go of credit cards that are not a benefit to me.  So...

To note, my only monthly bills outside of credit cards, is a 21.39$ charge for Adobe and maybe 6$ for Spotify.


* Do I cancel Capital One?
* Can I pay off both cards in full and still receive a substantial rise in my credit score?  Or do I pay them off little by little, even if I have the money now?",finance
personalfinance,"Looking for help, should I sell my car?","I hope all is well. I am a 26 yr old who has been lurking around PF for 2 years now. During this time, I have been able to get rid of 15k in CC debt, buy a house, and get my CC score into the high 700s all due to PF. I currently have a 2014 Honda Civic EX-L that was purchased after my 2006 Civic's engine cracked. Looking back, I should have just had the car fixed and continued driving the vehicle. I understand the mistake and this was before I got my finances in order and when I had significant CC debt. I purchased the Civic with around 4k down and received an interest rate of 7.99. After a year or two of turning my finances around, I was able to refinance the car at around 2% with my local credit union. I currently owe around 12k on the vehicle which is fairly close to what KBB lists for its value (50K miles).   

My mother has recently inherited a newer car and I may have the ability to buy/receive for free her 2007 Honda Civic LX with 115k miles. This civic has a salvage title and was rebuilt. She has had the car now for 50k - ish miles.

I am on track to have my car paid for in 2 years (paying around 500) a month. Would it be beneficial to keep the car and run it into the ground (250k additional miles) or sell the car to break even.  

I make around 70k, have 30k in student loans, 12k in emergency fund. I am currently putting 1400+ a month into my student loans. If I were to get rid of the car, I would most likely put that 500 payment into the loans as well.The current payment is not difficult to make, but the idea of paying off these student loans in less than 2 years excites me.  

I understand my finances aren't completely where they need to be, but they have came a long way and I am still in the process of righting the ship.

They have all been accumulating interest since those dates. I just made my first payment today (6 months since I graduated). I paid 400 for the first one, 400 for the second, and 200 for the third. My minimum payment due for all 3 was $588. I don’t know if I should consolidate them all into one loan? Or if I should try and pay the first one off faster or the one with the highest interest rate off first? I know nothing about loans really so I could use some advice.

personalfinance,I need some tips on negotiating a lower CC interest rate.,"Ok, so my promotional period with my Citi DCB card is closing in a couple days. I've spoken with the representatives and they said the interest rate will be around 21%. I'm like no.... I don't usually carry a balance anyhow, but there is no way I'm letting it be that high. I have two older visa accounts with 11 and 13% that have a revolving bill on each to keep them active but they are otherwise unused and have no balance. My latest credit score is 805.

Are there any key things I can say to them to convince them to give me a better rate? To me it's just the principle of having such a high interest rate with good credit.

And if it matters the credit limit on the visas are 18.5K each and 20K on the Citi card.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) I recently graduated and have begun paying off all my student debts. How should I approach it?,"Hi r/personalfinance! I graduated from school last June and started working in a healthcare profession. I'm not salaried but my yearly income will likely be between $80,000-90,000. I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't very smart with my money while in school and it's started to come back to bite me. My main bulk of debt is $120,000 in a line of credit, but I also have ~$10,000 in student loans and I owe my mom ~$10,000 as well. Luckily I have no credit card debt because I pay it off every month. The (fixed) interest rate of the LoC is prime, which is 2.70% IIRC. Automatic payments on the LoC are $900 a month (covering interest and a payment). The automatic payments on the student loan are much smaller (~$100 a month) but the interest rate is higher and is floating (at ~5.70% right now). My take home is about $7,000 a month. Rent is $1,250, phone $100, critical illness/disability insurance $180. Those are all my big monthly payments. I'm wondering how I should go about paying off my debts. I'm paying my mom $500 a month so I'll have paid her back within a year. I'm thinking of paying of the student loans first because it has a higher interest rate; I should be able to allocate $500 a month to the student loans and have those paid off in about a year as well. The big beast is the line of credit. With minimum payments it would be paid off in about 14 years but obviously I want it gone before that. How much of my monthly income should I be putting towards it? I also currently don't have any savings - should I start an emergency fund with a couple months worth of pay first and then focus on paying off the LoC?

personalfinance,Student Loan PSLF for doctors: what are the employment requirements?,"I am a doctor currently in a 4-year medical residency program working for a major hospital (non-profit). I am trying to figure out what the employment requirements are to maintain PSLF. (My 4 years in residence counts so I only need 6 more).


The [Federal Student Loan website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-employment) lists eligible employment as:
&gt;
- Government organizations at any level (federal, state, local, or tribal)
- Not-for-profit organizations that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
- **Other types of not-for-profit organizations that provide certain types of qualifying public services**

Obviously the first two are straightforward, but many doctors are actually employed by a smaller practice group, not the hospital itself. So the question is do some of those practices count? I.e. how do I figure out whether I am likely to fall into that 3rd category? I can't find anywhere on the website anything more specific about ""qualifying public services"", or what it even means to be a ""not-for-profit organization"" but not tax-exempt.

[Student Loan Hero has a page about loans for doctors](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/ultimate-student-loan-repayment-guide-for-doctors/) which only has this vague and slightly different statement to say about it:

&gt; Public service includes full-time employment by a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit or public institution (which many hospitals are). **It also includes working in areas that are underserved or have a high need for medical professionals.**

Is there any authoritative way of determining whether an employer will qualify me for PSLF?",finance
personalfinance,"$30k in credit card debt, $15K on car loan. Odds of coming after me if I stop paying CCs?","My question here is, if I default on my credit cards, but still make my car payment, what are the chances of being s*u*e*d? Can they come after the car with a co-signer on it even though money is still owed on the car? I don't want to put the co-signer's credit at risk for my problems, I can find a way to survive, pay my car payment, and that's it. The largest balance is $6k, some balances $3-$4k, other lower.

If you want to know the details of what has happened to me read below.

Before you flame, I have never missed a payment in my life on any debt I have. I was irresponsible when I was younger with CCs, and have been paying the price. I also last year made a huge effort last year being self employed to make as much money as possible to get out. I paid thousands of dollars back. This is after years of being unemployed and racking up more debt getting by. So, last year as things were going great and I was making progress, I came down with a health disorder that is disabling, it makes me working my previous job impossible, and other jobs difficult, since at times when I get spells I need to lay down and relax until it passes. It literally interrupted my entire life. Since November I have used the last bit of my cash, nothing left. Disability told me since I did not pay into elective coverage while self employed, there is nothing there for me. My only shot would be federal social security disability, which I will consult a lawyer about today. So now I am looking at a situation where I have never missed a payment in my life, but the money simply isn't there for everything. I would love to pay all of my debts, I believe in doing so, but its just not there right now. The only thing that makes me slightly not feel bad, is that I have paid so much interest to these companies, they aren't really losing anything on me if I don't pay them. I hate to look at it that way, but it is the only way I can live with myself not paying what I agreed to pay, it is a big deal to me to honor my commitments and I hate this situation. I in a stage in my life where I will be starting a family with my soon to be wife within the next 10 years. Before we get married I would sign papers so my debt will not go to her, I can contribute cash to our family, she has a good job and is in a great place financially, it is me who now has the issues. My brother years ago stopped paying his bills, he got harassed, but ignored it and nothing ever came from it. It isn't what I want to do, but will I get sued for just abandoning the credit cards? I don't mind living off cash for 7 years, I really just don't know how to survive and pay all of this back at the same time, especially coming down with this ridiculous health situation that disrupted my life. Trying to be a grown up didn't work for me, trying to salvage parts of my life.",finance

I have pretty poor credit anyway due to high student loans and several months of late payments around 3 years ago but I've been working really hard to pay these off (avalanche method) and have fully paid off my highest rate loan, and made a significant dent in the second highest, only minimum payments on my lowest interest rate. Should I just wait until this debt that is in collections falls off the report in 3 years? I don't foresee my credit improving much before that time anyway. However, if I really do owe this debt then I want to pay it, which brings me to my next questions.

1.) Why is this only showing up on Trans Union and not the other two? Even though I don't recognize it, I don't doubt that I might owe this debt as it's from the university system I attended. 

2.) Any idea why this collection agency hasn't tried to contact me? All my information is up to date and I am easily reachable.

3.) Finally, how can I find out which collection agency it is? Should I call the original debt holder and try to find out that way? I'm sorry if this has been addressed previously, I tried searching and couldn't find anything. 

Thank you very much for your time and any advice you have for me.",finance
personalfinance,I don't understand why my Federal return is so small.,"Apologies for the long post, but me and my spouse are just extremely frustrated with finding out that we are getting back a measly $116 on our federal tax return this year. I'm going to detail our income this year and what was withheld in hopes that someone can at least explain why this has happened. 

Married filing jointly.

Job A) Wages Earned : 1192.80
             Fed income tax withheld : 49.90

Job B) Wages Earned : 3388.48
             Fed income tax withheld : 206.51

Job C) Wages Earned : 10,862:

Job D) Wages Earned : 1964.00

financialindependence,advice requested - furloughing work in prime earning years.,"I'm trying to follow the recommended format from the FAQ, so...

Life Situation: married, 2 kids (1 and 3), living in US.

FIRE Progress: I could RE now assuming I found some meaningful/fun work that could supplement our income with 20k per year.  Otherwise, I'm probably 5-10 years away. 

Gross Salary/Wages: 114k base, 5-12k in potential bonus

Yearly Savings Amounts: total net worth is $1.17 million (80% of it is in 401k and Roth IRA, about 130k liquid).  yearly savings is a bit tough to figure out right now.  maybe about 30k per year.  

Other Ordinary Income: none

Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation: none

Current expenses: 

  Assumptions are... 
  1) expenses on a typical year without major surprises ($52,250.00)
  2) we hold 'separate' money on the side ($168k?) to pay off the mortgage on day 1 of retirement if needed.
  3) assume an extra 15k needed for family health insurance premiums per year.
  4) assume some prudent assumptions of additional expenses ($4,300) in various areas to cover things tat just seem to break or go wrong each year.
  5) assume an additional $5000 for a nice family vacation each year.
 
So my 'full' FI number is $1,635,781.75.  But I could quit my job now to do more meaningful work (if I found out what that would be) as long as it paid about 20k/yr.  

Expected ER expenses: same as current expenses listed above.

Assets: 130k cash, almost all the remaining 1.17 million net worth is in 100% stock allocation in vanguard index funds.  

Liabilities: 168k 15 yr fixed mortgage at 2.75% interest rate.

Specific Question(s): 

What are some things I should consider that could happen (both the unexpected bad and unexpected good) if I decide to furlough my career in my peak earning years (i.e. now) to stay home with my wife and kids rather than delaying my departure from work until years later when the best times for a young family are over?  

For example, the good i'd hope to see happening in my first year off are:
1. I'd spend some great quality time with the kids that are growing so quickly
2. I'd concentrate a LOT more on my health and exercise (i'd have time to swim)
3. I'd get a lot of projects done around the house. 
4. I'd have time to be there for friends and visit with the people I care about.  

After the first year, ideally i'd uncover (with my ample 'thinking time') a passion project or some type of work I wouldn't mind doing rather than going back to the industry I never liked. 

The bad is that some things could go very wrong and I would have a lot of trouble getting back into any market anywhere near my current earning level.

personalfinance,"Help! Car Dealer Lied to bank, bank has now declined my loan, I have had the car for two weeks and now w/ NO LOAN on it.","Hello! I need help/advice to see what is my best option or what to do... This is my 2nd car purchase, I haven't had many car buying experiences much less one like this.


Two weeks ago I purchased a used 2014 Tundra. Although I had my own financing, the dealer insisted they could beat the interest rate by more than half to 2.25%. I didn't care for running my credit again, but they insisted, I wasn't sure about it but we went ahead and they gave me a 2.25% with a local credit union. Purchased the car, came home. (Home is 2 hours away from the dealer)


Fast forward to yesterday, the Credit Union called to interview me and verify some of the information the dealer gave them. 

They found out that the information the bank gave them was false, and I never stated it. The dealer told the credit union that I attend church in the county.

The credit union only works with people who work/live/worship in certain counties of FL and I neither work nor live in that county, so the bank told them I attended church in the county in hopes that this would get me the loan.


The credit union thought this was odd and reached out to me to verify that I went to church 2 hours away from where my home address and work address is.  I was confused, thinking they had the wrong person, and told them no, for sure I don't attend church in Naples. They were not happy and apologized  to me but couldn't give me the loan and the manager stated they will actually terminate their relationship with this dealership due to this fraud and asked for names and info for their report.


I called the Dealer and spoke to the finance guy that helped(or not) me.. they asked what I told the CU and I told them what happened(minus the fact that they would be terminating the account). The finance manager needless to say was frustrated and sighed, I think in part that he forgot to tell me to LIE, and that now the bank CANCELLED the loan and I now have a car in my possession without A LOAN.


I was upset that they lied, and gave false information, and didn't tell me about any of these requirements that were needed to use that bank. Now my bank isn't matching the rate (although I still have access to the loan), but at twice the interest rate.



I am blown away that this dealership went that low to get a measly $2000 from a loan, and I am quite frustrated, now the other bank is asking me for statements to add to their reports, My other car was totaled about 3 weeks ago by my neighbor in my driveway(reason for new truck) and my wife is 9 months pregnant. This is a headache and stressful. 
I don't have time for this, so I'm asking for advice. 


A buddy said this might work in my favor, and I might be able to maybe get a lower price or something.... I dont know. Any thoughts and or advice would be great. Not sure if any of this warrants a lawyer, writing them a letter to make this right? 

basically I have a car with no loan and the bank is just about freaking out trying to cover up this and apologize and trying to get my other (loan) banks info but to at a much higher rate! Which is a load of crap because we agreed to a 2.25% and on top of that they lied, and committed fraud on my behalf to secure a loan. 

I think they are scared their boss will find out, unless they are already aware of this. But this is really big dealership! 

Thank you in advance for your time!

My SO (fiancee) has quite a bit of student debt and I'm in a position to help with the payments. I'm trying to figure out the best way to allocate these funds.  Here are the loans all laid out:


#Federal (on IBR)

Amount | Rate | Min Payment /mo
---|---|----
$3.5k | 6.8% | $3
$5.5k | 5.6% | $4
$22.2k | 6.8% | $20

$12.3k | 10.25% | $132
$15.4k | 11.25% | $175
$13.3k | 3.5%(v) | $97
$12.2k | 8.29% | $162
$10.4k | 7.0% | $118

#Total
Amount | Min Payment /mo
---|----
$95k | $712


Yeah, its a lot, and the rates are not good either. My SO is paying the minimum, and starting this month I'm going to start helping out by providing an extra $1,000.

#Questions  

- The crux of my problem is, do we attack the federal loans first or the 11.25% loan? The federal loans are growing because they are on IBR, but the 11.25% loan seems like public enemy #1. Should we first make additional payments on the federal loans to prevent their growth (+$327 based on 10 year payoff if my math is right) and then use the remaining $673 on the 11.25% loan? Or should we just throw the entire $1,000 at the 11.25% loan?

- I'm really confused by how the balance is calculated on the 11.25% loan.  According to the website the original amount is $13k, but the current balance is $15.4k.  The website says this 'includes the outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest calculated out to the good through date, and outstanding late fees'. My SO says it was never deferred and there was never a missed payment, I don't understand how the total has gone _up_. Maybe I don't understand how loans work but I thought if you at least pay the minimum it will go _down_ a tiny bit.  Any ideas?

- Any other suggestions? Things I'm overlooking?",finance

I am doing my best to adult up. I have read all of the great content linked in the sidebar. I have a good idea of what I need to do. I am currently in the process of formulating a budget, but I have some questions on the specifics

#1: What are all the taxes/deductions that will be taken from my salary?

According to [this](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes):  with the parameters $108k, Seattle, and Single, it looks like my take home after taxes will be somewhere around $79,556 a year. My monthly paycheck deductions for insurance will be around $34 a month taken out for Medical (more on this in a bit), Dental, and Vision.

That puts my take home at $79,522 factoring in federal income tax and insurance deductions. Is there anything else that is automatically deducted from this amount? Is this an accurate amount I should be basing my budget on? 

#2: How much money should I be putting in a 401k?

I am eligible for 401k, but I have just recently learned what it is so I'm not sure what I should do. It seems like money isn't automatically being taken from my salary and put there, but it's a good idea for me to put money in it on my own volition. The document says I can contribute 1%-90% of my eligible pay on a pre-tax basis, a Roth 401k after-tax basis, or both, and that my company matches up to 2% of my total eligible pay. 

I'm honestly not sure what to make of this. How much money should I be putting in here? It says the limit is $18k a year. Should I be shooting for that? Should do I pre-tax or post-tax or both??? So many options :(

#3: What's the verdict on Health Savings Accounts?

After looking over the 4 medical insurance plans, the Health Savings Plan with a Health Savings Account seemed like the best one to me(I was also influenced by [this](http://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/)). 

The deductible is $1500 which is high. After you pay the deductible, you pay 10% in network and 30% out of network. The good thing is the HSA which I can put money in to reduce my taxable income. My company will also add some money and if I ever leave the company I take the HSA with me. The monthly paycheck contributions for the HSP are only $25 for single me + $7.00(Dental) and $2.00(Vision) which makes the $34 a month I mentioned earlier. 

There are other insurance plans with lower deductibles, but they require higher monthly contributions. Is getting the lowest deductible most important? My mother seems to think so, but to me the HSP seems like the most beneficial. Also, can I have both an HSA and a 401k?


#4: What percentage of my salary should go to living arrangements? 

Rent. My biggest concern right now. Since I am moving to a new city I need to find a place to live ASAP and I'm not sure what I can afford. From the sidebar I learned I should spend no more than 30% of my income on rent. I'm unclear if this percentage applies to my total salary ($108k) or salary after deductions (~$80k)?  Assuming it's the latter, I should be paying no more than $2000 a month. But what should that $2000 be covering? Rent + utilities, internet, food, etc? Or just rent by itself and that other stuff is separate in the budget?

&amp;nbsp;



I think that is all the questions that I have for you all. Sorry for the bombardment, but I just want to be **sure** when taking these very important steps in my life. I'm finally making real money and I don't want to let it go to waste, like all the money I've made before now.

personalfinance,Need help with 2017 Tax Planning! Should I save or pay down debt?,"I am messing with my 2017 tax planning and I have a question that I hope PF can help with. My taxable income will be 80.5K (post current 401k contributions) this year with bonuses and I am currently in the process of aggressively paying down 30-35k in student loans. My employer currently has a tuition reimbursement plan in place, but we are unsure on how many more years they will continue to cover 85% reimbursement. I have read the reimbursement plan many times and I am sure that the reimbursement will not be considered as taxable income as the degree will be a MBA.  

Taking the above into account, I am at a roadblock. I will have qualified education expenses in the current year, but my income precludes me from any tax credits and currently excludes me from the student interest deduction/qualified education expense deductions. To be able to take advantage of the student loan interest deduction and education expense deduction, I will need to have my MAGI under 80k. The student loan interest deduction is phased out over 65k, but I will still be able to take advantage of a portion of the deduction if I reduce my taxable income; roughly a third if my income gets down to 75k).  

I am currently contributing 6% to my 401k to receive my employer's match and all excess money in my budget is going to student loans with an average interest rate of say 5%.  

Would it be smart to contribute say 10% instead of 6% to ensure I am under the 80k MAGI threshold instead of putting that extra money to the guaranteed return of 5% (student loan rate). I would expect the return on my 401k to be above 7% but we know this is not guaranteed. I do know I will save roughly 600 in taxes due to the deductions and another 750 in taxes due to increased 401k contributions.  

TDLR; Should I increase traditional 401k contributions to reduce my MAGI in order to qualify for tax deductions instead of putting said contributions towards student loans? Am I overthinking this? Am I missing something?

EDIT: My budget is pretty fine tuned and it would be tough to cut misc. expenses to increase my contributions. No cable, cell phone at 45, etc. I did post yesterday about potentially getting rid of a car payment and that could open up some money.  

EDIT 2: I am getting married in 2018 and this will help a lot when it comes to tax thresholds.",finance
personalfinance,Exempted myself from paying federal taxes by mistake while on an internship and now I owe money. What should I do?,"So I spent this past summer interning with a large company. Before I started, I had to fill out a W-4 (first time I had ever done so), so I was a bit confused and misunderstood some of the things I had to fill out, one of those things being what exempt vs not exempt means. My confusion led to me exempting myself and now I owe money.

Because I am still a college student and receive help from my parents, I have the option of filing as dependent or independent. From my understanding, filing as dependent exempts my parents from paying a portion of their taxes. Would this include the taxes that I also owe? Or those taxes wouldn't be included? Would it be a better idea to just file independent?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I've learned my lesson and I will definitely understand everything on a W-4 before submitting it to an employer.

personalfinance,"Just finished making my household budget, looking for comments/suggestions and people to tell me that I am totally wrong.","A screenshot of my budget spreadsheet can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/LYBdJ).

A bit of background:

I (23/Pennsylvania) am currently living at home with my parents while I wait for my SO to finish student teaching, with the intention of getting a place together after graduation.  I wanted to have a budget in place for us so that, when we do move in together, we have a good hold on our finances and are actually contributing to savings.  I currently have about $5,000 in a savings account/emergency fund and about $2,000 in my IRA, but aside form that, neither of us really has any assets.  I make $14/hr and $21/hr overtime, however, during the summer I'll regularly work ~60hr/wk.  I am pretty low on the totem pole at work,  so my wage will definitely increase over time.  I also get paid $0.50/mile and do quite a bit of driving for work.



Some notes on the spreadsheet:

-$200/mo for T&amp;E was a very conservative estimate. That will sometimes be as high as $8-900/mo due to mileage, but obviously the amount spent on gas will be variable as well.

-My SO's annual salary was estimated based on the low end of the [BLS] (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes252052.htm) stats for her profession and region

-The ""Hyundai Loan"" was co-signed with my dad so I got a good APR on it.  I paid $2,000 for the down payment, and am about to make my fourth $250 payment.  The amount shown in the spreadsheet is the total financed amount, before any payments were made.

-The ""Africa Loan"" is a $7,000 personal loan I got from my dad.  We didn't establish repayment terms; he basically told me to pay what I could.  I'd rather not drop below $200/mo. He doesn't need the money, it was more of a ""teaching responsibility"" kind of thing.

-My SO has a federal school loan but didn't know any of the details except that it was ""like $20,000 or something"", we'll work on that

-Rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in my area is generally $600-1,100/mo.

-Utilities were a guess

-Auto insurance for my car is $650 biannually, my SO's parents pay for everything with her car aside from gas


I am looking for any feedback you are willing to give.  Were my estimates reasonable? Am I overlooking anything? Any advice for a young couple just getting on their feet?

personalfinance,Is it worth it to pay off debt early with an interest rate lower than inflation?,"Now this is a purely theoretical question, as this is really unlikely to happen.  And even if it did, it would probably be better to get rid of the debt anyway in case you lose your income later on.  But for the sake of discussion, let's imagine you have a 10k debt at 1.5%.  The inflation rate is 2% and your income rises with inflation.  

Now if you chose to put off paying the debt or payed only minimum payments, the amount of dollars you owe would go up, but the value of the debt as a proportion of your income would go down.  So would the purchasing power of the money you owe. So is this logic correct, in a perfect world where you don't have to worry about losing your income?",finance

2. How much should I pay down the student loan debt/interest? Would you recommend setting up a monthly payment?

3. Is the 6% too little to save in the 401k? I am scheduled to increase it a percent a year I believe.

4. How much more aggressively should I be saving for an EM fund, or paying down my debt?

personalfinance,President Trump Signs Executive Order Delaying Labor Department Fiduciary Rule,"# President Trump Signs Executive Order Delaying Labor Department Fiduciary Rule

Hi all.  To discuss the effect on individual investors of the executive order that was signed today, we have created this megathread. **Please note that our rules on politics are still in place and political soapboxing and other off-topic comments will still be removed.**  This thread is meant to offer a place to discuss the financial impacts of the ruling as well as any financial steps you may want to consider going forward.

Here's what we know:

- President Trump signed an executive order which *delays* the implementation of the Labor Department's fiduciary rule which still had not gone into effect. The fiduciary rule required financial advisers to act in the best interest of clients and to disclose any conflicts of interest. Previously scheduled to go into effect in April 2017, its implementation date is now unclear.

- A second action of the executive order directs the secretary of the Treasury to consult regulatory agencies and report to Trump about what can be done to eliminate the ""overreaching"" aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a federal law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

personalfinance,"In credit building mode, my ex surrendered the car I was cosigned on and at a time when everything was completely free and clear.","I've been coming here for awhile to observe and learn over time.  /r/personalfinance is absolutely a valuable resource and I am very proud of everyone here, always.  You, on the other hand, will not be so proud of me.

I was the cosignee on a vehicle, which is something you should never ever do kids.  NEVER.  Just wanted to restate that so you know that I am absolutely serious.  I let my ex take the car when I had ended our relationship, and have had to pick up the bill over the last year+ to help her balance the payments.  Most recently I paid half of of the monthly payment in both December and January, per an agreement that we had in which I would pay half the car payment and give her $1,000 out of my tax returns to lower the equity to where she needed to refinance and get me off of the loan.  This was only a textual agreement, that shit has no stick.  Now let's talk about how my mistake and my mess really, really requires some help here and I do need some good understanding here.  This is monumental for me, and not in any way is it a good thing.

While unique and challenging as my come up may have been, and the gigantic, long lasting, mistakes that I have made in the mess of it all... I am still, on the surface, another story of another person who went to community college on federal funding loans, was irresponsible with the loans and the schooling, moved around-- created debts with phone companies and cable giants and the sort.  Vet bills, hospital bills, the list is actually pretty long...

These are all things that I have smashed past with a job that I humbly received in 2015, which has since changed my life.  I have a salaried + commission job and it has offered me the opportunity to pay back ALL of those terrible debts, in full.  I wanted no misunderstanding on anyone's part in my financial future, I had cleansed my past and did so in complete full.  I had begun checking Credit Karma every Friday to monitor my credit and watch each one of those scabs fall off.  I had finally plateaued... and was ready to come here to ask for assistance on what the next move would be, when this BOMB was dropped on me.

So now I'm before you with the mother of all personal finance blunders...

I logged on to Credit Karma today to see my credit has dropped 79 points.  From 610s to the 530s.  All of my debts (except student loans I pay monthly on and the auto loan) have been off of my credit for a couple of months now.  I have a secured credit card I am using to build up more of a ""credit card"" type history to further my opportunities on more accounts to ultimately build credit further.  So why the drop?

The auto loan shows as closed.  I remember the refinance talk and I am completely full of glee---- distraught because of the impact, but hey that part of the life I figure is GONE.... she did it!!!!

Later in the day today I started getting skeptical... browsed pf and found some not so palatable stories.  Each different from my own though, so I still need you on this one.  What she actually did was surrendered the car.  Back on 1/13 no less.... yup.  Repossession, now on my credit report for 7 years.  At the most important time in my life... after all of my young 20's mistakes have been scrubbed off of my report.  At the age of 31, credit building, good job, optimistic future, am now hit with a black mark on my credit report.  Let me just reiterate something which I am sure won't be seen on time but only after the fact, much like my mistake, do not cosign on shit.  

I wanted to build my credit up for a few months and apply for a credit card in May.  Maybe buy a PC with a credit card and pay it back with a commission check and just have the account open.  My intention was to do this with several purchases.  With this setback, what are my options?  When/what should I go for to get the best results, long term.

As far as the car goes, I have the option to go get the car and then have the account reinstated... but I don't need the car.  I am going to be stuck with the debt regardless and will have the mark on my report regardless from what I've gathered.  If I don't need the car, and I have the mark, and the debt is owed... scratch that let me just ask, what is my best course of action here?  

The debt owed is $13,000 - whatever they sell it for at an auction...  she banged up the car pretty bad last I seen it.  We will be lucky to get $1,000 at an auction.

I want that taken care of in the fastest and most efficient and possible way to reflect on my credit.  I will eat everything with rice-- to budget.  I have to wait 7 years for my past to be removed from me but I want to do whatever I can in the meantime to mitigate this impact.  Will it be possible for me to apply for a credit card in my current situation?  Is letting the car go and paying the loan off the best course of action for me?  Since this is entirely one sided and I'm of the assumption that she's stooped this low and therefore feels no responsibility to it I am in a position to assume that I will need to be the one to take care of this since it is my future I am worried about.

I'm a puzzled person right now.  I apologize for the read.  In short:
- As a cosigner my ex has surrendered the car without my knowledge and the car is about to be put for auction.  The debt is $13k.  I have no need for the car and my credit now has the repossession on it.
- I'm in credit building mode and this has hit at the absolute worst time, what is my best course of action?
- What are my other possibilities while waiting the 7 long years to fall off?  Would I be able to get a credit card right now to start another account?  Should I not even bother to avoid a further impact?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on my options of paying down substancial credit debt.,"Over the past decade, for various reasons, I've accumulated $27,000 in credit debt.  I'm looking to consolidate this and eliminate it within the next three years or so, which I can afford with some budget tightening and raises this past year.  

I am sitting at around 60% credit usage.  I don't have any major bad items on my credit report but that and a couple late payments, with the latest one being almost two years ago.  My credit score averages around 690-695.  

I also have a 401k that is 100% vested that's worth about $18,000.  

The rates I'm getting for a consolidation loan are not terrible and better than the rates on most of the cards.  I could take a loan for the full balance at 5 years and equalling my current minimum payments, it would take 48 months to pay the 60 month loan.  (Edit:  I don't want to take a 3 year loan as if anything bad happened in life it would be easier to take the 60 month loan and pay way more a month than guarantee a much larger 36 month payment.  Is that bad logic.  I just want to be able to drop to the minimum if something happened in life.  I'd rather pay less to debt and still meet minimums and use that difference to pay for something and not go further in debt.)

I accumulated the 401k in the last 2 1/2 years due to company putting in a percentage of salary every year and me putting in $200 per twice montly pay period.

I just got a raise and the entire amount is going toward the debt.  I also am going to lower the contribution to $50 per paycheck or $100 per paycheck to put more toward the debt.  I'm thinking of taking the super hit on the 401k as I have career potential coming up that will allow me to put more back in within the next few years to hopefully offset this tax loss.  I should net around $11,000 after the crappy tax hit and penalty.  My thought is to dump that on my balances.  This will drop my credit usage to around 35-36%.  I'd keep paying my current minimums for a couple months and my credit score should jump over 700.  Then, I'd move forward with a consolidation loan, which should have more favorable interest rates and I'd still do a five year term but keep paying my current minimums to try to pay it off as quickly as possible. 

Is this a decent plan or should I try to do this all while not touching the 401k?  Should I keep putting as much as I do into the 401k while having this much debt?  Any advice or critique of my plan would be greatly appreciated.

A lot of the debt involved en expensive move to a much more expensive area a few years ago and the costs of study materials and professional exams for my profession and a few random home appliance and car repair issues.  If I can just get back to square one, these types of surprises won't be as damaging as they were a handful of years ago when the debt started rising.  Thanks.

personalfinance,Getting married is going to have huge tax negatives. Anything I can do to reduce the impact?,"*hashtag firstworldproblems coming in hot*

My fiancee and I both work full time in WA state. She makes ~$90k and I'm ~$210k. Separately, with retirement contributions we can reduce a lot of our individual tax burdens (including dropping me back into the 28% tax bracket), but when we get married, it's going to put us so far into the 33% tax bracket we won't be able to fully compensate with retirement contributions.

Couple of notes about us:
-She has student loans w/fairly low interest rate and fixed repayment (not income based). I have no loans.
-We rent right now and have no plans to buy any time soon if we don't have to.
-We both expect raises in 2016, although not huge. Maybe 1.5%-2%. 

Filing taxes as Married Filing Separately doesn't sound like it's the right way to go (although correct me if I'm wrong). Does it make sense for us to both claim Married but withhold at single rate on our W4s, to reduce out of pocket tax payment at the end of the year? And is there anything else we should be doing to try and reduce the tax burden?",finance

personalfinance,Getting my tax return soon. Should I pay off my car or continue making monthly payments?,"HI all,

I'm getting a refund for $2200 soon! 

I currently owe about $1500 on my car and I make $170 payments each month. This was a 60 month loan at a pretty high interest rate, but even if I continue the $170 a month, the car should be paid off by November. 
Should I take the money from the refund and pay off my car entirely or just continue making the monthly payments until November? 

Because I have been making these car payments so long, I don't think another 9 months of car payments will result in paying that much of a difference in interest charges.

I'm just curious as to whether or not you guys think it's smarter to pay the $1500 upfront and save the $170 a month for another 9 months, or if I should just keep the tax refund and continue paying the $170 a month...",finance

personalfinance,Paying for post grad program,"I'm currently enrolled in a 2 year post grad program and I'm trying to figure out the best way to finance it. 

A little background info: I didn't go into much debt for my undergrad degree but I have one federal four-figure loan in deferment while I attend school again. I don't have any non-academic debt. I currently live with my parents so I do not have any real cost of living expenses aside from my vehicle which will be paid off by the end of the year. I work part time. 


The program tuition will total $24,000. It will be broken into $4,000 trimester chunks. I figure to be able to pay $1,000 (including non tuition expenses like books) of each trimester out of pocket, so I'm looking to finance roughly $20,000. I have filed FAFSA but it wouldn't begin helping until the fall, so I'm on the hook for about $8,000 until then. 


I'm debating withdrawing my IRA mutual fund which is worth roughly $3,300. I could always open up another one later and I've barely fed this over the seven years that I've had it. What sort of penalties, tax or otherwise, would I face for the early withdrawal? I do realize I wouldn't get the entire amount.

I plugged the numbers into Turbo Tax's estimator app and it said I should be receiving $1.13 back and all is well.

I understand that this isn't totally accurate so roughly half my wages are still in the mail.

However the dollar amount seems incredibly low. I'm reasonably sure I filled out my tax form correctly when I initially got the job (w-4 right?). After noticing this I checked my pay stubs from the year and most of them had withholding of 0$ with a few cents coming out of seemingly random paychecks that added up to that $1.13 amount.

My significant other and I (age 27) recently sold our old home (made a little money on it) and purchased a new home with intentions to remodel it. By doing this we have some extra funds as we have pulled a decent amount of equity out of our old home. We have put down 20% on the new home to avoid private mortage insurance, and we intend to remodel it to sell in a few years. We have an emergency fund of $8,0000, and are putting money away for retirement with Roth IRA's matching work 401k's. My wife does have some student loan debt still about 22k @ 5.35% however we are currently making minimum payments as she will receive Teacher Loan Forgiveness of $5,000 when she has worked there for another 3 years. The only other debt we have other than our house and student loans is a car payment interest rate of 2.89% with 8,800 remaining on the loan.

Finally my question is with approximately $26,000 remaining what would be your suggestion. Pay off the car or pay down student loans or invest the money or maybe something else? My thoughts on it is the most logical which is to pay down highest interest rate first which goes as follows School, House, Car. However with the teach loan forgiveness I feel it may be worth paying that down more aggressively after we receive the grant. Then another thought that crosses my mind is the fact of being able to remove a monthly payment by paying off the car which is a step in the right direction towards more financial freedom. As you can tell I am a little conflicted with what might be the best thing to do for my family so I appreciate anyone that might take the time to provide me with some input.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) Need help. Wife and I make Combined ~90k a year and still live paycheck to paycheck. No Budget. No Savings. Drowning in Debt. Please Help!,"My wife and I are broke. We live Paycheck to Paycheck. We always have no money, are 30 years old and know we can be further along in life than we are right now. Here is as detailed of a breakdown that I can give right now.


Income:


Me= Work in a call centre for a large bank. Base 40k a year, up to 6k a year bonus. Net pay is 1122 B/W

Her=Nurse. Works Base .75 (aka 75% of full time, or 60 hours B/W). She often picks up shifts to supplement when possible. Makes ~40 an hour and her take home after deductions is usually about 1600 B/W on the low end of things, about 1.9 to 2k on the higher end depending on her hours. For Budgeting purposes, I want to use 1600 B/W

Monthly Expenses:

Rent=1253. Includes parking spot.

Car=127 B/W. Almost exactly 2 years left (~6k owing with about 7.5% interest rate). Work is needed to be done soon as it is getting up there. 2010 Hyundai Elantra with 173k Km's on it. Spend about 50 a week on Gas. Wife either buses to work (about 20 bucks a month total) or I drop her off and pick her up. Total about 474 On Transportation

Car Insurance= 140 a month

My Student Loans= 265 a Month with about 24k owing. Government financed @ 5.2%

Her Student Loans= 406 a Month. Student RCL through Bank. Rate is Prime+3.5%, which right now is a total of 6.2%. On top of this, she has ~8k in government Student loans (3k provincal (in manitoba so interest free) and 5k in Federal at 5.2%. The payments are 108 a month for those loans. Combined total of 514 a month.

Hydro=50 a month Equal Payment Plan (good price for this, covers electric heat and power up here in Winnipeg for pretty cheap)

Internet, TV and 2 Cell phones bundled together are $350 a month. Don't have exact break down but Its about 180 for the phones, 100 for TV and 70 for internet.

Pet Costs= about 250 a month (Sigh......) for Doggy Daycare. Puppy can't be left alone for as long as he can be about 2 or 3 times a week, which is when we daycare him. Once he is older (or I get a better work shift) this will go down to 0. Dog food is about 60 a month right now. Cat food is about 15 a week (Needs wet food and vet dry food due to age and health problems). Total is about 370 a month (I die a little inside reading this)

My Credit Card= 5.5k owing ~19.99% interest. Min Payment is 131, pay 150 a month right now. At it's limit right now
Her CC=13.5k, 19.99% Interest, paying 350 a month on it right now. At it's limit right now
Food=We would like 200 a week, but right now it is probably closer to 300 a week due to restaurants/fast food


Absolutely 0 Savings right now


This should leave us with some money left but we routinely have nothing left. The Biggest culprit is eating out. Right now we eat fast food or go to sit down restaurants nearly every day, and this is killing us (literally, I am obese (315lbs)) and the extra portion of whatever is left. That and Dog toys (my pupper is spoiled rotten) One thing I feel that hurts us a lot besides money is that we have 2 separate accounts, one for me and one for her that are owned just by each of us so I can't see her income and she can't see mine. I have 100% trust in her and she does in me but I think going joint might help us stay on a better path. I also pay the rent, car, and car insurance and she pays hydro and internet/Cable/Phones. We just use whomever has extra cash left after bills (usually her since Rent eats up more than 1 of my cheques) for things like food, etc. We use our debit cards for almost 100% of our spending.

Sidebar: My work offer 2 employee match contributions that I am not taking advantage of yet and it kills me inside. The first is a Savings plan that matches the first 6% of Gross pay I want to save. I can withdraw this money at any time, without penalty, once it has been vested for 6 months. The second is a top up on my pension. I get 3% of my yearly wage extra and it gets saved as a pension. My Plan lets me top up (after 2 years, which will be this year) to an extra 5% of my Gross pay that can be matched as well. Wifes work Deducts a % of her cheque to go directly to pension. 

My biggest questions:

0) What more information can I provide to help clarify the situation?

1) Should we combine everything and let 1 person do the work when it comes to this stuff? Switch to a cash diet? Stay as is? 

2) Besides Doggy Daycare, where should we look to trim the fat?

3) If we somehow manage to get this spending habit under control, what debt should we tackle first? CC debt? Car? Should we focus on savings?

4) What are some good plans for food to eat cheap and somewhat healthy? Any good cost savings tips? My Wife and I both suck ass as cooking and when we do, it's usually something easy like spaghetti, or a slow cooker recipe. 


I will obviously have more questions but we want to implement these changes in March to turn our selves around and have money for once. I am hoping for an update post in 3 to 6 months time with some good news!",finance
personalfinance,Seeking advice: What credit card debt to pay down first.,"The facts: 
$19,000 at 12.74 % - $475 minimum payment 
$14,500 at 9% - $270.00 minimum payment 

Husband called and tried to have both interest rate lowered with no luck.

My husband has been paying more than the minimum payment on these two cards for the last year. The debt is going down slowly and neither of us are using the cards anymore. Or any for that matter.

He will soon have other financial  obligations (taxes, his past divorce settlement debts, legal fees etc) and may not be able to pay above the minimum on both cards. To prevent these accounts from going to collection, incurring massive interest and thus creating worse problems later (credit report hit, lien) I have decided to take money from my savings to pay down some of the debt.  If I leave myself $6k for emergencies, I can put $12k towards this debt. 
I've gone through the frustration, sadness and acceptance of having to do this and I want to prevent bigger long term problems that would affect both of us. We corrected the behavior that got us here, we both earn decent incomes and we are no longer creating debt.

My question is, should I pay $12k to the card with the highest balance and interest ($19k at 12.74%) or split my payment over the two cards? (ie $8k to one, $4k to the other.) 

After this I will pay more than the monthly minimum on one card while he handles the other.

personalfinance,Should I stay in College?,"Background: I'm a 19 year old college student. I was thrown out of my house at 17, and I started community college while working part-time instead of finishing high school. I completed 45 credits towards a degree and was thrown out again. I spend a couple months living with friends for free, then got a full-time job on top of my part-time job and rented a room for around 500$ per month. After a family emergency, I left both jobs and my room, and moved 200 miles away. Now I'm staying with distant relatives because I have nowhere else to go, and am attending classes at a 4-year Private college. 

Tuition is estimated around 61,500 a year, I only went to this school because I wasn't accepted anywhere else. I managed to cut down the cost to around 15,000 by registering for only this Spring semester, taking part-time classes, living off campus, not buying textbooks, etc. My financial aid package was supposed to be 6500 in deferred federal loans plus a 5000 scholarship. I have about 2000$ in savings, so I thought this would be reasonable. The deadline for withdrawal with a 100% tuition refund passed a few days ago, and this morning I received an email from the office of financial aid stating that I couldn't receive my scholarship because I was a part time student. This wasn't mentioned in my financial aid award letter. I also went to the office of financial aid at the start of the year, and specifically asked if changes in the amount of credits I took would impact my financial aid package. I was (incorrectly) told that it wouldn't. I was registered as a part-time student when my financial aid was calculated.

I'm not currently working, but if I started working full-time immediately, I still wouldn't have enough money to pay off the 9,000 or so dollars that are due to this school. My question is this: If I drop out now during the 50% refund period, I will owe 7500$. If I stay and complete the credits without paying, I will owe the full 15,000$ cost once I don't register for classes in the fall. If I go up to full-time credits, I can receive my scholarship, but my financial aid won't otherwise change and the total tuition owed will go up to around 22,500$, meaning that I'd owe even more than if I stay part-time without a scholarship. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do, I didn't realize I'd get so screwed over by financial aid, and now I'm worried I'll end up with a massive student loan I can't pay off and no money to show for it. I don't have any credit history, I have no one to cosign on a loan with me, and I'm not employed.  I realize how weird my situation sounds, the family/living circumstances I'm in are very complicated, and I'm not receiving support from either parent. Does it make more sense to cut my losses and drop out, and focus wholeheartedly on paying back the 7500 I owe, or should I finish out the semester? Or go to full time and rack up even more debt, but get more credits to show for it?  Any advice on what to do in this situation would be incredibly helpful.",finance

What is the smartest thing to do with the money I have saved?

I have Roth accounts already set up for retirement. I don't make a consistent income from free-lancing and I save as much as possible when paid. I can pay my monthly living expenses with no problem and do not lead a frivolous lifestyle.

Eventually I'd like to invest in property but this student loan debt feels crippling. It was originally about $60,000 and is now at $100,000. 

Any suggestions on what to do with my savings? Increase my payments to $500-$750 a month. Put it in a CD? 

Thank you!

UPDATE: Pardon the delayed response I have been traveling. Here are the key additional facts:

-I am female, single and renting a room in NYC. I don't own a car and this loan is the only debt I have. 

-It's all just one loan at a 7% interest rate.

-I work in the media on W-2s doing short-term contracts for various companies.

-I generally make about wide range between 65-90K per year. Some years are slower but that's been the range for the past 4 years. 

-I did have one crazy year where I made &lt;30K because things were unusually slow. But I can say with moderate confidence that that 65-90K range is to be expected with the possibility of more as I go up the ranks. 

-I paid off credit card debt completely last year and focused on saving so that I have a cushion for living expenses.

-I am inclined to keep doing the Income Driven Repayment plan and keep saving toward investing in property. I'd rather put money I spend on rent toward a property that I could also rent out when I have to travel for work often for extended periods. 

Thanks again for your responses. Its pretty crazy how common this upside down student loan dilemma is. I just dont see the point of putting more toward a seeming black hole of debt. Paying the IDR minimum + Quality of life + The potential to make more by investing in property + Working hard to continue to make more in my career seems the best choice for now. Thoughts???",finance

As I wasn't married when starting, I had to go back and change a lot of information through their online system.  It has honestly been problematic and has left me in this in-between stage at work for the past year and a half (maiden name on some things, married name on others).  I made sure to change my marital status, and in the system it says ""married"", however, my W2 says... single? What?  Why?  Is there something I didn't do correctly?  Is this affecting how taxes were taken from my paychecks resulting in me now owing taxes?  An explanation would be most beneficial.

Secondly, I started working PRN for the local major hospital system in September of 2016.  I noticed that on my W2 there were no federal taxes taken out.  Does this affect anything (I currently owe federal taxes, but not state)?  I remember 6 years ago, I worked for a nursing home that didn't deduct state taxes, and that year I got nothing back from the state as a result.  6 years ago, I didn't care.  I got back over $4k.  This year, I owe $2k.  I care now.  Funny how that happens, isn't it?

Thirdly, while plugging in our numbers (we decided to try out Credit Karma's tax filing this year) I didn't find anywhere to plug in my 1098-T.  I have the form for it.  This is the 5th year I've received a 1098-T, however, this year I made no payments towards the amount of $2112.00 (yes, yes... shame on me, but there have been other more important bills taking priority this year).  Because I've made no payments, is this just whatever, or do I need to make sure it gets filed?  I could use some clarification here.

Finally, this is a unique situation.  I honestly think this may be where I our problems really lie, but I would like some input on it.  My parents are successful small business owners.  My mom is also sick with a very rare (very expensive) auto-immune disorder.  They have 3 employees: my mom, my dad, and me.  They pay me full time hours and use that money to pay for my kids and my health insurance.  I would get less than $200 every 2 weeks back after insurance was taken out to help with some household bills.  This was an agreement to help me while I was a single mom in nursing school.  Now that my life-style is very different, I think combined with my full-time hospice job ($25k), my PRN hospital job, and my husband's income ($35k), this deal with my parents is breaking us.  I looked at my paycheck stub and found out that through them, the insurance is ""taxable"".  Which (I think) means that even though I only got to use $5k of my paychecks for the year from them, I made about $20k after taxes.  Looking at it, I really only got to use 1/4 of that money.  On this matter, I really need some personal advice.  I want to get off my mom's payroll and have for a while.  We are doing pretty well on our own at this point, but the only thing keeping this from happening is the fact that for insurance purposes, my parents need at least three employees on their payroll in order to receive the insurance rates that they do (from my understanding).   I don't want to rely on my parents anymore and have been trying to break away from them financially for a while.  I feel like this is now hurting us in the long-run.  We would struggle financially on a day to day basis if we got our insurance from either of our jobs.  I would like to know how to best handle this financially.  We are currently about $10k in debt, have about $1k sitting in collections, pay $860/mo in daycare, $1050/mo in rent, $305/mo for my car, $200/mo for his car, $200/mo for my car insurance, $150/mo for his car insurance, plus about $300/mo in utilities.  Our minimum payments on credit cards add up to about $400/mo.  I do get $120/wk for child support, which basically compensates the daycare bill.  My son also has ADHD and ODD.  His medication costs $10/mo (with insurance) and I have $2500 racked up in medical bills from all the therapy sessions he attends.  I just don't know how to balance out our finances without breaking the bank.  I know this last part isn't really tax related, but some advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Sizable amount of my student loans have been discharged - now what?,"I graduated with 120k in student loans, about 90k in parent loans in my mother's name and 30k in federal sub/unsub loans in my name. I was able to build up a 10k emergency fund during the 6 month grace period after my graduation.

Since I've graduated, my mother has become permanently disabled. Through [Total and Permanent Disability Discharge](https://www.disabilitydischarge.com/default), all of my mother's parent loans are being discharged.

Per the terms of the discharge, in 3 years she'll have to pay income tax on the loan payoff total. Between my loans and some for my brothers, a total of 150k is being paid off. 

I live at home with my parents, so I have minimal grocery expenses but I do try to help my parents keep the house stocked. I make 59k/yr salaried, paid every-other week. The 2 ""extra"" paychecks I get each year help to absorb less uniform expenses, such as checkups for my cat and maintenance on my car. I have had a credit card since high school and have been building my credit through college, my credit score is ~750 (though I recently missed 1 payment because I was on vacation and forgot to pay my bill online... paid in full the next day).

I bought a new 2015 sedan-style car in July 2015, I put 2k down and financed 22k with 1.9% simple interest.

My company has a 401k plan, I make 6% contributions to a Roth IRA. This 6% is matched by my company, placed into a traditional IRA. I also have life insurance automatically deducted; I'll be on my parents health, vision, and dental insurance until I'm 26.

My budget (after deductions mentioned above), as of last month:

Category|Amount
:--|:--
Income|+3120
*Parent loans (min)|-1150
Personal student loans (min)|-340
Car loan|-380
Car insurance|-100
Phone|-50
Groceries|-100
Gas|-100
Spending Money|-500
Restaurants|-200
Savings|-200

With the $200 savings above, I would save 2k (on top of 10k emergency fund) and then pay down loans with it targeting highest interest rates first (85-90% on loans, remaining 10-15% on a splurge item).

*Pending the approval of my mother's TPD discharge application, I'll have $1150 added to my budget. 

I want to maintain my budget and put this $1150/month towards: 

- paying down the rest of my debt (25k with 3.1-6.5% interest between 4 loans)
- increase emergency fund (up to 20k)
- save towards paying income tax on my share (~90k) of the discharged loans in 3 years (How can I anticipate/calculate the amount of tax that will be owed???)
- pay off car (16k)
- increase 401k contributions (pay into Roth while I can afford it?)

Is the above list a viable plan of attack? Is there a more efficient order? Divide and conquer? Please let me know your thoughts!

Thank you for reading!

tl;dr - My mother's parent loans were forgiven, freeing up 1150$/month in my budget. How should I proceed, while knowing in 3 years I'll need to pay income tax on the forgiven loans (90k)?",finance
personalfinance,Tax refund: pay off low-interest debt or save as a safety net?,"My state/federal tax refunds should land this week to the tune of $1,900. 

I owe about $2,500 on a single credit card. The debt has an interest rate of 6% for life (for the curious, First National of Omaha offers that deal on balance transfers a few times a year). 

I know that generally speaking, less debt is good, but considering the interest on the credit card is only costing me about $12 a month, the thought of having a jump start on an emergency fund seems pretty appealing.

personalfinance,Fellow Mainers who are recent college grads - Take advantage of free money from the state this tax year with the Educational Opportunity Tax Credit!,"As some of you may not know, Maine has a tax credit for college graduates who are currently repaying their student loans. This helps  you reduce your tax burden based on the _principle_ of your payments.

And yes, you can claim the 1098-T tax credit and this credit too (1098 is for interest and is the federal one). If you have a STEM degree, the credit is _refundable_. I'm getting back ~$3000 this year from the state because of it.

More details [here](http://www.liveandworkinmaine.com/opportunity-maine/) and you can get the form [here](http://www.maine.gov/revenue/forms/credits/2016/16_eotc_indv_pmts_by_indv.pdf). Note that you must currently reside and work in Maine to claim the credit - and you also need to have graduated from a Maine college or university. However, they do offer prorated tax credits when going through the worksheet.

Hope this helps get people some of their money back! If you've forgotten in prior years you can file amended returns as well.",finance

personalfinance,"Paying off house vs investing the money, how to calculate actual interest rate over the next 5-10 years","I own a home and owe $320k on it at 3.75% on a 30 year mortgage.

I have some investment opportunities over the next 5-10 years, and since the first years of a home loan cost more in interest than the latter years, I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the ""actual"" interest rate over the next 5 years, 10 years, etc.

I'm starting year 3 of the home loan this month. This month I'll be paying $1025 in interest, and $517 in principal. Next month is $1023.50 in interest, and $518.50 in principal. Etc.

How would I calculate what the interest rate over the next 5 years of payments will be? Or the next 10 years?

Assuming I can make an annual 6% with this investment over the next 5 years, it automatically sounds better compared to the 3.75% of the house, but I have a feeling that the next 5 years on the mortgage might actually be higher than 6% based on the amortization schedule, so paying off the house might be a better move.

personalfinance,"Just starting my career, looking for any financial advice to lead me in the right direction.","Little background: grew up in a low income inner city area, was one of a few in my friend group who went to college. Neither parents have a degree but did well raising my brother and I. I recently graduated (22 y/o) and make about 64k a year give or take how much overtime I work within the year. I don’t really have anybody to talk to about financial advice other than my mom telling me to put money in my companies 401k and I’m pretty sure none of my friends even know what a 401k is .. so I came here!

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I live in my parents house and pay about 250-300 a month to help out with the phone bill and other expenses including food. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to live here because the commute is an hour both ways which really sucks. I pay for my own health and dental insurance through my company that is about 140 a month combined. I contribute 12% to my 401k and it says on fidelity that my company matches 58.33% of the first 6% which is not something I completely understand, like it only matches a little over 3% or what? Also, I'm pretty sure they offer discounted stocks to employees, which I have not looked into much. I have about 22k in federal student loans (2.6-4.3% interest) which I have been paying about 500 a month to so far. I have one credit card with US bank (2k cap limit) that I got in college two years ago and have never missed a monthly payment on so I can’t imagine that I have bad credit. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was thinking about opening a credit account with OnPoint so I can build some credit with them to get a low interest auto loan in the near future. I would be able to sell my car for about 1.5-2k to add to a down payment. Any other suggestions on how to get the best deal out of that and what kind of credit limit I should request?

&amp;nbsp;

After browsing this sub for a few days it seems I should also open up a roth IRA, possibly with Vanguard, but don’t know how much I should contribute and I also know next to nothing about investing. Have noted to look over Investopedia.

&amp;nbsp;

Another quick question: my health insurance provides a HSA, I’ve heard that the money you contribute does not rollover and goes away at the end of the year if it is not spent? Regardless, how much should I be contributing to that?

&amp;nbsp;

I apologize for the long post, but any other advice on how I should handle my money would be much appreciated!

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing I would like to mention is reading about all these tactics for saving and realizing I won’t be able to touch most of that money until I’m at least 65 has me wondering why live so frugal now to enjoy the later end of life when I could cut back on the maximum savings strategies to somewhat enjoy my life at the moment when I’m young? Not saying saving is a bad idea, just maybe not saving so much that all I can think of is not spending money so I have more in the latter .. just some food for thought!",finance

personalfinance,Navy Lawyer With Complicated Student Loan Debt,"Hello Finance Gurus,
So I have about 130K in student loan debt all from a top 3 law school. I've been out about a year and a half now. After law school I joined the Navy, mostly because service to this country that has given my immigrant family so much was really appealing to me.

My law school has a program by which they take a look at my income and supplement it so that I am making full loan payments on a 10 year repayment plan of my loan. Essentially, if I have my student loan debt payment is $2000/month after taking a look at my income, they will send me $1500/month and I'll cover the last $500. The great thing about this program is that if I leave active duty, that junk of debt that they have helped pay towards won't come back to hit me, so it is a slight improvement over PSLF. The problem is, if I throw additional money at my student loan debt, the repayment program may decrease the amount of assistance they are sending my way because I can obviously afford to cover that much more.

Because I am in the military the SCRA sets the interest rate on my loans at 6%, I am not allowed to refinance because it would cause my loans to no longer be covered by my law school's repayment assistance program.

My annual salary is about $68,000 with about 18,000 of that being untaxed housing allowances. So for tax purposes $50,000. I have about 15K in a savings account. My average expenses run about 2K a month with rent being half of that.

I guess my ask here is what I should I be doing in terms of either creating a more targeted budget or more effectively utilizing my savings to get myself out of debt when the time comes/start more effectively saving for the future. Thank you all for your time and assistance.",finance

Total bring home pay: $2180 (after health insurance and 401k) 

""Fixed cost""  

Rent/water/electric roughly $800 

Car Insurance - $85 

Life Insurance - $35 

Cell phone - $60 

Gym Membership - $40 

Minimum car payment - $228 (I'm currently paying $150 every two weeks)  

My loans official maturity date is 6/2021. I signed a 5 year loan, knowing I would pay it off early. Interest rate is 1.94% I am really on the fence about paying it off now, and slowly rebuilding my savings. My pay off is $11,361.50  According to the calculators I've been using, I should pay it off a year early.  

I know I will pay myself at least the minimum payment back each month, and I was thinking about putting some of the extra into my 401k or other savings I have. 

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,When to refinance med school loans,"Just graduated residency in June and have about $345k in debt over 13 loans ($300k principal, the rest interest). Rates vary from 5.5%-8.25%, most are 6.55%.

Right now I'm still riding on my last year of IBR (since they used my 2015 taxes to calculate my payment, and I was still making residency salary then). Next year when they use my 2016 taxes I'll be placed on some standard 10 year plan, I presume. Ideally I'd like to put in $5000-6000/month and get everything paid off in 5-7 years, but I need a lower interest rate for that to happen. So, I'm strongly considering refinancing (looking into SoFi specifically). Is this the right choice for me? If so, when should I refinance- should I wait until next year when I'm off IBR, or just do it now? I'm not concerned about losing my federal loan benefits, since I don't foresee ever working in public service for possible PSLF. Of note- I'm currently paying $4000/month (toward my single remaining loan from a non federal lender) plus my monthly $450 IBR payment.

Any other advice?",finance

[Supply and demand forces acting on miners will decide how large blocks are](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/faq), not proclamation by bitcoin core. The more people are able to use and spend Bitcoin, the higher the value for everyone, which improves mining profits.

This will not be possible with a scarce block space fee market model, due to expensive transaction fees. 

It helps consumers by ensuring that blocks can expand naturally to a viable size so that everyone can place transactions on-chain, without paying massive fees, or waiting hours for confirmation.

personalfinance,$9k in CC debt. Is this plan viable?,"Hi all. Throwaway b.c I don't want this attached to my main account, but I highly appreciate any feedback.

My wife (24) and myself (26) live in Brooklyn, NY. It was very difficult financially in the first few years being married and we racked up a bunch of credit card debt. But I was promoted to a much better job and am now making about $3,900/mo net and my wife does part-time teaching for $700/mo plus freelancing here and there. We both have bachelors degrees in music. 

Our expenses apart from the credit cards: $1900/mo rent (rent-stabilized so no changing this), $250/mo utilities, $220/mo transit, $360/mo for her health insurance through Obamacare, $460/mo for her student loans, and about $300/mo for groceries.

Tallying it all up: $4,600/mo income - $3,490/mo expenses = $1,110/mo left over to handle the CCs and savings.

We have seven credit cards from various vendors and stores. Most of them have about $1k, some have $2k in ballance; they are essentially maxed out. All APR's hover around 25%. Total ballance is $8,900.

Here's the problem: we have no savings. What little we had was wiped out from vacations, managing debt, or cash flow problems. Since our income is far better than it used to be, we don't need the credit cards like we used to. But out credit scores are taking a hit from having so many revolving accounts, mid 600s. Another caveat is that my company is doing 401k matching, but I'm not participating right now. There was no cashflow available in the past couple years to devote to retirement, but that might change now that we have more income. 

Plan A was to get a loan from our bank to cover all the balances in a debt consolidation at a lower interest rate but they rejected us due to the low credit score. Maybe we should try a different bank?

Plan B is to use the extra money left over every month and pay down $120-150 on every card for the next year. At $120/card that's $840/mo or 11 months until it's all paid off. That also gives us $270 left over for wiggle room/discretionary/savings. Or, the more aggressive $150/card at $1,050/mo or 9 months until it's paid leaves us with only $60 left, which is a very thin margin that I'm not comfortable with. Also that leaves us with no chance of putting away savings or 401k. 

Is this even a good idea? Anyone have any better strategies given the lack of savings? Thanks for any input!",finance

Not sure if there is a similar post already to this, but if so, I'd appreciate a point in that direction! 

About my situation:  
I make about $24,480 a year post tax and post 401K contribution. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend who makes about the same.  

I owe $3457 as a personal loan to a family member. No interest no deadline. Currently I pay $100/mo on it. I think the family member would be unhappy to see me paying any less on it.  

Then I have student loans totaling $6980 at a 4.66% fixed interest rate. I pay $75 a month it.  

My goals:  
Currently I have $3,400.00 sitting in an Ally savings account. I average about $600 in savings per month. I want to see this account grow to about 6 months worth of funds (~$7800).  

I'm in the process of transitioning careers, to do so I'd like to get a better computer which would cost me about $1000.


My questions:  

Where should I focus my attention to my main goal (savings fund) and my minor goal (computer) the fastest? Should I be putting more money towards my loan? Since it's such a small amount and didn't seem to be hindering my ability to save or enjoy myself, I thought putting more in would just take away from my ability to save a lot of money.

Right now I have about 3 months worth of bills saved.

I didn't see much advice for what to do when someone has a very small loan to repay, so please any guidance would be helpful. Am I doing things right or could I be doing things better?

A little background: Currently an engineer/PM making 99k. Customer offered me a soft offer with the city making 145k. This position is managerial, non-union, and I can be let go if a new administration comes in and decides to do some cutting. It has a pension that I would have contribute 6 percent. Minimum service is 20 years and I have 1 year 6 months of federal service I can transfer over.

Some pros of my current position is that I can work form home, paid cell phone, work travel and some meals are expensed. I also really like the culture there. Recently, I was given additional responsibilities and title change to PM without a salary increase (sucks). I currently have a 401k sitting at 90k right now. I started at this position 5 years ago at 80k, and honestly was expecting to be making more right now.

Some cons of the city job is that I could possibly be stuck at the same position as I am not sure yet if there is future growth. I also have to report in everyday at my duty time regardless of weather conditions, etc. (I can deal with this just not used it). However, it is a managerial position that builds on my past experience as an engineer/PM where I can do well and have a positive impact.

personalfinance,"I have been asked to take over a modest family trust, and would like some third-party advice before I agree or deny.","Greetings PF.  First, this is a throwaway for anonymity reasons.

I have a family trust which is structured to ensure a home and health for my parent, before being passed down to my siblings and I.  It is structured this way because the parent is not exactly responsible enough to handle their own life beyond ensuring that they are always fed and entertained...  The current trustee is quitting the trust, and I have been asked if I would consider becoming the new trustee, and need advice if I would be better avoiding this responsibility or actually consider it.

While the work of managing the trust is not daunting and I already have enough experience managing my business of this size, I am concerned about a few things.

First, knowing my family history, I would prefer to invest a significant portion (20-40% of the just-under-eight-figure) of the trust through non-speculative real-estate, bonds, and other 'safe' investments.  I know from conversations with my grandparents, and based on how they amassed their fortunes, that this is the course they would have taken, but the current trustee was unwilling to do this for liability reasons and because they didn't want to be *that* involved with it.  I understand that doing this would mean I could not buy real-estate and rent it out myself (at market rate and only as a way to benefit the trust), but would I be able to do so for my siblings?  As a future beneficiary myself, would doing something like this cause me to have to worry about legal conflicts of interest?  We are fairly close (talk at least monthly) and generally fairly unanimous in decisions regarding our parent.  The only reason I say 'fairly' is because I tend to be the more patient with our parent, while the other siblings have all-but disowned the parent; so I am not concerned with familial conflicts of interest, only legal.

Second, the parent in question tends to be...  churlish is a fair description... about things.  For instance she has a not-legally-married-because-they-didn't-want-to-lose-alimnony partner who she has fought to have the trust cover their expenses in some instances.  In one particular instance, the trust capitulated when it became clear that doing so would be the least costly option.  While I have no trouble handling in an impartial manner, I just don't want this to distract me from my own concerns.  Additionally, since it is foreseeable (regardless of our agreements over the phone and in writing if I decide to take this responsibility on) that this could cause familial friction, would I be likely to jeopardize my own status as a beneficiary of the trust?

Third, would I be able to fairly charge the trust for my time managing it and costs associated (such as hiring accountants for tax preparation etc as I do with my business.) I wouldn't charge what a normal trustee CPA would, but I would have to make sure that any time it distracts me from my business is at least acknowledged.  I would of course set a documented rate schedule which is agreed to by all beneficiaries, but would this be introducing another possible conflict of interest with my future beneficiary status?

Fourth, what do public trustee boards typically cost?  Based on what the existing trustee was charging and the aforementioned lack of desire to invest or manage the trust beyond disbursements, all of us involved came to the same conclusion that we are most likely better off (mainly to ensure its viability in caring for our parent) handling the trust ourselves.

Honestly, I don't personally care if I get nothing more than enough to cover the funeral of our parent when the trust passes to my generation; however I know that one sibling is counting on getting something to be able to retire (they barely make ends-meat working for a non-profit educational outreach organization) and we would all like to pass our grandparent's legacy to our children by guaranteeing them a good college education - as our grandparents intended (one of the functions of the trust was to provide a college education for all subsequent generations of the family as long as the trust is fiscally viable.)

If this is the wrong place to ask, please point me in the direction of where to ask.  I already have time set aside to discuss this with my CPA on Monday and my personal attorney on Wednesday, but I need to have an answer by the end of next week.

personalfinance,Debating if it is a good idea to buy a condo as a future investment vs renting and put my down-payment elsewhere (e.g. retirement)?,"I am debating on buying a 170k 2 bedroom condo at the moment, to live in for at least 6 years (currently work from home full-time  as I work on my PhD part time which is about 6 years). I would be a first time homeowner. I'm 30 and have a mid-level career in pharmaceuticals (been with company for 3 years). have maybe 3k in student loan debts @ 2% interest (old federal loan rate).

When I finish my PhD, I might look for another job to earn more, which can be either a work from home job or in office job. If it is an in-office job, I would be a 1-1.5 hr drive away from this condo.  If this is the case, I would most likely rent the condo out after proper tenant screening, with hope it would just be an additional source of income when the condo is paid off (currently 30yo, so about 60yo).  I have been looking at this condo complex for the last year and it seems it is quite easy to rent the place out and it is in high demand (e.g. listing doesn't last more than a week or two) and the unit typically goes for $1450/month for rent and a rental listing goes quickly.

But going back to buying the place: 

After a 34K down-payment, my mortgage (3.88%) payment   would be about $630/month (I have a pre-approval) for 30 years and my additional fees (HOA fee, 2016 taxes/12 and condo insurance based on a few estimates/12) would be $600/month. This would come out to $1230/month. 

My rent is currently $1250/month (down the street from the Condo I am looking at). Thus it is quite close to my mortgage/fees payment. 

I have been playing around with the [New York Time's Rent vs. Buy calculator](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) . I am unsure what to type into certain fields (especially under what does the future holds section and closing costs)..so I left most fields default with exception of the mortgage and maintenance/fees section (added in the 600/month fees I listed above, plus 1% maintenance). It looks like the calculator feels that it is best to buy since my rent is not less than $1144/month, thus it looks like it is best to buy.

So I am trying to think about this from an investment point of view. Regardless, I would have to pay about the same monthly fee to either my landlord or to the bank.  So the only differences I think between renting and buying is down-payment (35K) and maintenance (Just whatever is inside the unit, mainly Furnace, dishwasher, stove, fridge that has wear and tear). Thus, thinking about this, I am trying to figure out if it better to buy a place or use that down-payment towards something else (i.e an IRA account) as a future investment.",finance

personalfinance,Friendly reminder that you can pay your taxes for free online if you make less than $64k/year (US),"I have paid to efile my federal and state taxes with TurboTax for nearly 7 years and I am a chump. After learning about the free tax solutions for people who make under a certain amount of income each year, I filed for free for the first time (and I'm kicking myself for not knowing I could have done it for free for all those years)!

[This IRS page with free filing solutions](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) walks you through a wide-range of different software solutions for efiling depending on your income level (e.g. TurboTax is free for those who make under $33k/year). 

P.S. Another tip (regardless of income level) - if you end up owing a fair amount of taxes and have saved up the money to do so, pay the bill initially with a rewards credit card so that you can get points for the big payment. Then pay off the charge completely with the money you saved for your tax payment at the end of the month. It's an easy way to get some decent cash rewards or airline miles for something you have to pay for anyways.
P.S. Edit: u/breauxdle pointed out that there are fees and interest charges incurred for credit card payments to the IRS, so be sure to research how much you will be charged before making the choice to do so.

personalfinance,How does this budget look?,"I'll try not to be long-winded here, but will chime in with points/explanations if I think they're warranted. I'm coming here wondering a) if my budget is okay and b) if I should live with my parents for the next year and a half to save money. Ideally I would sign the lease  described below but I grew up SUPER low-income so I'm kind of paranoid about money. Living with my mom wouldn't be ideal seeing as how I'd be sleeping in her living room on an air mattress as she lives in a 1 bedroom apartment. However, the prospect of saving a lot of money is very tempting.

Background: I recently moved to a bigger, more expensive city in order to pursue a better job. 

Monthly income post-tax, parking @ work, and 6.8% into retirement (Wisconsin Retirement System) = 2200 + whatever I make serving (boss predicts I'll make anywhere from 800 to 1200 serving per month)

* Potential lease: $850 (includes all utilities + water + parking + lawn care &amp; snow removal, I would only pay for water). It should be noted that this is a total steal for my area. Studios in the same area are going for 700-1000 without utilities / parking. This lease would start in August 2018. I'm currently paying for a lease in a different city since all of my stuff is still there &amp; I shared a bedroom with my boyfriend aka I couldn't get out of the lease. This lease will end at the end of May).
* Car loan: $268 (Currently at 4.29%, have around 11k to pay off yet)
* Car &amp; renter's insurance: $85 
* Phone: need to get off of my parent's plan but I'm assuming it'll be somewhere around $70
* Internet: Assuming it'll be around $40
* Student loans: All federal loans, a little less than 35k at 5%. I'm currently on an income-based repayment plan but I think my new serving job will lead me to pay more monthly, somewhere around $300 a month for 10 years.
* Health insurance (will start paying in April of 2018 once I'm kicked off my parents' insurance): $85

Future goals: 

* Rollover my 401k from my previous employer into a vanguard roth &amp; contribute X amount monthly...not really sure how much I should contribute...?
* Save up for a future wedding &amp; down payment on a house &amp; honeymoon.
* Pay off car loan.

I'm new to budgeting but am currently tracking my February expenses in a google sheet so I can get a better idea as to where I'm spending money and where I can save. I'm currently spending $100 a month to park at work (grrrrr) because my serving job starts immediately after my first job. This is something I would be able to get rid of with the new August lease as the apartment is super close to both jobs and is in a much more bus-friendly area.

personalfinance,Would it be worth it to refinance my home?,"I am 30 yo and purchased a house and land in 2014 for $200,000 after my down payment I borrowed $190,000. At the time I was making roughly $80K a year, since that time I've been laid off started at a new company and am currently working my way up the so called corporate ladder. Last year I made just shy of $60k and my wife is unable to work for personal reasons. 

We live modestly and try to keep debt as low as possible. We have one car payment for $305 a month a few medical bills then utilities and kid expenses. Our mortgage last year was $1250 per month however we just received notice that it will jump to $1444 this year due to insurance increases and apparently a negative escrow fund. 

This would be more than half of my monthly bring home pay and really isn't doable for us.  Our current interest rate is 4.25%.  Do I have any options for refinancing and saving a little money? My wife and I both have very good credit of 780 + each. 

Note* tomorrow I will be talking to different insurance agents to see what my options are there.",finance
personalfinance,Would like some help planning out my budget and retirement plan,"I'm a recent university graduate who will be moving to the Seattle area (working as a software engineer in Bellevue specifically) in late March. I've been doing a lot of reading and number crunching in Excel in preparation and would like another set of eyes on my plan.

## Personal info
* 21, male
* 750 credit score
* Somewhat risk averse
* Don't like keeping a balance on credit cards

##Compensation

* 107k base salary (with potential for ~10% bonus at year end, though I've excluded this from my calculations), paid bi-weekly
* 120k in stock, vested over 3.5 years
* 25k signing bonus
* 5k relocation, grossed up for tax
* 401(k) with decent low cost index funds. 50% match up to 401(k) max; can contribute extra 20k after-tax
* HDHP with HSA through Premera ($1500/yr employer contribution, no premium). Also covers vision. FSA also available. Dental coverage also included through another provider with $25 deductible.
* ESPP (10% discount, up to 15% of base salary, quarterly)
* ORCA public transit card paid for by employer
* $800/year reimbursement for gym, fitness equipment, classes, etc.

I plan on using 6k from the signing bonus to pay for my sister's recent medical expenses and banking the rest in a high-yield savings for my emergency fund.

All numbers from this point on will be taking into account my base salary only.

##Budget

I will most likely not be itemizing my tax deductions (-$6350 in taxable income). 401k and HSA will both be maxed out (-$18k and -$3350 respectively). So I'm looking at $79300 in taxable income.

Since WA doesn't have state income tax, I only need to consider federal income tax plus SS/Medicare; after taxes, I'm looking at about ~$4800/mo take home.

* Rent: ~$1200. I searched on CL for furnished rooms within 5 miles of 98004 with in-unit laundry, a private bath, and a decent kitchen. Roommates are fine as long as the bedroom is not shared. Studios are out of the question. Easy access to public transit is essential; being near UW is a small plus but not required.
* Groceries/food: ~$300. I don't like to eat out a whole lot, and when I do, I try to keep it cheap. I plan on meal prepping. Not sure about grocery prices so this is an estimate.
* Utilities (internet, cell phone, electricity, water): ~$250. Still not sure what I'd be looking at here. My cell phone is ~$70/mo (Verizon unlimited line on family plan); the other three depend on living arrangements. This is very likely to be an overestimate.
* Car: ~$300 (very likely an overestimate). I have a 2012 Honda CR-V worth ~$20k, fully paid off. No accidents on record. I will not be using the car to commute to work; it's purely for recreational use, trips to Costco, etc. This figure includes auto insurance, vehicle registration, and gas.
* Student loans: ~$500. I have about $25k in various loans ranging from 3.76 to 4.66% (averages out to about 4%). Minimum payments are ~$250/mo, but I plan on paying at least double that.
* Other insurance: ~$50. Since health and car insurance have already been covered above, I think I just need to get renter's insurance and umbrella insurance. Also don't know exact costs for this.
* Clothing: $100/mo. Placeholder number, but I don't buy clothes all that often. Okay with buying during sales only.
* Fun (eating out, fun toys, Spotify/Netflix/other subscriptions, etc): $200/mo
* Emergency fund: $100/mo

My monthly expenses end up being about $3000/mo, leaving me with $1800/mo left over.

Again, the above numbers don't include potential year-end bonuses or the 120k stock from my compensation package. It also doesn't consider any proceeds from stock discounts through the ESPP.

## Future goals
* Buy a house
* Help cover parental retirement (their retirement accounts are basically nonexistent)
* 529 funds if I choose to have children
* Financial independence

## Questions
* Does my budget look reasonable? Are there any places where it might be worthwhile to cut back?
* Should I pay my student loans down faster or slower?
* Does it make sense to dump as much of my paycheck as possible into my 401(k) as after-tax contributions, then establish a Roth conversion pipeline as a tax shelter for the money earmarked for future goals? Or should I establish a taxable account for this purpose?
* I didn't include savings for potential vacations. What's a reasonable figure for this if I want to start budgeting for it? I get 15 paid vacation days per year.
* Assuming I want to buy a house in 10 years, how should I save for the down payment?
* Is $150k a reasonable amount to save for the down payment, closing costs, appraisal fee, etc. on a $500-600k house (in today's dollars)? Will the resulting monthly mortgage payments, property taxes and maintenance costs be fine given my budget? I'm somewhat handy and can handle minor home repairs.
* Since the Seattle area is a huge seller's market right now, if I decide to stay there for 15 or more years from now, does it make sense to buy a house as soon as reasonably possible? I ran the numbers on the NYT buy vs rent calculator and it seems like it makes a lot of sense to buy ASAP if I plan on staying.
* I only have one credit card on my report: a Chase Freedom card where I am an authorized user (my mother pays the bill for that). I plan on opening up another card or two and keeping the Chase Freedom open. Which cards should I be looking at?

personalfinance,Can I be the guy with the stupid question? 5K Tax Return &amp; $6500 in CC Debt,"Sorry if this seems obvious to some. We had been totally CC debt free but stupid choices (by me) last year plus some emergency spending got us back where we didn't want to be. Could use some support and advice from you all. Thank you in advance if you've read this far!

My logic is the interest rate on the CCs is about 20% on all three cards which would cost us more than the measly interest in our savings acct. so throwing the 5K at 2 of 3 cards seems best. however it's always nice to have the cash in case of an emergency.  I don't want to assume and could use a different opinion. Our tax return is going to be about $5,000. 

Wife and I have $6,500 in CC debt. I need to know what the wisest move is on what we do with our tax return. Should we use all of the tax return to pay off the two with the higher interest rate? Or put the tax return into a savings account and pay them off over the next year?",finance

95 - Capital One QuickSilver cc (owe 3k, interest rate around 25%)

25 - Chase Slate cc (owe 1,400, still on 0% interest until June, then interest rates kick in at about 25%)

I did some research on Roth 401(k) and understood that the general advice is for young professionals to choose Roth as their tax brackets will increase over time.

So I am getting about $5,500 back from taxes and work bonus this year. I am debating whether I should pay off my interest-free credit card - $5,600 balance and interest-free for 11 more months.

I have it budgeted so that I can make $500/month payments to my credit card right now just to get out of the debt quickly and pay it off before the promotion period runs out since the personal loan is already fixed payments.

In my head I know I should pay down the higher interest rate but it would be a lot nicer to not have any credit card debt and use that extra money to pay down the personal loan. So I am torn. Hopefully collectively, we are not ;)

investing,A better then S&amp;P500 core?,"My investment strategy to beat the S&amp;P500 is pretty simple:

* buy the S&amp;P500 with the vast majority of my portfolio
* then seek out opportunities with individual stocks (long); special situations (options) and rarely shorting (buying puts) stocks or sectors
* increasing exposure to certain sectors via ETF

So for this strategy has served me well enough.  Going forward I am concerned that the S&amp;P 500 won't perform as well as it has in the past, partly because of the unpredictability of the Trump Administration, part because of the increasing ratio of passive/active investment that has me concerned.

I thought about playing the dividend angle, with the S&amp;P500 Aristocrats, but the most inevitable increase in interest rates makes that strategy too vulnerable.

Then I thought about investing my core into Berkshire Hathaway, but that's too much exposure to the financial sector, therefore defies the diversification angle.

personalfinance,How hard is it to file an amendment on my 2016 taxes?,"My wife and I got married recently, and so this year we filed jointly. I'm an idiot and thought that filing jointly was simply the status we each marked on our returns (IE, I filed a return marked as filing jointly, she also filed a return marked jointly). Because I was operating under this now obviously stupid assumption, my W2 came before my wife's did, and I went ahead and filed my return as thouh my wife didn't have a W2. My taxable income was a hair more than $32k, I paid just shy of $2500 federal, and got a $2k return early last week. My wife just now got her W2 (~$7300 taxable income, she paid $344.55 federal taxe). 

I know I've screwed up and need to amend my return but HR block is saying they charge $150 to prepare an amended return. Obviously I can take that out of the incorrect return I've already received, but if submitting an amended return isn't difficult I'd rather save myself the money. 

I didn't list the state taxes or medicaid tax amounts because I'm not sure how much bearing that has on all of this. 

Also,  will I need to do a separate amended return for my state taxe?  I'm assuming I will, but as this post very clearly demonstrates I have no clue what I'm doing.

Hank took out a loan for Le Cordon Bleu Institute of Culinary Arts in Pittsburgh (school was sued last year and is now closed) for $50,000 and was cosigned by his dad. After graduating his father made a payment over the phone August 2007 for $25,000 ""to take care of half of it"". This was originally with Sallie Mae. Hank signed up for automatic payments which started at $240 and has since increased to $250. The interest rate is currently sitting at 4%v, and the highest he's seen it was 9.5%.


Last week when I happened to log in to his account for Navient, I was completely shocked to see that he has a principal balance of $41,000 on his private loan. Although he has automatic payments they have been consistently charging him late fees and until 6 months ago, only about 8% of payments were being applied towards the principal balance. I reported this to CFPB with the statements showing all payments made to Navient (which I took from their website). 


Navient has been zero help. We are constantly transferred to different departments but hardly getting answers. Even when asked where the $25,000 went they said it was applied to ""future interest payments."" I can't deal with this and it tears me up that between him and his dad they have paid over $40,000 and have hardly made a dent in the principal. What do we do?

The first has a 24% interest rate (holy shit, right?) and 5% cash back on rotating items. Credit limit is $10k. This was my first credit card when I was single and has been open for about ten years. 

The second card as a 14% interest rate and 1% cash back on everything. The credit limit is $5k. This is our first credit card together and has been open for less than a year. 

Those hideous interest rates were never a problem because I always paid off the entire balance each month no problem. That is until... I went part time to raise our son, our car died, our stove died, I smashed my phone, Christmas happened, etc... 

Four months later the extraordinarily high card is nearly paid off and I can now focus on paying down the lesser card. 

My question is once the 24% interest rate card is paid off should I close the same and never look back? Or is it more beneficial to our credit to keep it open since it only recently got out of control and it is my oldest existing line of credit?

personalfinance,Middle class struggles with student loans and mortgage. How should I manage my finances?,"Hello fellow redditors!

I have come to respect this subreddit more than all of the others after reading so many success stories. I figured now is as good a time as ever to see what advice you can offer on my situation. 

WARNING! I am not retiring in my 20s, a professional athlete, or have anything remarkable about me whatsoever. My family is strictly middle-class going through the struggles that I am sure many would scoff at but am also sure is shared by many others on this subreddit.

My situation:

* Married with no kids, wife and I are both in mid to late 20s. 

* Yearly household income before taxes is about $165,000 (roughly 2/3 me and 1/3 wife). 

* After tax monthly income is roughly $9000-10,000. 

* We have about 10k spread across several checking and savings accounts.  

* 1 year into a 30 year mortgage, Monthly payment: $2500 inc PMI. 

* Student loans- me: 60k wife: 100k (6-9% interest rates). 

* Two car payments: $900 month total (halfway through 5 year loans). 

* 401k for myself: 24k (I contribute 6% of my salary and company matches). 

* Wife IRA: $2000. 

That pretty much sums it up. We have been trying to save up to 18k for an emergency fund but have had struggles due to some unavoidable expenses with our home.

How should I be handling my debt? Is student loan consolidation an option? Should I focus on high interest loans 1st or the smallest loans first?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: monthly expenses

* mortgage $2500

* auto insurance $100

* gas $150

* auto payments $850

* utilities $200-300 (electric varies + we have a pool)

* tv/phone/internet $250

* student loans $1450 (this is the minimum monthly payment for a 30 year plan)

* food $1000 (I know this is an area we can cut big time)

* pet expenses $400-500 (2 dogs this includes food and pet sitting)

This puts us at $7000 a month, so theoretically if we bought nothing else we should be running at a $2000 a month profit but that rarely happens.",finance
personalfinance,Paying back student loans effectively?,"I am currently 23 and finished up college last year in May, and started repayment on my loans back in December. Over the course of the last year, I started repayment early to allow me to pay down the principal on some of my loans before they started to accrue interest.

I was making a $55,000 salary prior to graduation, and post graduation I landed a job making an $88,000 salary.

personalfinance,Issues paying off specific student loans,"Hi Pf, my wife and I have student loans after college but have different loan providers.  I currently have Fedloan services and been very happy overall.  My wife has great lakes though and we have issues with them.  We are using the avalanche method to repay our loans focusing on those with highest interest rate first.  We both have the monthly auto debit and I could just specify online the loans I want to pay towards with a second payment and have them applied and cleared off with Fedloan.  My wife though is forced to call to make the extra payment if she wants to target specific loans.  At the beginning of last month she made an extra payment to pay off 2 loans and verified with the representative that the amount will account for all current interest payments and principle balances so that both would be 0 (we were told that both loans would be cleared).  At the beginning of this month we were planning to do the same but when we checked we noticed that one of the loans we thought we payed off last month was not and still had a balance of over 300 dollars.  When we called to ask about this the representative (not the same one as before) said that since we were paying before the monthly debit that that has to be covered first for ALL the loans before any extra can be applied to any loan even if there is auto debit enabled and we had clarified with the first person to have the 2 loans payed in full.  We asked why and she said quote that is was a ""federal law"".  My wife didn't record the call though as she was calling during her lunch break but this seems wrong especially since I have had no issues with doing the same thing with my federal loans through a different provider?

personalfinance,Help. Personal Student Loan Crisis. PSLF,"I started paying off 108k student loan debt in 2013. I'm a civilian working for the air force.

I did what I thought was the smart thing to do, and set to work paying off all of the private loan debt. I accomplished this early last year, thanks to a deployment overseas to Iraq.

This brought my Federal loan debt to 47k. This has meant no vacations. This has meant a ton of sacrificing. This has meant living frugally and at times costing opportunities due to being unable to pursue them for lack of funds.

I currently make 76k/year, and have the means to sock away a lot more money into IRA accounts to lower my AGI. I have been putting away 11% + 4% Employer match.

I expect to be making ~ 88k within the next 2-3 years through promotion/regular increases.

Should I artificially lower my AGI for the next 7 years to receive ~10k in forgiveness and cash flow benefit?

I have three years of payments towards PSLF...but at this time I don't know if I will have any forgiveness. I've come to grips with this as I went to recert for REPAYE. I'm entirely confused on the repayment plans and that's my fault -- but the information isn't exactly clear and FedLoan couldn't give any less care about assisting.

I have two choices really. If I ever make enough money to no longer qualify for REPAYE, my loan payment will be recalculated at whatever my standard year payment would be. The problem is -- the loan servicer recalculates that payment to be whatever it would take to finish paying off your loans in ten years - not the standard payment if you had been on the standard payment the entire time.

I thought if I ever got bumped off of REPAYE I would simply start paying the 10 year rate on studentloans.gov / before I went on REPAYE (which for me is ~310/mo) Imagine the shock when I asked how much it would be if instead of REPAYE I went to standard -- ~610+. There is no real information on this on the studendtloans.gov website, and there is no one to contact about it. In essence -- if I allow interest to accrue for even up to 9 years and 11 months but then no longer qualify for REPAYE, the entire balance is due on the 120th month -- meaning no forgiveness.

That means no public student loan forgiveness, and that I basically allowed 2-3 years of 0 payments (when i didn't make jack squat) to add interest to my loan balance for no reason.

I don't want to bitch and moan too much because I've been fortunate to work my ass off and be able to do as well as I have -- but I kind of feel cheated. 

The real benefit realized from forgiveness for me would be approximately 10k, but even more -- it would provide cash flow flexibility. I have 40k saved up that I could simply throw down on the loans now (they're at a terrible 6.5% avg), but that means kissing goodbye the house payment I had saved up and starting from scratch for two more years.

personalfinance,"College work study, think financial aid is giving me inaccurate hours?","Hello,

Firstly, sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. Wasn't sure where to put this.

I am a work-study for my school -- from my understanding, I am paid by the federal government. I was given a set amount of money based off of my FAFSA, which is split into the fall and spring semester...rounded, it's $1,600 per semester. I didn't meet the max amount for the fall semester, as I was brought on late in the semester.

In regards to this semester...I tried speaking to the financial aid work study coordinator four different times, and was eventually told by another person in the financial aid department that they talked to the WSC, and I am allowed to work up to 20 hours a week...it is a 15 week semester, and I get $11 an hour.

I did the math and it didn't work out at all for me...ended up calling and the work study coordinator answered. Rushed me off the phone, saying I can ""work 10-15 hours per week""...I'm now working 15.5 hours a week (my supervisor insisted that it wouldn't go over the given amount...), but that math even at 15 hours a week doesn't seem to work for me? Even if we say that I get two weeks vacation (which is more than I actually get), at 15 hours, I'd be getting $2,145, wouldn't I?

Given this, I'm wondering how this is going to work out? I was first told when I was brought on to make sure I don't go over the amount because the school would get sanctioned...then I was told that they'd just list some of the spring hours into the fall semester...then I was told that they'd just pay me the extra out of the school's funds? Idk what it true or not here, and have no idea how to research this. 

I guess my main question is, where do I go from here? I've already made 800$ this semester so there's no way I'll make it to the end without exceeding the $1,600 figure by the end of the semester, right? What happens if I do go over that limit?

personalfinance,When to take on student loan debt?,"Hey, so I'm a college student coming up on graduation. I've tried to keep my borrowing to a minimum by budgeting and working part-time, but I've not done the best job. As a result of some optimistic budgeting and some missed revenue opportunities, I've wound up with a good chunk of credit card debt. All of this debt is a result of living expenses, it's just a few years of going over a bit on groceries every month (maybe eating out too often) and not putting in enough hours at work outside of class.  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
  
  I was wondering, would it be A. legal and B. wise to take out an additional student loan to cover this debt? Afaik it's perfectly acceptable to use student loans to cover any living expenses, but I don't know if it's okay to do so retroactively. If it's okay, it seems like a good idea as the interest rate would be much lower. I'd be looking at an unsubsidized loan through the state that would require quarterly interest payments until graduation. Then, there's a transition period and a repayment period once you have gainful employment.  
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
  I'm graduating with a STEM degree, so I anticipate having a healthy, stable income. In the mean time, I'd put my credit card in a lock box where I won't be tempted to use it.

personalfinance,IRS dropping the ball - Do I have to file a petition in the US Tax Court?,"The backstory (feel free to skip to my questions, I don't know how much of this is relevant):

Back in march of 2015 I filed and payed my 2014 taxes. It was my first year doing freelance and apparently I had been wronged by the American public school system, because I had no idea what a 1099 was or form schedule C SE, never mind self-employment taxes. A wonderful and exceptionally rare lady at the IRS was kind enough to call me and inform me of my mistake. she even walked me through correcting it. My account was put on hold for 6 months while I waited to receive transcripts. That august 2015, I got a ""tax guy"" to help me file an amended return. I payed the taxes I owed and the interest due.

Fast forward to the summer of 2016: I receive a CP2000 stating I owe taxes for the year 2014. There's a chart included which compares my numbers with their numbers. It is painfully obvious that these numbers are from my original unamended return. So with the help of my tax guy, I write the IRS a letter explaining the misunderstanding. I even receive confirmation of the lathers receipt. However, I continue to get letters stating I owe back taxes for the unamended 1040. My tax guy says I need to give them time to, that the IRS does everything at a painfully slow pace.

Around the end of 2016, I receive a letter saying I either have to pay up now or file a petition with the US Tax Court by March 2017. I decide to call them (it's surprisingly hard to actually talk to a person at the IRS). They say they have on file an indication that I payed the amount that I owed, but no 1040x. They assure me that it was probably received by the IRS, but they don't actually know. Apparently it's not uncommon for some vital departments of the IRS to not have copies of things, because they weren't scanned or entered into the digital records system. I sent their specific department a copy straight away. Then I ""gave it some time.""

Now in February of 2017, I receive a letter saying that nothing has changed. I have to pay up or file petition with the US tax court based on my unamended return. They are ""reviewing"" my 1040x, but it will take up to 60 days, well beyond the deadline to file a petition.

My Question:

I think I actually have to file a petition. how do I do that?

Do I have to do that?

Can I do something else?

Do I need a tax lawyer?

Why does life suck and the IRS hate me?

I don't even know if I'm asking the right questions. I'm taking a shot in the dark with reedit here because I've seen some sage advice dolled out in the past. Even a blue downvote arrow will help me so long as it's pointing in the right direction.

*******Thanks to everyone who responded. Especially thanks to u/ohio_asian. I called my local IRS TAC about ten minutes before they closed and a very helpful person stayed on the phone with me and walked me through my options. There were still the usual hangups, (""We see here that you sent something in, but nobody marked in the system what it was, so we won't actually be able to tell you if we received your 1040x for another 60 days."") but at least I know what filing a petition in tax court is. It seems for every unhelpful, overworked, and annoyed person answering phones at the IRS, there is .1 people who are empathic and willing to go above and beyond. I'm grateful for those people.


And finally, for those wondering. I think my tax guy down at H&amp;R block biffed it. The 1040x was completed properly and It seems that I've paid my taxes, but he didn't include a copy of my C SE. This seems to be causing the confusion.",finance

I am originally from country A. This country's financial and political future is very uncertain. And I am pretty sure that I won't be returning to this country.

I am currently working in country B. I will be here for a minimum of 3 years and I am absolutely loving it so far.

My employer is registered in country C.

I would like to get my salary paid into an account in a country other than country A. Due to the very undeveloped nature of country B I would prefer not to have it paid there either. Especially since getting paid in country B will mean serious taxes and an inability to send money to country A where my parents still live and where my insurances and retirement funds currently are. Country C is Mauritius, so I don't really know if having a bank account there will be the best option.

Does anyone have experience with something like this? What is my best course of action. Where should I open an account and with which bank.

personalfinance,Help With $25.5k of CC Debt - Should I Take Chase Payment Plan?,"24 years old with $25.5-$26k in debt. Lost job in November. Have been paying minimum payments (roughly $700 a month between five cards). This month would be extremely hard to meet payments. 

Through older threads I've learned that Chase has extended hardship program generous terms to others. 3 of my 5 cards are chase (Sapphire, United Explorer, British Airways). 

On Sunday, I held the following thought process - In an ideal world, I would like for my minimum payments to be $0 for a few months (until I get another job) and/or for 0% interest for a bit, so my $500 a month in minimum payments actually starts to whittle down the roughly $20k of debt I have on those cards. 

After speaking with Chase on Monday, they said that they could not do this. But what they could do is lower my interest rate to 2%, and put me on a 60 month repayment plan that results in minimum payments of $350. How might this plan affect my credit score? The credit bureau specialist I spoke with wasn’t quite clear on how it will show up on my credit report told me that it should not negatively impact my credit, but I am (honestly, I just couldn’t understand what he was saying and am hoping someone here with experience with this can break it down into English for me).",finance

personalfinance,Question Regarding Sudden Change in Taxes (US),"Hi All - 

We had a pretty big change in our taxes this year, I'm pretty sure I'm done them correctly (going to triple check my math tonight, hoping the problem is on our end) but we've gone from receiving about $1500 in a tax refund to owing about $1200 in taxes this year. Not the end of the world for us, I'm just more hoping for some insight from PF on what might have caused the problem and how to correct it for next year, ideally we'd be ZERO in tax refund or credit.

Some back ground - 

Wife and I file jointly, historically she has had zero income and we have one child to claim as a dependent. In the 7 years we've been filing jointly we've always received about $1500/year federal tax refund, this year we owe $1200. Here's some math on our filing

I received two raises in this past tax cycle, started around $105,000 in June 2015, raised to 115,000 in january 2016, and in march 2016 to around $130,000 (not sure if these screwed something up). My wife started working part time this year, earned a total of $6000 pre-tax. 

We claim 1 child as a dependent, no concerns about that. 

No other investments for income, but we paid about $7k in mortgage interest and about $300 in student loan interest. I have about $1000 in other deductions from charitable donations/other tax rebates we scored in the year. 

One thing that I've noticed is that the $1k child tax credit starts to reduce one you earn $110,000 and completely dissolves at $130,000. Our combined W-2s show us hitting more-or-less exactly $130,000 this year, so no child tax credit. 

It's really aggravating because the only thing I can think of is that between my wife's income and my raises we're suddenly losing out a other (?) tax credits and it would actually have better financially (not morale/independence wise) for my wife to not work last year. 

Would it be worth attempting to file separately?

Any other information that might be useful?

EDIT - My suspicion is that I'm claiming three exemptions, me, my wife and my child. Now that my wife has income in excess of $1,500 it looks like I can no longer claim her as an exemption (because she likely put herself down as an exemption).",finance

investing,This is why I am still short Ford Motors (F) stock and long Tesla (TSLA):,"This is why I am still short Ford Motors (F) stock and long Tesla (TSLA):

1) For Ford, analysts are forecasting a yearly earnings decrease of -5.74% over last year.  Analysts expect earnings growth next year for Ford of 5.49%.  For Tesla, over the next five years, the analysts are expecting it to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 30%.

2) Socially responsible investing is a good investment strategy and the consequences of it are significant.  According to the US SIF Foundation’s 2016 Report on Sustainable and Responsible Investing Trends in the United States, as of year-end 2015, more than one out of every five dollars under 
professional management in the United States—$8.72 trillion or more—was invested according to socially respsonsible strategies. 

3) Tesla's advertising budget is roughly $0 per year.  Demand for their cars is so strong that they don't have the manufacturing capacity to make them fast enough.  

4) Ford's advertising budget is over $2billion/year.  94% of Ford's advertising is spent trying to increase demand for their gas guzzling cars and trucks.  

5) Demand is so flat for Ford's gas guzzling cars and trucks that they have to idle their plants several times a year.

6) Most people don't know this, but electric cars are 50%+ cheaper to drive than their equivalent gasoline guzzling counterparts (after the car is driven off the lot).  Who doen't want %50+ off their gas bill?  Please see below for easy calculations.  Ford fails to mention this mathmatical algorithm when they advertise their gas guzzling cars and trucks.  Tesla doesn't have to mention it because they don't have to advertise the economic benefits of driving an electric vehicle.   

7) An idling internal combustion engine vehicle consumes between .16  to 1 gallons of gasoline per hour of driving.  Obvioulsly, Ford fails to mention this when they advertise their gas guzzling cars and trucks.  Tesla doesn't have to mention it because they don't have to advertise the mechanical benefits of driving an electric vehicle.  

8) Electric vehicles don't ""idle"" in the same way as internal combustion engine vehicles do; and thereby won't waste the estimated 6 billion gallons of gallon of gasoline per year people in the US consume going nowhere.   Ford fails to mention this when they advertise their gas guzzling cars and trucks.  Tesla doesn't have to. 

9) The formula for the cost (in dollars) to drive an internal combustion vehicle vs. the cost to drive an electric vehicle is as follows (where -1 means the reciprocal, or 1 divided by the variable):

Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)-1]-1 = z dollars per mile.  

Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile.  If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

Likewise, [(d miles per gallon) * (e miles per kWh)-1 * (f dollars per kWh)] = g dollars per gallon gasoline equivalent for driving an electric vehicle. If g &lt; the current price of a gallon of gasoline, then the electric vehicle is cheaper to drive.

For most vehicles, the calculations show that it is a lot cheaper to drive a mile in an electric vehicle (40 - 60% cheaper). Therefore, for both people and companies who drive a lot (i.e. UPS, FED EX), as well as those individuals and companies who lease their vehicles, it makes good economic sense to switch to electric vehicles, correct?

8) Emissions from internal combustion vehicles smell really, really bad.

I had some missed payments from 2009 which are no longer showing on my credit report and her student loans are paid off. Her score is now 820 and mine is around 785 (all depending on who you ask of course). 

The Mortgage, interest and taxes all together total about $1900/ month. Our goal is to move out of the house in a few years (4-6 years) and move into a new home.

The alternative of course is that I take the extra money that I would spend on closing costs and higher payments and put that aside in some sort of account. 

My financial advisor hasn't given me much guidance on this (presumably because he doesn't sell mortgage refis). How should I be thinking about this, fellow redditors?

gaming,GameStop's Circle of Life: my story.,"My story with the never ending bullshit that is GameStop's business model is not as bad as others', but I thought I would share it anyways.

I own a New 3DS, and it's probably the machine I play games on the second most, next to my PC. I've always been a Nintendo fan (well, not lately, but that's another story), and due to the immense amount of play time my 3DS gets, it's starting to break down. Screen is getting dirty, buttons not as springy, R button giving me trouble, etc.

Anywho, me and my brother saved up some money, and we wanted to get a new New 3DS so I can play Mario Maker and Kriby without frustration. My brother would also get a new one so that he would stop borrowing mine to play Pokémon. I live in the Valley, so the only place anywhere near  is to get games and consoles is GameStop. I've had problems there before, but nothing really terrible.

We call a Lyft to get us to the GameStop, and arrive with hopes in our hearts and money in our pockets. Now, I previously checked online for stock, as I have had stock problems at this location before, even when I preorder (such as the NES Classic Disaster of 2016). The website they had multiple copies of different colors and styles of the New 3DS in stock at that location. We walked in and went to the front desk. It was rainy and dark, and nobody was in the store except myself, my brother, and the clerk.

We go to the counter after looking around for a bit. I won't disclose which location I was at, but let's just say that it was small and obviously understaffed. We approach the counter. I know this will sound like something out of r/talesfromretail, but bear with me. I will be M, the clerk will be C, and my brother will be B.

C: Hi, welcome to GameStop, (insert pre-order spiel here)?

M: No thanks. I would like to purchase a New 3DS, please.

C: Alright, one second... (types at computer) OK, will that be a new or used system?

M: New please. (I have had a very poor experience with used systems before, and I would rather not spend $10 less for a half-broken system)

C: One moment... (types at computer) I'm sorry, we are out of stock at this time. We do have the used system if you want.

M: (Confused expression) Are... are you sure? Your website said you have them in stock here... and I reserved a copy for this store.

C: I'm sorry, we are out of stock. You can get the used copy, and you can get the warranty if you are worried about the system being broken... 

(Red flag. The warranty is bullshit. I have had this exact scenario shoved in my face before. One of the poor experiences that I mentioned earlier was GameStop selling me a DS Lite with the warranty. Problem was the console was broken and multiple buttons would not work. I brought it back, and they refused to refund me because ""the warranty did not cover those damages"", even though they sold it to me not two hours ago.)

M: No thank you. I have had issues with used systems and warranty a while ago.

C: Alright... but I assure you (insert spiel about used systems and warranties here)

M: (Starting to get slightly agitated) It's alright, I am not interested in buying used.

(Now, before I begin the next part, I have to mention that my brother has Autism. In fact, so do I, but it isn't noticeable with me. Though my brother is very reserved in retail situations, he has two things that help out: an eye for things I don't see and a built-in lie detector. He can tell when someone is BSing us to get a better deal for themselves. His skills and my speech and general know-how make us a great team. Thought I'd add that.)

C: Look, the used-

B: You say you are out of stock of new systems?

C:...yes?

B: Even though your website says different? Just clarifying.

C: Yes, sometimes our system glitches up-

B: Then, what is that? (Points to walk behind clerk)

(I had not noticed it, but in the glass case behind the clerk had multiple boxes stacked up. They read: New Nintendo 3DS XL. Bingo.)

C:(Turns to look, gets flustered) Wha... th... those?

B: Those look like new copies to me. (He has a good memory when the occasion calls for it, and he told me later that he remembered those boxes from when we bought our New 3DS when it came out.)

C: Those... are... (grasping at straws) display copies.

M: (I shoot my brother the ""I got it from here"" look) Display copies?

C: Yes. (This guy is worse at lying than some of the guys in LA Noire)

M: You need twelve display copies?

C: (Turns around. There are around twelve copies. They are even in plastic wrap, sitting next to ""display copies"" of Battleborn. Probably why the game didn't sell well, maybe all the copies are ""display copies"".)...Yes.

M: (I look at my brother. We shake our heads.) Right. If all those are display copies, I suppose we can take our business elsewhere. (We start to walk out.)

C: Wait, do you want to purchase some of our used 3DS games? They are guaranteed to work... (Clerk seems not to notice that you need the console before you can buy games)

M: Once again, no thanks. Have a good day. (We leave)

That was a couple weeks ago. I showed my brother the new Jinquisition episode, and it all started to make sense. The guy was desperate to sell us the used console. So much that he would rather disappoint customers and refuse to sell consoles as a last-ditch effort to sell us the used 3DS. That also explains why he randomly tried to sell us used games for a console we had not bought yet. I also failed to mention that, during one of his scripted spiels, he kept pressuring us to pre-order the Nintendo Switch, even though I made it clear that I was not interested in the slightest (that's another post for another time).

Wow, this turned out longer than I expected. Lesson learned: GameStop loses us as loyal customers until they stop BSing us. I'm sure others have had similar experiences. So a word to anyone: please buy your games and consoles from other retailers until GameStop knocks this off.

TL;DR: Clerk lies to our face in order to push the GameStop agenda of making money over satisfying customers.",technology

personalfinance,Why don't we pay off loans in order of highest interest (NOT highest rate)?,"The two most common methods I see for paying off loans are snowball (paying off the lowest balance) and avalanche (paying off the highest interest rate). I understand the merits of these approaches, but neither of them seems like the optimal solution in the following scenario.

&amp;nbsp;

Say I have two loans:

&amp;nbsp;

Loan A
&amp;nbsp;
Principle: $10,000
&amp;nbsp;
Interest Rate: 2% 

&amp;nbsp;

Loan B
&amp;nbsp;
Principle: $1,000
&amp;nbsp;
Interest Rate: 6%

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming yearly compounded interest, interest paid over the first 3 years looks like this:

&amp;nbsp;

Year 1
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan A: $200
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan B: $60

&amp;nbsp;

Year 2
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan A: $204
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan B: $63.60

&amp;nbsp;

Year 3
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan A: $208.08
&amp;nbsp;
Interest on Loan B: $67.44

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously interest is compounding faster on Loan B, but Loan A is still costing me more in interest, and will continue to do so for a while before Loan B surpasses it. Both the Avalanche and Snowball method would say I should pay off Loan B first, yet to me paying down Loan A seems like the priority, at least until the actual interest charged matches Loan B. 

&amp;nbsp;

What am I missing here? Why is this not a common piece of advice?

personalfinance,Is Capital One telling the truth for my situation?,"I have one credit card, my first, and I've been very diligent in my payments and responsible in using it.

I decided to ask about lowering my interest rate and the representative told me that they couldn't even see what lower rates they could offer because my interest actually has to go into effect first. 
 
Is this correct or are they just giving me the run-around? Do I really have to take the 24% hit *first* and *then* negotiate?

datascience,Small to mid-size project ideas on PURE text mining?,"Hello. I am developing an online course for Text Mining to be completed in 15 days for which I need to build a small project to be demonstrated to students. Now the problem is that my supervisor is strict on the project being as much about Text Mining as possible and less about general Data Mining. I had earlier proposed a project where I (through sentiment analysis) calculated the emotion rating for movie reviews (this was the Text Mining part) and fed these ratings into a Collaborative Filtering algorithm to develop a recommender system. This idea was rejected since it involved Collaborative Filtering which is more of a Data Mining thing. So can you guys suggest to me some little to medium complexity projects that deal with Text Mining mostly? Maybe something involving advanced techniques in Sentiment Analysis?

Note: I can't use Twitter data because of reasons. Any other ideas would be much appreciated.

Note 2: I also can't use the most basic sentiment analysis technique of calculating the positive score of a text through calculating the sum of all its positive words. Anything more advanced than this is welcome.",technology

personalfinance,"If mortgage interest rates go up, will house prices come down? (US)","So i'm looking at mortgage interest rates and it seems like they are pretty low historically.

Is this the same with mortgages and houses or are they somehow decoupled?

My monthly bills come to about $1,800 (rent, car payment &amp; insurance, phone bill, utilities, groceries, gas, gym membership, and a medical bill that I have set up on a monthly payment plan. 

That doesn't include my student loan payment which is a minimum payment of $103 a month, but I always pay more, usually whatever I can budget in that month. My loans are consolidated ($32000) with a 4.375% interest rate. 

I have about $1400 in my savings account right now that I will not touch unless it's an emergency. I try to contribute a bit of each pay check to this savings. 

So, after college I was between jobs and had to rely on my credit card for a little while. I also had some unforeseen medical issues come up with terrible insurance, so once again had to rely on the credit card. This included two cross state moves, helping my sister with some college tuition so she was kicked out, and, I will admit, some bad spending habits that I have now broken. The current balance is $4700, and I finally feel like I'm in a financially stable place that I can afford to aggressively start paying it off. I want to get rid of this debt so I can start saving for a house (paying rent is like throwing away money to me). I have never missed a payment, and my current credit score according to my statement is 701. I would like this higher for said house. 

My issue is I don't know if should just pay the minimum on my student loans for a while and aggressively pay the credit card down? Or just balance between student loans and credit card. 

My tax refund will be about $1200. My original plan was to just immediately put that towards my credit card. 

My job gives the option to work overtime right now due to short staffing, which is time and a half pay. I am going to try picking up at least one extra shift a pay period. Easier said than done, as I do only work 3 12-hour shifts a week, but the burnout is real in nursing. That's a different story though.

My total monthly expenses come out to around $800 and my net income is around $1700 a month. I'm using the rest of my income and putting it towards my smaller loans and snowballing my debt down.

alimony order of $8,500 per month for the next 7 years

separately owned property: 

1. condo in Queen Ann Seattle - currently valued at $350,000 with no mortgage owing. Older 1940's building with capital expenditures on the rise.  Move from building residents to make this an only owner occupied building.  Currently rented for $1600 per month with $492 monthly association fees

2. modest older house in Shelton with three bedrooms and a full garage separated from house by a breezeway and 9 bare lots - house currently valued at $175,000 with no mortgage owing.  Rented out for $850 with $800 coming to me after property management company fees paid. 

3. 1920’s house in Kelowna BC with no mortgage owing.  House is on very busy road and currently valued at $400,000-$450,000.  My son and young family live here.  This has been a family home since 1970’s and although we love it, with a new baby the street is just very busy. The city will 4 lane this road within 5 years.  Kelowna is the fastest growing city in British Columbia and is currently listed as the best place to start a new business in Canada.  Population is diverse and fairly high income.  Lots of skiing, wineries, hiking and 100 mile long lake make Kelowna one of the most desirable places in Canada to live.  Kelowna also experiencing high growth because of foreign investment tax of 15% implemented in Vancouver creating a spillover of foreign money into Kelowna.  

4. house in Kelowna BC.  !980’s split level with nice yard on quiet street.  Four bedroom two bathroom, well maintained.  Purchased for $485,000 in September 2016 and prices have gone up since.  Currently mortgaged for $242,000.00.  Probably resale value $500,000.  New high efficiency furnace installed in December.  

Jointly owned properties with ex-husband:

1. House on 5 acres in Olympia WA.  Currently valued at $635,000.  Very high utilities because of unique features of house - indoor endless pool and infrared sauna and some heated floors.  House is 4 stories high with a lot of windows.  Very shady, forested location without much capability of solar or growing food, shade increasing because of neighbours trees growing and blocking out sun.  I currently reside here and love the house and have lived here for 10 years but it is lonely and very big.  It is also very private which is a desirable feature.  Most of the 5 acres is wetland and inaccessible to foot or motorized access.  Attached to the house is another building lot to the north currently valued at $70,000 and is to go with the house as per the divorce settlement but could be sold off separately.  This was purchased to provide a privacy buffer from neighbours building close to the house.  House has private well so water is not a cost.  Currently owing $336,000.00.  

2. small old house on 5 acres of prime arable land in city of Olympia.  Land is slated for subdivision for 6-8 lots.  City of Olympia water costs are very high.  House has two bedrooms, one bathroom and is in fair condition although a lot of money has been spent to get it in rentable condition. Upgrades to kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, bedrooms and roof.   I have grown a garlic crop here for 5 years with great success. Currently owing $186,000.00.  Currently valued at $310,000.00.  Ex is adamant he wants this property, probably because he has the ability to develop the lots.  

3. 1500 square foot house on 1/2 acre in lake forest park suburb of Seattle.  This house has been upgraded a fair amount, and has two separate units that can be rented out for $1100 and $2200 per month.  There is a small stream running through the property and potential for nice landscaping.  Currently owing $272,000. Valued at $550-575,000. Ex wants me to trade equity straight across for house 2.  

Current cash reserves 
$527,681 with $83,100 additional funds in IRA

I have no job as of the end of February, when I lose my employment with my former company that my ex got in the divorce settlement.  I have static costs of $623/mo for medical, and I have a medical condition that may cause me to become unemployable in the future, although through my own research I have been able to get my condition under control through diet, although it is anyone’s guess how long this reprieve will last.  The prognosis under the worst case scenario is loss of motor control, or dementia, or schizophrenia, or all three.  Other members of my family have it and my father at the age of 79 still has fairly good motor control although he has developed periodic schizophrenia and has a very poor memory.  The medical treatments I have planned for myself cost approximately $350 per session and should be done 4 times a month.  I plan to purchase a hyperbaric oxygen tank for self treatment and hopefully this will ensure better functioning in the future.  I currently have no symptoms.  

So basically I have some major challenges I am facing with medical expenses.  I am a dual citizen so I can go back to Canada and re-enroll in medical but the medical system there is very slow and difficult to get proper treatments.  There being no freedom of access based on ability to pay puts me at the mercy of whatever doctors think is medically necessary so I will have much less ability to draw up my own treatment plan.  

Possible scenarios:
1.	Pay out the lake forest park house with cash available.  Rent out both units. Sell the condo, and buy out the large Olympia house with the pool.  Keep the Shelton house with a long term renter and a rental management company.  Either rent out part of the Olympia house or rent it all out and move to either a rental house that is smaller and more in line with my needs or move back to the 80’s split level in Canada. 
2.	Pay out the lake forest park house, keep the condo in Queen Ann, and try to mortgage the large house in Olympia with the bank.  Keep a presence in the USA and try to manage real estate as a job.  Perhaps form an LLC property management company to manage my own and perhaps other people’s properties, since I’ve had a lot of experience with it now.  
3.	Sell all real estate in the USA and invest in blue chip stocks or else more real estate in Canada.  I was thinking of selling both houses in Kelowna and buying an acreage further out of Kelowna so my granddaughter and son and daughter in law would be able to raise her without the traffic, noise and hazards of the old house in Kelowna on the busy road.  However this would put me out of the Kelowna area and hospital should I need to be close to it. Also no theatre, culture, amenities if I move out to the boonies.  

My big questions are as follows:

1.	Given the volatility of the united states, is it wise to keep so much money and assets in this country?  Canadian currency is very low in value right now compared to US, and my conversion rate is the highest it has been in years.  I could pay out my mortgage in Canada and be debt free in that country.  There is a possibility that the Kelowna market could crash but it does not look likely.  
2.	is it worthwhile to sell out my US real estate now, get a good price but yet deprive myself of rental income in the future and invest instead in blue chip dividend paying stocks?  If interest rates rise, my investments in real estate may devalue quickly.  My ability to sell to raise cash may be hampered.  One real estate agent reflected that in times of financial crisis he could not sell anything in lake forest park, and I am concerned that this is a prime window to sell now, due to low interest rates, low supply and high desirability of the Seattle area. 
3.	Given my muddy prospects for earning potential in the future, and possible mobility issues, does it seem realistic to keep these holdings in the US and try to act as a remote landlord? Renting houses is a not that simple and with problems with tenants, or depreciation or capital expenditures, I may end up spending more money on keeping things running than I am actually making on rental income.  With taxes, insurance, and capital expenditures and the possibility of losing money if interest rates rise, is this a wise choice to continue acting as a landlady?
4.	Given that I ultimately will end up living in Canada as I get older, is there a path to setting things up now to make things as profitable for myself as possible, with cross border taxation issues, and residency issues bringing to bear on the decision.  I don’t know much about it but I believe that in order for my heir (son) to benefit from my holdings, it would be better to liquidate while I am still alive and move everything to Canada.  I think there is an exit tax or something that the united states imposes when settling an estate.

personalfinance,My employer hasn’t had me fill out a W-4 and just cuts me a check at the end of the pay period. How would I report this on my taxes?,"To be honest, this whole situation just feels weird to me and I’d like some outside input. Sorry if I have formatting issues, this is just a throwaway.

I’m a young adult who’s worked in several restaurants and I got a job about a month and a half ago at a new one after quitting my old job. I worked a couple shifts before I realized that my boss had never had me fill out a W-4, so I took the liberty of doing it myself, plus attaching a copy of my SS card and driver’s license. When I went to give it to my boss, he just told me to put it in his office and he’d get to it. Well, it’s been a month and it hasn’t moved from where I put it. He hasn’t looked at any of it.

My boss cuts me a check at the end of the pay period, just a plain check. No taxes withheld—not federal, state, or local. He does this with almost everyone else who works for him too, with the exception of management. Like I said before, I’ve worked in several restaurants and this just feels very strange to me? I’ve filled out a W-4 at literally every job I’ve had up to this point. This is a small business with fewer than 15 employees, so I know they might not have the same set of regulations as my other jobs might have had, but I’m still unsure.

So I guess I have two questions:

1)	Is this legal on my employer’s part? To be blunt about it. 
2)	If it is legal, how would I report this on my taxes next year? Would I report it as self-employment or under “other” income on my federal tax return? I am soon starting a tutoring job in which I’m an independent contractor, so I’d be filling out a 1040-ES and making quarterly payments anyway… should I just include this job’s income as well?

Thanks for helping out a confused young individual. 

EDIT: I'm not sure if this is too relevant, but this job is just a supplement to my current income, so I don't think I'll be making more than $5,000 per year with it. Still, I am curious.",finance

personalfinance,Need help understanding why 2nd W-2 drops refund by $250,"I have read the sidebar links which were very useful and scrolled through a couple pages of posts hoping maybe someone posted about a similar scenario but wasn't able to get the information I needed from those resources.

In 2016 I worked for two employers. On my W-2 for the first company my wages, tips, other compensation totals ~$11.6k with $992 federal income tax withheld. On my second W-2 which is my current employer, the numbers are ~$13.8k wages and $1,425 withheld. This is all in Texas so no state taxes.

I am young so I don't have dependents, assets, or students loans, filing as single head of household. From what I can tell I should be getting the standard deduction. When I put this all through a tax calculator it says my tax return should be around $1200, but here's where I get confused.

When I put in the first W-2 I mentioned into TurboTax (the free one but not the EZ) it calculates my tax return at $858. Then when I put in my second W-2, my total return somehow drops to $604. To troubleshoot (thinking maybe something was wrong with the second W-2 somehow) I tried putting the total wages and withheld in as if it was all from my first employer/W-2 and it still says my tax return is $604. How does this happen? Should I only be getting $604 or does it look like something is wrong?",finance
personalfinance,"Doing taxes since I have everything, usually do turbo tax.","I was about to file my return when turbo tax showed me this year they wanted $110 for my taxes.

Wife didn't have health insurance for 9 months, but since monthly premiums for us together are 215 a month we're eligible for the waiver.

Wife was terminated in January and we withdrew her 401k, was just about $300 but turbo tax made us upgrade to the ""deluxe"" edition to include that, and now it's charging to file for each state too.

TL:DR
Turbotax is listed on irs.gov as ""free"" but it isn't. I need a truly free tax e-file site that can handle multiple states, moving, healthcare penalty waiver, and is good for families making $30k or less. Federal &amp; state preferred.",finance

1) Any recommendations for a savings account? Is it even worth it? I see interest rates well below 1%.

2) When I put money away, how can I divide it up so I know how much I saved for each goal. For example, within a savings account, is it possible to break down my overall savings into ""sections"" for each goal, or do I just have to look at one overall amount and just do the math myself.

personalfinance,"Filing taxes as ""Married"" killed wife's refund amount but mine not affected?","Hi everyone. My wife and I were married in November 2016. Now that it is tax time, we're trying to figure out how best to file, but seeing something strange. Short version is that my refund amounts pretty much stay the same no matter what option we take (single, married filing separately or married filing jointly), but her refund practically disappears if she files in either of the ""married"" options. Details as follows:

- Using TurboTax for returns (we've been using this for along time).
- We live in California.
- I made $105k and she made $55k in 2016.
- If I file as single, my refund would be $6413 fed/$2300 state.
- If I file as married filing separately, my refund is exactly the same as filing single.
- If she files as single, her refund is $1050 fed/$239 state.
- If she files as married filing separately, her refund is $150 fed/-$65 for state.
- If we file married filing jointly, fed is $6503 and state is $2244.

So we're wondering what is the reason for her tax refund change because we're now married but mine is not affected? Since there is no drastic change between either of the ""married"" options, should we file jointly or separate?

Thanks in advance for the help!

I figured there must be some clerical error on the part of my employer, but this morning they showed me that on my W-4 I had somehow claimed 10 exemptions. I have no idea why or how I would have done that. I'm pretty clueless about filling those things out, but they also showed me that in 2015 I had claimed 3 exemptions. 

I don't think this is my employer's error, it looked like my handwriting. This is causing me, for the first time in many years, to owe taxes. Over $3100. I don't have anywhere near that amount of money to be able to pay that.

First of all, is there anything I can do to fix this? Or am I screwed?

Second, I understand the IRS will allow you to go on a payment plan if you can't afford the owed taxes. How does that work, who do I contact, and what are the terms? Like, how long do they let you pay it off and do they charge interest?

Final question, is it worth spending the money to go to an actual tax consultant to help me with this?

And yes, I made made sure I only put three exemptions on this year's W-4.

An unrelated question, but Turbo Tax also told me I couldn't claim my kid because he turned 18 in November 2016. He's still in high school. I thought you could continue to claim kids as long as they were full time students. Any advice about that would also be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,For fun--brain storm. Looking for experienced PF folks to get creative and help me and my family start our next life journey,"Apologies if this is not appropriate, too vague, weird, or whatever. I love Reddit and this sub. A lot of the questions I see posted in here are super-specific and generally require some type of expertise or experience in an specific area to resolve. I figured I'd throw a mental exercise out there to start a discussion that will help me, but also maybe help other people who are doing similar thought experiments.
   
Main goals of this post: 
* get more complete thoughts and insight that I haven't thought about 
   
* get specific resources to meet general financial goals
   
* get creative location/lifestyle suggestions I can research further
   
My wife, newborn, and I are in our early 30s and thinking about moving away from our fast-paced, high cost of living area in California. We're about 10 years into our careers, so we're hitting that slump, and want to not get ""stuck"" in the 2.5 hour commute we've been doing, high-stress education environment, etc. We love a lot of different kinds of places wanted to see if anyone had any creative ideas on where we can move to, fun jobs/careers we can explore, or tricks to live simply and take a few years off, or anything really. Just looking for a change, but not something so drastic and dangerous/risky we jeopardize our careers or long-term stability. 
   
Some basic information about us:
* Both come from an education background, but have done well for ourselves in administration/well-paying teaching roles in our area. Our experience is pretty wide and interesting, so we think we are pretty marketable (at least on paper)
   
* No debt or obligations outside of mortgage and normal things like utilities/phone, with about $400k in equity in our house (After real estate fees if we sell). Our interest rate is 2.25 and starts adjusting in 2020
   
* We have about 200k in our 401ks, and 75k in emergency funds
   
* We have a small side business that is expected to make a little money this year, but it's low-key and we can take it anywhere basically
   
* Currently make about $165k together, save 25% pre tax and 5% post tax
   
* If we rented our house out and moved, we'd net some modest money each month, something like $500 after mortgage/taxes/insurance/management
   
So I'm basically just looking for you all to dream up fun scenarios where we could post up in a cool small coastal town for a year, generate some investment income, work a new job, spend time with the baby, pursue mental health, etc. Or anything really.

personalfinance,Deciding on a budget for a new (used) car,"Hola,
Long-time lurker. I will keep this short. My 20 year old car is on death row (I do repairs myself so I know it's got a rear main seal that is leak
ing onto the flywheel making the clutch iffy and I don't want to get into the bell housing again) and I am considering purchasing a used car in the next 4 months. I want some strangers to poke holes in my plan or suggest something wiser. 

Firstly, my after tax/HSA/401k/IRA pay is about $2400 per month. 

Monthly expenses are about $1100 per month ( I budget with Mint and this is an average of the last 8 months). Expenses also include a $15000 student loan I am paying off. I had really hoped to pay it all off before getting another car, but my izusu has other plans. 

And I have approximately $11000 in savings (not counting the $7200 I have set aside as an emergency fund or any of my (maxed out) retirement accounts. 

I am looking at some 3-4 year old civics (maybe an SI would be cool) that are in the $12000 to $15000 range depending on mileage (25k-60k). 

I am working on saving up, but if my car dies tomorrow, is $15k something I can afford? Not looking to buy anything else big like a house or have kids. 

If so, what is the best way to make up the $4000 dollar difference? Personal loan through my bank or a credit union that can offer a low interest rate? Financing at the dealership? 

Any advice or personal anecdotes welcome!

Don't want to bloat my post with personal stuff, so I'll give cliff notes. I'm very physically disabled and partially blind. Reconstructed spine and heart, Marfan Syndrome, etc etc. I'm on SSI Disability, so my monthly income is 735$ flat without change for my life. I'm 24 and because of being disabled could never get a job or build credit of any meaningful kind. So little that I got turned down for a secured credit card. Bank offered to give me a 500$ secured card and upgrade me to a real one in 6 months with good use, but I kept that offer open for now.

Using a computer is most of what my life is, 12 hours a day when I'm not eating, sleeping or working out against doctors wishes. I need a new one, and a good one for my particular needs is in the thousand dollar range. 

Normally I'd just save for it, but unfortunately is both against the rules of SSI D and questionably a federal fraud charge if I'm ever caught with more than 2000$ of tracked money. 2000 asset limit makes saving very very hard.

personalfinance,What order should I pay off my student loans?,"Hello. I just started paying off my students loans. I made the first payment on January 19th in the amount of $135.10. That was the minimum amount that the website is telling me to pay.

Principal Balance  $5,468.42
Interest Balance     +$12.55
Current Balance  **$5,480.97** @ 4.410%

Principal Balance  $2,042.10
Interest Balance     +$4.29
Current Balance  **$2,046.39** @ 4.040%

I feel like paying only the minimum amount will accrue too much interest. If I pay only $135.10 for the next 10 years, I have to pay about $3000 in interest and total of $16000 for an original loan amount of $13000.

I make $3000 monthly and I have literally no expenses. I live with my parents, no car, and just sometimes phone bill to help my family. 

I am planning to pay $250 monthly and I put 100% emphasis on the highest interest rate for the excess pay allocation but is $115 more worth it?

And I asked them if a friend of mine could open an account from US without coming here and their answer was that as long it's OK within our law (US) it's fine with them.

personalfinance,Using TurboTax. Should working a 2nd job as a pizza driver three months really reduce my tax return by $400? More info in the description.,"I'm a young single male without children living in Texas.  I don't own property.  In 2016 I worked two jobs.  One job as a cleaner at a factory and one as a pizza deliver.  I was technically employed at the pizza place four months of 2016 but only worked three.  The last month of those four I was put on leave.  On average I worked 36 hours per week as a cleaner (making $15 per hour) and 20 a week as a pizza deliverer (making $12 per hour total).  

The free version of Turbo Tax seems to think that I would normally get about $1,300 if I had only worked as a cleaner, but when I add my delivery job it reduces that amount to around $900.  That just doesn't sound right to me.  I tried adding in my mileage cost, maintenance cost, car payment, and $600 dollars worth of repairs to the business expense sections for my car since I was using it for deliveries.  I don't own the car, but my brother in law has me pay him once a month payments on it (which he keeps record of) and is eventually going to let me own it.  

Adding the expenses in didn't help.  Turbo tax seems to tell me that unless my expenses are over $1,200, that I'm better off with the typical normal tax return that doesn't require those details.  Turbo tax seems to tell me that the typical tax return suggested is what will give me my maximum, which is only $900.  That doesn't make since to me.  Here are the numbers on my W2s.

personalfinance,"""Your refund is not your return"" and other tax tips.","Things to know when filing your US federal tax **return** in the hope of getting a **refund**, or at least owing less.

1.  You can probably do it yourself, if you want to; it's not usually hard if you use a program.  It will probably be free if you are a typical redditor, but maybe not if you have a lot of complexity.   https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ohy01/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/

2.  If you don't want to do it yourself because it's too complicated, do yourself a favor and talk to a real accountant.  H&amp;R Block doesn't count.  If you qualify for VITA (https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-you-by-volunteers), that's a great option for free help, too.

3.  Make sure you have all your forms before you start.   You may not have received everything yet, including investment 1099s or health care forms, or a W2 from that job early last year that had to be forwarded to your new address. Filing an amended return because you forgot something is an inconvenience to be avoided if possible.

4.  If you find yourself owing money, that doesn't mean you did anything wrong.  It probably just means you got more during during the year.  If you would rather get money next year instead of this year, you can update your W4 to have more money withheld.

5.  If you worked two or more jobs, you probably are getting a smaller refund than you expected, or even owe money.   This is because of how withholding works.   The liability from both jobs together is more than either job thinks you will owe by itself.  Otherwise, see point 4 just above.  Ignore any intermediate results suggesting a bigger refund during the process of entering W2s, those are not valid for your situation.

6.  There are rules for who can be claimed as a dependent, either qualifying child, or qualifying  relative.  These are based on relationship, age, and amount of support provided / the supposed dependent's income.   These are unrelated to FAFSA status.  Read about them here: https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Family/Rules-for-Claiming-a-Dependent-on-Your-Tax-Return/INF12139.html

7.  Filing jointly is usually a win for married couples.  Sometimes it isn't, especially if you have income-based repayment of student loans.  Try calculating it both ways and see what you get.  If you find yourselves owing money filing jointly, see if you both filed W4s saying ""married""; that usually results in underwitholding.  Fix your W4s with the IRS withholding calculator, or with single rates. 

8.  At this point, you can't change your tax liability very much.  There are a few ways some people can save money if they qualify for traditional IRA deductions or HSA contributions for last year, but you have to meet various eligibility tests and limits.  (Note that you may end up paying more than your true liability if you don't take advantage of all tax benefits you are entitled to, including credits for children, child care, tuition, etc.)   

9.  Most redditors will use the standard deduction, unless they have lots (&gt;$6300/12,600) of itemized deductions like state income taxes, mortgage interest and property taxes.   So if you can't itemize, you can't claim small deductions for that laptop you bought for work, or the cost of tax prep software.  You can potentially claim certain ""adjustments"", though, like student loan interest, and IRA and HSA contributions, even if you don't itemize.

10.  Unless you are in one of the seven states without such things, don't forget to do state income taxes.  Usually these follow federal tax policy to some extent, but each state has its own unique quirks.  If you have to file multiple state returns, you have our sympathy.

More information about these and many many tax questions can be found online as well, including the very helpful web site from our friends at irs.gov.",finance

I am attempting to get down debt as quick as possible. I have done a good job thus far I feel but I am looking for a bit more push to make it even quicker.  
Here Is a complete break down of our finance situation.  

We are in our late 20's  

My Yearly PRE-Tax Income is $83,000 (Salary) + $5,000 Side work
My Wife's Income is $34,000 (Salary)

I have 
$44,831 @ 4.8% AVG Student Loan debt  $94/mo MIN PMT, I usually pay double   
$10,981 @ 2.8% (Car 1) $230/mo PMT  
$7,800 @ 3.4% (Car 2) $210/mo PMT  
$5740 @ 2.0% (4 Wheeler - We have a farm, this is a writeoff) $140/mo PMT  
$671 @ 5.1% (Credit Card) I usually $150 a month if this goes over $500 until zero balance  

My Wifes Debt is  
$53,000 @ 6.8% $210/mo (Student Loans)  

My Accessible savings is a little over $10,000 (Oh Shit fund)  
My Non-Accessible funds are $40,000's Roths, Investments, cds, etc  

Monthly Mortage is $840 (mortage not included in debt due to being gifted a home, until said person passes/ Downside no tax advantage)  

Our primary goal is to get for sure the student loans paid in full within 5 years. The car loans were extended out for longer than usual due to interest rate and just incase we ran into hardship my wife could nearly support if needed. We have two kids but they are young and dont have ALOT of overhead atm.  

We'd like to get the big debt off of our heads before they get much older so we can focus on making sure they are setup and enjoying the early stages of life without stressing ourselves to much.  

I have been attempting to throw $1000 here or $1500 there to bills. But not a specific bill as im not sure what I should or should not be doing. We have gotten fairly good at not eating out, and having a lot of weird spending aside from here or there. Any advise is much appreciated.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing issues,"Hello Personal Finance!  So, after a long time of being terrible with my finances, I've started shaping up over the last few years.  My big problem right now is I have about $36,150 in Private Student loans from Navient.  When I signed up, I was dumb so I took the low initial interest variable rate.  

I'm now sitting with interest rates over 10%.  I recently attempted to refinance through SoFi with my dad co-signing.  I have a credit score of 712 and make roughly $55,000 a year.  My dad makes $120k a year, and has closer to a 750.  SoFI denied my application however due prior history of delinquent accounts.  I checked Credit Karma to see what was going on, as I hadn't missed a payment on anything in years, and found the only missed payments listed were from 2000 and 2005.  Is it normal for something to stay against me for that long?  Both of the accounts have been paid off since, one was a prior education loan from right after highschool, and the other was a credit card.  

Overall, I'm really wondering what my next steps should be.  Do I bother with Equifax, I'm not disputing the late payments, I'm just frustrated that mistakes from 12 years ago are still hindering me.  Should I try refinancing with someone else?  Any advice you can give would be appreciated, thanks in advance.",finance

I already have two credit cards: one cash back and another rewards (both VISA with an interest rate of 19%), which I always pay in full.

He said the line of credit was preapproved and it would not have fees unless I use it and not pay it in full. From my understanding, that's when the interest kicks in.

personalfinance,Senior in college considering buying a house.,"Hey all. Long time lurker, but I have a question I think you guys may be able to help me answer. I was recently accepted to a PhD program at Clemson University in South Carolina in a STEM field. I began creating a budget, and when I looked at the real estate market in Clemson, and there are some condos that are asking $60-80k. I've been lucky enough to be able to put some money put aside in the stock market ($10k). I was considering using some of this money to put a 10 % down payment on a condo, as I will in all likelihood be in Clemson for 5-7 years. In comparison to other Clemson student housing, my mortgage payment ($350/mo plus some change in APR fees) would be comparable to my rent.

My real question is whether I am forgetting anything in this calculation? I am very young (22), but I would appreciate you guys telling me if I am being crazy. The housing market seems pretty fluid to my untrained eye, so it would not be as if I would be trapped in an investment for years thereafter. I would sell my condo when I begin preparing to defend my thesis (my last year) and rent hence forward.

I received a teaching assistantship that will be paid for by tuition reimbursement and a $17,000 per academic year living stipend. In addition to this income, I would be either interning (internships in my field are generally paid well, and I'd expect to receive $4,000-$7,000) or researching in Clemson, where I'd be paid up to $3000 for the summer. The only large expense I foresee financially is a $250/mo payment on my car loan which should be paid off January 2020. My car is valued at $13,500 by Kelly Blue Book. I have $5,500 in federal student loans from my undergrad, but so long as I am still in school, I do not have to start paying those to my knowledge.

Thanks so much for your help. If I forget anything, I'll add it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I close this credit card?,"I used to have pretty rocky credit, due mostly to being an uninformed college student, and then a couple years as a starving artist/bartender.

Towards the end of this period I did at least have the wherewithal to realize that I should be paying some degree of attention to my credit score, and I took one of those accepts everybody, credit-building cards (Specifically a Credit One visa with 21.45% APR and pretty stiff interest and balance requirements).

Over the years they have slowly increased my limit by small chunks for a fee. It's still pretty modest limit - about $2k.

I stopped actually using this card ages ago, but I've left it open and kept paying the fees just to keep my total available credit, and length of accounts buffed up.

Now I'm looking at 750ish credit scores, and have much better rewards cards with better rates, higher limits and low or no fees.

This old card is costing me about $120 in fees a year, and is a monthly annoyance as i have to keep checking a card i don't use.

Is it worth keeping this card open for its benefits to my total credit? Or is there an advantage to just putting this guy to rest?",finance
personalfinance,"28 year old couple with $66,000 + income, a house sell, kids to feed and a question about the future. (CAN)","My husband and I both have school debt. $15,000 between both of us at about 5%. 

We have 2 children both of whom will be in school September 2017. 

My husband works two jobs bringing in about $66,000 gross. 4 months ago he had only the one job, bringing in $38,000 gross.

I work part-time at my home business and made $12,000 gross last year. I will begin working full time in September of ’17 and anticipate that income will grow this year. 

We also draw about $850 monthly for our children, a benefit from the province based on the age of our children and our income from 2015, this will decrease this year. 

We currently own a home in an undesirable part of town, with $129,000 remaining on our mortgage. 

We have no other debts, and have $3000 in savings currently. Our cars and my business equipment are considered assets but are minimal. 

Our monthly expenses are about $3000 and our net income is about $4800, give or take. 

We both came from lower income families so our financial acumen begins and ends with “don’t spend more than you make and put some of it in savings in case you break your leg.” 

Our city is one of the fastest growing in the country and in the 3.5 years since we bought our home (150,000) the housing market has grown 22% and is expected to rise at least 15% this year alone and likely more in the next as some major infrastructure will completed in 2018. 

Our home is very, very small and we have out grown it. My business is also hampered by not having an office and working out of the living room. Renting office space elsewhere is prohibitively expensive. Having space would double the work I could do.

Our original intention was to sell and purchase in mid-2018; saving $1500 +/month now so we would have $30,000 saved plus the sale of our home when the time came.

We have been told waiting would be a mistake. The average price of houses sold right now is $340,000 and growing. The interest rates were at a record low, ideal for buying, but have begun to rise again. (2.2% in Sep and 2.89% now) 

We have been pre-approved for $250,000. We anticipate our home will sell for $180,000+ leaving about $30,000 – $38,000 once our mortgage balance, realtor, and lawyer etc… have been paid. A $280,000 home will be hard to find but might be possible; most are going for well above asking. We have been advised that having any conditions (sale of home for example) will make our offer undesirable because the market is competitive right now. 

So my question is, “What makes the most sense?” 

Sell now and find a home in $280,000 range that doesn’t necessarily fulfill all our needs, but allows for my business to grow.  

OR

Renew our mortgage for another year in July. Save every month until July 2018 so that we have a $30,000 down payment + the returns from our house sale, knowing that both market and interest prices will rise, maybe dramatically.

OR 

Is there another option that would make more financial sense?",finance
personalfinance,Derogatory account reported to my credit report 3 weeks ago instead of going away after 7 years.,"10 years ago in 2007, I racked up a couple phone bills that amounted to $500+, and $600+ in 2 consecutive months. I was young and irresponsible to say the least. The first $500 bill came but I was able to pay it immediately. Then the next bill came-- over $600 ouch. No way can't do it  not again. I ended up running away from home and disregarded all my financial responsibilities which meant this bill was ignored among others. Through the years I've been able to pay off or settle my other debts BUT this one. I've since moved on from ""that"" bad part of my life (homeless, no car, no phone) I just forgot about it. Having been used to having bad credit, I didn't really question my low credit score. I just thought that was the result of years of financial neglect. I've gotten better these past 2 years when I finally put serious thought in my credit worthiness. Got a car loan (very high interest rate), applied and approved for a few credit cards (to better my score) which I try to keep at a low usage rate. Sometimes it's hard not to spend more than I can but I've kept it manageable for the most part. So I'm feeling ok, if not good considering my history about my finances these past 2 years. Today I got my tax refund in my bank account to my surprise. Sweet, let me lower these credit balances. I'm still in my bank app and decided to check my balances.

personalfinance,No income - prep for retirement?,"Hi all - I've been reading a lot of what is posted here and have picked up a few tips, but I'm looking for a little more personalized advice right now.

Here's my situation: I (22) graduated a 4 year state university this past May - I had a part-time job over the summer and worked abroad this past semester, but I'm currently unemployed. I'm job searching and applying to places all over the country (US), but since this process is fairly new, I haven't heard much success. While I'm job searching, I'm traveling the country, crashing on my friends' couches (they're so good to me).

I've tried to pay way over what my minimum for the past 3 months, so I don't have a minimum payment due until May or so, but my goal is to pay that off by December 2018. I also owe my university $4.6k, but they stopped charging me late fees on it, so that hasn't taken as much priority in my mind.

I am paying off my 2009 Honda accord next month and the resale value is about 6500.00. I have 26k in credit card debt (13 cards total but only 7 are charged interest) and I am finally in a position where I can pay it all off. I am paying off the highest interest card with our taxes and I then have two options. One, pay off the remaining cards one by one and they will start falling off in July, then November, December, February, March, and August 2018. However, if I sell my car in May when the kids get out of school and say I get 5500.00 (hopefully 6500.00) I would be able to pay off 4 cards in May, the other in December, and the rest on March 2018. I can sell my car in May since we won't need it during the summer and if we do my husbands grandma NEVER drives her car so asking to borrow it once a month or due to an appointment or something would not be an issue at all. We would like to get a new car around 15k (3% interest) in September and our credit union would delay the first payment until November 2017. I've never made a late payment. The only thing keeping my credit score in the 600s is the high balance on the cards. I want to eliminate this debt and the high interest that goes with it. Once the cards are paid off I will have good credit again. It was 740 before the cards so I think it should be around that or higher when I pay them off. Trading the card will allow me to pay off the cards a lot faster, eliminate high interest every month, bring my credit score up.

personalfinance,"Doing pretty well, but what to do next? General advice needed.","Hi all. I've flailed for a while regarding what to do next with respect to my finances.  I don't have a narrow question per se, as there are an array of considerations. 

To keep this focused, I'm just going to lay out some pertinent facts, followed by my general thoughts/questions. Any and all help is appreciated.

Just turned 38. Married. Wife stays home. 4 kids ages 5, 4, 3 and 6 mos. Attorney.

Last year I made around $315K gross. Best year ever by far. Not sure how that will project for 2017 as we are on an ""eat what you kill"" type system. Like many lawyers, I'm always worried about whether the work will come from next, even though I've never not been busy for an appreciable length of time. That said, for personal reasons I am not sure I want to put in the work I did in 2016 regardless. My base is $210k.

I know it isn't exact/perfect, but per Mint, right now my net worth (including home equity) is about $530K.

Current Assets:

Cash- approximately $110K

Home- $615K (zillow estimate). I owe $350k at 3.25%. In 2016 I paid off the entirety of my $44k HELOC, which was a goal.

Cars-  A van (approx value $20K) and a sedan ($4k). Don't owe anything on them. Bought van new in 2013 and paid it off in 2015.

Current work 401k- $45k balance. Maxed in 2016 and plan to in 2017.

Rollover 401k IRA - $40K balance
Rollover 401k IRA - $50K balance

Okay, here goes- I have ""adjustable comp life"" insurance policies through NWM for my wife and me. It's a hybrid product that provides term and whole life. The approximate cash value of all policies is around $7k, at roughly $250k whole/$800k term. I also got small policies on my kids because they were dirt cheap and apparently allow them to increase coverage without a physical exam at certain ages. I know these don't get a lot of love around here, but at around $290/month all in, I'm not sure it's worth pulling the plug. In a couple of years the front-loaded part should be done and it may not be a bad piece of the puzzle as a fairly safe (if suboptimal) investment.

I have a few other odds/ends (a $10k investment in a real estate LLC that is passive- I pretend like it isn't there), but this is the gist.

Debts:

House - noted above- $350k mortgage balance at 3.25%. In year 6 of 30.

Student Loans- balance at $25k. I pay $285 a month. Interest is sub 2%.  Psychologically I'd like to just write a check and be done but at such a low interest rate I'm not sure that's the best choice.

No CC debt other than what's paid off monthly.

Questions/Comments- overall, things have been simple so far because my goal was to (i) paid down the HELOC (done), (ii) max my 401k and (iii) save roughly $100k in cash. Very straightforward. Mission accomplished, but now things are a little less obvious since I don't have much debt (and it's low interest).

1. Do I do anything right now with the excess cash on hand?

2. Do I worry about the student loans or just let them lie because there are other things I should put extra dollars toward?

3. Leave the insurance alone or take action?

4. Open a taxable account (Vanguard) and start investing, or put $5,500 in an IRA (or go ahead and do $11k for 16 and 17)? I believe I made too much money last year to do any sort of Roth or Trad IRA (I don't know my MAGI to the penny yet b/c I'm not done with my taxes, but I'm confident that based on my gross I'll be well above the max). I believe I could do a back-door Roth but I'm conservative- tax maneuvers scare me and I am a fan of simplicity. And if I do that for 2016 and make a lot less this year, does that account just hang out there by itself...? Again, I like simple.

5. Start 529s for the kids?

6. I like the idea of having a little more cash on hand because I may have the opportunity to invest in real estate (need access to liquid funds). Also, I don't want to get into it in detail but my son had a health concern last year and there will be costs going forward. Insurance covered everything, but we will likely be maxing our annual deductible on him ($6k) for years.

For the sake of discussion, I net about $12K/month right now. There may be more/distributions, but I haven't earned that yet.

I also fantasize about selling off everything, quitting my job and just living for a few years because I'm a stressed out mess and have been since I started practicing law, and small children add to that (although they are wonderful). That is for a different thread (and sub) though haha...",finance

Capitol One says that the interest paid won't change if I buyout of the loan, but my thinking is to pay it off first to get that additional $225 to toss at the lower interest card, which would knock it out in no time. Not sure if that's a smart move though, especially since the CC is still gathering interest monthly, whereas the car already had it factored in.

Ideas? Thoughts? Oh, and the remainder amount of money is handling some preventative car repairs, mixer repair (we use the hell out of it and just toasted some gears), and helping pay for a trip to visit the in-laws. We want some overhead to play with, just in case, so the remainder will sit in savings.",finance
personalfinance,"Girlfriend and her family owe 230k in student loans, while she is only making minimum wage!","First off, sorry for the wall of text. 

Long time reader and sponge for all the knowledge shared in this subreddit. I think it’s amazing how people come together here and share what they know, and how this information has helped people recover from all kinds of circumstances to help set their lives on track.

The situation is this, my girlfriend went to college who’s out-of-state rate is around 40k a semester. She went here for five years, paying the out-of-state rate for the whole time. This schooling accrued some 200k in the Direct Parent PLUS federal loan (which is in her mother’s name) as well as some 30k loans in Direct Un/Sub federal loans which are in her own name. This is some crazy amount of debt for, especially seeing how she went to school for a field which makes an average of 40k/yr--she has yet to get a job in her field though, and is making minimum wage as of now. 

She is trying to get a job as a park ranger, but has been having difficulties finding a job, Right now, she is working as an Environmental Educator at minimum wage, and I remain hopeful but doubtful that the situation is going to change in the near future. 

From what I gather, her idea was to enroll in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (once she gets a job in her field) while paying her loans on the Income Contingent Repayment plan for the entire ten years it would take in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. The problem with this, as you may guess, is that the vast bulk of these loans are entirely in her mother’s name, and as such, these repayment/forgiveness options on the PLUS loans are only available to her mother and not her. 

When I became aware of this situation and the gravity of the loans, I immediately hunkered down and spent the past year learning to code so I could switch careers and make more money. I am now just beginning an entry-level job as a software engineer at around 60k/yr. I have about 50k in student loans myself (30k in Sub/Unsubsidized loans and 20k in low-interest private loans.) When I graduated, I saw this amount as unfortunate (I could have been smarter with my money in college), but as a manageable amount of debt. 

Her mother is currently enrolled in an MBA program, from which she will graduate come this spring. As the Parent PLUS loans are in her mother’s name, I think the start of repayment on these loans begins some months after she graduates from this program, and it’s stressing me everyday thinking about how we will handle this. At the standard ten-year repayment plan rate, her mother would be responsible for around $2,400 a month from these PLUS loans, let alone what she owes for her own MBA (which I believe is being covered by her current employer, but I’m not 100%) and her mother has, obviously, been stressed about this situation as well.  If we were to pay for these, in addition to what we owe in our names, the monthly rate would be larger than our income. Her mother has indicated several times that she wants us to find a way in which we could have these loans signed over in our names, an idea which terrifies me. 

So I’m not sure the best course of action from her. From how I understand it, it seems as though her mother could enroll her in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program if she were to find an alternative job (as the Parent PLUS Loans seems like they qualify for this) , but that might be problematic with her other personal student loans (some companies pay for continuing education only if you stick with them for X amount of years and I’m not sure how her MBA was paid for.) If she were to do the PSLF program, and sign up for the Income Contingent Repayment Plan, we would be able to HELP, but not to fully take over the loans. That would be the ideal circumstance, as far as I can tell, but does anyone else have a better idea of what we could do to manage this insane amount of debt?

personalfinance,"29 Years old, 6 years into teaching and $65,000 in student loan debt.","First time poster here but a long time reader of this sub. Love the support.

I'm 29 years old and have been teaching in the public schools for 6 years. The largest amount of debt I have comes from a parent plus loan that my father took out. It was for $65,000 at something like 6.75%. I have been paying it down for 10 years and haven't touched the principal yet, paid about $18,000 so far. The loan is in his name but the money is being taken out of my account so the monthly payment is based off of his income etc. I recently found myself single and living with my parents so rent is gone and I'm only really paying for gas and food for myself and funsies things which will be dramatically decreasing as to pay back this loan. I'm just having a little up swing after the breakup. It was a good thing. ANYWAY I'm making $50,000 a year and my monthly MINIMUM payment on the big loan is $450 a month. I have two other smaller loans in my name that add up to $180 a month as well, but one of them is almost done, which will drop it to an additional $140 instead of $180. So overall in the near future I'll have about $600 a month to worry about, given I want to just pay the minimum on the 65k loan. 

My dad is looking into this company called SoFi to refinance the loan at a better interest rate. If I keep on the path that I'm on it'll be 2041 when it's payed off. What are my options given that the loan is in my dads name and that it's a parent plus loan. Is there any possible way to put it in my name and have it be based off of my income? How much would I have to buckle down to get that sucker paid off in the least amount of years? Any help is appreciated and I'm sure I may need to give more information but that's what I've got so far.

personalfinance,Recent College Graduate. Just got my first job. Need advice on savings and tackling student debt.,"I am a recent college graduate who just received my first job (yay!) in one of the most expensive areas of the country to live in (boo!) but I want to make the best of what I have which is why I am looking for some advice from this lovely sub. I have 3 immediate financial goals: save an emergency fund, pay off my student debt, and save up for a down payment on a car (Would like to purchase in the next year or 2)

Here's my breakdown. I currently make 60K a year. I contribute 2% of my annual income towards a 401K but only because my employer contributes 8% already for a total of 10%. I'm only putting in the minimum I believe I should be putting in because I have student debt that I would like to address first. My health insurance is also directly pulled from my salary. I live in one of the most expensive counties in California so please keep that in perspective. When everything is all said and done I take home $1,624.00 every 2 weeks. 

My monthly expenses are as follows:

California Rent: $1500.00
 
This is higher than where I would like to be at but I only have a 10 minute commute to work.

Arizona Rent: $105.00 

I received my job offer half way through a lease in AZ and my landlord would not allow me to break the lease. I am subletting with landlord approval; however, I am still putting down money because I needed to fill the place in a month (was a nightmare) so I priced it attractively meaning I still put down $105.00 a month (Better than the full $655.00) until June 2017.

Electricity: $60.00

Gas: $25.00

Water: $50.00

Internet: $40.00

Car Insurance: $130.00 

Due to my location, car insurance rates are absurd and this was the lowest rate I could find. This price includes renters insurance.

Student Loan: $110.00

Credit Card: $60.00

Okay! Onto my debts....

Student Loan 1: 20,000 Government loans. 

Mix of subsidized and un-subsidized with interest rates ranging from 4.29%-6.8%. Currently on an income driven repayment plan. Due to my income at the time of the application, I do not owe payments until August of 2017. 

Student Loan 2: 10,000 Private.

Interest rate of 8.99%. I know horrible but I did what I had to do. I'm currently making the minimum monthly payments of $110.00 a month.
 
Credit Card Debt: 3,000 at 11.40% interest. 

Again I know its horrible. I unfortunately encountered a medical emergency in May of last year. A majority of this debt is medical bills... but I am happy and healthy at this point :) I'm making the minimum payment of $60 dollars a month. 

I'm expecting a return on my taxes from Arizona as I was still working a minimum wage job/was still a student.  My situation has not changed from the previous year and I received at $1200 refund for 2015.

What would a good monthly budget for myself look like? As stated before I need to pay off my debt, save an emergency fund, and save up for a new car. I appreciate the time you took to read this and I look forward to your advice!",finance
personalfinance,28yo needing some financial guidance,"Hi all,

I'm looking for advice on what to do in my current financial situation. Recently, I've gotten more involved in educating myself in personal finance and understanding how the money world works. I appreciate any advice and thank you in advance!

- I'm 28 years old living/working in NYC. I'm in the medical field. 

- Salary -  $145,600 ($6,800/month post-tax) with ability to work OT (@ $100/hr) - been working for about a year

- Rent/Utilities/Car Insurance - $1,700/month (car is paid off)

- Student Loans - $175,000 (undergrad + grad) - $1,100/month (minimum) w/ 4.145% variable interest rate over 20 years (refinanced/consolidated all my student loans via Sofi - I plan on paying at least another $900+).

- Life Insurance - Transamerica Index Universal Life Insurance w/ flexible premiums started 10/2016 - $500,000 level death benefit -  paying $300/month with a CV of $1,000

- Amex High-Yield Savings - $4,600 w/ 0.9% interest (building my emergency/wedding fund - contributing $800/month)

- Retirement - I have two 403Bs. One with an old employer ($15,000). Another with current employer with 8% match, which I am putting 8%.

- No credit card debt - I am strict with paying them off

That leaves me with roughly $1,950/month left. I don't shop a lot. Don't drink coffee. I spend my leftover money on food/groceries (I have a loose budget when it comes to this). I bring lunch about 3x a week. 


I met with a financial advisor at Northwestern Mutual recently and this is what he recommended:

- $100,000 WL ($119/month) and $400,000 term to 80 w/ increasing premiums ($20/month)
- Disability Insurance - total monthly benefit of $2,500. ($50/month)
- Mutual funds  - American Funds (American Balanced A, Capital Income Bldr, and Fund of Amer)

Few questions:

1.What should I do with my leftover money? Save, invest, pay loans?

2.How aggressive should I be with paying off my loans vs saving for wedding/trying to build wealth?

Initially, I was paying $2700/month to loans when I first refinanced, but realized that I wasn't leaving much money to save. My GF and I have been together for 7 years and we don't plan on having an expensive wedding nor does she want an expensive ring so I don't see my wedding fund being more than $20,000.

3.Thoughts on my current life insurance policy?

I am still ambivalent about getting an IUL especially since I regretfully didn't do much research into it before purchasing. If I had, I most likely wouldn't have gotten it. It's also expensive to cancel the policy. One thing I do like about it is that the CV grows tax-free, that's about it. I know there's a lot of debate about buying term and investing the rest, but I know little about investing.

4.Thoughts on what the financial advisor recommended?

Last thing I want to do is to complicate my life and spend money on products I'm iffy about. I don't plan on buying a home or having kids anytime soon so I don't think I need that much more insurance.

5.What should I do with my old 403b? Rollover to my current employer's 403b? To an IRA? Is a backdoor Roth IRA a good option?

6.What are some options to help save on taxes?

personalfinance,3 Credit Cards all with 0% Interest - Let's pay these suckers off....advice needed.,"OK so my wife and I have 3 credit cards/accounts. One actual card, has a balance of $5,000 and is 0% interest for another 12 months. One credit account is the financed portion for my wife's lasik surgery and has a balance of $2,400 with 0% interest for another 13 months. The last is a credit account from a mattress firm purchase in mid-2016. The balance on that account is $1,000 and is 0% for another 7 months. 

Want to pay these off ASAP for a couple reasons. 1, we may need a new car for our family in the next 3-6 months. 2, I just don't want almost $9K of debt hanging over our head. 3. I want to take my wife on a vacation to celebrate our 7 yr wedding anniversary guilt-free, not worrying about debt at all. 

I have a little extra money laying around, so I've been thinking about paying off the $1,000 card (Payment of $170/mo) in one lump sum payment. 

That leaves me with $5K on the credit card ($200/mo payment) and $2,400 ($200 payment) on the vision financing account. $7,400 total. 

I know there are 2 prevailing thoughts in terms of debt payoff, snowball and avalanche, but in this case, both cards have the same interest rate: 0%. 

Couple questions: Is there any benefit to paying off the vision ($2,400) with the credit card? That would leave me with 1 creditor and a $7,400 balance. Combining the payments for all 3 accounts, I would have roughly $600 to spend towards that debt each month, plus any additional money that becomes available. 

Is there any negative to paying off the vision debt w the credit card? 

Am I missing or overlooking something that may be a better option?  

Thanks in advance for the advice.

stocks,"As the US backs off MBS, will the stock market see a cooldown?","Hi /r/stocks, looking to have this line of thinking audited:


1. The US has been buying tons of mortgage-backed securities + actively working to keep interest rates low
2. As the US [backs off buying MBS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-06/the-mortgage-bond-whale-that-everyone-is-suddenly-worried-about), the interest rate is going to have to go up to attract investors
3. If global investment community returns to buying MBS (filling the void left by the US Government), that's less overall demand for other investment vehicles, like the stock market--a place everyone has been dumping their money because there is nowhere else to invest

Conclusion: interest rates are going to rise, and the stock market is going to cool off as people move capital out of a stock market that's seen massive increases over the last eight years.

It seems to me like a simple supply and demand equation, with the stock market having a lot of demand previously, whereas in the near future, there will be less demand as investors have more outlets to invest capital.

stocks,Home Loan vs Stocks,"If you had a lump sump of money and you have a home loan, would you invest or pay off more of the home loan. Here are my thoughts (hence why I cannot decide):

* Although interest rate on home loan is quite high, the property continues to appreciate so by the time I finish off the home loan, I wouldn't have paid more than the actual property.
* Depending on how investing goes, I may get a better or worse rate (I don't think anyone can predict in certainty) than the home loan interest rate. Investing in Stocks is more risky, but the return may be better.

personalfinance,Comparing Mortgage Options,"Greetings,

We are currently house hunting and have a couple of mortgage options.  See [here](http://imgur.com/a/xqzwv).  The first column is type of loan: USDA, 3% down, 5% down.  The 2nd column is the approximate cash outlay needed (down payment and closing costs...the interest rate is a little higher for the 2nd two options as we're selling points to reduce our cash outlay).  The monthly principal and interest columns are for the first month of amortization.  The PMI on the lower 2 options falls off at 20-22% LTV, whereas the USDA option does not fall off but instead is a percentage of the remaining principal.  The months to break even is how many months until we could sell the house and walk away from closing without owing anything (realtors fees, etc are included in this figure).  

We are in a very competitive market where most houses are selling within 3 days of listing with multiple offers.  For this reason, I have some concerns about the USDA loan (100% financed) not appraising as well as having a competitive bid.  Additionally, the USDA loan adds about 2 weeks to closing time.  Any advice or things to consider when picking a best option?  I should add that $10k is getting to the high end of what we are comfortable outlaying (while still having some money for moving, and other expenses).",finance
personalfinance,"27 years old, Canadian, terrible with money.","I'll try to make this as short as possible.

I've been working for the same company for 10 years now, my salary is heavily influenced by sales and performance, but I'm essentially guaranteed 51k per year, which equates to around 37852 take home per year.
I have two credit cards,
A visa with a limit of $1000 that I owe $658 dollars on with an interest rate of 11.99%
A Mastercard with a limit of $11000 that I owe $7531 dollars on with a rate of 18.9%
I have a chequeing account with a $1500 overdraft

I get paid weekly, average take home is $680-980 depending on the week. Every week I put $25 on my visa, and $25 dollars into a saving account I just opened that now has $300 in it. I do not use my visa.
Out of my bank account I have car payments ($181 bi-weekly,) a phone bill  ($70 monthly,) a newspaper subscription  ($22.50 monthly,) and household rent.
Rent is $1613 a month, one roommate  (girlfriend) pays me $375 a month, and my other roommate pays me 1/3 of rent minus Internet and utilities which comes out of his account; normally around $350 a month. I cover the rest.
I do not use my bank account for anything else.
All other purchases get put on my Mastercard, and then at the end of every month I put everything that's still in my chequing account onto my Mastercard, including the  $1500 overdraft. If I pay the card after the 1st, there's no interest for being in my overdraft because it's after the banks billing period, and after 2-3 weeks I'm out of the overdraft again until the next month. My car insurance and one other bill come out of my Mastercard  ($140 and $120 a month respectively.)
Sorry this is longer than I thought.

So a few questions;

Would I be better off just paying the visa down completely now, or continuing to pay $100 per month for the next 6 months? The logic I used was the visa has a much lower interest rate and balance, so I'd rather put as much down on the Mastercard as I can.

Does using my Mastercard for everything really make sense? I don't pay interest for my overdraft since I'm never in it at the very end/beginning of the month, but sometimes I think it would make more sense to stop using the card completely and just put payments on it while using my debit. The balance of the Mastercard goes down an average of $200-300 per month so at least I'm not spending more than I'm making.

My employer also puts money into an RRSP for me and I'd like to start contributing around $60 per week, which I could use next year as a decent down payment on a house so I can stop renting, but I also don't want to lose out on that $200 a month until my cards are under control.

personalfinance,Trouble with Sallie Mae Repayments &amp; Cosigner,"When I applied for 4 separate private student loans with Sallie Mae back in 2012, 2013, and 2014 I had asked my boyfriend at the time to cosign on the loans because my parents did not qualify and I did not qualify on my own. He agreed and without really thinking too far ahead we proceeded with borrowing from Sallie Mae. I borrowed a total of $39,000. I technically finished school in December 2014, but graduated ""June 2015"". 

When they began asking me to repay the student loans the minimum payment was something like $560 per month. I could not believe how high this minimum was and called them asking why it was so much. They said that because my ex was still cosigned to these loans they determined the minimum based on both of our incomes combined. I had no idea that this was part of the loan repayment process when applying with a cosigner so I asked how I can get him off of my loans. They told me I need to pay the minimum every month for 12 months consecutively and meet 9 other requirements before even applying to have him released. 

I have been paying the minimum of $565 (which just went up to $581) every month for the last 9 months on my own but am barely able to get by or pay my Federal Loans (of $119 every month) on time. I can't get my ex off of the loans as a cosigner because I have had at least one or two 90-day delinquencies on other bills in the last 24 months due to the high minimum on my Sallie Mae bill. I've also had normal life things, like car troubles and cats needing to go the vet, come up causing me to fall behind even just a little bit.

I am at a loss for what to do because these payments are not sustainable for my monthly income. I work as a bartender part-time and then hustle as a freelance filmmaker in all my other free time. I can only do so much to make ends meet and lately it barely feels like enough. I am constantly stressed about this payment and making sure I do everything I can to get it paid every month. Does anyone have suggestions on how to get untangled from this mess? I have thought about loan consolidation but have also heard nothing but bad news about the idea. I have little guidance from my folks since neither of them had to borrow money to get a higher education. I also don't know anyone with as complicated of a repayment situation as mine.

personalfinance,[Student Loans] Did I make a bad decision? (no not talking about going to grad school cuz that's an obvious yes) Consolidated Grad School loans.,"Went to law school at about the worst time from 2007-2010. Graduated with ~150k debt. Unemployed for 2 yrs, then 3 years making 50k doing IBR.  Now making 100k, but living in an area with a high COL. Can afford a little more than IBR, but not full payment, and as a result, loan debt is now 310k.

All of the loans I took out were (according to my Navient acct) Grad Plus or Direct Loan (Subsidized &amp; Unsubsidized). The consolidation interest rate is 7.625%. The previous interest rates were 6.8% and 8.5%.

Judging from my career path, I really only see myself making a max of $150k. I may be able to telework in a few years allowing myself to live in a cheaper area.

Am I pretty much screwed for life? I am really trying hard to just have like a few grand in my emergency saving fund. Maybe start actually contributing to my retirement fund? Is there anything I can do about this crazy interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Thinking of paying off my car loan with my tax refund. Will it help my credit as much as I think it will?,"Hello,

Bit of background: I'm a 28 year old male currently making 85k/year. Due to bad choices when I was younger my credit score is pretty bad.

Back in 2013 I had a 2001 Jeep which didn't seem to go a full month without a mechanic visit. It broke down on me a couple of times and I would just fix it. But then something related to the heater broke and the repair were going to be too much so I decided I needed to purchase something that would be at least reliable instead of wasting more money on the Jeep.

I was in a bad spot financially and decided to make the poor decision of financing  car through one of those ""All credits accepted"" dealerships. I purchased a 2008 Honda Pilot, I put down my broken down Jeep and $1,500. The pilot had 110K miles on it, price tag was $12,500. I was approved by Chase auto finance but with a REALLY high interest rate (21%) so premiums came out to be 360/month. 

Fast forward to now. My car is my biggest expense other than rent. I did my taxes this year and the total amount of the refund will be close to 8K and I'm thinking of getting rid of the car loan which I think will help my credit drastically, right? I just need to confirm this basically because my girlfriend tells me it won't really help my credit that much.

If it's not going to help my credit that much.

Any input will be appreciated. 

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,"Wondering whether to eliminate not-quite-high interest rate credit card debt, or fully fund my emergency fund","Hi /PF! I've been lurking for a few months as we try to take control of my finances, but as we are struggling with my next step, I thought I'd check in on a path forward.

My husband and I (both 27) live off my income as he's in college. I make a healthy salary about 1.5 years out of professional school ($95k pretax, though it was very recently $86k). He has a side job tutoring to pay for books and other small expenses (~$1k a year). 

We've paid off about $5k in high-interest credit card debt in the past 4 months after realizing we were on a bad path. We began seriously budgeting, using YNAB, and are now faced with whether we want to continue paying off debt, or fully fund our emergency fund.

Here's our current situation:

- $3k in online savings account as an emergency fund

- $9k in credit card debt, at 8.99%

- contributing 7% to Roth 401(k) to get full employer match (they also put in an extra 1%, so 7 + 1 + 7 = 15% annually)

- planning on PSLF for $230k in federal student loans, at 6.75%*

If I read the flowchart on the sidebar correctly, we should be first fully funding a 3-6 month emergency fund before tackling the remaining $9k in credit card debt. This is because the interest rate is below 10%. However, it's close to that at 8.99%. Also, the advice we got from a financial adviser when we started this process was to keep $3k in an emergency fund until all the credit card debt was paid off, including the balance at 8.99%. 

What would you all do in our situation? Are there other options we haven't considered? Thanks in advance for any help!


*Yes, I know, it's a lot. I'm committed to working for the government for the required 10-year period, though. I'm also receiving a fellowship to pay my student loan payments for the first three years I'm out of school, so for now, I'm only paying tax on that fellowship income through Dec. 2018. If I chose to leave for the private sector, my compensation would be much higher ($200k conservatively) and I could handle paying it off fairly quickly.",finance

personalfinance,"Late 20s Settling Down, Are We Doing It Right? (GTA, Canada)","Hi PF, first-time long-time here.

Looking for some solid advice and criticism of my (our) financial plan for the next year considering our immediate and short/medium term goals.

**Background:**

My girlfriend and I took the plunge and signed a rental agreement on a beautiful semi in the Peel Region (Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada) in December 2016. Things are going very well. Not worried about the relationship.

We're both in our late 20s and getting around to starting our careers. I went through a job change in early 2015, which left me unemployed for 9 months, underemployed for 3, and over $10k in debt with all my savings depleted. My girlfriend finished school at the end of 2015, but didn't find something in her field until fall 2016.

Things improve a lot since then though! As we're checking off things on our list - stable full time jobs, our own place - we're looking toward our future, and that's where you come in. Any suggestions/comments/advice are welcome.

**Financial nitty gritty:**

Income: I make about $3200 a month, though in May and November I will make $4800. Girlfriend makes about $4550 a month. Those amounts are all post tax, CPP, EI, and other deductions. For me, that includes contribution to my pension (I work for the federal government).

Expenses: Rent is $1850 a month. Utilities including internet is $300 month. We split these (and groceries) 50/50. Total cost of living you could put at $1275 a month each. Other expenses are discretionary. For car insurance, I pay mine in chunks 3 times a year -- about $600 each time. Next payment is in May. She pays $170 a month for hers.

Debt: I have about $12000 of debt across 2 lines of credit. $2500 owning on one at 7.95% (20k limit), and $9500 on the other at 5.95% (10k limit). I recently opened the second just to pay down the other at a lower interest rate. Yeah, it's not much of a difference, but the bank offered it and my credit rating is excellent. If it takes a minor hit for opening the new line, that's fine. I own my own car in full; 160,000km, new winter tires, summers are 1 season old, regular maintenance done. Not expecting any issues with my car.

She has debt to her family that was a loan from school with interest worked into the payment plan in advance. That goes until the end of 2019 and is about $320 a month for her. She also pays $310 a month for her car loan (7 years, no interest); 1 year old, covered under warranty, regular maintenance done.

I pay off my credit card every two weeks - always have, always will. I treat it like a rolling 30 day cash advance that earns me travel points. I have no credit card debt.

Girlfriend does the same, as I've been pushing her to pay it off in full because the interest charged is not worth it.

If you've read this far, 1) Thank you 2) it's pretty clear that she's in better financial standing than I am, though I'm not in terrible shape either.

**The Plan:**

We made some big purchases after getting our new place together that rang up about $2100 each. We also went on our first vacation together in November, which ran us about $600 each after travel points factored in. Maybe not the brightest, but we wanted some quality us time together (the vacation) after living in different cities for 6 months, and wanted to make our new home feel more like home (big purchases).

Now that we're settled and very happy with our new home, we've agreed to buckle down and cut the spending.

The summary of our plan is to 1) pay off outstanding debt 2) create emergency fund 3) save for goals.

Paying off the debt really only applies to me as I see it. Girlfriend has no incentive to pay off family loan or car loan faster as the interest is wrapped into the payments or there is no interest. As I see it, she's better off saving the money in an easily accessible account, and if needed she can pay off the debt faster. However, she might as well get the interest on her money as she only has to make the set payments.

For myself, I'm repaying at minimum $1250 a month to my lines of credit while keeping my credit card debt at $0. I'm paying off the slightly higher interest LOC first. Based on my math, I should be debt free come year end assuming some unexpected major expense doesn't pop up.

Girlfriend has agreed to help me pay off my debt, and I've agreed to pay her interest on her contribution above what she'd get from having it in savings, but less than what I'd be paying my bank. Financially it makes sense for both of us. We agreed on the interest portion because she's been burn on lending money in past relationships, but neither of us are really worried about it... as in we see it all being our money once we're married anyway.

The emergency fund would be the next. Based on our experiences job searching and being unemployed/underemployed, I'm pretty worried that it would take nearly a year for either one of us to find jobs similar to our current ones if we lost them. I'm thinking that we should save around $10,000 each for emergency fund.

Goals from short to long term are: engagement, visiting UK, wedding, house, retirement.

Engagement one is more so for me. After I'm out of debt, and have saved some in the emergency fund, I will be putting aside funds for an engagement ring. I figure this will be $3000-5000 after taxes... I haven't really looked into this.

My girlfriend's family is from the UK and her nan can't travel. I doubt she'd make it to the wedding if we had it in Canada. My grandfather recently passed, and her nan is her last living grandparent. We'd like to visit her prior to getting married, and my papa's death has made us realize we don't have much time left with our grandparents. My hope is that we're also engaged when we go.

We were hoping to maybe go to the UK in 2018. I do realized that saving for my emergency fund, an engagement ring, and this trip would be an arduous task to accomplish given the timeline.

After that it'd be saving for a wedding and then a house. We both expect to have the maximum contribution of $25k from our first time home buyers out of RRSPs along with additional savings for a down payment. Honestly not expecting to buy a house for another 10 years with the current market in the GTA. We'll see what happens though.

**Questions:**

1. Should I really be creating an emergency fund before I pay off my sub 10% interest debt like the flow chart says? I feel like I'm fine with paying off the lines of credit and dipping into them in case of emergency. If the cash is in either my regular chequing/savings or the LOC it's just as accessible, but the interest I'd gain from having it in the savings is max 2% whereas I pay 5.95% for having it out of the LOC.

2. How much do you recommend we have in our emergency funds? What type of account is best for your emergency fund?

3. When should I be contributing to my RRSP? Should I start now? Should I start contributing after I build the emergency fund?

4. How much should my girlfriend be putting into RRSP? Should she be looking into other forms of investments?

personalfinance,I just applied for and started using the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. Is it bad to carry a balance during the 0% APR period?,"Unless I am mistaken, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers 0% Intro APR for 15 months from account opening on purchases. After the intro period, a variable APR of 15.49% - 24.24%.

My credit limit is $7900. I'm told you should never have a balance over 20% of your credit limit. However, would it be a bad idea to continually keep a balance of $1500 (7900*0.2=1580) over the next few months? My reasoning is, why not take advantage of the 0% APR period if I just be careful to ensure my balance doesn't go over 20% of my credit limit? Will it have a significant impact on my credit score? If it doesn't, isn't it like taking a 0% interest loan of $1500 for a few months? I do have the money to pay it off, but it seems like it would be more beneficial to do something else with the money in the meantime. In the very least, I could put it in a checking account and at least collect the small amount of monthly interest on it, especially considering interest rates may go up over the next 6 months.

personalfinance,"I know Redditors hate Universal Life Insurance policies, but could I be in the rare situation to consider one? Thank you for your advice","A couple weeks ago my parents suggested that I get a Universal Life Insurance policy as a way to diversify investments while minimizing my tax liability as much as possible because I have seemingly exhausted other avenues of investments and I earn a high income at a young age. I understand that it's not the best bang for my buck for types of investments and that Redditors generally hate UIL's, especially since I do not have any dependents. However, I fully intend on leaving my parents everything and more if I were to die right now. I am an only child and want them to be taken care of. Lastly, I happen to be one of those people that earn a high income and most likely will continue to earn more as I age. So, my estate at retirement (excluding my future SO) could well be greater than $5 million.

The policy I was recommended is from Nationwide and is tied to the S&amp;P. I will admit that I don’t entirely understand everything behind it and have been diligently researching more today. I have a follow-up call with my advisor next week. Our family financial advisor recommended it for me in my situation because I will never get taxed on the equity in the account. From my calculations, I will be in the 28% federal tax bracket and I live in California which has a state income tax of 13%. I’ve listed my stats below and would really appreciate the advice of the Reddit community.


My stats:

- 23 years old 

- Annual income is roughly $120k to $140k all in depending on my year-end bonus
* I have maxed out my 401K for individual contributions ($18k)
* I am about to max out my Roth IRA ($5,500)
* I have an emergency fund of about $6,000k, or 3-4 months of expenses
* I have about $10k left in student loans, but the interest rate is about 3.4%
* I have $5,000 to $6,000 set aside that I will be investing in a Vanguard brokerage account made up of ETFs or other investments with low fees


TL;DR: I am doing very well for myself financially and saving for retirement. I’ve been recommended a Universal Life Insurance policy as a way to protect my parents, while not leaving extra income just sitting in the bank. It is also reassuring that the cash value of the insurance policy will never dip below what I have put into it (i.e. get completely wiped out by market risk). Is this the right choice in my situation?

personalfinance,Financing taking some time off work,"First off, I love this sub. I’ve gained a lot of really great tips from here that I’ve used to help improve my credit score and reach some financial goals. 

Short version of a really long story would be that in the past 10 months I have dealt with the end of a really shitty marriage, moving across the country, anxiety issues and recently the death of a sibling. I’ve come to the conclusion that I really need 3-4 months of a break from working and I need some unbiased advise on the best way to finance it. Since I am single and live alone it is relatively easy to keep my spending habits within a tight budget. I also only have a car loan and a credit card that are my only sources of debt. I bought the car brand new about 2.5 years ago and it has a 0% interest rate, which is my biggest debt right now. I’ve saved a lot over the past four years when me and my SO were both employed and living with relatively low expenses. Overall, I’m in pretty decent shape financially and I have been going over this in my head and have narrowed it down to three options - 

Option 1 -
Small personal loan. I could take out a personal loan for what my fixed expenses would be for the next few months and use that as my primary source of income. The thing to worry about would be how long it would take to pay this back, with the expectation that I would resume working at a job that could pay comparable to what I make now. I am 30 now, I don’t want to pay for taking time off years down the road.

Option 2 - 
Borrow against my 401(k). I’m not sure if I could even qualify for taking money out of my 401(k) since I know that there usually has to be some kind of extenuating circumstance or financial difficulty but, if this is an option I think it might be a good one. I was looking into this a little bit a few months back and the amount I am thinking of borrowing would be less than half of the max allowed. 

Option 3 - 
Use my savings / part time job. The third and least favorable (in my opinion). I’m not opposed to having a low stress part time job to use it as extra spending money but I also don’t want to stress about money. Using my savings would mean I have nothing to fall back on in case of an emergency  and it would probably make me worried about money more in the long run. 

Any thoughts or helpful advise is welcome! Thanks.",finance

So my cash advance balance was $430 my purchase balance was much more.  After my regular monthly payment was applied to the account, I made an additional $1000 payment and still have $7 left on the cash advance balance. ~~Being the payment was done online, I understand that it's allocated different ways because...profit?~~... But when I called and asked to pay $7 right now to get that done away with, she said that wont guarantee it gets payed off because the system will allocate it to the different balances.  She said I could pay $60 to guarantee it gets taken care of.  Her supervisor said the same thing, that they can't manually apply my payment to pay off the (assumedly) higher interest rated amount.  

Is this just a WF thing that doesn't allow manual entries? Are there any institutions where I could manually apply my payments how I choose?

I'm trying to edit clarity and add details. According to my bill, which has my monthly and bonus payments on it, my cash advance and overdraft balances are only $59 less than they were last month and nowhere near payed off like they should be.  This is all very confusing.

personalfinance,Parking Tickets that I never received somehow ended up in collections,"Back in late 2015 from the period of October, 2015 - November, 2015 I had parked at one of those UPark locations (self park in a parking lot next to a building where you pay $15 for a full day of parking). I had parked there 2-3 times a week during this duration as I was doing small contract work in the area (it is in Seattle, WA). 

Fast forward back in October of 2016, I received a collections letter from [National Credit Services](https://www.ncscollect.com/), and I started to sh*t bricks because I at the time was driving my dads car (I am in college) and so the collections notice is technically under his name, but still, I know this isn't right since I never received a parking ticket, nor any letter prior to the collections letter. So I had my father call, he authorized them to speak with me about the situation and a lady on the phone told me to mail her bank statement from the credit card that was use indicating the transactions. I did just that, printed out all bank transactions when I parked at UPark, and sent it off to them.

Fast forward to November, they claim they never received the letter, and so I said I'll send it off again. I send it out the first week of November, and couple of weeks later, they call back saying  they never received it, and so I then started reviewing their [reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=nationalcredit+services&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#safe=off&amp;q=national+credit+services&amp;lrd=0x54900e823c694397:0xcd28b241db0baebf,1,) and see its pretty bad, and they piss off a lot of people. Though, as a collections company, I figured this is also normal since people probably are ticked when they find out they have to deal with collections. Anywho, I asked if the person can send a letter of the specific dates and if I can speak with UPark since they have a hard time receiving letters to their address (she keeps claiming I am an exception and suspects I am lying of sending them letters and scares me with the ""this call is recorded blah blah"") and she says she can't and that she would have to take further actions. So I told her, I'll email it to her. And so, I emailed her the bank statements. By then, this was the end of November.

Fast forward to after Christmas, we get a call AGAIN. Same message, but this time ""the attachment can't be opened"" and that she wants me to resend the email. I told the lady I can convert the file, and send it to her, but I was out of town and would be away until the first week of January. Once I got back to the states, I converted the file from a .PDF to a .JPG, sent it off her way. 

Now just last week, she called me AGAIN claiming they were never able to open the attachment, and perhaps faxing it, or mailing it may be better. I mention that I can just drive up to her and hand deliver them but then she acts reluctant ""but that is a ~60 mile drive, you sure you want to do that?"" and I say ""what other solution do you have, because clearly you don't receive ANYTHING I send your way"".

And so, that is where I stand. At this point, I am fed up, and not sure what my options here are. This has been going on for too long, and I am worried that this may be already affecting my fathers credit score, as he is looking for a new home, and he has a damn near credit history, and I don't want to mess it up. I am scared as hell, as while this isn't my fault, I just don't know what to do here, as I am sending my proof that these tickets don't have any relation to me (I should add, the tickets add up to $700, like WTF?). The lady on the phone is extremly roude, speaks over me, acts like I am a child repeating things always saying ""you got it, or do you need me to explain it again?"", the company does seem to be accredited, but I am not sure what that means for me.

So here I am, I am just asking for help, I have viewed the Collections guide posted on this subreddit, but I feel I am way beyond that now as I have already spoke on the phone with this company. What are my options here, as I clearly have no fault in this, but instead this is just a collections company that is harassing me and potentially screwing my dads credit score. I am most definitely thinking of sending the bank statement one more time, but in verified mail (which I should've done in the first place, I am learning my lesson here as I enter adulthood I guess), but not sure if I should do anything else prior to that (or if I should even do that now, knowing how far this has progressed, and seek alternative options, if there are any?).

Another final question I have, which is more for future reference, the bank statements I sent included all my purchases made through the specific date period on my credit card, along with the total balance and all that. Should I have simply cropped the transactions made under the parking lot (UPark) instead of sending my entire billing statement? The billing statement shows when the transactions were made, but I also now feel like I am sharing a bit too much information with them as the can see other transactions I made during that date range.

personalfinance,Questions on US citizen with investments in a Canadian corporation,"I own some stock in a Canadian corporation whose ex-dividend date is tomorrow. With that, I've been looking at foreign tax consequences of continuing holding past tomorrow at market close. If it is too burdensome, I will sell at a slight loss to avoid the tax headache. The stock is currently held in a ""regular"" brokerage account with no tax advantages.

From what I've found reading, Canada will withhold 15% of the dividend payment as I am a US citizen (normal rate is 25%).

My questions are:

1. Should I expect to have a tax liability within Canada given that this is my only income subject to tax in Canada? The amount for this tax year would be on the order of a few hundred dollars.

2. If so, what forms do I need to file and by what dates?

3. What are the means in which I can recoup the withheld dividends that were withheld if I do not owe any Canadian income tax?

4. If I do owe tax on my dividends, to what degree can I offset them with the Foreign Income Tax credit? Does this credit apply to my state income taxes, in particular in the state of California?

5. Excluding the tax break for having qualifying dividends, are there any tax consequences relevant to US federal and state income taxes that I may incur by holding foreign stocks in a regular cash account.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Debt Collector Settlement Taxable Income Issue (California),"If you look at my post history, I previously asked a question about how to file this year's taxes and how to file form 982 after my wife's declaration of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

After her bankruptcy attorney started the process, I understand that any attempts to collect a balance on the debt she listed on her bankruptcy filing were illegal. There were several attempts made to contact me and her after the filing, and her bankruptcy attorney referred her to a colleague to sue the parties that contacted us. My wife met with this attorney, and the attorney filed against several companies, with three settlements resulting for the amounts of $4000, $3000, and $1000. She only received $750, $500, and $250 after lawyer's fees (I know how ridiculous that is). 

Her attorney did not mention anything on how those settlements would be taxed, and I didn't think of it when it came to filing this year, so I already completed my filing and have already received my federal refund. 

After I filed, we received 3 1099-MISC forms for the total amounts of each settlement. I was not able to find an answer I could understand on the IRS's website about whether these amounts were taxable. It seemed to depend on whether the awards were considered punitive or fell under another class of damages. 

I sent an email to her attorney asking if these amounts were taxable and what sort of damages did the settlements fall under. He replied with this:

""As set forth in the language underneath my signature block [a requirement from the Treasury Department], I am not a tax professional and therefore not qualified to give you tax advice.  To the extent that you have any questions regarding the potential tax implications of this settlement or any other of your settlements, I encourage you to direct them to your accountant or a qualified tax professional.
 
Having said that, it is our lay understanding that if you have any tax liability for the money you have actually received in connection with these settlements, it would only be for any income you actually receive in your pocket, not for any attorneys’ fees paid to us by the Defendant; those fees that are paid can be claimed as a deduction/expense associated with the settlement by your tax professional.""

The last thing I should mention is that we filed jointly using the standard deduction. Our qualifying deductions were very low, and even with the lawyer's fees it would still be smarter to use the standard deduction, I believe. 

If you read through all of that, thank you! Here are my questions:

1) Is that income taxable?

2) If it is, do I need to amend my tax returns for the year?

3) If so, do I enter the income as the total minus the lawyer's fees, or do I have to enter the total and the lawyer's fees are just deductions that I can't use?

My worst fear is that we will have to pay the full tax on the 1099-MISC income, $8000, which will be more than the amount we received from the settlements, and find a good accountant to do so. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,I need help getting my financial life in order.,"Hi PF!

Before I get to the details of everything, I'd like to point out that I know I really fucked up the last year or so. I'm looking for advice to help me fix my finances.

About a year and a half ago, I was pretty set with my money. I was 24, credit score was 735 and have about $13,000 in savings. 

Today, I'm 26, credit score 530 and have absolutely no savings. I made a few terrible decisions (financial and personal) and am really paying the price now. My savings went to some medical bills and paying for a summer semester of school.

My debts are as follows:

- student loans: ~$50,000 (3 different loans, interest anywhere from 6 - 11%). I'm making payments on one loan; a parent plus loan ($185 a month; I changed the payments to 25 years, not 10) but have deferred the two other payments. 
- credit cards: ~$12,000 (5 different cards, interest anywhere from 12-25%, total monthly payments $315)
- car loan: $17,500 (interest rate 4%, 36 payments left, monthly payment $350. My car is currently worth ~$13,000 because of damage from accidents) and insurance is $150.
- I owe my parents about $4000 from money leant for legal issues

All-in-all, my monthly expenses are about $1000.

I decided to move back in with my parents in California to save money on rent/utilities. I just accepted a job offer making just over $33,000 plus commission (OTE is roughly $45,000. I don't count on making an extra $12,000 because sales is so unpredictable). I'm looking for a second part-time job that will work with my full-time schedule. I've also been looking for freelance work doing social media marketing/advertising and some programming (I'm learning online and I'm still learning back end development, but have a decent understanding of front end development)

I have missed a couple of credit card payments from simply running out of money in the past (high rent/utilities). I want to purchase a condo in the future (I know I'll have to wait 7 years for the missed payments to fall off) and want to get an MBA to help with my career. 

I have thought about purchasing a $7-10,000 car and get a new loan, however I think that just essentially prolongs the same amount of debt (I could be completely wrong, though).

I obviously really need help. This all stresses me out so much and with everything that's happened in my personal life the last six months (when my finances really took a turn for the worse), it has all finally hit me. 

The only good thing I'm doing is contributing to my 401k. I'm contributing 4% per pay period and my employer matches the 4%. 

What is a good plan to pay off all my debts and get my credit fixed? So far, my plan is to pay off my credit cards, since those have the highest interest, and keep the student loans deferred (minus the one I'm paying now). I also have no idea how I'll be able to save money for any emergencies or leisure money (if that's even possible). 

Thanks in advance :)

personalfinance,86k in private student loans. I need a game plan!,"Background: Currently I'm 22 years old and work full time making 48k/yr fresh out of college. I graduated from a private business college in May. Due to my financial naivety, I was unaware that interest was building on both my private and federal loans during my 4 years in school. My federal loans (subsidized/unsubsidized) are sitting at 30k. I just applied to consolidate with Great Lakes at 4.34% and $150ish minimum payments. I can easily manage my federal loans, but my private loans scare me. I originally borrowed 56k for school in private loans, now I'm at 86k after only 4 years of interest accruing. What can I do to stop this substantial amount of debt to get out of control? I know cutting back on expenses to free up extra cash is the first step, but I want to know what the next logical step would be.

Let me just say, I bought the drake collection and played the first game first. The first game almost made me trade this game back in. It completely burnt me out... Every room I went to was full of waves of soldiers and they were always in places that they shouldn't have been. There was hardly any story and little exploration. The plat forming was a welcome break from the onslaught of enemies who would spawn behind me and shoot me with impecable aim.

The sequel rectifies a lot of things. The story is great, Drake is likeable (I just found him cocky before(, the pacing is better (still many gun fights but it's spread better), plenty of talking, the atmosphere is better etc. I remember killing a guy, consequently he ended up blowing up a building and the whole thing fell down. The escape scenes were great too..

The only things I didn't like were the bosses. I found them unrealistic in how much damage they could take and I was fed up of dying. Also, I found the main villain forgettable and cheesy. I'm surprised his own men didn't murder him the way he acted.

I called the IRS and they said that it could be an IT issue and that I need to just mail in my returns, which could take 8-10 weeks. The problem is that the state was rejected because the federal was rejected.

personalfinance,Recommendation: I think the PF community should check out Credit Karma for tax returns this year,"I'm a few years out of college, so I don't have a ton of tax filing experience. That said, I had used Turbo Tax for a few years. I was happy enough with it, but I didn't really see the point in paying when I could pretty much do it for free through one of the clunkier sites like freefillableforms.com. I have used Credit Karma for credit score monitoring for a while, so I gave Credit Karma Tax a chance and I’m very happy.

I had a fairly straightforward return. One W-2 from my job. An IRA contribution. Some interest from my bank. Some interest paid on a student loan (tax credit!). I did sell some shares of a shitty mutual fund so I had some (thankfully small) capital losses.

Credit Karma handled them all quite well. The interface was a bit less intuitive than Turbo Tax's, but I think this comes from the inherent difficulty of trying to shove every nuance of the tax code into one web app and not having as long as Intuit has had to refine the experience. I didn't encounter any bugs or places that were difficult to understand.

My one complaint was that Turbo Tax had a more streamlined process for entering items off the 1099-B (for recording the mutual fund sale), but Credit Karma did do it okay. 

After filling out my return on CK, I compared the estimated return amounts to the ones Turbo Tax was showing me. Federal was identical. For some reason my state return was $2 lower on Credit Karma, but I’m not worried. Turbo Tax was going to charge around $55 to file, so I’m much happier paying nothing to Credit Karma.

personalfinance,Buying a house need direction.,"Okay, I make around 41k a year. Which is good considering the medium household income is $32,571 per google. I am not rich by any means, but I am pretty well off.  
  
I have been working on purchasing a house. The seller is selling two brick houses side by side, both for 100k. My brother in law is going to buy one, and I am going to buy the other. I have a construction friend (around 30 years exp) who looked at the house and said it was in great shape. I also have a friend who works at Orkin and check the house for rodent/insect damage. He said he did not see any.  
  
The house needs a bit of work. Some flooring put down, kitchen cabinets (the wife is adamant for these), some plumbing under the house replaced, some windows replace and upgraded from aluminum, some spackle work, paint, etc.... I talked to my construction friend who said he assumes he can get it done for less than $12,000 which is good because i budgeted for $15,000.  
  
The closing cost + down payment required to get out of pmi range is roughly $15,000.  
  
I am going to cover 60k of the 100k loan primarily for one reason. It is the bigger house. It has storage attached to carport, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathroom, bigger yard.  I am fine with that, also my brother-in-law offered to pay me 10,000 in cash as well when his money from the military gets out of what I like to call ""The Red Tape Zone"" for taking on the extra debt which should later this month, or early next month. I am also fine with this arrangement, so is the seller. It will allow me more money for renovations. He is also a very trustworthy guy, I would and have trusted him with varying amounts of money in my life time and he has never, not once, went back on his word. The seller only cares if he gets the full 100k and will divy up the balance to however we deem fit.  
  
For the tax season, I am getting just over $5500 back from federal, and around $50 from state.  
  
I also own a single wide trailer/mobile home which I have a interested party for buying it for $12,000, with cash whenever we are done with the loan process.  
  
I have around $22,000 in my savings as well.  

Monthly Payment + Escrow is around $450.00 / month. I have this budgeted and will be well off with a remaining monthly balance of around $500.00 after all bills are paid (going off of people that live in the area with similar size family/house)
  
Total upfront cost to get things done as I have currently planned are roughly $27,000. Currently, I have an accumulated wealth of $27,500(Savings + Taxes) + $10,00 (Brother-in-law) + $10,000(Trailer - $2,000 because I am sure there are fees/taxes I'll need to pay) = $47,500.

investing,SHORT $SNA,"Snap on your parachute

Propping up sales: Snap-on has seen poor growth in its core business over the last decade but has built a robust financing business, which has ballooned in recent years.
Interest increasingly risky: Snap-on has taken to financing both franchisees and end customers in order to accelerate revenues and has had to seek out customers with lower and lower credit scores. This has increased the risk pool too quickly for investors to react to and makes SNA increasingly vulnerable to default, especially as interest rates rise.
Structural decline in end demand: Only the tools segment has seen meaningful revenue growth over the past few years. But end customers, primarily independent mechanics, told us that few people in the business of auto and truck repair are expanding their business and many are going out of business. The Great Recession temporarily buoyed auto repair, as used car sales soared, but since that effect lessened starting in 2014, SNA has lost its last source of expanding customer demand.

I brought this to the attention of my employer and he responded with a letter saying a lot of nonsense, but concluding that, because of a paragraph in my contract, if the business is charged any fines or penalties I'll have to pay half.

I checked out my contract, and this is the paragraph in question:

The amount on her LOC is going to stay there since the interest rate is lower than the one she can potentially get with a loan, so that will stay as is. She is barely making minimum payments on her accounts so I'm trying to find any way she can be charged less.

After our raises, we should be able to make it about even, but seemingly no way to afford my loan payment.

Right now they're on forbearance since the payment is more than 20% of my income. I've done this all of last year and am probably looking to do it for another year. 

I haven't been too smart about them and have just sort of put them on the back burner but I really need to have a plan. I looked at their calculator, and it seems that the Income Based payment plan (if we file separately) would be around $450/mo, which we could possibly be able to make those payments, but is forbearance a better call since we are technically only paying interest?

The one payment plan that seemed the best in terms of how ""little"" interest your paying was the 25 year fixed payment. That ended up being the lowest amount of total interest paid, but is about $875/mo.

Anyway, I'm just rambling, would love to get some people's take on this. 

EDIT: I'd like to hear more tips about the best practice for paying back the loan; I know we are living beyond our means currently. We're making many adjustments.",finance

financialindependence,"Just getting started, looking for some guidance/wisdom","**Life Situation**

* Single Filing Status, 27 years old (28 in September)

* 3yr Daughter (Lives with Mom and Step-Dad)

* Washington (Contracting in Qatar) 

* Just got promoted to an almost 6-figure position, Network Administrator in Qatar for DoD

* SR: 46.8%

* Do not own a home, currently saving for one

**About Me**

I would like to know if it seems like I am heading in the right direction. My current goal is to be able to retire no later than 50. I would love to have a number of rental properties to bring in residual income at low time-investment (ideally with a property management group). My plan is to internationally contract until I have roughly 3-5 properties under my belt and then to come back stateside and continue working. I am currently estimating my income to grow around 20% each year. My income has increased each year as I've tried to get my life together: $15k (2013), $20k (2014), $35k (2015), $55k (2016), and to the current $98k (w/ bonuses). I'd like to see growth of 20% on my income each year for the next 6 years. $109k, $131k, $157k, $188k, $226k, $271k. Identifying this gives me a great goal to work towards. This will allow me more savings, which would be fantastic. Working towards this, I am finishing up a Bachelor's in IT Security this year and plan to have my Masters no later than end of 2018. 

To reach my goal of $313k by 30, I would want to up my SR from 46.8% to almost 100%. This isn't going to be doable without a massive increase in income, above my projected 20%. If I save until 31, at even the 46.8% I get $241k. I believe with some reworking of my SR as my income grows, I will be able to hit that goal. Realistically though, I will be able to hit my goal with my projected 6 years of earnings, and be able to have a house fully paid off as well as a rental property paid off. 

I am debt free, aside my mother using me on one of her medical credit cards (which I'm trying to get taken off of). My credit score was around 800, but dropped to 750~ after my mother incurred around $1,900 of medical bills for her dog on the aforementioned credit card. My available credit is around $30k as well if that is relevant.

If this was the wrong place to post this, I do apologize. If you need more information from me, then please ask away and I will respond and add it to the OP to allow for more concise information. I feel real late to this game, especially since I've not started doing anything up until my daughter was born. That really helped me kick my life into motion. I've not had any guidance so far, which has me worrying about my foundation and my next move. One of my co-workers bought a single property in Las Vegas and is making about $700 profit each month, which has really made me wonder if I can get into real estate much sooner than expected (was originally thinking 3 or so years from now).

I'm going to peruse this reddit more and see if I can't educate myself better, as well, so I don't entirely rely on others. I was going to post on /r/personalfinance but that seemed to be a lot of people in dire straits so I wasn't sure if this was apt for there.

**My To-Do List**

* Going to look into redoing my life insurance setup.
* ~~Checking out the resources on the sidebar. Currently working on Early Retirement Extreme and Mr Money Mustache.~~
* I'd like to plan on $50k/yr of usage in retirement. Want to err on having a little more than needed than a little less. Will do the math though and attempt to finer tune this amount to more accurately represent my needs.
* Current goal of have $313k saved by 30 to retire by 50. Little up there for my current income, but gives me a very tangible goal to work towards and allows me to narrow my focus some. More probable expectation is to hit it around 32.

May r/bitcoin rot in hell to be honest. It gathered attention by being THE bitcoin subreddit and then betrayed those who put in the effort of making it what it was, to only become a subreddit at the disposal of its ""owners"".

Hi all.  Long time lurker, first time poster.

First, some background: I'm 29, bf is 28, dating for 2 years.  I've been working toward FI for about 1.5 years.  My bf is a naturally spendy person who doesn't mind taking on debt for things he wants and doesn't like to plan expenses or budgets in advance; I'm the opposite.  However, I introduced him to the idea of RE about 6 months ago, and he agrees its something he wants to pursue (he has a high stress blue collar job) and he gets really excited talking about what we'll do together once we 'retire'.  He increased his 401k contribution and began tracking expenses in Mint after we talked, and I was so proud.  I've noticed he's also tending to make slightly more frugal decisions in day to day life, whereas his old attitude was 'always buy the nicest version of x thing, because why not?'.  Its been a slow process so far, and I'm okay with that.  I'm trying very hard to share things at a pace that works for him.  My hope is that he slowly comes around based on his own thinking and experiences; I'll lead by example for now and keep showing him my numbers steadily rise.  

My concern is that this weekend he may be about to make a decision that will negate the progress we've made to date.

BF is participating in the VW buyback program, and turning his car in today.  On one hand, this is fantastic, he owed something like $19K on it and they're paying that off plus putting another couple grand in his pocket.  On the other hand, he has his heart set on a fancy truck....like a $40K fancy truck that HAS to have 4WD, leather seats, full cab, etc..  He's talked about this for a year now, so I know its something he really wants.  I've brought up the fact that we live in a suburb in the south, don't need 4WD, don't have plans to do major remodels or farming activities (at least not until after RE), the opportunity cost of high monthly payments, the fact that his credit score will probably mean a more costly interest rate, etc. and the best we've managed is to occasionally get him thinking about a $35K price tag instead of $40K.

Edit: he's considering used trucks, not new.

I want him to have the things that make him happy, and I don't want to fight this plan so hard that it turns him off of frugality/RE/FI entirely, but I'm sure we could look at something like a $25-30K used truck with one or two fewer bells and whistles, and after the first week of owning it, his happiness level will be the same.  That would keep his payments similar to what they are now, and give him enough breathing room to consider ramping up his savings.

So, any words of wisdom on how to handle this situation?  What level of pressure makes sense now that we're so close to the purchase?  Is worrying now too little too late?  If this truly makes him happy, should I just let it be?

I'm going into the dealerships with him when he buys it, so any advice on truck-buying would also be welcome!",finance

personalfinance,Filing 2016 taxes with 1098T - but return to school until Spring 2017 semester (no school in 2016),"Hey guys, I have a quick question regarding filing my taxes and including educational costs. Thank you all very much, in advance, for any help you can offer!


**First, here is some information about my situation that may be relevant:**


**State:** Kentucky (also for federal taxes)

**Age:** 24

**Income:** ~27K

**Filing Status:** Single, No dependents, Not a dependent on any parent or guardian

**School Status:** Most recently, before the Spring 2017 semester, the last time I attended school was in 2014. I did not attend any school in 2016. However, I did take out my student loans in 2016 and pay for the 2017 semester during the 2016 year.



So, I just filed my 2016 Federal and State taxes yesterday. They have since been accepted by the IRS and by Kentucky. However, I found a form 1098T sitting out there for me that I had not even thought of - because I didn't attend school in 2016 I'm hoping that I can actually use this, as it seems it would boost my refund by a tremendous amount.



1. This is a **2016** 1098T - however, I didn't begin attending school again until this current Spring 2017 semester. I most previously attended school in 2014. At no time in 2016 was I physically enrolled or did I attend any school, whatsoever.


2. My 1098T has boxes:

     a. **Box 1:** Empty

     b. **Box 2:** ~$4350

     c. **Boxes 3-6:** Empty

     d. **Box 7:** Check mark

     e. **Boxes 8-10:** Empty

[**Here is a hyperlink to a blank 1098T form from IRS.gov for your quick reference**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1098t.pdf)


3. I did pay student loan interest, and included this on my taxes.

4. As deduced above on my 1098T info, my Spring 2017 semester has been funded completely by student loans - I received no grants or scholarships. 

All Google inquiries I make on this subject come back vague, at best. Searches of this subreddit seemed to be fruitless as well (perhaps i'm using the wrong search terms?) 


**My question:** 

1) Am I allowed to use this info on my 2016 return? I can't see why I would've received this form if not. If I am allowed to, can someone shed some light as to why? I did take out the loans in 2016. Is this the IRS's way of separating taxes by school year, as a school year (and the related finances) spans 2 years but taxes obviously only capture one?

2) Can I also include the rest of the students loans I took out to cover books and related course material? i.e. I spent more on school than just the tuition @ ~$4350. (~$550+ on books and software alone, not to mention supplies and other school-related expenses)

3) Beyond including this expense, is there anything else I now have access to claiming/using on my return? i.e. Lifetime learning credit, or any related education credits.

personalfinance,Student Loan Principle Payments Question,"Hey all! This is my first time posting in PF and the only gray cloud over my head is my insane amount of student loan debt. I am someone who is always trying to play the system to my advantage, and I thought of something today that I am wondering if it would be a benefit to me or not.

I have about $130,000 in mostly private student loans. The interest rates are INSANE (9-11% on most), so my number one priority is refinancing. I recently did the math and figured out that if I set it to a 10 year repayment plan, I will be paying about $1500 a month and about $198,000 total. If I set it to 25 years, I would be paying a more comfortable $900 a month, but it would be about $298,000 over the life of the loan.

Here is the scenario I'm wondering about: Would it benefit me, to set my repayment term to 25 years and make the minimum payments towards interest, but then each month, throw that extra $500-600 towards principle only payments? I know that in the beginning you are really paying mostly on interest and the though of that is painful. If I made smaller minimum payments, but then called and specifically made principle payments each month, would that benefit me financially in the long run? Does the math work out the same as a 10 year repayment plan? Or does throwing more at the principle help? If anyone could help me think this through or do the math I'd really appreciate it! 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Lost on where to start. In serious debt and can't dig out.,"To start with a little background, I have a history of debt problems in my family. My parents were terrible at saving and being money smart. Along with that, I was never taught how to save or how to responsibly use and maintain credit.

Flash to 10 years after my first credit card, loans and a failed attempt at graduating from a state university. I owe the state/federal government loans from failing out of college, somewhere around 15k left(they are currently garnishing my wages). I had a personal loan from what I think is 9 years ago that I don't see on my credit report and I don't think is paid...and multiple other debts that are in collections. Debt totals somewhere around 20k with student loans. Credit score is somewhere around 550.

I have been trying much harder recently, I rent and haven't missed a payment or made a late payment on that or utilities for the past 2 years. I've been a customer with att for 12 years and have been solid on payments for the past 2 years as well.

The problem is, I don't know what to do with the debt in collections. I am fine with paying whatever I need to, I mean I did borrow the money and it's not really mine. I just want to fix my credit and get back on track so I can settle down with my girlfriend, who I'd love to propose to, and someday get a house and have a family. We are ready for the next step, but I don't want to burden her with the mistakes I've made in the past. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"24, Married, Grad School. Am I doing this right?","I've been lurking and reading the wikis and I think I have a good plan for my personal finance. I just want to see if others here agree I'm being wise.

My summary is I am 24 in Grad school to be a Nurse Practitioner and will graduate summer 2018 with about 115K in Grad school federal loans ( a mix of Stafford at 5.3% and PLUS at 6.3%), plus 15K undergrad federal loans (3.4%). I aim to have the government pay off 50K-75K of my grad school loans (will be taxable) through a loan-repayment program over the first 2-3 years of working after I graduate. I anticipate earning 90-100K from the start. This year I am not working because the program is intense, but I might work per-diem as a nurse during the 2nd(last) year of the program.

Also, I am married, no kids, wife just got a new job at 50K. We rent a house from my mom (I know) at $1800/mo but also sublet part of the house. He pays $750 + 1/3 utilities, which average $350/month total (oil heating sucks). My wife and I have no other debts besides school loans. Car paid off, no outstanding CC debt. My loans are deferred while I'm in school and her 30K federal loans for undergrad are on an IBR plan, currently she pays $150/month.

We have saved up $8k so far, trying to build the emergency fund. We've been saving 10% of her income(~$250). Our monthly spending has averaged 4K-4.5K now that we're renting a home, but again the subtenant pays $750 + 1/3 util to us, so that helps.
My thinking is this: keep saving up for emergency fund, utilizing that IBR plan to pay less on wife's loans for the time being. 

However, because our spending would be 4-4.5K with or without the subtenant, I feel we should have 3-6 months X 4K = 12K-24K saved up just in-case the subtenant decides to leave (Highly doubt it). Her job is stable, so I feel we could swing only 3-months emergency fund. I have only 18 months of grad school left. Trouble is her income alone doesn't quite cover the monthly expenses, so I take out about 3K/quarter (1K/month) in grad loans to help cost of living (Seattle). Because I'm taking out a loan to essentially allow us to put some money into savings each month (~$250), it doesn't make sense to try paying down any of her loans that are at a smaller interest rate than the loan I am taking out to do so. Right? And on top of all of this, she has an employer 401K but I have yet to start a retirement account (neither a 401K or Roth IRA) because I've hardly been working between undergrad and grad school.

Tl;dr: Is this a bad spot to be in? I'm trying to build some sort of emergency fund for us while minimizing the grad loans I have to take out, and delaying aggressive undergrad loans payment until I start working as a Nurse Practitioner.

personalfinance,"(US) Need math check on best student loan payoff - factors PSLF, looking for advice [studentloan]","Background: 
4 loans, 1 paid off. Entered repayment in 2014. Started PSLF-qualified job mid-2015. Currently on standard repayment @375 a month. All numbers are slightly rounded up to the nearest  multiple of 5 to retain anonymity. Not an investment whiz so don't mean to show any disrespect in the method I used to calc.

[Original amount] (current amount) interest rate
#1 [$6950] ($3400) 6.55%
#2 [$5500] ($0) 4.5% paid off in 2016
#3 [$10000] ($9140) 6.55%
#4 [$15600] ($14190) 5.16%

Calcs I have checked (including studentloanhero and unburyme) I have a $26730 balance with 5.81% avg interest rate, so about $6135 interest paid off in 7 years (2024) at the current standard rate. I did make a good amount of principle payment advances over the year to reduce some interest buildup.

By technicality, PSLF would qualify in mid-2025. I was thinking if I applied for one of the other lower repayment plans to reduce monthly, I could have some saved and terminated via PSLF. Estimates that I will have about a monthly payment of $260, $31.5k paid and $5.9k forgiven. My current rate is $375 at $32.8k , which looks like about a 1.3k difference - but I could easily front an additional $100 a month for a year or so for peace of mind and finish a year earlier. 

Are there any factors I am missing or should consider before either? Will consider any advice. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Have a plan to pay a good chunk of CC debt this month...are we doing this right?,"Later this month, my wife and I are going to use a combination of tax return and a small loan from my 401k to pay off some credit cards. After getting the last two negative marks off of my credit, we are now taking steps to boost our scores so that we can qualify for the better mortgage rates here in a couple of years. 

We will be working with approximately 7k. 

I have close to $4k of debt between my cards and our plan is to pay all of my cards except for my Amazon card because there's some zero interest stuff with that. I have two cards from the same company and will be combining those. My current score is around 650, so I'm hoping that will get me a slight bump. 

My wife has a little over 6k of credit card debt. The plan is to pay off one of her cards, which will leave about $1500 as a cushion to put back into our savings account. She has the same two cards I have and will be combining hers as well. That should give one card a 50% boost to the available balance. My wife has a slightly higher score than I do, but we are both in the same neighborhood. 

We both have a higher interest account that I wish we didn't have. While paying it off would result in our highest balance and payment coming off, we free up more money and zero out more accounts if we pay off the smaller ones. 

The two cards that are getting closed are ones where we are listed as authorized users for the other's card. 

We have 3 department store cards all with zero percent interest rates over the next few years. I figure leaving these isn't too bad of an idea since the interest rate is lower, though we could likely pay off two of them with the extra we'd have left over. 

The 401k loan I'm taking out will result in about 50-60% less coming out of my check a month and through a couple of other things recent changes, we're freeing up around $400 a month. I am also due for a good 4-5k bump this year and that would all go into the savings account/used to pay down other balances. 

Once we get our scores higher, and before the mortgage, we've talked about getting a personal loan to knock out the remaining accounts that aren't 0% so that we go into the mortgage using a separate rewards card for the following: 

gas
restaurants, movies, and other similar date/family outings
and one for groceries that results in 5% off the entire in store purchase.

Each of these would be paid off each month using money that's already budgeted for those expenses. Any under budget amounts would get moved to the savings account.

personalfinance,Help Planning My Financial Future,"Hello PF!

I was looking for some guidance on making sure I'm properly planning my financial future. I'm 27 and have a credit score around 800.

Here is a rundown of my current budget:

**Cost of living expenses:**

* Rent: $850
* Electric: $60
* Gas: $50
* Car insurance: $60
* Restaurants/Bars: $50
* Groceries: $200
* Auto Fuel: $80
* Shopping(Clothes, Amazon Items, gifts, etc): $30
* Entertainment: $50
* Miscellaneous: $100
* Student Loan: $150

Total: $1,680

**Income:**

* I bring in after taxes and 401K contribution $3,000 / month, sometimes more.


I save around $1,000 monthly give or take. I tend to spend more than I budget on groceries, restaurants, and bars by a hundred or so. Cell phone and internet reimbursed by work.

**Assets:**

* Car: paid off, pretty shitty vehicle which could die literally any day. Has 188,000 miles.
* Property: I have a piece of property up for sale currently listed for $16,500
* 401K: Balance of $11,500. I contribute 10%, employer matches 5%
* Savings: I have $4,500 in savings

**Debt:**

* Student Loan: $10,400 remaining with varying interest rates. highest is 6.8% with a balance of $2,000. The rest is around 4%

**Plans:**

* I eventually need to buy a vehicle and that might need to happen soon. Looking at used trucks, I would love to get a newer Nissan Frontier. I would guess around $20,000 - $25,000. That's a big purchase which I'm not confident I should make, but it's something I've wanted for a long time. If I continue to save $1,000 per month and sell my property in early summer I could have around $22,000 in the bank. Now I'm sure most of you would suggest instead to buy a more reasonable used car for $5,000 - $10,000 and then throw the rest on my student loans.

* I would like to buy a house down the road, maybe 5 years or so. It would probably range in the $150,000 - $200,000 range. I would need $30,000 or $40,000 for a down payment which seems so daunting at this point.

I would appreciate any input. Thanks everyone.",finance

I pay my taxes. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I tried the H&amp;R Block Free File service as well and that told me I owed $4,000 (clearly incorrect, it also said I paid $0 in taxes in 2016.

They do (no one can claim me as a dependent, single with only one job, head of household).

personalfinance,Questions about CCs through Credit Unions.,"So recently I've started taking an invested interest in my credit scores, how they work, and how they can be improved. My questions are;

1. If I already have an open line of credit through said Credit Union(small auto loan), and I open another line of credit with the same Credit Union; will this decrease the positive impact of responsibly maintaining said card? Or, in other words, would it be more beneficial to my credit to open a line through another company, or will that be viewed as irrelevant?

2. I've done a fair amount of searching on Google, but I can't seem to find any concrete reason the interest rates seem so much better from Credit Unions; can anyone shed some light on this discrepancy? The APR rates are literally half of what I'm offered elsewhere, and that seems to be a huge margin for something like this.

3. I maintain a very stable income, yet most people seem to still advise a secured card. I am a very frugal spender and this card is being obtained purely with the intention of improving my credit score. With this in mind, would it be in my best interest to seek a secured or non secured card?


Basic info;

* This will be my first credit card
* I currently maintain a 640 *exactly* in Transunion and Equifax with no negative statements on either.
* I am 26 years old, unmarried, and have been with this said CU for a decade.
* My savings maintains a balance of &gt;$1000 at all times, excluding rare times immediately following large purchases.",finance

personalfinance,$2600 HSA closure to start paying off credit card debt?,"Help!! Advice please, I'm about to tackle my biggest debt problem seriously and feel like I'm going in blind.. financially I'm messed up (my fault) and seeking wisdom to get out of a hole I dug..

Backstory; 28 with no savings account, let alone emergency fund, have not really been able to stick with a solid budget with much success, but not giving up.. but I have a big problem: I have four maxed out credit cards and I'm about to cash out of my HSA to make these minimum payments. 

What happened: Last year I rolled over a credit card balance to a new account, 0% APR - 1 year. Expenses came up and I ran up the  original card again while making only minimum payments on the new card, for a year. I did the exact same thing with another credit card. Now the 0% offer ends this month, interest rates go up 20% and I'm not able to get another line of credit and don't really want to try. I am re-teaching myself to avoid financially illiterate mistakes through this subreddit so I thought I'd ask you.. 

I don't have an income right this moment, starting work next month. I'm broke now, poor so basic bills are primary and credit card debt secondary. Student loans third but those are deferred for now. My HSA has been sitting untouched for a year and I'm ready to take the 20% hit to withdraw this month so I don't miss any payments. My fixed monthly bills are minimal ~$60 for cell phone, ~40 auto insurance. 

Rice and beans and living home near parents in my very near future. No complaints, I have a strong supportive family and I can commit to action if I firmly stick with my plan. I want to pay off my credit card debt ASAP, avalanche style.

1) Is liquidating my HSA even a good idea? It's not much ..but literally my last money on earth. Even the 20% penalty is a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to take it to keep up with my credit cards. I might be able to borrow a personal loan from family, but hate to ask.

2) If I don't roll over this outstanding cc debt by opening another line (not even likely they'll offer) are there options I'm unaware of that have worked for anyone else in this situation?? 

Here's the breakdown:

4 credit cards total: $13k (average 23% interest)
HSA remainder after cashing out: $2k aprx
Monthly budget: $400 (fixed and variable)
Expected income: $1600 monthly after tax

personalfinance,Just realized I have $10k in credit card debt...what to do,"Please bare with me as I use this post to collect my thoughts and strategize on a disturbing reality I have just become aware of.  I have always been extremely bad at personal finance.  So much so that it literally just came to my attention that I have $10k in credit card debt. This all happened in the span of 3-5 years.  It was not frivolous spending for the most part, but rather medical expenses (no insurance and emergency an emergency room visit), car repairs, academic conferences, textbooks, and college tuition that I couldn't take a loan out for.  I also happen to be $23k in debt from student loans, but fortunately the payments for those have been deferred as I return to school to try to reboot my career.  As a result of this deferment, I have an extra $335/month to put towards paying this credit card debt down.  

So to break it down for you, the debt is spaced out between 4 cards.  

- $3443 @ 23.49%
- $2503 @ 23.4%
- $3482 @ 0% for 12 months
- $980 @ 0% for 12 months

One thing to note is that the $980 is a new card I just took out to do a balance transfer from the $2503 card, in an effort to save on interest.  This is how all but one of these cards were opened in the first place.  So I'm thinking the best plan is to put all my extra money into the one with the highest balance and the highest interest rate, and just pay the minimum on all the others.  Correct?  The hardest part is going to be not putting anything else on the cards.  I feel like I've become so dependent on them in the past that it is now like slamming on the brakes.  Although I have seen some good progress in the past few weeks already by over paying on all of them a bit.

And one other question:  Assuming I pay a credit card off fully, is there any benefit or reason to canceling the card?  I did a credit simulation, and it says if I cancel a credit card it would seriously tank my credit.  Why is this, and does this basically mean that I have these cards for life, as long as I want to maintain my credit?

personalfinance,Question Regarding Student Loan Interest Rates and Taxes,"So this is a stupid question but I would love some clarification on the topic because I don't understand the math.

My wife and I are carrying around $120k (total) debt in student loans from undergrad and grad schooling.  We have paid off about $20k already to get it down to this number.  They are 2 consolidated fed loans at 6.8%.  At the moment we are paying the minimum on one and double paying the minimum on the lower balance (since they are both the same interest rate).  No CC debt.

So my question is this.  Since the interest that we pay on the loans is tax-deductible, if we forget about the level of the interest rate (let's pretend it is 3%), if I have investments that can make more than the interest rate on the loans shouldn't I be putting anything extra into those investments versus paying off the loans?  

I guess I just don't know how to do the math on how much I save on taxes by lowering my taxable amount by the interest paid per year versus how much taxes I would pay on that amount at my current tax bracket (we are in CA and in the 28% bracket making $170k combined pre-taxes)?  Does that make sense?  

I know the goal is to be debt free so paying down the loans is better than not but since the number is so high should we be putting away for retirement beyond the employer 401(k) match?  Or always just throwing everything we can at the loans?",finance

My question is, even though Savings Bonds are exempt from state income taxes, do I still have to amend my state return anyway? Even if it's only to show that I received the interest.

Also, I will be paying the additional tax online. How long after mailing my amended return, if at all should I wait to submit the payment?",finance

personalfinance,"22 Years Old, Trying to Figure Out Student Loans","Hey all. I submitted a post a few days ago and didn't get any real response. So, I went and read through all the articles you have. The 18-25 article, the 401k stuff, the debt paying and emergency fund articles. Very informative, I learned a lot and was granted nothing but more questions. I'm now very interest in ""target-date funds"" I think they were called, as well as ""three fund plans"" and the different federal accounts like TIPS and I-funds. 

My question today is much more immediate though and apparently should be one of my first steps. Paying off my student loans. 

I am going to graduate in a few months with my BA and because I took the Community College route and only spent two years (six semesters) at a four year, I will have **15k** in student loans. I lived at home and only loaned for tuition so it's really not that bad. Still I want to get rid of it as soon as possible. I'm not entirely sure on the terms and all but they are Federal Unsubsidized Loans if that helps. 

I clearly want to pay these off as soon as possible and I really don't have much of a problem staying with my parents a little while longer to do so. They would love it. Now for more specifics.

I am planning on going into education and where I live (Southern California) I will be making just under 51k a year gross to start. That, however, has to wait for another year of school as I get my credential. Once I get my BA I can immediately start as a substitute teacher which pays $125 per day and I can work something like 91 days in a year due to my school schedule, school vacation days and the length of the school year so that's just over 11k a year gross. Clearly I'll still be living at home for that time period. I will also have to continue to take out Student Loans to pay the tuition for my credential program. So if I continue as I am now I will be sitting at just about **22k** in loans once I finish with my credential.

The last complication is the possibility of Loan Forgiveness as a teacher in a low income district for five consecutive years. I will be teaching in San Bernardino City where every single school is considered ""low income"" with high percentages of students receiving free or reduced lunch. The program is explained [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher#what-are-the-eligibility) and while it will not repay all of student loans, it will repay up to $5k assuming I read that all correctly which would leave an outstanding balance of **17k**

The program requires that I work the full five years before I can even apply for the loan forgiveness and knowing the government it will take some time after that to actually process the whole thing and have the payments go through.

So how should I handle repaying the loans up to that point? The options as I see them are.

1. If I were to stay at home for a full year once I'm fully employed and throw almost all of my paycheck at it I could completely pay off my student loans in a single year even if I end up maxing out 18k into retirement and pay my taxes and all that. It will be really nice not having to pay rent or food during this period. 

2. I can make some sort of payment plan, putting X% of my check towards the loans to have it paid off in some reasonable amount of time while working on other savings and such.

3. I can plan on that 5K at five years and factor that into my payment plan so that I have 5K left at the end of the five years and am done paying it right then.

I have no problem staying at home to do plan 1 but I also have no problem with the others. Is it worth the savings on interest to just pay the entire thing off as fast as possible like that? Or should I pay it off more slowly and start saving money outside of retirement?

Sorry for such a very long post. I'm still new to this whole world of finance and all and I want to start off right. Any advice you can give me for my questions or for using the Sub are very much appreciated. I'm probably going to be here a lot as I move forward.

TLDR: Going to make enough to pay student loans off very, very quickly if I stay at home. Should I pay them off immediately or at a more modest rate and use the money elsewhere?",finance

personalfinance,Question about consolidation offer,"Hi all, first time poster here. I have a 30 yr mortgage of 245k @ 4.625% interest rate and about 10k cc debt. I keep getting an offer from a company called Meridian offering debt consolidation of the aforementioned mortgage and cc for a loan in the full amount for 15 year repayment period @ 3% fixed(3.5% APR) for ~$1500 a month. It seems so tempting because my current mortgage payment is $1400 (that's without insurance and prop taxes) plus I pay about $600 a month for the cc (which is much more than minimum). So simple math shows I'll pay way less and pay off the mortgage in half the time. I am assuming I will no longer receive the tax credit for mortgage interest payment every year but that seems negligible compared to paying it off in 15 years less. So does this seem like a smart move? Does it even seem legit? Any insight would be appreciated",finance

personalfinance,Citi Simplicity or Chase Slate for balance transfer?,"I'm looking to decrease my debt and recently found Vertex's debt reduction calculator VERY helpful. It has given me the direction and motivation I needed to get this show on the road.

While playing around with the tool, though, I realized just how much interest I will end up paying on my Discover It credit card (started with 0% interest for 12 months but now it's been about 18 months). Credit Karma has suggested that I do a balance transfer to another credit card with 0% interest for the intro period.

I have narrowed my choices down to the City Simplicity card (0% interest for 21 months with 3% balance transfer fee) or the City Slate card (0% interest for 15 months with 0% [intro] balance transfer fee). The APR after the intro is 13.99-23.99% and 15.49-24.24% respectively.

My balance owed on the Discover card is $3879 with a 23.49% interest rate. I have a 680 TransUnion and a 658 Equifax credit score. Credit Karma rates my chances as ""good"" on either of these cards. According to Vertex, I should have my Discover balance paid off in 15-19 months (depending on finances).

Given the options, what would you do?

gaming,"Several years late to the party, here's how I thought Mass Effect 3 would end","I managed to avoid just about all spoilers regarding the conclusion of the trilogy and successfully completed my playthrough just a few weeks ago. So I played the ""fixed"" version with the updated endings and, while I did end up liking where Bioware went with the ending (a minority opinion, I know), I still feel my predicted ending would have been perhaps more interesting.

Entering ME3 armed with only the knowledge gained from the previous two games and the fact that the next title in the franchise is called ""Andromeda"", I became very curious as to the purpose of the Prothean superweapon dubbed 'Crucible'. The Reapers appear to be an unstoppable force; they are incredibly powerful as well as numerous and haven't even sniffed failure in their recurring mission to destroy intelligent organic life in the Milky Way. What could the various species of the galaxy possibly do to have any hope of vanquishing them?

Nothing.

For most of ME3, no one has any idea what the Crucible actually does. The Protheans just handed off plans for a device to survive the Reapers that we are assuming is an unfinished weapon that would destroy them. But what if the Protheans realized they had no chance to defeat this godlike machine race? What if the enigmatic weapon wasn't a weapon at all, and instead of launching a projectile or bomb, in fact propelled a huge amount of mass across an incredibly long distance?

Imagine a device that the Protheans have designed to be self-scuttling. They have left no records of its completion and successful use in the unlikely event that the Reapers discover they have escaped and decide to follow them. The last of the Protheans, as many as they could muster, gather in a fleet of ships and rally around the Crucible, which activates and fire them to the nearest galaxy, a feat never before accomplished. The Crucible self-destructs and the Reapers complete their purge without ever finding that some have survived.

When the Citadel species near the Prothean device's completion in secret, they discover to their horror that their predecessors gave up hope in fighting the Reapers and instead tried to run. They gather as many as they can and abandon the Milky Way to the same fate.

What would be cool about this ending? All of the politics, characters, history and lore of the ME universe are preserved and transposed into a new galaxy, a new frontier, with new species, new options, new faces. We don't lose what we loved in the ME trilogy, and we gain all of the potential of Andromeda. Plus, the Reapers still exist. They're still out there, in dark space. They may never return, but there is a lingering fear. A fear that perhaps the Citadel species didn't perfectly scrub the records of the Crucible and its purpose, and that the Reapers are on their way to finish the job, even if it takes thousands of years to get there, or not until Andromeda collides with the Milky Way.",technology

financialindependence,Tax treatment of dividends and capital gains: A myth of equality,"This may have been shared here before, if so apologies. 

[This publication from Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s557.pdf) analyzes the differences in investing style between a total return approach and an income approach, a familiar debate no doubt.

Of particular interest is the myth that LTCG and QD are taxed the same. 

&gt;The tax rate on qualified dividends is now equal to the tax rate on net longterm capital gains. This reduction led many investors to believe that there was no difference between the taxation of cash flows on qualified dividends and the taxation of capital gains. Not so: While it is true that the 15% tax rates are identical, the amounts that the tax is applied to are not. That is because a qualified dividend is taxed at 15% in its entirety; whereas if the equivalent sum is realized from a stock sale, the 15% capital gains tax will apply only to whatever portion of the sum represents a gain.

&gt; To illustrate this point, consider an investor who receives $10,000 from a portfolio. Depending on how the money was withdrawn, the investor could have the outcomes shown in the table at left (assuming a 15% federal tax on qualified dividends, a 15% federal tax on capital gains, and a 3% state tax on capital gains). As you can see, if the $10,000 consisted of a qualified dividend, the investor would pay $1,800 in tax. If the $10,000 was produced by a stock sale, the investor’s tax liability would range from zero (which assumes there was no capital gain) to $1,800 (which assumes that the stock cost the investor zero to acquire). For most investors, using lot accounting, the majority of tax on the cash flows under total return would fall between 0% and 2%, versus 18% for qualified dividends.

This may be old news to you, but this was like an epiphany for me.

Currently living at home nearly expense free (less than $50/mo) and working part time (~$12k net income in 2016). I only took student loans out for the first college I attended. After transferring, I've been able to pay back most of my student loans, and I only have two loans left; both are **direct unsubsidized** with a 6.8% interest rate with principal balances of  about $1000 and $950. 

Since I'm still a full time student, both loans are in deferment. And due to a few large payments I've made over the last few years, there are no payments due on either loan until November of 2022. I've built a solid credit score over the last few years, currently have ~$1000 in savings, and don't plan on moving out on my own until late 2017/early 2018. 

If I have the ability to pay both loans in full at the end of the month, should I? Would I realize any significant benefit credit-wise by leaving them alone for a bit? Does age of credit history even play into my credit score that much, or will it look better that I paid all my loans off way ahead of schedule?

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans?,"Hello All -

I have several student loans totaling about $25k in debt. The interest rates range from 3% - 6.75%. I pay about $600/month towards these loans and it has been slowly chipping away for 10 years but I've only paid off about $10k of my starting balance. 

I recently received a postcard from a company called Sofi. They claim you can consolidate and refinance your student loans with a lower interest rate. I checked out their site and was preapproved to consolidate to a 4.9% fixed interest rate over 5 years with a monthly payment of $467. It claims I will save $6,300 over the span of the loan repayment. 

I haven't tried reaching out to them to see if they have shorter payment terms. I can keep shelling out $600/month and I'd hope that could cut down on this repayment time frame if they could offer me a better payoff with that amount. 

Is Sofi/refinancing student loans legit, and if so, is this a better option than me selling my soul (I mean, paying my hard earned money) to the crooks at Navient each month?

I'm also considering the snowball method of repayment but I'd love to knock the interest rates down on some of these if I could in the meantime.

In terms of budget, we can put anywhere from the minimum ($600) up to ~$2000 into this payment each month. My question is whether we're better off putting extra money towards this loan or since it's low interest, putting this money to use in other ways.

We currently have ~$25k in savings, and after all expenses (rent, groceries, minimum loan payments, health insurance, etc.), we have about $2–3k leftover each month. 

My initial thoughts were maxing out a Roth IRA for both of us, and then putting the remainder towards the loan. My wife already does a 401k employer match, but I have no retirement account set up yet (29 yo, just graduated from grad school). 

The only other considerations for this ""flexible"" money is that I am currently building a startup that could run out of money 6–9 months from now, depending on fundraising activities (I'd estimate ~20–30% chance of being broke by July/August). With this uncertainty, I think having a larger savings cushion would be nice, though my wife does have a relatively stable corporate job that provides full benefits for both of us.

I have 9 different loan token with GreatLakes (one for each semester of college), but only one payment which is allocated automatically. The 9 different loans and current balance are seen as below.

Loan Token |Loan Type |Current Balance |Interest rate |Interest accrued per day

0|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford|	$478.87|	4.41%|	 $0.06


From the GreatLakes website:
&gt;Once your scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, we automatically apply any excess payment amounts to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time. Or, you can choose how to apply any excess amount.

So, I take that to mean GreatLakes is using the avalanche method. Which /r/personalfinance collectively agrees is a great way to go about paying back loans.

What I am confused about: Loan token 7 does not have the highest interest rate, but it has the highest interest accrued per day. Please explain to me why I shouldn't be allocating all my excess funds into this loan until the interest accrued per day is no longer the highest.

I owe 23.8k in federal student loans at 3.4% ~ 6.4%interest, the 6.4% loan is thankfully a few hundred.

The plan right now is pay off a credit card that I've had since end of high school, build an emergency fund, pay down the highest % student loans and consolidate the rest later this year.

Essentially, my question is while I save up about three months worth of pay, and I knock out the highest % loans.. should I start taking advantage of the org's 403(b) at the same time as building up my emergency fund?

I'm on the fence about the retirement account because I won't see any matching on my contributions until July marking my second year of employment and I want to make a dent in the high % student loans before consolidating once I figure out if the percentage is weighted or a simple average.

I've been fortunate enough that the snowball method helped carve out an entire paycheck dedicated to paying down/investing half my monthly pay in something. My expense for living is really minimal and I have those bases covered meticulously.. thanks Americorp..

Thank you for your time!",finance
personalfinance,Do we have any options with my fiancee's financed car?,"Long story short, my fiancee financed a car when she was quite young with her mom's advice. It ended up being a 7 year loan with a little over 6% interest. She was able to refinance with our credit union for about ~4% interest, but it's still a pretty high interest rate and the monthly payment is about $240 altogether, with ~$8,000 left owed. She currently makes $25k before taxes (about $1,200/month after taxes). Obviously the trade in value is much less than what it's worth, and according the Kelly Blue Book  we would probably have to pay the difference if we sold it privately. What are our options (if any) to either sell this car or get the monthly payments lower? Would it be better to bite the bullet and pay the difference to be able to sell it and be done with it or just keep going with paying it off? Ideally we'd like to just buy a cheap car outright and be down with the monthly payments for her.",finance
personalfinance,Better understanding tax rates and how it works specifically Federal income tax witholdings,"Hello, this is probably a stupid question but everyone I ask never seems to get what I am asking.  

Also this is my first time ever coming to reddit and singing up so if someone has already written something like this I apologize

Basically I am trying to figure out how federal tax witholdings work.  Between my wife and I for our W2 after deductions for 2016 we made $205,000 which puts us in the 25% tax rate.  What I don't understand about this is where do I see this rate taking effect?  
For example my first check on 2017 was for $16232 before any tax deductions and when i calculated my federal tax rate it was around 24% but then my next check was for 1232 in January (I work on 100% commission medical sales so i have a draw that i do every month of 1000). in which i was taxed about 5% in my federal tax column.

Could someone help me understand how the taxes work throughout the year?  How does it effect me?  Does someone have any links or online workshops to just basically gain a better understanding?

I never did finance classes ever and I am 31 now and I want to make sure that I am taking care of my family and properly maintaining my money so I am looking to really just get a basic knowledge of how all this works in like a 3rd grade explanation.

I have other questions but I will post that as a separate thread.

I did a few soft inquires with refinance places and they all kicked back rates that were pretty much the same.

USAA offers a career starter loan, its 25,000 and the rate is 2.99%, it needs to be payed back in 5 years.  I'm thinking of taking this option to cover 25K worth, and pay off whats remaining with the federal side as fast as possible.  OR I could pursue more options with what remains, maybe refinancing a lower amount will result in better terms?  

My concerns at the moment are, I have 0 experience with budgets, savings, and self control.  My new take home pay is higher than what I'm used to and I'm struggling to find a good balance as far as savings/retirement/loan payoff.

Take home pay will be 4600.00 after tax.

personalfinance,Should we sell our house or rent it out?,"My wife and I are contemplating downsizing our living situation in order to pay off debt.  We are stuck between two opposing philosophical arguments - sell our home and pay of debt with the profits, or rent our home out and structure the debt differently.  

Here are our details:

* **Net Income**: $230K
* **Current Debt:** (w/o mortgage) $178K (mostly student loans @ low interest rates, car note at low interest and credit cards)
* **Total Savings**: $3,500 
* **Value on our home**:~ $700K
* **Mortgage Balance**:$465K
* **Monthly Payment on our home**:$2,238(mortgage) + ~$900(taxes) +$285(HOA) = $3,423
* **Rental Rates in our area**: ~$3,200 - $3,500

**Background**: We are currently taking Dave Ramsay's Financial Peace University, and thus far his method and philosophy has made a lot of sense to us emotionally.  Paying off debt using the debt snowball and by selling assets - basically trying to live as debt free as possible, is emotionally appealing to us as this is quite stressful having to juggle everything month-to-month and paycheck-to-paycheck.

On the other hand we have our financial planner and realtor who sold us our current house advising us to hold on to the property and rent it out.  His thinking is that we can apply for a HELOC, consolidate our debt payments and use the rental income to accommodate for our first mortgage payment - using a small downpayment on a second home and thereby qualifying for a FHA loan.  His counsel is to not ""give up the golden goose"" because our home is in a desirable area.  

We are struggling between the need to cover ourselves right now, but also to plan for our future.  Right now we have very little in savings, and our cash flow each month is tight because of the debt we've gotten ourselves into by living a kid-free, travel-it-up lifestyle. We have a new baby and are trying to change our financial behavior to get ourselves out of debt (cutting up credit cards, writing detailed budgets, not going out to eat...) but it's hard to balance the need to increase our monthly cash flow by paying off debt quickly against taking on *more* debt for a long-term goal.

Credit card: ~2200 per month. Mostly groceries and clothing but also everyday things. We're not super strict on this. We've been trying to eat healthier and that means more fresh food and that costs more money. We've already been budgeting better, down from ~3200 a month, but could cut back more.

Car payment/ins: We have 2 cars, one paid fully, the second a lease at $210 per month and ins at $79 + $110 per month. We both drive to work

with our take home - all payments we have about 2k extra each month and I'm thinking that splitting that between savings and loans 50/50 would be best way to stay saving but get rid of our debts.

I project I'll graduate with $50-$50k in debt when I graduate based on my prior financial aid history, my EFC is 0.

I'm under no illusion that even under the best circumstances my salary in my chosen field after graduation will likely be far less than the ideal amount needed to pay off this debt in any kind of timely manner, i.e. within 10 years.

My dad makes an income large enough to get a decent tax return -- yet he isn't utilizing it since he's still pretty hardcore Japanese, isn't really Americanized at all, and takes a while to process information in English. The last time he filed for a tax return was in 2011, and hearing that his measly $400 return was adjusted by the IRS to $1400 had me thinking that he probably is missing out on more money than he should have gotten in 2011.

Anyway, I was filing his 2016 info through Turbotax when I found that he was actually due a $3,000+ tax return for 2016 for Federal Tax. But, there was one error with the state return asking for the 2015 tax. That wasn't filed (I'm guessing), so I ended up leaving it blank for now and haven't submitted the documentation yet. It additionally says that he owes roughly $1,000 in tax to the state, so I'm guessing that he potentially owes back taxes on additional years as well...

Earlier today I asked my dad for his tax related documents (work, divorce settlement as for who can be claimed as a dependent, retirement, etc), and I think I have everything needed to file past federal tax returns as well -- what should I do with that? Get 1040s until what year back? 2013? 2014? 2015? I know that the statute of limitations is expiring in roughly a month or so, so I really want to help my dad out. 

**What I have (may or may not be relevant for this, I can get more information from him upon request)**

1) Monthly paystubs, 2012-2017 (shows that he has 5+ state allowances and 0 federal for 2017)

2) Judgment of divorce stating who can claim who as dependents on which years

3) 2011-2016 W2's, 2011 also includes his filed tax return letter showing his amount that was being refunded to him, as well as a copy of the original documents he filed



**My main questions**

1) How far back can I claim returns for my dad (what year 1040s can I go back to)

2) How should I file past state taxes as well (MI), according to his 1040 he paid ~$2,000 in state income tax when his salary was ~$70K

3) Should I file turbotax even if I can't fill in the state tax line, because it requires 2015 tax information

4) Do I need to file 2015, 2014, 2013, etc by paper and how

If you made it here, thanks for reading all of this -- I actually haven't filed taxes before (19), so a lot of this is new stuff to me. I am probably missing a lot of key info here, so please PLEASE do let me know.",finance
personalfinance,Why is my girlfriend's tax return different this year?,"The exact same information through turbotax's free service. Last year her federal refund was 750 and state was 100. This year her federal refund is $7.00 and she owes the state one dollar...

The odd thing is her federal with holding both years has been different from mine. Whereas mine is the standard 10%. Hers seems to be about 2%. She claims to have not changed anything on her W4. I wanted to point out that her with holdings were the cause of the lack of refund but she showed me last year's taxes with the same 2% with holdings and same information where she received an appropriate refund for both state and federal.

What could have caused this? She said she hasn't made any changes to the way her taxes work, how and when she pays them, etc. The only thing I could think of was opting for quarterly payments and missing them, but I'm not sure how that works because nobody I know does that.

edit: SOLVED. She was using the wrong paperwork. I found the discrepancy. Now my question is, if her taxes are so close to 0-0, should I be changing my taxes to be similar to hers?",finance

investing,Question about an Annuity,"So I am at my bank and my banker asks me if I am interested in some fixed annuity (see the edit below). The reason he asks is because I have had a decent sized cash position at the bank for awhile and it just sits. I have no intention to do anything with it for awhile. Consider it a cash reserve.

-

At one point I cared about getting a higher % of interest on this money (like a credit union or Ally) but instead I keep it here to maintain a relationship with the private bank so assume I am not looking to get a higher interest rate and/or move to a different bank. Also let's assume the money is tied up for at least 7+ years at the bank and the bank currently pays less than .3% on a 5 year CD.

-

He tells me he has some ""fixed annuity"" that will pay about 2.8% (I don't remember the exact %) each year for 7 years. At the end of the 7 years, you get the principal back plus interest. I have the option of receiving the interest income each year or reinvesting it.

-

I can pull the money at any time but I lose some of the interest I accumulated. Also, the contract is insured by the state of New York (under the threshold).

-

I requested a print out of the information so I can read the fine print and I will get that on Tuesday.

-

I am also aware that interest rates are moving up (allegedly). Anyone familiar with this type of product? Any thoughts?

-

Edit: Without getting too convoluted and confusing. This is a family relationship with a private bank. The actual account was a suggestion for a family member with a large cash position at the bank.",finance
personalfinance,"More income with less tax return, help?","Synopsis: I've made almost a grand more than I did last year, and yet my tax refund in lower.

Nothing has changed since last year, except my Health insurance- though they're the same effect for both years.

I'm said to owe $130 in self-employment tax (which is correct to the research I've done), yet the federal refund goes down $200 and state goes down $50. I'm... just confused really.

personalfinance,(EU) Can investing money instead of paying off debt quicker be worth it?,"Hi All,

I've been trying to calculate if it's worth throwing whatever extra money towards my mortgage payment or investing it and pay the mortgage off later.

I put together an Excel sheet to calculate different scenarios, but I'm not sure if I got it right, mostly because it seems that I can pay the mortgage off sooner if I invest the same amount of money even if it's with a smaller ROI than the interest rate on the mortgage.

Can you please point out what my mistake is, or if I calculated everything correctly, explain how this works?

personalfinance,Education in UK/USA for Russian law student,"I am 25 old law student (actually finished my law school at 2014 with master's degree). 

I will start with economic info for Redditors cause it will simplify many things. 
I live in a big city, population of this city is higher that 1 mln. Average monthly salary is 30k roubles ($500), cost of 1 bedroom apartment for rent in central parts of city is about 12-14k roubles ($200-250), 10-12k ($170-200) in suburban area, 2 bedroom apartment begins with 15-18k roubles ($250-300) and goes up to 25-30k. I pay $180 now.
My income only consists of my salary - I work for big Russian accounting firm. Almost of all last year my salary was pretty low even for Russia since i was intern. In this year i have got promotion so my salary is about 550$ per month, I could even make my own savings like 100$. It is not very good, but it is OK for my region.
I could make more, in 3 years (and after 3 promotions, we have annually promotion system but sometimes you are not promoted each year, it depends on results of you and your department) I could double my salary. 

I wish I will study in some of UK/USA university but I checked spendings in UK and it makes me sad. For 1 year master degree study I will have to pay $25,5k. It is tuition fees + some of living costs, housing etc. for one year in the Plimouth University. Of course, it is not the best choice but the one of the cheapest. 
I think I could not take out a loan from UK/EU banks since I am not their citizen or resident. You could say I could take a loan from russian bank. Of course, I do, but there is high interest rate, for example, interest rates for mortgage are 9-11% at the minimum.

There are some grants for international students. I will aplly for some of them but most of grants do not refund your living costs and etc. Even if I got this grant I would need $10-12k. 

Also I owe $2000 to my relatives. No interest rate, though.

I could make my spendings lower by moving to another apartment and live with roommate or get a girlfriend and live with her, choose apartment closer to work so I will not spent on transportation. Also I could prepare food by myself more, go out less. But i am not sure that it is best choice. I could change my job but in 3-4 years there will be good salary for average resident of Russia and my city inhabitant (it will be twice as much as average salary) and I really love my job.

How can I spend my $100-150 savings? 

There is bank with 8% deposit interest annually. Secondly, there are some investments instruments - unit investment funds with 30% annual yield at the minimum but also it is risk to get losses. 
I am planning to pay debts from deposit's profit and investment fund's profit, and put more and more money on deposit.
But what to do? With this situation I will only in 5-6 years be able to save sufficient amount of money to study in foreign university, the same thing with studying in the US and buying something ""big"" - a car, an apartment. In 5-6 years I hope I will have family, children and so on. What to do? Maybe new ideas will come up from this discussion.",finance

I'm currently paying the $201/month minimum into my loan and have started attacking hers. Her min payment is $170/month but I've put 2,500 into it in the last month.

We also pay $180 for cell phones a month, have a storage unit at $110 a month, child care - $320/month but will be $480/month in the summer, and her car note is $350/month. No current rent or utilities as we are in a parents house while house searching.

personalfinance,Roth IRA vs 401k comparison,"I hear the Roth IRA frequently suggested as preferable to a 401k, so I decided to run a comparison of the numbers. Based on the assumptions of 100,000 salary/single the 401k comes out 20% ahead of the Roth IRA at retirement after accounting for taxes.

My calculations are below - Am I missing anything, or is the Roth IRA only preferable at a lower salary?  

**Calculations**

Note: This only takes federal income taxes into account. For simplicity, I didn't account for state/local income taxes.

Assumptions: 100,000 salary, single, maximum Roth IRA contribution  


**Option A: Roth IRA**  
Net Income after 5,500 Roth IRA contribution

    100,000  salary
     (4,050) personal exemption
     (6,300) standard deduction
    =89,650  taxable income
    (18,190) tax
     (5,500) Roth contribution
    =76,310  net income (salary - tax - Roth contribution)  


**Option B: 401k**  
Net Income after 7,350 401k contribution (401k contribution adjusted to have same net income as Roth)

    100,000  salary
     (4,050) personal exemption
     (6,300) standard deduction
     (7,350) 401k contribution
    =82,300  taxable income
    (16,340) tax
    =76,310 net income  

So now, we have the same net income of 76,310 in both options, but with these balances:
 
    Roth IRA: 5,500 
        401k: 7,350  

With 30 years of compounded interest at 6% annually, the balances become:

    Roth IRA: 31,589.20
        401k: 42,215.66  

Now, let's withdraw it all as a lump sum at retirement:

    Net Roth withdrawal: 31,589 (after taxes, no taxes)
    Net 401k withdrawal: 37,898 (after 4,318 in tax, see below for calculation)  

Tax calculation for 401k withdrawal:

     42,216  income (401k balance)
     (4,050) personal exemption
     (6,300) standard deduction
    =31,866  taxable income
     (4,318) tax
    =37,898  net income  

So with the 401k, I come out 6,309 (20%) ahead of the Roth IRA. It's often stated that taxes may be higher in retirement, which would impact the advantage of the 401k, but the total tax would have to be 150% higher before it ends up being an equivalent investment to the Roth IRA.",finance

personalfinance,Just finished grad school at 28. Student loan debt at $35k with very high interest rate. Should I save money or pay off my loan aggressively?,"I'm single and just finished my grad school in December and currently have a student debt at $35k with a private lender, 10% interest rate with 10-yr repayment plan. The minimum payment is $470 every month. I also have emergency fund of $8,000 sitting in my savings account.  
  
I have been unsuccessful with finding lenders that can help me refinance my student loans with lower interest rate. So I want to get rid of my student loans as soon as possible.  
  
I started a new job in January, and currently I'm thinking of putting all of my $8,000 savings towards my $35k debt, and then pay off the rest of it aggressively in the next few months with my salary.

&amp;nbsp;

My monthly cash flows is as follows:  
Net Income
&amp;nbsp;


* $4,900 / month ($2,450 every two weeks), net   
  
Expenses
&amp;nbsp;


* Rent and utilities $900 / month  
* Groceries, eating out $350 / month  
* Pharmacy $100 / month  
* Gas, car maintenance $150 / month  
* Car insurance $150 / month  
* Phone, internet $70 / month  
* Personal (clothing, movies, gym, etc.) $150 / month  
* Student loan repayment $470 / month  
  
Total expenses is about $2,300

&amp;nbsp;

So that leaves me with net cash flow at the end of every month of $2,500. If I put all my savings and this extra cash flow towards paying off my student loan, I feel I should be able to pay off all my debt in the next 10-11 months. But I'm also afraid if I pay them aggressively I will be living without savings.

I have never been great with saving, however I feel like Im nearing a point in my life where I need to learn. The debt I'm referring too is two credit cards, both with interest rates above 20%. I have decent credit rating, around 700, and it seems like the biggest thing keeping my score down is my balances (both cards maxed out). My total credit card debt is roughly $1900. I make at least the minimum payments each month but the interest is really killing me and it doesn't sound like i can lower my rates without paying my balances. I'm a full time student (24 y/o) and I work as a server. I brought in about $18k last year and my return is about $2700. I have managed to cover the cost of my education without loans but in doing so have maxed out my cards (on food, car repairs, other life needs etc.). My savings is non existent and I have been using my cards to cover any emergencies which is hard to do when they are maxed. Until recently I have been living pretty much paycheck to paycheck (usually any extra money goes into paying the cards). I could cut back on spending but I also don't want to disrupt my lifestyle too much and im not a frivolous spender anyway. So my question boils down to this: Should I use all of my return to pay off my credit cards or save it and up my monthly payment to say $100-$200?

Edit: a better way to say "" i have covered my cost for school without loans"" would be ""due to much support from family and friends, i have been able to cover my education cost without needing loans""

As I write this I am actually filling out the forms to get financial aid. Im not concerned with being unable to make payments on that loan in the future as i still receive support. The loan is going to be used to cushion the upfront cost of going to a university verses a community college (where I previously attended)

Edit 2: as pointed out in the comments, when i say tax return I am referring to my refund (which is $2700). Thanks for the correction!",finance
robotics,Robot dog idea,"So I had this idea for a robot dog and I wanted to get some feedback on the idea.


A lot of robots have been introduced lately.  Typically these are cute little bots that roll around and don't do much.  Another problem is that they typically roll around on wheels, which makes climbing stairs impossible.  What if they build robots with legs?  That would solve the stair problem, but it then it would be kind of creepy and scary, so it wouldn't sell.  What if the robot was built like a dog?  Dogs are already accepted in the home, so a robot dog could easily blend in.

What would a robot dog do:

* It would greet you at the door like you're a rock star, just like a real dog
* It would alert you to danger like a real dog
* It would provide companionship, like a real dog
* At night it would wonder around the house checking for burglars, fire, co2 poisoning, and alert everyone if something was amiss.
	
So why not get a real dog?

* They have to be let out several times a day
* They have to be fed several times a day
* You can't leave them and go away for the weekend or on vacation
* Some people are allergic to fur, so they can't have pets
* Vet bills are very costly, especially when they get sick
* They die which can be a very traumatic event for a person or family

	
What the robot dog would be like

* Modular component design.  The processor, batteries and cameras would be upgradeable.
* The dog should be able to bark, and possibly talk, although a talking dog would be a bit odd and so people may or may not accept that.
* The dog should be able to listen and follow voice commands
* The dog should be able to recognize family members and friends of the family.  Initially, when friends are first introduced, the dog would cautious until a ""ok person"" word is given.
* Changeable outer covering, available in various colors, lengths, and types (course, smooth, long, etc).
* Replaceable outer covering of fur.  Available in various colors, lengths, and types (course, smooth, etc.)
* Cost could be anywhere from $1,000 - $1,500, which seems like a lot, but in the long run, after you buy a regular dog, feed it, take it to the vet regularly, you're going to easily spend that much.  Once they get old and sick you could spend that on one illness.  If the company wanted to make more money, they could have a premium line of fur coverings that are more lifelike.  These could go into the $2k - $10k range depending on the material.",technology

If the terms are: 5% on up to £2500, but must pay in £500 a month that means:

 - I will earn 5% interest (pre-tax) on up to £2500, per month. 

 - If I have over £2500 in the account, I will still earn 5% interest on the £2500 in the account

 - If I have over £2500 in the account, I will either get no interest or a lower interest rate on any extra money in the account

personalfinance,Rewards Checking Vs. Savings Account,"I recently got married, but for the immediate convenience my wife and I have not joined bank accounts yet. I bank with Chase (that $200 bonus for signing up was nice when I was first starting out), and she banks with a smaller, local bank. I recently came to the realization that her checking account is a rewards checking account that gives her a certain percentage yield (as opposed to miles, points, cash back, etc.). She also has a savings account with this bank. So, as we are beginning to save more as a couple, I asked her to ask a bank representative what the annual percentage yield would be for each account (she and the rep said ""interest rate"", but to my understanding that's not quite the right terminology). They said the interest rate for the checking account was 1.99% compounded monthly, and the interest rate for the savings account was 0.1% compounded quarterly. So am I missing something, or would it be a significantly better yield to just put everything into the checking account and close the savings account? 

TL;DR Why have a savings account at .1% compounded quarterly when you also have a rewards checking account at 1.99% compounded monthly?


Also, more generally, are there any other rewards checking or savings accounts that we should look into?

personalfinance,Friend took ACA subsidies for 2016 but didn't make enough income to qualify - three questions,"Hi - 

I don't know if PF is even the right sub for this issue, but I'm hoping some people here know enough about how the ACA and income taxes work to answer my questions. I know the ACA may be on the way out, but for now it's still the law of the land, and so I am asking these questions on behalf of a friend of mine who benefits greatly from it, but may have to go without, even if it is not repealed.

My friend has a very limited income, and until the ACA, he had to go without health insurance. He has some serious health problems (Diabetes, Heart Disease - including a bypass done before he had medical insurance). In past years he has barely made enough income to qualify for ACA (we live in a state without Medicaid expansion, and he is not eligible for Medicaid here). However, having health insurance the last two years has been a godsend for him. Unfortunately, in 2016, even though he was fully subsidized for ACA health insurance premiums, he did not actually wind up making enough money (less than federal poverty level) to even qualify for ACA coverage (but remember, there is no Medicaid or high-risk pool available to him in our state). 

I have three questions:

1) When he files his federal income tax return for 2016, will he owe money back for ACA subsidies he received since he didn't actually wind up making enough money to qualify to be on an ACA plan (and thus to receive the maximum subsidies he used to pay for it)?

2) Are the ACA administrators likely to remove his current 2017 ACA subsidies or force cancellation of his ACA insurance for 2017 once he files for 2016, based on the fact that he didn't make enough money in 2016 to qualify for coverage last year?

3) He has some small savings he managed to scrape together in past years when he made a little more money. If the answer to either of my first two questions is ""yes"", could he simply falsely claim on his federal income tax return for 2016 to have made just enough money to equal the federal poverty level (in other words, to lie and say he made more money than he did - it would be slightly more than a $1,000 difference in income - and actually pay taxes on that falsely higher amount)? Were he to do this, the additional taxes he would owe for 2016 would be small enough that he could afford to cover them from his savings. Based on the type of work he does, it would be very difficult for the IRS to prove that his income was less than he would need to claim.

personalfinance,Looking for advice - car needed with little/no downpayment and bad credit,"Hey everyone,

So my girlfriend is in a struggle.  About a week ago she slid on some ice, hit something on the side of the road and did massive damage to her car.  The car was deemed total and her family haggled up to about $7k for her car from insurance while she still owes $9k for it.  No stop gap insurance, so she's negative $2k.  She also had a recent surgery putting her out of work for two weeks and is in the process of building a stronger financial situation, but is struggling right now.

Assuming she can get her family to assist with the remaining $2k, what is the best course of action for her?  Knowing the general advice I told her she should look into getting a cheap junker within the $3k range.  She doesn't have money to pay for something in cash though.  We're also not the smartest when it comes to cars and are worried about buying something that will end up being a terrible purchase.  She drives roughly 30 miles a day when she works and we live in the midwest with cold winters.

The other option we can think of is getting a different car loan with the dealership, something in the $5k to $9k range, which would put her roughly in the same position she was in.  Two problems though.

1. Potentially no down payment
2. Bad credit (&lt;600) due to her mistakes in the past

We broke out her finances and determined that she has $700 and $1k a month that can be used to pay off her debts.  Even though she doesn't have a strong footing now, I believe over time she can start rebuilding herself.

With that being said, we're not sure which route is best to take.  She doesn't have money to pay for a car flat out in cash.  If she we're able to get that money then we would struggle to find what a good car to get is.  I have done some research and have a rough idea on what's more reliable, but even then I'd be nervous about finding a car on craigslist for sale.  On the other side, if she can get a loan with  no down payment for a car then her interest rate will be crazy high due to her terrible credit.  On her previous car she cosigned with her father, but he said he probably wasn't doing that again.

Any advice on what to do in this situation?  I've been trying to assist her with getting her other financial issues on track.  Shes recently (in the past 5 months) gotten a stable job and trying to get things in a better position, so this is really unfortunate timing.  Thanks much for any advice.

Mortgage - $745 (but this will lower in June due to escrow)

Car- $250 plus $800 a year for insurance, $210 a year for plates/registration

Student loans - $220 on IBR for fed loans, $585 for private loans

Utilities - $370 (gas, electricity, internet, and water)

Credit cards - Roughly $1100

Balances on them are: $14k, $14k, $3k, $3k, $1.5k

personalfinance,Multiple car issues,"Hello, Last Tuesday I purchased a 2010 Hyundai Elantra from a highly regarded dealership. Earlier in the day I test drove a car from another dealership to my trusted mechanic for an inspection and he found a lot of problems with it and I ended walking away from that car and the dealership after some negotiation.

I admit I rushed into the car I did purchase due to being distraught with the kind of pricing and interests rates I was being quoted at first dealer and I was thinking no one would give me a reasonable rate and certainly not the one I was asking for. It was later in the day so my mechanic had left shop and all I did was a very short test drive a couple of blocks with the salesman in back.

I'm not car savvy at all so I didn't notice any problems right there and admittedly was a bit nervous with the salesman in back instead of just being able to test drive it alone. So I go through with the deal, sign all the paperwork even when I found out the interest rate was very high. I'm a first time car buyer with the only credit history being one credit car that I've had for a year and a half. I planned to pay it off early anyways so I wasn't to concerned with it. The next day I take it to my mechanic to find out what needs work at some point. He test drives it and says there is something wrong with the transmission.

It hard up-shifts and and down-shifts, it's a very noticeable feeling but only really happens once the car has been warmed up for a bit first, which is why I didn't feel anything when I test drove it the day before. he also found that the front tires were nearly bald and I would have to replace those soon and that the oil was dark and a bit burnt smelling.

He says the car could very well need a new transmission. I've looked up common issues for that model year and there were numerous complaints about consumers having transmission problems and needing them replaced pretty early on(my car has 76,000 on it). I talk to my salesman about this and he tells me I have a 90/3000 mile warranty that would cover a new transmission if it comes to that.

But first he schedules an appointment with their service station to have them look it over and confirm any transmission issues and the next day they call and the tech says that there definitely is an issue with it but they're not a Hyundai dealership so it would have to be sent to one for a final diagnosis. However he tells me that since I'd only had it for a week and the paperwork was still being finalized that I should drive it a few more weeks as is and then they would send it over and I would probably be without the car for a week.

I'm getting discouraged because I wasn't expecting all these issues right off the start when I purchased the vehicle, but I do take full responsibility because I signed the paperwork and was just hoping it was a perfectly good car. I have the car back in my possession currently in it's faulty condition and the dealer still wants me to drive it a few more weeks before anything gets done.
At the start of the week I got a call through the bank I got financed through and they just wanted to confirm some things with me which I did. However their last question was ""do you currently have the vehicle and is it in sound running condition?"". It was in service at that time and I told them I did not and that there was a transmission problem. And they told me that until I'm able to tell them I have the car and it's running well, the financing was on hold. and after a lot of back and forth the rest of the week until today the dealer said they were going to go ahead with the financing after I get the car repaired and that the only other option I have is for them to find me a vehicle in the same price range to move into instead.

I was hoping for there to be some way to pull out of the deal because I'm really uncomfortable with this whole situation at this point. Today I called the bank again to see why when the last time I talked to them they were saying they weren't going to finance it due to the car trouble and it not scheduled to be repaired for a few more weeks, to now the dealer saying it was a done deal and I had my 2 options.

However, their saying it's still on hold but not due to the transmission but because my pay is coming up short. I was honest about my pay and never changed my answer. I provided pay stubs but on one of them I had worked a 6th day so my pay was inflated compared to a normal week and I think that's where the problem stems from. Regardless, I was told that the deal would most likely have to be restructured due to this.

Since I would like to get out of this deal if there is any possible way, **my question is, if the contract has to be redone, would they just do that and tell me the updated terms, or would I have to agree and sign something else?**

**TL;DR: Rushed into car purchase, found out there are multiple problems, the biggest being the transmission, told it wouldn't be fixed for a few weeks and to drive it during the meantime, financing bank saying my monthly pay not adding up and deal might be redone, trying to see if there is any way out of the deal**",finance
personalfinance,"25 y/o, $24,000 in debt, considering going back to school. Need advice.","Hi, I've been lurking on this sub for a while and I need some advice.

It's somewhat embarrassing, but I flunked out of college 3 years ago due to bad grades. I was going through terrible times in my personal life and I let it affect my performance, racking up $25000 in student loans during that time. Anyways, I went through some counseling and I think I can finish this time. 

The problem is, that with the GPA I finished with (1.7), it would be difficult for me to transfer. However, my school is allowing me to re-enroll during the summer semester (but I was told I won't be eligible for federal student aid. I should still be able to get private loans). This will likely cost around $30,000 for the rest of my credits. ($10,000 a year for 3 years)

I'd like some advice on how I should plan for this. 

My current situation:

Income: $2000 Monthly

Budget: 

* Rent - $600
* Utilities - $50
* Phone - $40
* Gas - $50
* Internet - $50
* Student Loan Payments - $110 (IBR, paying only interest)
* Health Insurance - $150
* Car Insurance - $50
* Groceries - $200
* Other/Stuff I forgot about/Entertainment - $100
* Savings(Roth IRA) - $460
* Savings(Emergency Fund) - $140 + whatever is left over.

Debt:

* Federal Student Loans - $24,000 (Ranging from 3.4% ~ 6.8%, Average 5% interest)
* No Other Debt

Savings/Assets:

* Emergency Fund - $7,000
* Roth IRA - $6,500
* 2001 Honda Accord (Paid off)

I plan on going back to school part time while working my current job full time. The biggest problem is I obviously don't have the money to do so, and will have private loans to fund it. 

Questions:

1. Should I stop contributing to the Roth to pay for college? I feel like I'm missing out if I don't max it out.
2. Is a second job worth it? 
3. Will I be eligible for private student loans without a cosigner? My credit score is 760.
4. If I get private student loans, my total debt will be $55,000. Is this a manageable amount? I plan on majoring in software engineering.

personalfinance,SO has ~$110k in student loan debt. Help would be greatly appreciated.,"I’ve followed PF and similar websites for years and you guys have really helped me educate myself and make sure I didn’t make any life altering mistakes throughout college. I recently graduated with very little student loan debt. I make $30k a year as a teacher and have no debt besides these student loans. I have a newer car that’s paid off, a great credit score, and have an emergency fund that would cover 6 months of expenses if needed. All in all, I feel like I’m sitting pretty good for being in my mid 20’s. 

Where it gets tricky is that my girlfriend has fallen into a trap that I’ve heard about so many times with people our age. She has a $94,000 in private student loan debt and another $15,000 in federal loans. She makes $30,000 as a similarly paid teacher. I know taking out $110k in loans to make $30k a year is insane, but it is where we’re at currently. Throughout school she let her parents co-sign these loans, which are between 7-10% interest. Neither of them really talked about the implications of taking out these loans until she graduated, which was obviously way too late and due to a lot of financial illiteracy. 

I know the first suggestion is that she’s going to need to increase her income but as a new teacher, she already has a full workload. She will definitely be working during the summer which should help. For the federal loans, she is going to apply for IBR and should be able to apply for PSLF after ten years. I haven’t read a single thing that would be applicable to the private loans though. I’m fine helping with them, but I really just don’t see how even our combined income could tackle this debt without being broke for many years to come. We’ve already drastically changed our budget and are living pretty frugally as is but just the private loans take up over half of her monthly pay (15 year loans, about $900 a month). Is there anything else we haven’t considered? 

Her credit is in the 400’s and we’re going to work on repairing it as soon as possible. I fear having this low of a credit score (coupled with a similar one for her parents) means that it will be very hard to refinance for a lower interest rate. I was also curious how much her credit score/debt would affect me if we were to get married. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Car Loan after accident,"Hey PF
Just got a situation that I am not sure how to proceed with.
Last month I was in a car accident that I was not at fault for but my car was totaled. On my insurance I have a depreciation clause which basically states that in the event my car is totaled in a non-fault collision within two years of the purchase, I am supposed to receive the amount i purchased the vehicle for. Ironically, the vehicle was totalled EXACTLY two years to the date of the purchase and therefore they may not be paying it out (legal stuff I know)

So here is my situation. Worst case scenario insurance will only be paying around 18000 on the vehicle (the depreciated value of my vehicle); when I still owe just under 21000. 

If this is the case, should I deal with the 350 dollar/month term I have been paying for the past two years, or should I attempt to pay it off as fast as possible with the use of savings (Not a whole lot)/Credit Cards. The interest rate on the loan is 1.99% so I feel that using a credit card to just get the loan off my name is a bad idea as credit cards have higher interest. That being said, 350/month for the next year for essentially no reason will frustrate me to no end.

Hubby &amp; I are working on filing Federal taxes for 2016. It was the first full year where we were married (married Oct 2015) and we changed our status from single to married at the beginning of 2016 on W4's. Also, both of our allowances are at 1 (can't remember if this was the case in years past). We have no kids. 

We both have a full time job and contribute 5-6% to our employer matching 401k. In 2016 we made about $145k combined. Hubby made $77k &amp; I $68k.

After putting everything into TurboTax, we owe about $6k. I'm guessing the change in martial status/decrease in amount of taxes taken out caused this. We had a little house interest to deduct and some student loan interest. We'll be using the standard deduction since we didn't have enough to do itemized. We have our filing status set to married.   If it matters, we live in a state with no state income taxes. I can also share more details on the amounts of interest if needed. 

My first question - 
Are there any creative options for our $6k bill? We can pay it, but I'm curious if there's any option for a last minute 401k or IRA, etc... payment to lower the amount we owe to the Feds? We'd rather pay ourselves if at all possible! 

Second question - 
Any recommendations for 2017? Since we're using Turbotax, we can't really ask them tax advice. We don't want a huge refund (or even a refund at all) each year, but would prefer not to have to drop a large amount of money like this again. Should we adjust our Allowances on our W4? I know increasing our 401K contribution should help some, but how much should we do and how much will it help? 2017 combined salary should be $155-160k. Deductions for home interest will also be significantly higher in 2017. We purchased our home 2 months ago in December.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Opinions,"Back in March of 2014 I consolidated my 3 student loans into a single loan for a 15 year term at variable rate interest. My initial interest rate was 5.87%. With an auto pay discount of .25% and a loyalty discount of .25% (I opened up a bank account with my lender) my rate was reduced down to 5.37%. My consolidation loan was for $34,729.22. Flash forward almost 3 years and my current balance due is $24,275 and my interest rate has risen up to 5.95% after the .50% discount for auto pay and loyalty. I have been trying to be as aggressive as possible to the point where I am now make almost 2.5 payments each month. 

I have begun shopping around to see if I can get into a fixed rate loan at a shorter term to cut down on payments and also avoid rate increases. My rate has jumped .75% in the last year alone. Does it make sense for me to jump into a loan with a shorter term, but higher monthly minimum payment? My current debt-to-income ratio is 36% based on my net pay(my half of my mortgage and my car payment is factored in as well as my student loan). I have been conditionally approved for a loan for 5 years at 4.31% which would mean a minimum monthly payment of $445 and that would push my DTI up to 39%. Is this too high of a jump?

personalfinance,Can I increase my federal allowances on my W4 substantially to make up for maxing out 401k contributions?,"Tell me what's wrong with this plan, if anything. I'm sure there's something obvious I'm missing.

I want to keep my take-home pay the same but max out my 401k contributions. Using a W4 paycheck calculator (found here: https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary/), I calculated my salary off my last paycheck using my current federal and state W4 numbers (single, 2 federal allowances and 1 state allowance). The calculator gets within single digits of my take-home pay so I figure it is accurate enough.

So I was in bed thinking, what if I just max out my 401k contributions, which would be $750/paycheck (I get paid twice a month, so 750 x 24 = $18k). So I checked it on the calculator and figured out that to keep the same amount of take-home pay, I'd need my federal allowances to go from 2 to 16.

Not sure if that's somehow illegal or something, but I figure since my 401k contributions aren't subject to income tax anyway and the FICA amount is negligible, I don't see where the problem would come in.

Please tell me if this is a really bad idea or not. I feel like having 16 allowances on my W4 is not good but as long as I'm getting taxed at the right amount, it should be ok, right?

I'm getting my MS in Electrical Engineering and will graduate with slightly less than $30k in federal unsubsidized student loans in May. I live with a family of 4 people in a one bedroom apartment in NYC; my father is the sole bread-winner earning an income of about $35k as a taxi-driver (he basically pays everything from rent to the food we eat). We live in more of a ghetto neighborhood and would like to finally move out into a better two or three bedroom apartment.

The reason I am posting here is because this would be my first source of income aside from scholarships that were used to pay for tuition and books. The job pays $115k per year (paid in monthly increments) and comes with options on retirement savings, medical insurance, life insurance, etc. I'm trying to understand what each entails, but honestly it's very new to me. For all of these years, we seem to just get by albeit definitely ignoring things like an emergency fund or retirement.

Having said that, I am not sure where to start once I get my first paycheck. I will be supporting my family with my father from then on. How much should I save to eventually get a new apartment? How should I handle paying my student loans? How much should be set aside for emergencies? What are some useful financial products that I'll need? I mean, I don't even have a credit card!

A cash-out refi would leave us &lt;20% equity so we'd have to pay PMI which is no good. 

Other options seem to be Home Equity Loan or a Home Equity Line of Credit.

personalfinance,How should my girlfriend pay off her student loans in the most responsible manner? Details inside.,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to gain some insight and get some help from the community here. I know this is a fairly common circumstance, but I'm trying to help my girlfriend get out of debt and pay off her student loans. I've recently realized how large of a burden they are in her life and want to help her pay them off as soon as possible, as does she. I've read through other posts regarding this situation but wanted to get some help with her specific case hopefully. Listed below are her monthly expenses and income. I am hoping to get some advice on how she should distribute her funds in a way that makes the most financial sense. 

Side note, we have a friend who we have invested in in real estate in the past with good returns at typically 10% ROI within 6 to 8 months. He has a project coming up that we'd each like to invest $20k into. Is this a good idea given her current financial situation? Double side note, she is planning to open a ROTH IRA by the end of this month. Good idea?

personalfinance,Summer internship in different state than permanently reside in,"I've been filing my tax returns for the past several years, but this is the first year I've done a summer internship in a state (B) that's different from the one I attend college in (A). I've already submitted my tax return (through TaxHawk) but I need help determining whether I need to submit an amended return. Here are some details:

I work a part-time job throughout the year in state A and I worked a three-month full-time job in state B during the summer of 2016. I was charged a state B income tax on this income; this tax was automatically applied to my paychecks. 

On the ""State"" section of my TaxHawk tax return, it seems that this three-month portion of my income was considered as state A income, and that an additional state A income tax was applied to this money -- even though I already paid this income tax, and to state B (the appropriate state), not to state A. TaxHawk calculated that I owe $800 to state A.

I submitted my federal return and my return for state A, but I did not submit a tax return for state B. Also, I do not think I said on my return that my summer income was taxed by both states.

My expected federal refund is more than $800, so paying state A won't really be a hit, but I'd like to not pay as much. Is there anything I can do to more accurately reflect my situation?",finance
personalfinance,Refund redirected to past tax due (2013) with no prior notice?,"Hi PF, I just got 2 pieces of mail from the state of CA:

2—A letter stating that my tax return for this year was intercepted and sent to the IRS... and apparently not applied to this state tax-due, so maybe for something else?

So I went to the IRS refund tracker for this year, and see that some of my federal refund was also intercepted / diverted to pay a past due IRS obligation.

personalfinance,Drastically different returns with TurboTax or HR Block?,"Tax season is upon us and like many of you I am currently in the process of preparing my federal and state returns.  

Like in years past, I had planned to use the free version of TurboTax to prepare and file my return. Typically before I file I double check my return with HR Block's free version and if the numbers agree (or are close) I file. However, this year I ran into a snag. 

As it stands, TurboTax calculates that I am due a federal return of $568 and a state (California) return of $378.  

HR Block calculates that my federal return is $1633 and my state return should be $742. 

Since these are drastically different numbers and I would hate to leave money on the table, I was wondering if anyone here had any insight as to why there would be such a large difference and what I should do?

I worked from Jan-August last year.  I made $32450 (reported on W2) during this time and claimed 1 allowance on my W4. 

I started grad school in September and was awarded a fellowship.  The school issued me a 1098T with $4470 reported for tuition (box 1) and $11,580 reported for scholarships and grants (the fellowship, box 5). I did not double report the fellowship money that I used for living as income.  

I also paid $1450 towards student loan interest, which is reported on a 1098e.  

 
I double checked that all of my forms had been entered into both programs. My return was estimated by TurboTax to be federal: $1633, state $742 PRIOR to entering the 1098T form. Is it possible that either program is not handling the 1098T information correctly?

personalfinance,"Taking out a small loan (of which I will have the money soon enough) to build credit, good idea?","Title might be a bit confusing so let me explain.

I am in the market for a car. Currently a 19 yo full-time college student, about $100/week income. At the beginning of next quarter of college, I will get a financial aid check of $5,000 flat. This is for my rent/books, tuition is already paid for.

However, for the previous few quarters I have been saving up cash, and last quarter I totally took the entirety of that $5,000 check and put it towards my rent until the end of my lease. In other words: I could totally pocket the $5,000 if I wanted to. The money I have been saving was for the purposing of buying books next quarter, giving myself some breathing room in terms of hygiene products, new clothes, etc. 

Since I was going to blow that cash on a car anyway, would it make sense to take out a small loan and purchase a car, then use that cash to make payments and build my credit? I was thinking of getting a $4,500 loan, buying something around that price, then using the fin-aid money to pay off the loan.

I know i would end up paying a little more by the nature of loans, but do you guys think it is worth it to help establish my credit? Asking especially because next school year I may have to take out private loans (bye-bye scholarship), and was hoping to establish a bit of a credit history. 

To disclose: I already have fed-loans, but have not been able to make any meaningful progress in terms of repayment. 

I was planning to go through my credit union, which specifically doesn't have a fee for paying off early, but still wanted to make 5-6 months of payments (little less than a 1000/month) just to establish that repertoire credit companies like. 

What do you guys think? I am an economics major, so ravage me.

edit: with a car, i could easily increase my income to about $200/week (was, at my best, doing $250 for three weeks straight). ALSO, I am paid under the table, if that means anything. I'm a tutor in a high-end college town, and have had to turn down several people because taking the bus everywhere is a huge drag in terms of time trade offs.

personalfinance,Credit Card Stress,"Hi personalfinance! Longtime lurker, first time posting. 
Basically, I'm an idiot and got messed up in a few credit cards. I wanted independence really quickly, and didn't really have the financial means to do so, therefore credit cards. 

I have been making at least the minimum payment on all of them this entire time (about 4 yrs, however I've been spending on them as well....) and I am ready for them to be done. This sub has helped me see that even if I have to cut back on some ""luxury"" things, the debt needs to go first. I have saved up enough money to do some big payments, but don't really know what to do about them. 
I have gathered there are two methods, and really at this point they all have the same terrible interest rate, so paying one over the other probably isn't going to make  much of a difference (I think?). None of them have any great ""rewards"" because I was not very smart about this. 

In a year, my parents are going to sell me their house for what is left on their mortgage. I'm going to need a loan because it's still going to be about $20k. I want to make sure my credit score is the best it can be, and that I don't have these credit cards looming over me. So if there is some specific advice I'm missing on that, feel free to point it out to me! 

My question is: do I pay off the credit cards and leave them open with a small balance? Do I pay off the credit cards entirely and just stop using them? Or is there some middle ground I'm missing?

Thank you for your advice! I feel very stupid about this whole thing and it's been a private embarrassment for a long time. I can't imagine how great it will feel to finally be rid of this anxiety every month!",finance

I've read a number of articles on why you shouldn't get a refund, but truthfully I still want one. Unfortunately I'm garbage at math and may have my adjusted tax withholdings taking out too much from my paycheck. Last year I made over $55k, and voluntarily allocated an extra 25% of my paycheck to federal taxes so I ended up paying $17,259 in federal taxes. I also moved from a state with high state tax (NY) to one without any (FL). I have my own freelance business but make under $3000 a year with it, and have a full time job. In 2016 I  made over $55k and got $10k back in my return. This year I'm expecting to make $75k+. I am terrible at budgeting and like the concept of a refund so that I don't owe taxes at the end of the year, but feel I need to adjust my withholdings so that I'm not getting 10k back, because that seems a bit ridiculous. Would really like some concrete advice on what percentage I should voluntarily adjust for federal taxes. The articles are vague and I can't figure it out. I will say that with my taxes, retirement contributions 10-15% each paycheck, and student loans I am living paycheck to paycheck which seems unnecessary. Luckily, I'll be using half of my refund this year to build an emergency fun. Please help.",finance

personalfinance,How do you compare mortgage lenders when they all give you complicated cost sheets with different things? How to compare apples to apples?,"My husband and I are purchasing our first home and getting very frustrated with the process of shopping for a lender.

We have submitted an offer of sale and it has been accepted. The offer stated ""buyer's choice"" for the lender so we are now trying to shop for the best lender.

The offer was originally for an FHA loan with 6% seller's assist. The seller was fine with the number but not comfortable with using FHA due to some issues in the house they believed would not pass FHA inspection. We have very limited funds for closing costs and switching from FHA to conventional meant we could only ask for 3% seller's assist instead of 6%. 

So after talking to a friend, we realized we could request 3% seller's assist plus seller pays all transfer tax (total 4.1% in our city, usually split 50/50). So this would bring the amount the seller is paying for us up to 5.05% and we were comfortable with that. 

The first lender we were originally working with said that wasn't allowed and she would not be able to process the loan application. We spoke to our friend who did this exact thing and now we have found two other lenders who say they have done it and will do it for us.

The problem is that it's impossible to compare apples to apples with these two lenders, and any others that I'm calling for quotes. When I ask for the bottom line, total closing costs, monthly payment, interest rate, etc. they never give me a straight answer. They send over a cost sheet that has some line items that the other one has, missing some, and some that the other lender doesn't have. It's exhausting going back and forth like this. Plus they all say these are just estimates and numbers will change at closing. 

How in the heck am I supposed to shop around when I can't get the same numbers from any two lenders, and none of the numbers they're giving me are actual numbers?",finance

personalfinance,Should I invest in an RRSP or pay-off my large student debt (CAN),"I am a 25 year old resident physician (i.e. doctor in training) in Canada. As such, I have &gt;$200,000 in debt that grows at a prime interest rate (2.75% currently). I had initially thought it would be best for me to put any excess money to paying off this loan. However, I'm starting to think it may be better for me to start an RRSP. My thoughts are that even if the RRSP grows at only 2.75%, then it is equivalent to me paying down my loan. However, if the RRSP grows faster than that (which I assume it will?), then I benefit. Also, there are the significant income tax credits from contributing to an RRSP. I currently make ~$60,000, but in a few years I will make a lot more (likely &gt;$180,000). I figure it's best for me to start an RRSP now but save the tax credits for when I am in this higher tax bracket.

If I put a minimal amount down on the new car, and then wait to sell my current car until I get the price that I want for it, can I then just use all the proceeds to make a principal only payment and end up about the same as if I paid the larger down payment before hand?

The terms of the loan are the same, up to the total amount plus TTL on the car that I want so it isn't like I'd get a better interest rate or anything. The only thing I can think of is that the extra principal will be accruing interest during the period before I sell my car. This seems like it would be negligible to the overall greater amount I'd get for my car compared to quick-selling it.

Current car is 2002 Dodge Dakota - KBB - 3.5k

CarMax has a free ""hold"" feature where you can hold a car for up to I think a week if you really like it.

Please help!","This post is a wake up call for me. I have been financially irresponsible for far too long. Five years ago, I started with $40k in student loan, and a $65k job. I put a goal of paying off the loan in 5 years due to the high interest rate of 15% (student loan is from India, which I could not refinance in the US due to lack of a co-signer and no credit history). I am on track to pay off the remaining $13k with my tax refund next month. 

This would have been a perfect ending, but I also have a $4k cc debt AND a $7k credit line debt, both at 13.5%. The credit line was racked up to $8500 in 2016 due to a dental procedure for which I did not have an emergency fund. Next time I will create an emergency fund and maybe go for medical tourism instead taking a loan and pay such astronomical fees. 

The credit card bill was pilled up in early 2016 because of travel for a friend's wedding and a trip back home to India for a family emergency. 

Due to my existing liability of the student loan, I was unable to pay down the cc and the credit line bill sufficiently over the past year. 

With an avalanche method of paying off the student loan next month, I still need some guidance to pay off the remaining $11k debt and also build up an emergency fund. 

I'm 33 yo and 5 years into my job, and have a decent 401k but have zero dollars saved up. My rent is size able too at $2200 on a take home pay of $5300 pm, but I'm not into staying with roommates. I realize that my habit of going out regularly is deeply impacting my wallet and lack of savings. 

I live in New York, where going out is synonymous with living.  But I still need a solid plan to pay off my debt this year and start saving, to eventually buy an apartment in another 5-10 years?!

Agreed I need a budget and need to change my attitude on going out for food and drinks. 

Here's my shot at making and sticking to a budget. 

Annual salary is $115k with $15k bonus

Monthly salary: $9580

Fed tax 27% : $2560
NY State tax 9% : $824
401k 7%: $666
Insurance 4%: $340

Take home 54%: $5188

Now expenses as % of take home

Rent 42%: $2200
Payoff 11k Debt with 13.5% interest, monthly payment over 12 months (19%): $1000
Electric, cable, subway, phone 8%: $400
Food 8%: $400
Gym 2%: $120

Entertainment 8%: $400

Savings 13%: $660

Entertainment includes restaurants, bars, concerts, shows, clothing, etc. Its in my hands to determine how much I allocate to each. 

Things I should not do:
Take cabs
Go out more than once a week
Shop unnecessarily

Things I should do:
Cook.
Run / workout. 
Limit going out to bars/restaurants.

personalfinance,Complex $260K student loan question,"Alright so here's the situation, which I think getting a good understanding of could benefit anyone with student loans under REPAYE. I’m asking on here because my loan servicer was pretty much useless over the phone and takes ages to reply on email, of which we’ve exchanged no less than 20 on this topic.

BACKGROUND: I have roughly 260k in student loans at an average interest rate of 6.5%, divided into LOAN 1 (215k at 6.3%) and LOAN 2 (45k at 7.1%). Monthly interest is roughly $1380. My REPAYE payments are $900 for LOAN 1 and $150 for LOAN 2. I can afford to pay $2000/month for the next 4 years (followed by significantly more after that – so this situation applies to the next 4 years only)

PLAN: My initial plan was to use the 50% interest subsidy with REPAYE by paying the $2k on the 1st of the month, let the interest accrue all month, have the gov't pay 50% on the 31st (1380/2=640), and then make my $2k payment the next day. I figured this would increase my effective monthly payment to $2640 (my 2k + subsidy $640). 

BUT, after what feels like a thousand emails back and forth to my loan services, they explained that the interest subsidy is ONLY for unpaid interest (i.e. any monthly interest accrued in excess of my monthly payment). Under this assumption then if I paid anything over ~$1130 (interest for LOAN 1) to LOAN 1 or ~$250 for LOAN 2, I’d receive no subsidy, right? Well last month I paid $700 to LOAN 2 and still got a subsidy, so now I’m confused on this even more. 
ASSUMING the subsidy does end up only applying to unpaid interest, which of these situations is better:

* Option 1: pay the interest on LOAN 1 ($1130) and the remaining $870 to LOAN 2 since its higher interest = 2k/month
* Option 2: pay the minimum payment on LOAN 1 ($900) which would result in the government paying (1130-900)*50% = $115/month “bonus” and then pay $1100 towards LOAN 2 = $2115 effective payment per month? I tried modeling this in excel and it appears that it would save roughly $2-3000 over option 1, but I’m not sure of the ramifications of accruing the interest (will the interest capitalize, etc?) Again, this only applies for 4 years (48 PMT periods) as I will have significantly more income thereafter. 

What are your thoughts?

personalfinance,Should we buy a new car or pay off our current one?,"Currently drive a small SUV (Nissan Rogue.) Have 2 small kids in car seats, which means we aren't able to fit other passengers in the car. I've been thinking of getting a larger SUV or van, but my husband is super against it for some reason. Here are the facts we have to go with:

**CURRENT LOAN**

Balance: $8,550

Interest Rate: 3.24%

25 months left on loan

Payment: $367.64 per month


I have found a car I really like, it's $15,500. Carmax has offered to buy our current car for $10,000 which would give us $1500 for a down payment. 

**NEW LOAN**

$14,000

Term: 60 months

Payment: Roughly $230 a month


SO in my eyes, we'd be saving $130 a month on car payments, but in my husband's eyes its not worth it because we'd be adding an extra 36 months of payments.

I know he's probably right, but I figured I ask people that know more than I do, is it worth getting something new, or should I just be patient and deal with the smaller car until we pay it off in 2 years?",finance

Info:

* 36m/San Francisco/single
* Current income $790k/yr gross (Fed/CA taxes take a huge chunk of that ofc)
* I haven't been saving much because I was pulling a DJ Khaled (bought my whole family houses), but  it's time to focus on FIRE for myself now.
* CEO who fully owns a small outsourced tech consulting company. Could probably sell the company for ~$2MM on the open market.
* My apartment is paid off, current market value ~$1.25MM
* CC+utils $1,250/mo
* Total yearly COL has floated between $55k/yr to $70k/yr (up and down) for last four years. I could keep it to a constant $55k or less if I put even a little discipline into my budget.
* Have $80k in standard micro-yield savings account. Planning on moving the majority, less emergency fund, to an S&amp;P500 index fund.
* Have $245k in SEP-IRA. Split is 50% into a couple individual tech stocks and 50% in S&amp;P index fund. Portfolio has slightly outperformed S&amp;P, but it's important to me to invest in a hand full of couple companies whose mission I believe in, not just interested in raw returns. So that explains why I'm not all in on index or target retirement funds. **I can no longer add to the SEP-IRA, due to IRS rules stating I have to offer to match my % contribution across the company.** So what do I now for tax advantaged retirement savings?

personalfinance,ELI5: Mortgage loan on new construction house in master planned community,"My husband and I are thinking about building a new construction home in a master planned community. They require a $2000 deposit to secure the lot and floorplan. We hvae to be prequalified in order to secure the contract to build. But the lenders are telling me that our interest rate won't be secured until closer to the time of closing on the house. It would take 3-4 months to build the house.  I'm confused about the loan process for this, how would I pick a lender in order to sign the contract to build the house if I don't have an interest rate? Would I just get prequalified to show the builder, and then later I can pick the lender? The builder said they require a $2000 deposit for a preferred lender, but a $5000 deposit with a non-preferred lender, and if the nonpreferred lender can't close within 30 days of the closing process then we won't get our deposit back, but with a preferred lender the deposit will go towards the down payment.",finance

Not sure if I will be leasing or financing yet, so I plan to apply for both. So, two questions:

1) When should I apply to have the best credit (and will it really matter?)
2) How can I minimize the number of hard credit pulls (ideally, so only one shows up on my long term report). Ideally, I'd like to apply with a handful of lenders for both leasing and financing and try and get some competitive rates.",finance

A little history about us  We've been married for almost a year now.  We are in our mid 30's and I'm a veteran that is about to graduate from a local university with a business degree.  The GI Bill was used and I will have no student loans.  Neither one of us have any debt.  We use our credit cards almost exclusively, but pay any &amp; all balances off at the end of the month.  Both of our cars are new (2014 &amp; 2015) and both cars were paid with cash.  We both have employer 401k's, I've got the max company match going in (6%) and a separate American Funds ROTH IRA set up with $250 deposits every month.  Her company doesn't match, but puts in 10% of her annual income in as a bonus every year.  Our finances are semi-separate but we filed jointly this year.  We each have well over $10k in our savings accounts as emergency funds and jointly have about $25k for down payment (+ related fees) to put towards a house.  She made just a shade over 50k (salaried) last year and I made just under $35k (hourly).  I made less, because I was going to school full-time as well as working at a full-time job but only working part time hours.  After I graduate in April, my worst possible scenario is I start working 40 hours a week at my current job making about $40k a year (I make a shade over $20 / hr).  Most likely possible scenario, is I land a full-time position at a local area company and make $55-$60k salaried.  There is a best case scenario that I move up with my current company and land in the $65-$70k range, but that scenario requires a little luck to pan out.

Here is the tricky part, my wife is super frugal and dislikes spending money (this is mostly a good thing).  She wants to keep our mortgage payment (w/ escrow) to about 25% of our take home income because we still want to have a kid or 2 as well as enjoy ourselves.  

We've been pre-approved for $175,000 (this is what I told the bank was our upper limit) and are trying to decide between a 20 year or 30 year loan.  She believes that we need to stay under a $1,000 mortgage payment including escrow.  Doing some ""napkin math"", $85000 with 35% (generous I think) taken out in various taxes (Fed, State, SS, Medicare) leaves us with $55,250 take home.  25% leaves us with an annual budget of $13,812.50 broken down to $1,151 a month.  Am I looking at the big picture properly?  Also, this is based off me not working full-time last year and I will be either be getting a better paying job (hopefully) or at least working 40 hours a week (gauranteed) at my current job.

personalfinance,Possible to get more money back on Taxes by filing my student loans and additional grants?,"Hello PF. I am getting ready to file my taxes and I had some questions regarding possibly getting additional money back or qualifying for a tax credit. 

Background: Last year I made about $7,600 at a part time job and received a W-2. For my schooling, I was offered close to max Pell Grant for the entire year, so I ended up receiving about $12,000 from my Pell Grant and my schooling only cost about $8,000. So I ended up receiving about $4,000 extra for the year and I ended up taking out a loan of $2,100 to pay for some summer classes that my Pell **DID NOT** pay for. There were no restrictions with what the excess grant money could be used for as far as I have researched/read. 

So, I went through the process of filing my W-2 **WITHOUT** submitting, and it showed me getting about $450 back from federal. I was talking to a co-worker today and he said it is possible to qualify for a tax credit with your schooling if you paid out of pocket for school stuff and your income is under a certain amount

Is it possible to claim Rent as paying out of pocket since I made so little? I paid about $5,000 in rent for the year and I have all my receipts. 

So, long story short, is there something I can add into my tax filing that would increase my return? I would like to get the maximum amount I can. I usually file my taxes by myself. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Student loans, windfall on house sale, and protecting my husband.","My husband and I were married in the last half of 2016. 

Five years ago, he purchased a house that is set to be worth about 300k more than what he purchased it for. I know that sounds insane, but that's just the way things are in that city, so you'll have to take my word on it. Right now, we're leasing out the house for reasons I won't get into but we'll have to sell in the spring/summer of this year (unlikely) or next year (very likely). 

I have 77k in student loan debt ranging from 6-8% (which, considering I did most of a doctorate debt free and went to private schools for my first two degrees, I am actually really well off). We live in a community property state. All the debt was incurred before the marriage. 

Once we sell the house, what was his becomes ours. That house is all his money (purchased before the marriage) but will translate into marital property once we sell. Because we moved from a very high cost-of-living state to a very cheap one, that amount of money would essentially buy us a mansion here. Think about the difference in moving from Seattle to Nebraska. Of all our debt as a couple, the student loan debt carries the highest interest and is the biggest pain in the ass. We have no real debt otherwise except the mortgage on the house (which rent is covering) and a lease on a car. Everything else is paid off minus four thousand in interest-free CC debt we're chipping away at from the wedding/move. That will be handled in a couple of months. Added to that is a cache of Fortune 500 stock options that will vest yearly as we move forward so we have ample emergency funds if needed. Besides that, there's nearly no chance of him ever being unemployed because he's one of only a handful of people who can do the kind of work he does and he is highly sought after. 

**So here's my question**: the obvious answer would be to use the windfall from the house to pay off all debt (my student loans being the largest chunk of it) and then to buy a home with the remainder. But, from his perspective, is that a bad decision? Yes, the money from the house becomes a marital asset (as best as I can tell) once we sell. But the debt would still be a personal asset. Once we pay it off, well, I'm off the hook. But I get there by way of his expense. 

I love my marriage, I married him because I want to spend my life with him, but I am not so stupid as to sit there and think, ""Well, we'll live happily ever after by sheer force of will"".

One of my jobs is also doing bike delivery for my job at Jimmy John's and I invested in a new bike to better service this job and use as a commuter for class, spending 1.5k on it. I probably spend 75% of my time with the bike using it for work. Can I deduct that from my taxes? I have a 1099-R from one of my jobs which had a very minimally contributed 401(k) and also have a 1098-T from taking classes last spring as I prepare to go back to school. My 401k was only like $110 from my short time at that job and I've already cashed it out. Would using an online service such as H&amp;R Block or Turbo Tax let us determine if filing jointly or married filing separately, or should I use a professional service such as a CPA or local group?

Let me know if you need any more numbers or information about me to help me figure out. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing goals and question regarding paying higher percentage of my mortgage to principal.,"As the title says I want to pay less of my monthly mortgage towards paying the banks interest. Here's the details of my loan:

* 176k outstanding principal remaining of the original 210k(after down payment) loan.
Interest rate is 4%.

* I make monthly payments of 1,520. Of that only $413(27%) goes towards paying down the principal.

I have about $70k that I could comfortably invest or spend towards paying down the house. I don't care so much about lowering my monthly payments as I care about paying the least amount towards interest as possible in the long run. Is refinancing the best way to achieve that? Is this a sound financial decision or should I pursue other investments? I really like the idea of having my house paid off as early as I can.",finance

personalfinance,I owe a decent chunk to the IRS this year...how to proceed,"So for the past ten years or so I have used a tax preparation service and with them doing my taxes I have gotten a reasonable refund of $1000-3000 every year depending on my salary and number of jobs worked, etc. I had a feeling for the past few years that I probably shouldn't be getting the big refunds I was getting and was flagged in my state to provide evidence for some of the deductions the tax prep company had claimed on my behalf. I ended up having to pay a few hundred extra dollars in taxes last year to the state but fortunately there was no federal audit. I decided to dig into my past few year's tax returns and realized the firm was fabricating tons of deductions I wasn't really entitled to and putting me in a very risky situation should I have to prove all of them. 

Of course they are legally covered since I signed off on everything, preferring at the time to keep my head in the sand and happily spend my refunds each year. Now I know better and I'm just doing my taxes myself and it turns out I actually owe a significant amount. I don't have a lot of deductions; I'm not a homeowner and my income situation is pretty straightforward. I just wasn't having enough withheld. I've since adjusted my W-2 so I won't be in this situation again in the future.

So, what happens when you owe? Do I file my taxes and wait for a bill? Will I be expected to send the full payment right away? It's a bit more than I'd like to pay all at once (about $1700) and would prefer to spread it out over a few months if I can. I know about applying for a payment plan, but does that happen after I file?

tl;dr What's the process when you owe income taxes to the IRS? (I'm filing electronically)",finance
personalfinance,27year old PhD student with a somewhat large savings account. What can I be doing to grow my net worth?,"Sorry - net worth isn't what I meant. I meant how I can capitalize on the money I already have (I guess that's the same thing?).

Hello everyone! I'm 27, and I am currently working as a PhD student for the past 6 years receiving a stipend of about $24K-26K per year doing research assistanceships and adjunct lecturing undergrad courses. My credit history is very good because I pay all of my bills on time. The only debt I have is about 30K from subsidized federal college loans that don't accumulate interest until I graduate grad school (hopefully in a year). I get a decent health care package from the school (like $5 for generics and $25 for brand name). I don't have IRA or Roth counts because I don't think I qualify (to be honest I really have no idea what that is but I know it's very valuable). I own no assets other than what's in my bank account.

I live at home with my parents because in my culture we don't move out until we become married, so they essentially pay for my ""rent"" and food (my parents prefer it this way - I am a not a person living in my parent's basement because I can't find something else, and I absolutely love living with my parents because we are very close). I NEVER ask them for money, only stuff like to break smaller bills into something or like $10-$20 because some places don't take credit cards and finding an ATM that doesn't charge fees is annoying. Thus, I have over the years ammassed &gt;90K in a BoA Rewards Savings account that in 2016 netted me a whopping $38.01 dollars in interest. 

My question is: am I doing a good job with my finances instead of letting it sit in a crappy interest rate savings account? What are some things I could do to make value of the funds I have stowed away? I do want to say that I looked into stuff like CDs, but the returns were so low it didn't seem worth it. What other options are there?

EDIT: I also want to mention that my degree is in a field that is very very sought after. The median starting salary for an MS is around 55K whereas 79K for PhD.",finance

* 10% for car maintenance
* 5% for discretionary/fun spending

I am not sure if I should focus on saving more in my emergency account, or if I could be even more aggressive in paying down loans.

Also: would it be better if I resumed 15% contributions to retirement, or to focus more money into student loans?

science,"Science AMA Series: We are Dr. May Berenbaum and Dr. Gene Robinson, University of Illinois entomologists. Our genomic research efforts go together like bees and honey, and we’re here for some sweet science discussion for Valentine’s Day! AUA!","We are two scientists who are fascinated by honey bees: their complex social lives, their collective ability to adapt to environmental challenges, their sophisticated cognitive abilities, and the vital role they play in agriculture and food production. We also share a common experimental approach: exploring the biology of honey bees and other insects by studying their genomes. The genome has also helped us learn the many roles that honey, the food that bees make from the nectar they collect from flowers, plays in the complex lives of honey bees.


Genomes have led to a definitive answer to the historic nature vs. nurture debate. Effects of nature and nurture interact with each other by influencing genome functions.  By sequencing the honey bee genome (http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/honeybee/) and studying its activity, we are learning more about how honey bees develop, behave, learn, and adapt; by sequencing the genomes of related species (https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140505-in-bees-a-hunt-for-the-roots-of-social-behavior/), we’ve identified new hypotheses for how social living evolved in bees.


In Dr. Robinson’s lab, we have discovered how the responsiveness of the genome in honey bee brain cells relates to the ability of bees to adjust their behavior to their physical and social environment, and therefore contribute to the colony’s ability to be robust to challenges (https://www.life.illinois.edu/robinson/Research/Pdf/annurev-genet-110711-155517.pdf).  We’ve also demonstrated how stress in early life, by acting through the genome, has a long-term impact on behavior (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbb.12087/abstract).


In Dr. Berenbaum’s lab, we’ve overturned the idea that honey is just a source of calories. We’ve shown that some components of honey that come from nectar and pollen increase the activity of genes that code for proteins that break down environmental toxins such as pesticides and help fight bacterial pathogens (http://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8842). We’ve also discovered that chemicals in honey and pollen, when fed to an immature bee, can influence whether she grows up to be a queen or a worker (http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/7/e1500795) Using tools made possible by genome sequencing, we’ve investigated potential contributions of different factors to Colony Collapse Disorder (http://www.pnas.org/content/106/35/14790) and developed molecular models to predict which pesticides are likely to be toxic to bees.

personalfinance,Resolving a Cosigned Auto the Best Way I Can,"Greetings /r/personalfinance!

If you're reading this, it means your eyes finally rolled back to the front of your head after reading the word ""cosigned"" in the title. Congrats on that. Yes, I'm well aware that co-signed loans are the devil (right along with that ""Foosball"", Bobby Boucher), but I can't do anything about the past. I'm here to advise you of the present and seek advice for the future.

Right now, my wife and I have two cars. Mine is paid for (Honda Fit), her's is not (Mazda 5, about $12k remaining @$400 a month). Additionally, I co-signed a loan to help my wife's sister's fam (let's call her Connie) with acquiring a car a few years ago (Chevy Sonic, insane interest rate due to their low-credit, about $17k remaining @$475 a month). Connie advised us this week that through the generous charity of someone at their church, a van was donated to her fam, which works out a lot better for their fam of eight. As a result, Connie and her hubby wanted to voluntarily repo the Sonic because of the heavy burden on their month-to-month. After I bandaged up my hands from punching the walls, I told them that repo'ing something my name attached to it was out of the question. I know I'm cosigned, and it's my responsibility or my credit going to the shitter (and I worked hard for that 700+)

Back home with me, the Mrs. and I have been talking about saving up money and spending a little of a savings in order to eliminate her car debt (so yeah, I've got about $12k sitting around at the moment). This would free up her car payment, which is a ""good thing"" because she's a stay at home mom now for our two kids (and goodbye $1.2k a month in child-care).

So here's where I need advice: the plan I have at the moment is to carry out my original plan of paying off the wife's car this month and free up that debt. As far as the Sonic goes, I want to either sell it or my Fit (I'd really like to keep the Fit, but I'm open to either one as long as I have a ride to work), take the money from the sale and put that money down towards refinancing the Sonic's debt. Assuming I get a decent amount from the sale, I'm anticipating a new payment of around $200 a month for 60 months (which I'd obviously would like to pay down as quickly as possible with any overtime money I make).

At least, that's what I have planned. I'm open to other suggestions for resolving this conundrum, at least anything that doesn't involve repo.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage and downsizing question,"We bought our first home for $194,000 in July of 2015 with a USDA loan and no down-payment. Our monthly payment is $1508.26 and to date we still owe $189,147.61 (ouch) with an interest rate 4.375%. Our current home has an HOA fee of $150/year, and a CDD fee rolled into the taxes that is harder to determine but it is probably $2000+. Our home, in all truthfulness, is just too large and the fees are too high for a community we don't enjoy or utilize. It's a 1700 sqft 3/2.5/2 2-story home, but we only use the downstairs (kitchen, living room, half bath) and our master bedroom/bathroom as our little one is only 8 months and still bunking with us. We do regret buying this house as it's what we thought we wanted at the time, but not what we want in actuality. We would love to move to a smaller home and save money off the mortgage, heating/cooling, etc, and also not have community fees. We would want a 2 bedroom 1 or 2 bath home, or even townhouse, and possibly a half acre if in a home. We only have about $5K in savings currently. If we bought a new house, we'd need to pay mortgage insurance. Our home value has increased since we bought it and we'd realistically be able to sell it in the $210-230k range. So my question is this. Do we stay put for a while and save up some money, or do we downsize and save money in a new home?

We will sit down to determine a payment schedule we're all comfortable with before doing this. They know I plan to pay off the loan in 7-10 years and that I will still be traveling in the meantime, which they have to be okay with.

About a year and a half ago I had a federal perkins loan go into collections with a balance of $6,200, I was contacted by the law firm hired to collect and agreed to make monthly payments of $200 until the debt was satisfied. I have yet to miss a payment on this collection and this month marks month 30 so I figured I would reach out to the firm and make plans on closing this out soon. Yesterday I requested a statement which lists all payments made to date as well as an overall account balance, today I received an email with the following letter attached:

""Please be advised that your current balance is approximately $1,725. Please not that fees, interest and costs continue to accrue, therefore the above figure is not a payoff amount. If you desire a payoff amount please provide a date that payment will be made in full.""

Obviously this was a big disappointment as I figured I would be much closer to a $0 balance. Any thoughts/advice as to what I should do from here? Can this firm refuse to send me a list of payments made to date along with an overall account statement?

personalfinance,Student Loans / Parental Support,"Hey everyone,

I'm 25 and have about 130k in student loan debt between federal and private loans. When I was in college, the FAFSA said my parents should contribute x amount, which was an amount I knew to be unreasonable for their income. We've never been wealthy, but always have been comfortable. I'd say middle to lower middle class. I'm the first one in my immediate family, and one of the few in my extended families to graduate with a bachelors degree.

During high school and college my parents always explained to me that they wished they could but they couldn't afford to pay for my education. I understood and respected that, however they always told me that they would help me as much as they could after I graduated with my loans.

Directly after college I had trouble finding a job in my field, and honestly I was pretty depressed for a while, making enough to cover my loans and that's about it, delivering pizza.

Fast forward a few years, and now I work in a career that I really enjoy, while making the minimum monthly payments on my loans (a little over $1100). I live at home and don't pay rent, groceries, etc. If I were to live on my own, I'd probably be paycheck to paycheck.

I have an older sibling that was in college for ~6 years and never finished. Over the years I've come to understand that my parents made most of his student loan payments while also helping him to make a sizable chunk of the down payment on his home. Granted he's 10 years older so his education was significantly less than mine. They also spend a lot of money on him, his wife and his children. It's something that kind of bothers me, but I don't know if I'm unreasonable in thinking like that.

What I'm wondering is, while I'm grateful for their support and love, would it be advisable for me to ask them to help by contributing to my student loans? I don't know if it's worth approaching or how to go about it. It just seems to me that despite my harder work ethic and greater success , my parents have provided much more financial support to my sibling.

This has been on my mind for years, and I honestly just never wanted to frankly come out and say this. I don't want to appear ungrateful or damage the mutual respect or relationship I have with my parents, and again I appreciate everything they do.

Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,Liberal PTO Vs Higher Pay (Should I leave my long term job with great benefits for better pay when I have a child - US),"I am the primary custodian and sole income provider for a 6 year old. I've been at my current job for 13 years, started in college and went full time when I graduated. I've moved up the ranks slowly but I've reached what I think is the top for my education and skill set (it is an admin environment).  It is the only job I've ever had and is something I'm passionate about at least 70% of the time. I am an executive assistant for my third CEO at the company (they have all retired).  

The environment is extremely conducive to liberal time off. They are an family friendly company and I have 30 days off PTO and 6 personal days a year to use. We are also a type of school for adults and children so we are closed every federal holiday and 2 weeks for the winter holiday. You can also save and bank your PTO up to 6 weeks.  

They have great retirement options with a profit sharing plan and a 403b. 

They've even allowed us to bring in our kids when the school was closed for any reason and my boss lets me leave early when I need to without having to take leave time (as long as it doesn't happen constantly). They also provided a discount tuition for the attached pre-k which my son attended for two years and saved me a ton of money ($380 a month tuition for employees).

They also allow for a 7.5 work day and flexible hours if I need it in a pinch, although most of my work has to be done in the office.   

Since it is the only job I've ever had and I've worked there since before I graduated college, it has a family feel to it. And it is as secure as I think you can get in my area. The new CEOs always come from within so I have a great working relationship with anyone who does take the position once a CEO retires.  

Saying that, they only pay me $33,000 a year. Which is tough to raise a kid on. Although doable in my area.

I recently got a job offer that is closer to my home by about 15 miles and pays $55,000 a year (a 22,000 a year raise) but the company benefits are sparse. They aren't family friendly so I would have to find after or before care for my child or a babysitter on sick days as he wouldn't be allowed in the office. They offer just two weeks of vacation (after 6 months of being there) and aren't closed for the two weeks in the winter. No profit sharing or 401K matching.  If my son got sick on short notice, I'd be hard pressed to find a babysitter and my ex husband is completely unavailable for any help. Doctors appointments would be hard, etc since I have to everything related to my son alone. I don't have family or friends who could or would help.

But I am never going to make $55,000 a year at my current company. I get by ok but a huge issue could easily deplete my savings and I'd be hard pressed to recover quickly. If I took the new job and it didn't work out though ( I had to miss a day because my son got sick or the school closed), I wouldn't be able to go back to my old company and I'd be in trouble. 

Do I stay somewhere that doesn't pay much but that offers me the freedom and supports me in being a parent or do I take the better job and be able to put more into savings? Is PTO for parents better than bigger pay? 


tl;dr: because I did write a novel. I make $33,000 after a long time at my job with excellent leave time but I got offered a job that pays $55,000 a year with terrible leave time. Does it make sense to take pay over PTO with a young child?",finance

personalfinance,Confirmation on tax return.,"In the year 2016 i worked two seperate part time jobs.

The first job had net wages of around 4k and on my w2 it says i payed nothing into federal which i am assuming is because i was making so little (300 every two weeks). 

Later i left this job and aquired another job where i made around 8000 and payed about 800 into federal taxes. 

When it came to filling my taxes i first entered the second job and my return came out to about 600 but after entering the first job that return dropped to 130.

What i am assuming is that my total income from the year (13000) was too high when combining the jobs together that i then owed taxes on the 4000 i made from the first job.

If this would be the case i would just like some confirmation before i go through hr and my managers to check my paystubs at the first job to see if i was paying any federal all along.",finance
personalfinance,Long term plan for a first time homeowner?,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what I’m going to do with my home. I’m a first time home owner and my home is definitely a starter home. 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, 2 acres of land with a full walk out basement that could be converted to additional living space with a 1-car under garage. It’s perfect for me and my wife and we’ve lived there the past 3 years. I’ve been making a little over 2.5 extra payments per year to try to knock down the principal while my interest rate is still low. To expand on that, I have a 5/1 adjustable at 2.99% and have another 2 years before I need to make some decisions. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m stuck in a bit of a pickle here in that the house doesn’t warrant a full blown upgrade or expansion. The house itself is in great condition, new siding, new roof, new electrical, new plumbing, new furnace. Basically everything is new within the past 5 years or so, the only things it really needs would be considered upgrades to what’s already there. It’s only 1100 sq/ft and I could see myself being very upside down on investment vs value if I decide to go with anything but basic, functional upgrades (no marble showers here).

&amp;nbsp;

By the time the fixed portion of my 5/1 is over, I’ll have between 60-70k worth of equity in the house that I’ll have to consider before making my next move. By that time, the loan value will be down to around 90k give or take.

&amp;nbsp;

**So, I’ve been toying around with a couple of ideas:**

1.)	Sell the home and use the equity to knock down some principal from a new home and attempt to keep the overall mortgage payment roughly equivalent to what I’m paying now.

&amp;nbsp;

2.)	Refinance into a more stable longer term loan product and rent the home, using the additional passive income to pay for a new, more expensive mortgage

&amp;nbsp;

3.)	Keep the home, refinance into a more stable loan product and ride it out until it’s paid off.

personalfinance,Debating between a 5/1 ARM and a 30 year fixed,"My apologies in advance, I'm sure this has been debated a ton of times on this sub, but I'm relatively new to Reddit so I figured this was worth a shot. 

I recently bought a house, currently going through all the closing details and need to finalize the mortgage details. I'm pre-approved through one institution and am considering another because their closing costs are cheaper and they have a better rate for 30 year fixed. 

Break down of the numbers: 
5/1 ARM, closing costs likely going to be close to $2,300. Rate at 3.125% 
30 year fixed, closing costs likely around $1,800, rate at 3.875%

The thing is, I'm in a good relationship with someone and he also owns a house, but we've only been dating for 6 months. If things go well, which it appears they will, we've already agreed to buy a house together in 2-3 years, which makes the ARM a no brainer (the extra 500 in closing costs will be a moot point after 9 months at the cheaper interest rate). 

However, it would be silly of me to assume things will go well. So that leaves me with a question of how long I'd stay at that house if things don't work out. And herein lies my problem - I really like this house, and there aren't a lot of similar ones in this price range in the area. I could see myself staying there long term if my cards play out that I'm single and staying in the area for my job. 

Considering mortgage interest rates have mostly declined in the past 30 years, how big of a risk is the 5/1 ARM if I end up wanting to stay? The conservative side is to obviously do the 30 year fixed, but I am notoriously cheap, and want the lower payments now. I could afford a higher interest rate in the future, but it would most definitely hurt a bit, as currently I'm pretty comfortable with my necessary and unnecessary expenditures. 

Also, I am planning on paying at minimum $50 more on the loan a month, if not $100, depending on other life stuffs. 

**Tl;dr**: How bad of a risk is a 5/1 ARM mortgage if I'm not sure I will be staying there for less than 5 years?",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) Car loan conundrum,"Hello! This is a throw-away account but I'm subscribed and there are a lot of smart people here. I'm hoping to get some advice.

My wife and I are expecting our first child. Exciting! We want to get a mini-van. Practical.

We currently have two cars. Two loans. We got two cars because we live in a remote area and my wife needed a car to get to work every week. I needed a car because we have some pets and, in an emergency, or if I need to get around, I also needed a car.

One car we got about six months ago, not really thinking we'd be expecting this soon. The loan: 23k for a 17k vehicle if we were to sell it now. The other car we've had for 14 months. 45k loan for a vehicle that won't sell for that much.

Mazda 3, 2014 is the 23k vehicle. Pathfinder, Nissan, 2015 is the higher vehicle.

Never missed a car payment. Ever.

We have a 1.4 or 1.5 percent interest rate on the Pathfinder and I believe higher for the Mazda. Pathfinder is in my wifes name. Mazda in mine.

I have a consumer proposal (not bankruptcy) for some taxes I owed. We are 3.5 years in, 1.5 years left remaining.

My wife makes about 30 to 40 k a year (although not that much soon due to maternity leave - not disclosed to the bank) and I make 125k a year.

We pay 660 per month for the Pathfinder and 540 per month for the Mazda. Just the loan payments.

Consumer proposal is 750 a month. Never missed a payment.

My wife has a Visa card that's currently $1,000 over limit but, when we're over limit, we don't go too far over and we don't stay that way for very long either. Limit is $8000 on the Visa.

Rent is $1525. We have the obvious other expenses that come with life. I have some medication expenses because I'm a diabetic.

My credit score is 684. I don't know what my wife's is but I know it's better than mine.

So, we do ok! We're not drowning in debt or anything. Mostly because our income is fantastic.

Now that she's pregnant and not going to be working soon, we want to get rid of a car, which would save us almost several hundred a month if we could, so a big win. We go to a dealership yesterday, ask to trade in both our vehicles for a new mini-van, to which they come back at us today saying we can't get a loan without a co-signer. Mostly because there were one or two sketchy months last year with my wife's Visa and that we are currently around $1,000 over limit although it hasn't been like that for a while, just a bump in the road.

I have my own business I do on the side for extra cash, not sure it matters, I use it for write-offs where possible.

We are not sure what to do here. We can co-sign but it seems rather ridiculous that we're making as much as we do, able to hold our own, but can't get a loan. We have years of good payments, good income to prove, all that jazz.

TLDR; Trying to trade two cars for one. Negative equity on both. Make a crap-tonne of money. Good on payments. But can't seem to get a loan without a co-signer?",finance

personalfinance,My mother passed away last year; need some tax/financial questions answered,"My mother passed away last summer; I was an only child raised by a single parent, so it hit me pretty hard and while I managed to get through clearing out her apartment with a lot of help from our friends, I've been neglecting a few things and I need some helpful advice.

1. I had to clear out her apartment in a hurry, which involved donating all of her clothes to Goodwill as quickly as possible. The goodwill people gave me a blank slip to estimate the value, but a year later I have no idea how to estimate this accurately, and I was told that it might not be worth my time since the used/resale value of the clothes is unlikely to exceed the ""standard"" deduction of ~$6,000. Is this true? She had a lot of shoes, dresses, blouses, jackets, etc. She must have spent well in excess of $10,000 on those clothes.

2. While she was alive, I often drove her around, and needed to have a nicer car. As a result, I own/am making payments on a 2015 Volkswagen Jetta that I'm no longer sure is absolutely necessary. I can afford the payments, but I'm wondering if it is possible to sell back to the dealership/someone else for a small penalty and save money in the long run; last time I checked there was ~$19,000 left to be paid over the next 5ish years?

personalfinance,Hit a Milestone in 2016 - Need to share,"Age 53 - Canadian

I recently hit a significant milestone and for numerous reasons I feel reluctant to share with family and friends so I thought I'd share my success story here and see if anyone can benefit from my experience.

I set savings goals for myself in high school when I learned about the power of compound interest. It was a time where interest rates were astronomical compared to today and at the time it seemed easy to accumulate wealth. My initial goal was to invest 10% of earnings or $3000.00 per year (Whichever was lower) until retirement. This coupled with 10%, or greater, interest rates at the time would guarantee that I become a Millionaire by retirement. As you can imagine, there were some hiccups along the way but for the most part, I've kept up to my goals. Here's how.

- I never put more purchases on a credit card than I can cover with cash. I always paid the full balance. Other than a couple of times where I forgot to pay it or accidentally paid the wrong bill, I've never paid interest on any of my credit cards
- When I bought my home, I took advantage of every 1st home buyers plan I could. I had saved 25% towards a down payment to avoid requiring Mandatory insurance
- I made extra payments towards the mortgage whenever possible
- The home was paid off in less than 14 yrs.
- With the house paid off, I secured a line of credit for $75,000 that I use rarely if ever. 
- I bought my first new car using the line of credit and paid it off in less than 3 yrs. Then I bought my second new car which was paid off in 2 years
- All along I've been investing my 10% or $3000.00 per year. Mainly in mutual funds and registered in what Canada calls RRSPs which are tax deferred. What this means is if I invest $3000.00 now, the Gvmt will refund the Tax I have paid on that money. When I withdraw the money, I assume (Hope) it will be at a lower tax rate. In the meantime, I can put the refund to work. Typically, I would increase my investment by the amount of the refund. e.g. if $3000.00 would return $1200.00 then I would invest $5000.00 to get a $2000.00 return.
- As my wage increased, I increased my investments accordingly
- If my work had any investment incentives, I took advantage to the max. At one point, I had 8% of my paycheck withheld and the company was matching with an additional 8%. Free Money, I'd be crazy not to.

I'm sure I'm missing a couple of highlights but those are the ones that stand out for me. Yes, I've made lots of sacrifices along the way. I've never bought anything I could not afford. I didn't get off dial-up internet until around 2004. No cable, No TV, Didn't miss it. Game system were bought on Rewards programs and my computers are fairly basic.

•	Emergency + Savings(liquid): 23k  
•	401(k): 40k (4k in Roth 401k and 36k in regular 401k)  
•	Investments: 20k (5k in Lending club and rest in stocks and index funds)

     •	Car insurance: 100(full coverage 2011 Lexus 50k miles, was bought used on a sweet deal)

     •	Student loan: 100 (will be deferred once I start school)  
     •	Total: 2900  


**Upcoming financial changes:**  
     •	Business school: 120k over 2 years(possibly 1.5 years till Dec 2018), could go down to 90k if I get more scholarships.  
     •	Income would be limited to an internship which would be a total of about 20-25k(pre-tax) for working 3 months in the Summer of 2018.  

1.	My first question is what should I do with the 401k? Should I use it to pay for the tuition or should I let it ride and take on student loans (~6.5%interest rate)?  
2.	Should I use my savings and only leave emergency fund to pay for school?  
3.	Should I sell all my stock positions and pay for school? Some generate a 2-3% dividend and I have a long position on most investments.  
4.	What happens to my 401k account? I have fidelity currently, do they keep my account once I leave my employer?  

Other notes:  
     •	My monthly expense might not go down by much. Maybe down to 2500. I will have a major lifestyle curb but I am in a city with high expenses. Rent would not change by much. Where can I cut?  
     •	If I need emergency money, I could ask my parents for about 3k-5k.

Currently I don't have enough money on my 401k but I believe in a couple of weeks I might be able to pull it all out just to pay it off. My question is

Do I still have to pay taxes on the 401k even though it is a regular 401k and not a roth401k?

Are these taxes calculated just like regular income brackets?
So all I would have to pay is State Taxes, Federal Taxes and Federal Penalty taxes?

Is there some other fee that I am missing?

I fully understand that this isn't recommended, but I am honestly doing the math to see if this would make sense in the long run.",finance

personalfinance,Should I spend $5000 on my loans?,"I have two loans that I am responsible for.
 -student loan with $23000 left with 4.125% interest rate. 
 -parent plus loan with $21000 left with ~8% interest rate.

I have $5000 laying around in my savings account and will get around that back when I eventually sell my car within the next 2-3 months, but since interest rate is fairly high for my parent plus loan I thought $5000 would help with that. 

Should I just use that $5000 towards my parent plus loan right away? Or should I save/invest instead?

UPDATE: I put $5000 towards my parent plus loan. Thanks guys!",finance
personalfinance,Reinvesting dividends?,"So I have a Roth IRA I recently opened through Vanguard and I funded 2016 and 2017. I chose for my dividends to be reinvested. Despite that, I'm showing $0.07 in my Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund which was paid into it as a dividend.

I tried to transfer it into my Roth IRA, but since it was fully funded it wouldn't go through. Now, it's clearly not big money but it's sitting there doing nothing. What do you guys do with it? Should I open some sort of other fund that dividends can be paid into or ...? I have savings on hand to open something else if that would be worthwhile in some way.

personalfinance,Diversification of Large Inheritance,"24 years old

$61k gross income

1 dependant

12k/13k 4%/8% fed student debt, currently applying to have it forgiven thru govt service program but unsure what dollar figure I'd actually be relieved of. Program contingent on two years service starting now @ above pay rate.

I've recently come into significant money. A relative wisely bought stock around 2006-2008, and it has skyrocketed. I've inherited ~1200 shares worth 120 today I think the cost to my relative was ~40.

This is a real chunk and I'm really nervous that I'll hold it too long and that current conditions with the stock won't hold and I'll take a huge loss.

Should I feel justified in cashing out while things look good and diversifying into something safer? This is my only investment besides some small 401k stuff thru work, and I'd like to be able to count on it being there in a few years.",finance
personalfinance,Just contacted by Student Loans Assistance Foundation. Is it worth it?,"I was just contacted by the Student Loans Assitant Foundation. I have one federal loan left at a balance of $4,912. I don't know the interest rate. 

The SLAF just offered me to pay 5 months at $149 and then 13$ for 300 months. That's a total of $4,645. 

That's saving me only $267 over 25 years or 89 cents a month for the next 25 years. 

That's not worth it right? Being a long time lurker on this sub, it seems dumb for me to turn down any money but I also know I will be able to pay it off by the end of the year. Probably sooner. 

I asked if I could take part in the ""Income Contingent Program"" and then pay it off all upfront and they said know. 

Also, My wife is in a similar situation but owes around 17k at varying rates. But I am also hoping to pay that off by the end of the year, if not in 18 months. Is it worth it to do it with her loans?

Thoughts?

personalfinance,I want to save towards a Tesla Model 3 for roughly June 2019,"Hello PF, first time posting here. I'll get straight to my situation and numbers.

Net Income: ~31.2K

[Student Loan Debt: 30,686.88](http://imgur.com/mtG0uOe)

* Interest rates for each in order: 4.66%, 4.66%, 3.86%, 3.86%, 3.4%, 6.8%, 3.4%, 6.8%

Here's my situation with my loans: Loans are currently deferred, although I am resuming payment this paycheck (tomorrow). I worked a job earning 13.75 (I think) and the hours were so overbearing that I needed to quit to look for a job in my field. I've since done that, but I deferred my loans because I would have gone broke in the meantime. I've settled into my job, so I'll begin paying them off again.

I've been paying 351.74 a month so I should have about 8 years roughly left to pay it off if I'm putting in that much per month. 

Here's my financial situation: I'm currently living at home and that doesn't appear to be changing in the immediate future. Aside from Netflix, I do not have any bills although I should be having my mother's car switched over to my name so I'll have car insurance to pay for.

_

Now, I 100% understand that the car is out of my budget. But unless this is a decision that is impossible or will financially ruin me, I want to do it. I've copied some of the math I've calculated below. (Feel free to criticize the numbers, they're just crapshots I came up with at work. Also the math on the loan isn't very accurate, it's just there for me to get an idea)

What I really aim to get out of you all is this: Is purchasing this car even feasible for me? I want to save as much as reasonably possible as to avoid a hefty car loan. But I want to be able to save as much as I can while I don't have much in the way of bills.

Also: Student Loans. I have student loans with interest greater than that of an auto loan. If I wanted to purchase this car, would it be wiser to be putting that money into my student loans (in the amount that I would be putting into the car indicated in my table, that is to say significantly more than the payments I've been doing right now) and then just take a loan out for the car in June 2019 which is when I want to get it?

I have lots of questions and there's lots of things I don't know, but I just want to be efficient in the way I spent my money on this relatively INEFFICIENT purchase, so I would appreciate the advice of people who know more than me on this. Tell me I'm an idiot if this will never, I won't get offended.

Thank you for your time!

personalfinance,General Auto Financing Advice,"So I work in the automotive industry and I've recently been reading this subreddit more often, and it blows my mind how many stories I read about people who are underwater on their car loans. So I thought I'd put together a little post of car financing advice.

First, to make sure we're all on the same page, being underwater on a car loan is when you owe more on the loan than the car is worth. So if your car is worth $5k but you still have $8k left on the loan, then you are underwater. Now on to the advice.

1. Put down the largest down payment you can afford. I'm not saying to empty your savings account or use all your emergency fund, but the more you put down upfront, the further ahead you are, and the less likely you are to get underwater. New cars can easily depreciate 10% as soon as you drive them off the lot, so if your down payment was less than 10%, you're already underwater. Ideally, I'd say you want to put at least 20% down.

2. Keep the loan length as short as you can afford. While a longer loan will bring the monthly payment down, more of that payment is going towards interest and less towards the principle. In this situation, it is possible that your car depreciates faster than you are paying off the loan, thus causing you to go underwater on the loan. Personally, I would never finance for longer than 3 years, but I know this isn't realistic for everyone. In general, I would say never get a car loan longer than 5 years. If you're looking at a 7-8 year loan to afford a car, you should really be looking at a cheaper car.

3. More than just the purchase price is negotiable. Your trade-in value (if you have a car to trade) and some fees are also negotiable. This is where you really need to do your research. There are multiple sites and tools online that you can use to determine your budget and your car's value. You need to determine the MAX you are will to pay for a car, and the MIN you are will to take for your car BEFORE you go to the dealership. Don't forget to factor insurance costs into your budget. As for fees, some are required and set ahead of time (like a destination fee). But other fees are set by the dealership and 100% negotiable, even if they say otherwise. For example, it is common for there to be a documentation fee and these often are ~$100. But if the dealer is trying to charge $500 for a doc fee, he is just trying to increase profit. Stuff like this is negotiable.

4. You almost never want to take financing from the dealer. Let me be clear here, I am talking about DEALER financing, not MANUFACTURER financing. If you qualify for a good loan from Ford Credit, GM Financial, etc., those can be perfectly good loans. But the dealership itself may try to secure financing for you. All they are doing is going to banks and trying to find a loan you qualify for, and then they'll jack up the interest rate to increase their profit. For example, the dealership might secure a 5% rate loan for you, but they'll give it to you at 6% and that extra 1% is pure profit for them. You should just go to a local bank/credit union and get the financing yourself. It will be a better rate most of the time.

5. Most extras/add-ons aren't worth the money. Things like window etching and underbody anti-rust coating do nothing and are just profit for the dealer. If you follow my above advice, you shouldn't get underwater on your loan, thus eliminating the need for gap insurance. Extended warranties can be tricky. Most regular, recent cars (less than 10 yrs old) that most people buy are very reliable, easily 150k miles and beyond. Unless the car you are buying is known for having issues, or is exotic and has expensive repair parts, or you know you get in a lot of accidents/break cars, most of the time it is cheaper to have your car fixed a local shop than to drop several thousand dollars on an extended warranty.

That's all I can think of for now. If I think of more I'll come back and edit it in. I'll answer any questions in the comments that I can.

EDIT: So I thought I'd make an edit to mention some very valid points made in the comments.

First, this post kinda assumes ideal conditions. I know not everyone everyone can save up 20% down, or maybe you really need a car to get to work but have nothing saved. In that case, you do what you have to, and that might be no down payment and a long loan term. Just try to get a cheaper car then. There are a lot of decent, reliable used cars out there for under $5k, heck even under $3k. And if you're in a situation where you know you might go underwater, then something like gap insurance might not be terrible.

Second, never let the dealer make you feel pressured/rushed or make you wait on them. You are in charge. The dealer is fighting for your business. There are always other dealers. If something doesn't feel right, take a night to think it over or go somewhere else.

Third, I said you ALMOST never want the dealer financing. However, if you show the dealer that you are approved for a loan at 3% from your bank/credit union, they will try to beat it because they still want your business (read money). If they come back with a 2.5% loan, then sure go with the dealer financing. Just make sure you have a clear understand of the terms of the loan.

Fourth, always get the car inspected before you buy it, especially if it is used. $100 upfront is nothing compared to the problems if the car blows up a month after you buy it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy a home due to the market continuing to rise?,"I'll be as brief as possible.

I just sold my home in TX and moved to Seattle, renting a home for a year here. We walked away with about 40k in profit, which we used to pay off our 17k car note, which was our only debt. I make about $120k, and am only taxed about 9% due to having a wife at home and 2 kids.

The ~20k remaining is our only liquid assets (not including 401k). We have a plan right now to get to about 60k by the beginning of next year, and go 20% down on a ~300k loan, which is rock bottom for this area; unlikely that we could find such a home even today. Our credit will go up from about 720 to about 750 by then, as well, as my only delinquency ages another year.

Here's my fear. The market is still climbing. I sold my house in TX for 50k more after just 11 months, and the market here is even hotter. Interest rates are also going up. If the housing market in my area does 10% next year, and it did 16% last year, then I'll have lost out on at least 30k in equity gains by waiting, and likely get a similar interest rate as I would now, with the fed increases cancelling out my improving credit.

I thought the market was slowing as of the fall, but it's just not. My brothers both bought in the fall in this area and are killing; over 30k in equity already. Our dad is an appraiser so we have a really good idea of value.

Our plan feels really responsible and solid, and I know you're not supposed to time the market, but what do you guys think about this? I'll be pretty bummed to have to pay 10% more with the same interest rate as I'd get today just because I waited. For the record, I can get out of my lease for a 2k relisting fee, which would be more than worth it if this is the best idea.",finance
personalfinance,Advice On Minimizing Tax Liability In Retirement,"* Currently age 40
* Retirement will be at age 57 unless early retirement is offered
* Employed by federal government
* Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is maxed (government's version of a 401K)
* Retirement will be a blend of government pension, TSP, personal investments and social security at age 62 if it is still solvent
* Currently no IRAs (traditional nor Roth)
* Currently living in Maryland - planning on retiring elsewhere

I would like to increase my personal investments towards retirement but I am concerned about my tax liability at that time.  All of my retirement income sources will be either completely taxable or mostly taxable (federal pension, TSP, Social Security if available and personal investments).

I'm going to start maxing out a Roth IRA.  No excuses for this glaring oversight on my part.

I also intend to retire in a state that doesn't have harsh winters and is ""retirement friendly"" with regards to taxes (your opinion on where is appreciated).

My question is - what other things can I do to increase my investments now that also minimize my tax liability in retirement?  I have only did a cursory look into municipal bonds.

To be clear, I'm not trying to avoid paying taxes (that would be nice huh).  I'm just trying to work within the system to avoid paying any more than I have to.

personalfinance,Got bad advice on S-corp filing from my CPA and now I owe about 120k in personal income taxes; What do I do?,"So basically my CPA told me that there was 0 tax liability if you paid yourself a reasonable salary over the course of the year and withdrew W2/federal income taxes and SSI/FDIC from that. So I paid myself about 60k and withheld about 14k and then proceeded to make about 300k net income on the business.

Now I found out that the CPA is actually full of shit and she mistook 'self employment tax' with regular income tax and even though I asked her 1million times to verify, she really just continued spouting this bullshit and it fucked me. So now, based on me being in the highest income bracket (and with the Obamacare tax), I'll be paying about 120k in federal income taxes.

Here's my situation - my wife and I are currently homeowners, but we are realizing that we are quickly outgrowing our tiny raised ranch (we have a 2 year old and a dog, with plans for another baby in the next year or so).  My plan is to move into (or ideally, build) q larger ""forever"" home in the next 2-3 years.

My dilemma comes from our recent financial situation.  We have recently been blessed with a ""windfall"" of sorts (extra money I'm not expecting).  What I mean by this is that a family member is gifting my wife, daughter, and I money on a somewhat regular basis.  Any funds earmarked to my daughter will be separate and I'm planning on putting away for college.  But anything for my wife and I, I would like to set aside for a new home, which I'd like to put at least 20% down (I'm over the whole PMI thing!).

So my question to you all is, what should I do with this money that will do more than earn the 0.25% or whatever my savings account will get me.  Here are some details:

* We will receive ""windfall"" payments of approx. $8,000 quarterly.
* I also plan on putting away any performance bonuses, which I receive through my compensation package at work, which pay annually in March.  This is to the tune of $5,000 - $7,500.
* In 2-3 year's time, I'd expect we have approx. $20,000 equity in our current house (in hindsight, we stupidly signed up for a 100% mortgage through the USDA - a ""farm loan"").
* I can maybe put an extra $250 a month into whatever type of vehicle these funds go in.
* I also have a 401k in which I can take a loan from to help with a down payment.  As of right now, I could get a ~$13,000 loan for this purpose.  While I'm 29 and retirement is a long ways away, this is obviously a last resort (loan pays 4% interest, which is most likely less than what it'd get out in the market).

While we do have some debt (just a car pmt, really), we are comfortable paying the bills we have.  No credit card debt, no student loans, and have (and continue to build) an emergency fund with our regular income.  And yes, I max out my employer's contribution into my 401k, which is in good shape for my age.  I truly want to consider and put away this extra money like I don't even have it. 

I was a finance major in college (but work in health insurance), so have a general knowledge of investing, but this is really the first time investing myself with real money and real shorter-term goals, so I'm hoping to get some real world advice to ease any jitters.  So all this said, I was initially thinking opening an account with and trying a robo-advisor (leaning towards Wealthfront or Betterment), but I'm seeing mixed reviews and keep hearing about poorer than expected returns (granted, I don't know what those people set for their risk tolerance).  Now I'm thinking of just opening an account directly with Vanguard and investing in a few mutual funds (probably following their guidance of 40-50% in a stock fund and 50-60% in a bond fund).  On the flip side, I hear other advice that says I should just stick it in a CD or other FDIC-insured vehicle, given the time line for my goal.  But with interest rates less than 2% on a 3 year CD and not being able to deposit more cash into the same fund (since funds will come available at different times), I'm not sure this is the best fit.

I'm a grad student about to finish school with:

-$130,000 federal student loan debt
-3 open credit cards with about $10/month recurring payments but otherwise unused (variable interest rate bw high 20s-30% on each). All three combine to $6,400 credit. 
-1 open store credit card with no balance. I think another $2,000 credit there. 
-1 Amex used as a cash card with loan money paying balance monthly. No issues with that (though have been late in the past toward end of semester (loans dry out, part time job doesn't cover it). 

I have about 3 months to graduation at which point I'll go to a $65k/yr job for one year then to $125k job more permanently.

personalfinance,Debt Payment Strategy/Interest Question,"I have a question about interest. In this example, there are three different debts:

1. A first mortgage at 3.25% that is about 4 years into the amortization schedule

2. A second mortgage at 3.65% that is in the 1st year of the amortization schedule

3.  A credit card that is in a promotional period at 5.00%


The breakdown of the payments for a current month in this example are:

Mortgage 1, Payment=$2100, I=$1200, P=$900	

Mortgage 2, Payment=$1800, I=$1200, P=$600
	
Credit Card, Payment=$500, I=$100, P=$400

Say I have some extra money to pay towards a debt. Usually, it seems to be recommended to pay the highest interest debt first. However, my question deals with two mortgages that are in different points of their amortization schedule. Assuming that paying an extra payment to principal advances you in the amortization schedule, the amount of interest in the monthly payment that is forgone for each dollar paid to principal seems to be different in each debt. For example, if I provide a ratio of interest to principal, I get:


Mortgage 1, I/P= 1.333

Mortgage 2, I/P= 2

Credit Card, I/P= 0.25

This appears to suggest to me that I should pay towards Mortgage 2 first because I forgo $2 of interest for every $1 I pay, which means, in this case, it is not best to pay to the highest interest debt first.

Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding or missing something?

(For this problem, let’s ignore the fact that the interest on the mortgages is tax-deductible)

Similarly, for example, it seems if you have a high interest rate mortgage at the tail-end of the amortization schedule, it might be better to pay towards a low interest mortgage early in its schedule first- again, paying the lower interest debt first, no?",finance
personalfinance,My tax calculations are not adding up. Not sure what the problem is.,"Hi everyone.

I'm making a tool to help estimate my taxes for coming years. It's ultimately to help me budget better. I'll get straight to it - [this](https://puu.sh/u41oy/23c4b2f027.png) table represents my taxes. I make $50,000/year (roughly), but for some reason 39% of my income is supposedly aimed at taxes.

After taking a step back I realized I was being silly. The 25% only applies after the first $37,950 as told [here](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/). But with this in mind I get $8,239 for my federal taxes. Wonderful! But next I calculated my state's (Ohio) @ the 3.465% rate and ended up with $1212/year after taking the same step back and applying it correctly as stated [here](http://www.tax.ohio.gov/ohio_individual/individual/annual_tax_rates.aspx).

So I end up with ""only"" a $9,451 total tax bill. Sounds great....but then I add in the other taxes with those figures to arrive at [this end number](https://puu.sh/u41P5/e0e2a6fee8.png). Something is clearly not right here. Every online calculator I use (including paycheckcity and ADP's) says I owe much lower than that $23,977 figure for taxes than this. I don't understand, what am I doing incorrectly? :(

As such, **the current implementation has very real flaws** thatlimitthe applicabilityofBitcoin and its potential to become a global transaction network. **Tangible shortcomings include**:            
            
&gt; * A difficult to maintain infrastructure. One that is both hard to keep consistent and allows for very little innovation and experimentation.
* A static, singular set of logics and rules. For example, **an unchanged and single monetary policy and inflation rate enforced for everyone independent of context.**
* An increasing arms race in hashrate, one that is both a race to the bottom, and has very real negative effects in energy consumption, that if projected forward is unsustainable.
* A limit of both 7 transactions per second, and an average wait time for transaction approval that is measured in minutes, not seconds. That is low throughput and high latency for what is ideally a push or pull request to a digital database.
* A single currency, with little space for development and implementation of alternative currencies, securities, digital rights, smart contracts, or generalized assets.

Their implementation of a ""solution"" for the fixed inflation rate will be to allow core devs a method to create Bitcoin on demand so that they can control inflation rates. Literally turning blockstream into the central bank of Bitcoin. It's going to be the most centralized and totalitarian bank in history, with direct control over printing and destroying Bitcoin, as well as near complete control over transactions.        
This is exactly the opposite of what Bitcoin should be.         
Under no circumstances we can allow this to happen, or come even close to happening. We should not allow them to create more tools that allow them to creep closer to their goal (SegWit and LN are just Trojans that slowly creep power and authority towards them, until it's too late to fight back, the same way central banks gained their power secretly until they were 'too big to fail').        
       
Bitcoin core devs should not get even anywhere within 10 km of Bitcoin. Ever.

personalfinance,Permanent Life Insurance vs Investments vs Both,"Hello there,

Long time reader, but posting for the first time.


I am a 26 year-old single and with no dependents earning $53k with no debt except for a mortgage of $1,050/month. (Not living in North America, cannot disclose where.)

I got through undergraduate and graduate engineering school debt- and loan-free via scholarships and paid internships.

I put a $58k down payment on a house a year ago and currently have a net-worth of $30k ($20k of it is being invested) excluding the house's value which is around $250k and which will increase over time since the country where I live is forecast to go through some serious growth soon.

I am very financially-disciplined, I set up budgets, and track ALL my expenses. For the past 3 years, I was able to save 35% of my yearly salary (~$18k) and all of that gets invested. I got the $58k down payment from that investment fund which had all my previous savings as well prior to the past 3 years.

I am currently looking to diversify my investments into a 3-risk category portfolio: low, medium, high, but for the moment, my investment fund is earning 5.7% per year with very very low risk.

A friend of mine who works for an insurance company approached me to buy a permanent life insurance policy. With a $3k yearly contribution, I will get a $125k death benefit, a $200k permanent or partial disability benefit, and the cash value for the policy will break even at year 7 ($16,872), will be $132k at year 25, $375k at age 65, $740k at age 75, and and $1.45m at age 85. I can't touch the cash value though without penalties until year 10. It's a Protection and Investment policy. The pension benefit option of the policy at age 65 will give me a life-time yearly income of $26k.

In contrast, If I don't get into that policy and I invest the $3k annually in a low-risk 5.7% interest rate fund, my simulation says that I will have $24.7k (+7.8k) at year 7, $156k (+25k) at year 25, $402k (+27k) at age 65, $738k (-1.7k) at age 75, and $1.32m (-131k) at age 85.

For the time being, I intend to keep saving 35% of my salary ($18k) and investing it, but if you were in my shoes now, with no wife and kids, would you get into that life insurance policy ($3k anually) and invest the remaining ($15k) into a 3-risk category portfolio?

Thank you in advance.",finance

btc,"AXA/Blockstream are suppressing Bitcoin price at 1000 bits = 1 USD. If 1 bit = 1 USD, then Bitcoin's market cap would be 15 trillion USD - close to the 82 trillion USD of ""money"" in the world. With Bitcoin Unlimited, we can get to 1 bit = 1 USD on-chain with 32MB blocksize (""Million-Dollar Bitcoin"")","**TL;DR:**

- Blockstream (fiat-financed by companies like [AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on) - which happens to be the 2nd-most connected financial firm in the world) is _suppressing Bitcoin price_ - currently at 1000 ""bits"" = 1 USD (where 1 ""bit"" is one-millionth of a bitcoin) - ie 1 BTC = 1000 USD.

- They're doing this by _suppressing Bitcoin volume_ - by _suppressing Bitcoin blocksize_ - in order to prevent debt- &amp; war- &amp; oil-backed fiat currencies (USD, etc.) from collapsing relative to Bitcoin.

- AXA/Blockstream's suppression of the Bitcoin price is [easy to see](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*22ix0l4oBDJ3agoLzVtUgQ.gif) in Bitcoin [price/volume graphs](https://i.redd.it/kvjwzcuce3ay.png): Bitcoin price and volume were tightly correlated (almost in lockstep) [until late 2014](https://imgur.com/jLnrOuK) - which is when Blockstream came on the scene. From then on, the price has been suppressed - due to AXA/Blockstream spreading their lies and propaganda that ""Bitcoin can't scale on-chain"".

- The way to stop AXA/Blockstream's _Bitcoin price suppression_ and let the Bitcoin _price_ continue to rise again... is to let Bitcoin _volume_ continue to rise again - by letting Bitcoin _blocksize_ continue to rise again - by using the [_market-based blocksize_](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fp7fn/suggestion_for_new_terminology_instead_of_saying/) supported by Bitcoin Unlimited.

- We actually _can_ reach 1 bit = 1 USD or 1 BTC = 1'000'000 USD (""Million-Dollar Bitcoin"") _on-chain_. All it would require is (a) the price doubling 10 times (2^10 = 1024), and (b) the blocksize increasing by the _square root_ of this (in accordance with Metcalfe's Law) - ie the blocksize would have to double only five times (2^5 = 32).

- 2^5 = [32 MB blocksize (which Satoshi actually _did_ hard-code)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=32mb&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) would support 2^10 = 1000x higher price _on-chain_ (""Million-Dollar Bitcoin"") - without requiring off-chain pseudo-Bitcoin Lightning ~~Network~~ Central Banking Hubs!

**Details:**

**(1) Who is AXA? Why and how would they want to suppress the Bitcoin price?**

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/

---

&gt; If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then tens of trillions of dollars on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" will evaporate, destroying AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderbergers. This is the real reason why AXA bought Blockstream: to artificially suppress Bitcoin volume and price with 1MB blocks.

&gt; The insurance company with the biggest exposure to the 1.2 quadrillion dollar (ie, 1200 TRILLION dollar) derivatives casino is AXA.

AXA is the #2 company with the most economic power/connections in the world. And AXA owns Blockstream.

**(2) What evidence do we have that Core and AXA-owned Blockstream are actually impacting (suppressing) the Bitcoin price?**

&gt; This trader's price &amp; volume graph / model predicted that we should be over $10,000 USD/BTC by now. The model broke in late 2014 - when AXA-funded Blockstream was founded, and started spreading propaganda and crippleware, centrally imposing artificially tiny blocksize to suppress the volume &amp; price.

&gt; This graph shows Bitcoin price and volume (ie, blocksize of transactions on the blockchain) rising hand-in-hand in 2011-2014. In 2015, Core/Blockstream tried to artificially freeze the blocksize - and artificially froze the price. Bitcoin Classic will allow volume - and price - to freely rise again.

**(3) ""But no - they'd never do _that!_""**

Actually - yes, they would. And ""they"" already _are_. For years, governments and central bankers have been spending trillions in fiat on wars - and eg suppressing precious metals prices by flooding the market with ""fake (paper) gold"" and ""fake (paper) silver"" - to prevent the debt- &amp; war-backed PetroDollar from collapsing.

&gt; The owners of Blockstream are spending $76 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.

&gt; The number of blocks being mined by Bitcoin Unlimited is now getting very close to surpassing the number of blocks being mined by SegWit! More and more people are supporting BU's MARKET-BASED BLOCKSIZE - because BU avoids needless transaction delays and ultimately increases Bitcoin adoption &amp; price!

(2) When it did finally come tumbling down, it happened *faster* than anyone expected (ie, in a matter of days) - and everyone was shocked.

personalfinance,[Housing] When is it okay/wise to put a smaller down payment on a home?,"Dear PF,  

DISCLAIMER:  
Obviously 20% is the golden rule.  

However I qualify for a 3.5% FIXED 30 year Mortgage through my bank.  

Now, given my predicament as a 24 year old college grad.  I have student loan debt that ranges across various loans between 4% and 6% interest rates.

Which brings me to the question.  Should I put down 10% on the home.  And use the remaining money to pay off the higher interest (6%) student loans.  
  
Since the mortgage would have a lower interest rate then the student loans it would seem wise to pay those off rather then putting a bigger down payment on a home.  Obviously this would mean I am paying PMI but the bank said it would only be an additional $23/mo.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy,"Hi, been a PF lurker for a few months – graduated school in May 2016, and am looking for some advice on which loans to target to pay off with extra funds. Have ~25k in federal loans and ~36k in private loans and am making a starting salary of 63k a year. I’ve built up an emergency fund, am getting the employee match on my 401k and paid off one unsubsidized federal loan with an interest rate of 6.55%, so trying to decide what to attack next. The private loan is variable rate, cosigned by my parents, and currently at 3.15%. The federal loans vary from 3.15%-4.41%, all fixed rate, and are both subsidized (~14k) and unsubsidized (~11k). 
I’ve got 5k from my tax return, along with an upcoming bonus paid out on March 3rd (unsure about exactly how much, started work in July so will be prorated to reflect this) that I would like to put towards loans, but I’m not sure which I should be paying down. There are two unsubsidized loans of ~2k each that I could knock out right away, which have interest rates of 4.41% and 4.04%. That being said, would it be wiser to try and pay down the private loan, even though the interest rate is currently lower?

personalfinance,What is the best way to tackle my debts?,"I want to get out of debt as fast as I can without completely restricting myself. I still want to be able to buy good food and maybe spend $50 or so on an outing each month.

1 credit line that I owe $700 on with 0% interest (paypal)

1 credit card that I owe $3800 on with 18.74% interest (discover)

A car loan that I owe about $7000 on

Federal student loans for $26,637.47

A private student loan for $14176.57 (Navient)

Right now I am most eager to pay off my credit cards and then my car loan. I am aware that my student loans will take a long time to pay off and am not in a rush. I have IBR on my federal loans and work for a nonprofit so they may be forgiven after 10 years of qualifying payments. I pay the minimum payment on the private student loans (about $255/month). On my credit cards I pay about $240/month to discover and $80-100/month to paypal. I don't charge much to these accounts at all anymore so my balances should not increase. I just paid off another credit card that I was paying $80/month towards, so not I have an extra $80 to put towards my other debts each month. I have $1,600 in savings. I am not sure if I should use that money for my debt or keep it. I make around $2,200/ month after taxes. My rent is $450/ month. I also try to put at least $200/month into savings but I am willing to put my savings aside temporarily.

personalfinance,$60k for grad school?,"My wife was recently accepted to a grad school program for school psychology.  The program is a masters, but it will take four years to complete--she would get her masters, earn a licensure, and complete a 1 year paid internship through the program.  At the two-year mark, she would potentially have the opportunity to switch over to a PhD program in school psychology, which she could use to later become a licensed psychologist.


Her mother and father both went to the same program years ago and have become well known psychologists in their field.  I only bring that up because she would have the groundwork already laid for making professional contacts in that field.


The program would cost a total of $60k if she completed the PhD program, which adds an extra year to the program (for a grand total of 5 years).  I currently work as a firefighter for the federal govt and make $62k per year.  Additionally, I have an extra ~$20k per year that I get through a mix of VA benefits.  My wife is currently working as an academic advisor at the same university which accepted her to the school psych program.  She makes about $40k per year, but the health benefits she gets through her job are really awesome and cheap ($75 a month to cover both of us for medical and dental/ $5 co-pays for all dr. visits at the university hospital).


We have no debt to speak of really.  We own both of our cars.  Our current rent is $1250/mo.  We pay $150/mo in cell phone bills, ~$100 in utilities, $100 in cable/internet.  I put $400/check into my retirement fund, we put $500 a month into savings (current savings $30k), and my wife's job puts a whopping 14% into her retirement automatically.  If she did this program, my wife would have to quit her current job.

Are we nuts to take on that kind of school debt?  We have never really had debt--we've always been good with our money and we've had some great opportunities come our way in life that set us up to live fairly comfortably.  She has considered other options like going to school online for her masters in higher education administration, but I don't think she's terribly passionate about her current job, and I think that an online program through somewhere like penn state would still be fairly expensive.  Right now we're both on board with her going through the program, but I want to make sure we aren't drinking our own kool-aid.",finance

personalfinance,Questions About Solar Panel Loan and Credit Card Debt.,"I have been quoted $20,930 20yr fixed at 4.99% for solar panels. With the solar panels I get rebates and tax credits totalling $7,779. There are a few scenarios that I am unsure of which to go with and why.

1. I do not go with the solar panels and stay the way things are now.
2. If I apply the rebates/tax credits to the loan the payments will be $100/month. 
3. If I choose to pocket the money and apply that towards credit card debt the payments are $100/month for months 2-18 and $143/month for months 19-240.

The credit cards we would pay off are as follows:

* 11.74%	-$4,886.73 Minimum Payment of $95.78 (Currently paying $100/month)
* 22.74%	-$2,466.79 Minimum Payment of $96 (Currently paying $100/month)
* 23.49%	-$559.46 Minimum Payment of $30 (Currently paying $380/month)

For those doing the math that is $7912.98, this is fine because we are using the pay off method of avalanche  and paying an extra $350 per month on these cards already, with all debt including car loans and school loans being paid off around March 2021. If the tax credits/rebates were applied to the credit cards that would save $2,498.48 in interest and giving total debt payoff (not counting solar panels) of September 2020.

*Edit* Everyone is saying to pay off credit cards first before thinking about solar panels. But the solar panels will reduce the overall electric bill by $50-100/month This reduction in electric bill counts the solar loan+electric bill (Electric bill is currently $267 a month would be $167-217 with solar panels included). This includes the loan cost of the solar panels. So would it not make sense to use the the additional savings from the solar panels to then apply that towards the debt as well? Continuing the avalanche method we are using the solar panels could be paid off by July 2021 increasing my overall debt payoff date to September 2021. (So by an additional 12 months).

personalfinance,Inheriting $600k in retirement and annuity. Am I doing this right?,"TLDR: Inheriting multiple accounts totaling over $790k. Looking for best advice on how to take the money. 

A little about myself. 

33. Single but about to be engaged. Will be buying a house once engaged/married. About $15k in car and student loans. All less than 3% interest on these loans. No credit card debt. About $25k in 401k. Have a volatile job due to the company itself struggling in the ag economy. Currently making $40k with downsizing and store closures constantly looming. (Already looking for new jobs or even considering starting my own business) 

First account is an annuity that is about $390k. Because my relative had taken out almost all the earnings every year, only about $26k of it is taxable. I have three options with this: Lump sum, 5 year deferral, or reinvest into a new life expectancy based annuity. During the 5 year deferral, the money is liquid and will continue to earn 4.5%. The new annuity option would only be earning 2.5%. As most of this money will be tax free, I think the 5 year option will be best. Let it earn 4.5% and then lump sum at the end or tailor the withdrawals to keep me in the lowest tax bracket possible.

The second is a $127k individual account that consists mostly of mutual funds. There is a $300 charge to have this account transferred to me. They are great funds that have earned anywhere between 5-15% over their life. I plan on keeping these.

The third and fourth accounts are Roth ($40k) and traditional ($237k) IRAs. Both of these can be drawn as a lump sum, 5 year deferral, or life expectancy based ""Decedent"" IRA. The 5 year deferral and Decedent IRA are both liquid and money can be taken out however, except the Decdent IRA has a minimum life expectancy based annual payment. Simplified example: If my life expectancy is 80 and I'm 30 now, I would have 50 payments of $5,540 (not including losses or gains). Again, these are both liquid IRAs so I could pull large sums out at any time if needed. I plan to do the Decedent IRA for two reasons. 1) Most of the funds are in a taxable traditional IRA, so taking as little money as possible each year will keep taxes low. 2) There is no cost to roll the IRAs into a Decedent IRA.

Thoughts? Concerns? Am I missing anything obvious?

personalfinance,First time home buyer here! Should I pay more down or pay interest rate down?,"Hey there everyone, name's Joe, I'm a first time homebuyer from Houston, Texas. I'll get right into the meat of the situation and not waste any time. 

I'm buying a house at 179,900.
I'll be putting at least the 20% down, to avoid insurance.
I'm 21, and want to stay in this house for the full 30 years of my fixed rate mortgage, so I'm trying to figure out what to put money towards to lower the overall cost, not really monthly payments.

I have about $50,000 to play with (down payment will be taken out of this), the builder is paying all closing sosts and fees, plus $1,500 toward buying down interest if I so choose. My rate is 4.2% right now. 

I guess my question is, should I pay down more? (all 50,000?)
Should I pay for credits to lower Interest? (Down to what?)
Or a combination of both?

Thanks so much for your time fellow humans.

personalfinance,"For a student, how cheap of a car is too cheap?","My fiancee and I will be needing a car by the beginning of the summer since we have summer jobs that require commuting. The problem is that we will only have $3500 total in our savings (including our emergency fund) by that time.

My fiancee thinks that is too little to spend on a car. Toyotas for example for that price in my area are 1999-2003 and they have over 150k miles, and she wants our next car to have 50k miles minimum. She does not want a repeat of her last car, which was a 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix with 150k miles given to her as a gift. It lasted us 3 years, each year needing substantial repairs, before we decided it was too expensive and too dangerous to drive.

One thing we were thinking of doing is getting a loan and paying it off in full by the end of the summer. After all expenses, we will have around $10k in cash by the end of the summer. We both have a 720 credit score but only 1-2 years of credit history. However since our income is only a few grand throughout the school year, I am afraid we will be denied on a loan based on our income. During the school year we pay the bills with grants and federal school loans, but for actual wages earned, we only earn around $20k combined for the entire year. I tried getting a preapproval from Capital One (who I have a credit card with) and they denied me. We also don't have anyone else to cosign.

How long could a $3000 beater be expected to last? Would it be better to get a loan--any loan--and pay it off in full in 3 months? How realistic is it to even be approved for, say, a $10,000 loan considering that would be half of our yearly income from wages?",finance

personalfinance,"Employer-owned housing, increase in salary, future borrowing.","I'm faced with a decision to make in terms of my compensation at work, and thought I'd pitch it to ya'll for some input.

1) I work at a non-profit and was recently offered a 5% raise after my annual review - ~45,000 year

2) My wife and I have been looking for a place to live much closer to our workplace - my employer has recently acquired management of a property with a small house in an ideal location. My boss offered us the opportunity to rent the house and we're excited to do it. My relationship with the non-profit and my boss are excellent and there's little to no chance things fall apart in the next year. The rent for the house is $500/mo. 

3) Because living on-site will affect my job description (new duties as a result of living on the premises of our program), I've been offered the choice between a) taking the raise as offered and immediately receiving a higher salary, then paying monthly rent back to my employer, or b) having rent withheld from my paycheck as a pre-tax benefit. This would reduce my gross pay to ~39,000.

I'm trying to figure out the best move here. Having my gross pay reduced obviously saves dollars - lower taxable income, but my wife and I are interested in borrowing to buy in the next few years and I'm under the impression that lenders are more confident in offering better terms to borrowers with higher gross incomes. 

Is the relatively small savings we'd get from having rent withheld worth whatever hit we might take from a lender when we're ready to shop for mortgage options? Would a difference this small mean anything?

For what it's worth, we're vegetable farmers and will likely be accessing credit through government programs designed to help farmers buy property at below market interest rates. The criteria for these programs are different from shopping for mortgages from traditional lenders. I don't expect /r/personalfinance to be super familiar with FSA loan options, but any insight you have into how lenders weigh factors like gross income into typical calculations would be really helpful.

This leaves about 1,000 bucks a month extra (excluding if I don't spend it all my categories in a month).

My interest rates are not that high (my interest payments are 14 dollars a month[excluding the fact that I am out ahead on points each month]), so I think it would be beneficial to save for the downpayment. I know I will be paying PMI when I get the mortgage, but don't see this as too much a deal breaker. I am looking at a houses in the range of 250,000-330,000.

personalfinance,"My GF received a large windfall due to the death of a parent :'( , but has student debt and no idea about how to manage money or personal finances. Please advice her on how to best deal with this student loan debt.","Sorry about the fresh account, but I don't want to link my reddit account with personal details I am about to reveal.  My s.o.'s mom died and she now is the beneficiary of about 150K in insurance money.  It's being held in an interest bearing account with the insurance company, it's not much, like @1%.  That's NOT the big problem right now.  The problem is her student debt, which is at about 60K.  After college she was basically homeless and living month to month and just defaulted on her loans.  Since she moved around a lot, she never got paperwork showing how much interest was piling up and how much she was getting further into debt.  She also was thinking that she would never be able to pay them off because she could barely make by with the little income she had.  Of course she could have not defaulted (there by avoiding HUGE penalties) and got into some program that was based on income based repayment.  She didn't do that until recently, but not after having accumulated 14K in penalties and interest on the original loans.  
I know nothing about finance either, but I do know how to use reddit so she has asked me to see what kind of advice people have.  Should she hire a lawyer and try to see if the student loan people will negotiate some type of lump sum payment that could give her a break on the insane penalties and interest (one of the loans was originally for 14k and now it's 26k because of the interest and penalties, just over a period of 10 years) ? 
It was one of her parents that filled out the loan papers, and she was moving around so much, she really didn't consider the consequences of defaulting because her parents never explained it, in fact she did mention to her father about not being able to pay off the loans but he told her just to default (thanks dad!) when the better advice was to keep paying them something, no matter how little so she didn't get these penalties and high interest rates.  
Obviously,  she could just pay off the balance with the windfall,  but that is almost half of her inheritance (and she has plans to go back to school for something that she can make a career out of and would like to preserve as much of the money as possible).  Also half of that student loan balance is interest.  It's crazy.  I feel like there has to be a way to not pay them so much and still pay something near the original loan amount and some interest.
Any suggestions?
I know she should move the balance from the insurance company's interest bearing account.  I plan on reading the windfall wiki for some ideas.  But really I wonder if there is someone she can hire to be her personal finance manger because I don't want to take on that responsibility.

I'm lucky enough to be in a lucrative position, and am looking to take over as much of the burden as possible.
I'll just get the details out of the way first.

STUDENT LOANS IN PARENT'S NAME:

* Direct Parent Plus Loan 1: **Balance:** $4235.30, **Interest Rate:** 7.9%, **Minimum Payment:** $85.12, **Repayment Term:** 116 Months (or 9.6 Years)

* Direct Parent Plus Loan 2: **Balance:** $6664.41, **Interest Rate:** 7.9%, **Minimum Payment:** $154.02, **Repayment Term:** 114 Months (or 9.5 Years)

* Direct Unsub Consolidation Loan: **Balance:** $35899.01, **Interest Rate:** 8%, **Minimum Payment:** $322.19, **Repayment Term:** 274 Months (or 23 Years!)

MY PERSONAL LOAN:

* Car Loan: **Balance:** $8,622.08, **Interest Rate:** 4.66%, **Minimum Payment:** $244.53, **Repayment Term:** 38 Months (or 3ish Years)

The solution I was thinking of is to help my parents consolidate the two Parent Plus loans with SoFi or something similar with a much more manageable interest rate, and then ""inherit"" the third loan on myself and refinance it as well. So, just a few questions on this, other than general advice on how this situation can be tackled most efficiently. 

- How do I go about willingly ""inheriting"" a loan, specifically the third loan that isn't a Parent Plus?

- Should/can I consolidate the two Parent Plus loans?

- Is SoFi a good or even plausible resource for this situation?

- What other options should I consider?

Any amount of help would be appreciated, and apologies for any first-time poster naivete. It'd be really great to help my parents out of this situation instead of skating off their supportiveness for the rest of my life.",finance

I have a car ($15,637 still owed on it) and three credit cards (a total of a $5,500 balance out of just shy of $10,000 worth of credit to use) most of the high balances come from paying my mom's bills. But some of it came from when I lived with my dad last year (I worked for his company and he didn't pay me, I had to use my credit cards to survive waiting for him to give me a fraction of the money he owed so I could pay my minimums.)

I don't have any school debt, as I put off school in order to work, I knew if I went right away I wouldn't have taken it seriously, that it would've been a waste of money and a bad move on my part at the time. I do plan to start online school next January, to start working towards a degree.

I have considered taking out a loan to put everything on a smaller payment, I have done the math at what I believe is a higher percent then what I would be paying (12.5% at 60 months) I have done the math of $20,000, $25,000, and $30,000. I have a credit score of 712, I've never missed a payment, so I feel like the interest rate would be lower than the 12.5% I did the math at. But with the 12.5% the monthly total would be much cheaper then what I have for bills currently. 

The total of my debt is a little over $21,000, so I have considered taking out more then I need (I.e the $30,000 idea for a loan) to keep the money not used in my savings account paying it back a little more then the minimum, plus the money I'd use on bills to pay the loan off faster then the 60 months I'd want to have to pay the loan off. 

I have already done meal prepping, planning out events further in advance and only going out when I have the extra money to spend, but I can't save money paying the bills I have each month, especially because one credit card is at a $4,200 balance, and essentially I am only able to pay the interest each month, not being able to catch up nor save any money. 

Would taking out a loan be in my best interest? Would it actually help me get ahead with saving, as long as I budget correctly? Or would it be a bad decision. 

I know this is a lot of information, but I don't think I'm going to be able to get anything in order if I keep living like this. 

I'd appreciate any kind of help anyone can offer, I really don't know what to do.",finance
personalfinance,Is cancelling a credit card better than leaving it open unused?,"I would like to switch from my first credit card (Scheels Visa) to the Amazon Citibank credit card. I have the balance paid off on the Scheels card. It has a 19.27% interest and no annual fees. I've had the line open since 2010. 

Will it negatively affect my credit if I close the card rather than just leaving it open until it closes itself due to inactivity?

Here is the scenario: -Bank loan amount = approx. $1,183,000 -Interest rate = 7.5% -Loan term = 10 years -Compounding = quarterly

personalfinance,Michigan holding my tax refund to apply to non-existent debt. What to do?,"So, for the first time ever I'm actually supposed to receive a refund from the state of Michigan.

However, I received a letter stating they're holding the refund to apply against about $6.5K in debt. The problem is I'm almost positive this is a mistake. My wife and I hold no unpaid or overdue debt that I am aware of. The letter cites an account number and that the type of debt is ""Accounts Receivable.""

The account number means nothing to me - doesn't show up in either of our emails or via a google search. 

I would think this is a scam, however I received my federal return weeks ago and we were still waiting on the state, so I do believe they are holding it. Also - because I know it'll come up - there's no way my wife secretly took out some debt without telling me. We have the funds to pay off that debt if we needed to, so if there was some honest mistake somewhere, this wouldn't be the sort of thing that we would try to keep secret. Also, I've never seen this debt show up on a credit report (not sure if it would even show up there?).

The notice they sent us also says we can file a form 743 ""Income Allocation for Non-Obligated Spouse"" so that the non-debted spouse's portion of the refund doesn't need to count against the debt.

The form has a phone number for ""more information"" but it is an automated system that tries to tell me the status of a return, it hasn't been helpful. 

Is there anyway I can figure out where they think this debt is from? Is there anyway I can prove to the state that this is invalid, and still get my refund? They claim they will automatically apply my refund against the debt in 30 days.

So I have seen a few posts reviewing Credit Karma's tax service and figured I would put my 2 cents in for anyone interested.

For reference:

I'm married filing jointly

My wife and I's AGI is just north of 105k

We do not itemize our deductions as we do not have a mortgage for interest deductions and taxes are cheap where we live. 

We have 2 children

We file with W-2's

We have a taxable brokerage account

We have 529's for the kids

I filed both Federal and NYS via CK

I thought the whole process was very easy and self explanatory, there was no point in the process where I wasn't clear on what I should be inputting. The UI was clean and simple to navigate. I did not come across any computational errors or anything ""weird"". I triple checked with Turbo Tax and by hand, and the results were identical. I e-filed both my Federal and State via Credit Karma, and both were almost instantly accepted (Federal was like 2 minutes, state took about 4 hours). 

Assuming the direct deposit(s) of my very small tax return goes well and without issue, I will happily use this service again, I thought it was awesome.",finance
personalfinance,40k in Credit Card Debt. Various Emergencies. Attending Law School on August. Advice Needed.,"I'm a 26 year old recent graduate living in South Korea. I'm an American/ Korean dual citizen.

I currently work for the US Embassy making about 32k dollars a year paid in Korean won. However, I’ve been accepted to Northwestern Law School and I plan to move to Chicago in August 2017. EDIT* I received 120k in Scholarship. I plan to finance the rest with Unsub/Sub Stafford Loans.

Long story short, I've had a nightmarish year last year, and it felt as if all hell broke loose. My family member had to receive an emergency treatment (with no insurance) that I foolishly decided to pay with my credit card, and I also had my 10k security deposit scammed by a real estate agent. (Security deposit in Korea is expensive) I contacted the police and was referred to a fee-free government lawyer. 

Because I had no cash, and no savings, (having that 10k scammed was a huge hit) I had to take out a couple of cash advances to pay for my living expenses and a security deposit.

Currently, I am 40k in Credit Card Debt (spread throughout 7 credit cards) and I have about 32k in Stafford Student Loans that I had deferred for a year. I don’t have any other debts.

So my total debt right now is 72k and increasing fast.

The problem is that I am having trouble paying down the credit card debt. The minimum payments alone for the 7 credit cards is about 1000 dollars every month, which is about 40% of my take home pay.

My monthly budget consists of the following: +$2200 take home pay. -$1000 minimum payments. -$650 Rent. -$400 Food. -$150 Transportation.

I attempted to lower my minimum payments and my interest rates by calling the banks, but only Bank of America was cooperative. I still have to make about 1000 dollars of minimum payments every month, not including the monthly living expenses.

I feel like I only have two options: file bankruptcy or default on the credit cards. I can also consider cancelling my admission to Northwestern and find a higher paying job, but I’ve worked really hard towards it and it would be devastating for me.

I know that filing bankruptcy won’t cancel my student loans, but I’d be ok with it because I would be able to defer it for 3 additional years once I start attending law school.

Other option that I am considering is defaulting on my higher limit credit cards. If I default on them I would cancel about 30k in debt and I would still have about 10k worth of credit left over for emergencies. I should be able to pay off the 10k in leftover credit by September, because I should receive a lump sum student budget funding from NW Law for the Fall Semester in August. This is of course under the assumption that other banks would let me keep my credit cards after the defaults.

What I am most afraid of is the collections agency. I don’t want them to harass my family, especially because they are still recovering from a major surgery. I’m also afraid of the collections agency finding my future address in Chicago and harass me while I’m studying. Are there any actions that I can perform to delete my personal information they have on file? 

I’ve done some research and it looks like the defaulted credit cards will last on my credit report for 6-7 years. I think that I will be able to handle having a bad credit for 6 years or so because I’d mostly be living frugally on a student budget while attending law school. I don’t intend to own a car or lease one, so I won’t require a good credit score for a while.

Anyways, thank you for reading this lengthy post. I’ve been living in financial hell for the past year, and I am really ready to move on to the next chapter of my life.

TL;DR 40k in CC Debt. Barely able to make minimum payments. Considering bankruptcy or defaulting on some of my cards. Please help me decide.",finance

personalfinance,Preparing for baby - use cash to pay down student loans or save as emergency fund?,"So we are expecting our first baby in 6 months. Wife and I have accumulated about $60K in graduate student loans (Stafford), averaging 5-6% fixed interest. My job covers some tuition expenses - the last payment they provided was about $9,000. I am hesitant to use that cash to pay down our loans with a baby on the way - is it better to keep it in an emergency fund? 
    
Here's our current setup:
Chase savings account: ~3 months worth of emergency expenses saved.
Another ~3 months worth of emergency expenses are parked in 100% equity index ETFs. I forsee the Fed raising rates will cause bond prices to fall, and I don't want to put this money is a meager 1% savings account or lock it up in a CD earning about the same.
Substantial 401k, if I had to cash it out, after penalties it would likely cover a year's worth of emergency expenses, but I plan to never touch that.
     
I am hoping to be able to afford having my wife stay home with the baby (no paycheck) for up to a year, so I am unsure of how far that will cut into our emergency funds. Her pay is about 40% of our total income. She does get 2 months full pay and I believe another 2 months half pay. Also wondering what state benefits might be available to us to help (NJ).
    
SO my immediate question is, should I send my newly received $9k to pay off student loans? Or hold it as extra emergency cash and just pay off the loans as normal, perhaps a little extra than the minimum payment each month?

personalfinance,Gut Check on House Affordability,"Hey folks - looking for a gut check on buying my first house. I feel like the ""how much can I afford"" calculators out there make it sound like I can afford a crazy-expensive house, and I'm looking to get another set of eyes on things.

My wife and I each make about $120k a year (so $240k total), and are in very stable jobs with room for advancement to make more. No debt. I have about $300k saved up in non-retirement accounts (which is more than I'd want to spend on a down payment - but the important note is that the down payment won't be a limiting factor).

If I plug that into Zillow's calculator here (https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/house-affordability/) it says I can afford a $1.5 million house. That seems crazy.

Browsing through PF, one rule of thumb I saw was that your monthly housing cost should be somewhere between 20% - 35% of your pre-tax income, 20% being conservative, 35% being aggressive. On a $240k salary, that translates to an acceptable monthly housing cost between $4k - $7k. 

Using this calculator: http://usmortgagecalculator.org - I plugged in a 4.35% interest rate on a 30 year mortgage, 0.572% property tax (avg for DC), 0.35% insurance, 3% initial one-time expense, 20% down payment (so no PMI). Playing with that, it looks like an $850,000 house translates to a $4,038 monthly payment (on the conservative end), and a $1.475 million house translates to a $7,007 monthly payment (on the aggressive end).

Do my assumptions here seem reasonable? We'd almost certainly be looking below $850k, but if a dream home popped up for that amount, I want to make sure we're not shooting ourselves in the foot if we go for it.",finance
personalfinance,Tackling loans/debt with APR vs Interest Rate,"I've been tackling most of my debt using the snowball method and have finished paying off a handful of smaller debts. I've consolidated my credit card balances to take advantage of a 0% APR offer and plan to cover that in the next few months. 

After the credit card balances are zeroed, the next two debts are nearly identical in balance: my car and my student loans (both roughly 10K). 

For my student loans (which i have consolidated), i have 2 separate rates (subsidized vs unsubsidized), about 3600USD at 6.8% and about 6350USD at 3.4%. The minimum payment for the student loans is 120USD (i've been paying more than that since the repayment period started). My car loan with 10k remaining has an APR of 7.35%. The minimum payment for the car is about 285, which is what i have been paying. 

My intent was to tackle my student loans with the higher rates and continue with my car payments since my car should be PIF by may of 2020 whereas my loans would take much longer due to the lower payment/payment minimums. 

So the question is, which should I focus on in order to have the greatest impact. Once the credit card is payed, i will have freed up roughly an additional 220USD/mo after a portion is redirected to savings. I guess my biggest question is should i focus more on actual interest rate or APR?

**tl;dr - Should i focus on higher interest rate or APR when tackling similarly sized debt?**",finance

Ok my setups aren't true hydroponics but functionally they operate that way - they're bonsai trees in boxes/containers (such as this http://imgur.com/ULfFbs7, here's a close-up of my 'soil' (media) http://imgur.com/i0uHSyh ), I use 85%+ DE (diatomite/diatomaceous earth granules, sifted&amp;rinsed to be only large granules) and the water just *falls through*, when I water them the water falls out of the bottom as soon as I begin watering - this loose, inert media, combined with my (manual) 'top-drip' feeding is reminiscent of types of hydro setups I've seen and I'm aware of how, in such setups, it's usually a top-feed 'dripper' that's irrigated (ie the water is collected at the bottom instead of just running-off, it goes to the reservoir where it's pumped back to the tops of the containers)

SO, with such a setup, *far* more fertilizer is needed than with traditional dirt-in-a-bucket, as there's no real retention of the fertilizer - I've read some general guidelines but they're all over the place, some people with similar bonsai setups do double to quadruple the recommended rates of instant-release fertilizers (I use the miracle gro 18-18-21, will start alternating-in a 24-8-16 soon when spring-growth really starts here in FL), right now I'm doing:

1TBSP of 18-18-21 per gallon every 5 days - but I take that further and divide the amount by 5, and do it daily, so *every* watering has a smaller amount of fert (that, cumulatively, ends up being about 2x miracle-gro's recommended application rate, but I know that rate's for plants in organic soils that'll be retaining it, not loose, sterile media that 99% of the water just falls-through!)

So, I'm hoping for help in determining how to approach this - because the trees need more or less waterings/day depending how sunny/windy/etc it was, I want to arrive at the best *concentration* of fertilizer to use in each watering, but I don't know how to translate their recommendations for organic soils into a hydro-esque setup like mine, I know it's different when there's no accumulation of the fertilizer but don't know how to do the #'s to figure it out (am currently thinking to just do what I'm doing *but* have 1 specimen that gets 50% more than the rest, and keep upping my fert% in the water until the 50%-more specimen starts showing signs of over-fertilization, at which point I should have a pretty good idea of the concentration to use, and it's easy to just flush-out the over-fertilized specimen so no real risk, but a many-weeks trial&amp;error approach sucks and I'd really like to figure this out the right way!)

I'm in WA so there are no state or local taxes and my effective federal tax rate is about 14%, so my gain on the 401(k) investment is 14% plus any interest earned up front, though that savings would be taxable at retirement (though possibly at a lower effective rate, depending on how well I do at saving for retirement).",finance

Looking for a quick sanity check and want to know if it is worth it to finally speak to a financial adviser / tax accountant of some kind to get some advice on setting up a bit of relief. I want to be pro-active and am beginning to think I'm not managing my money as well as I could be.

I'm in my mid/late 20's and make 85K+ base, and feel like I am just getting hammered on my taxes due to the fact that I have no children, house, etc. I feel like this scenario of responsible young professional gets it really badly come tax season and I'm fed up enough to start planning for  tricks and purchases to increase my deductions. Should I just become a dipshit and pump out some children like other morons I grew up with. Literally a large reason we are in no rush to get married is tax purposes, I mean what is this world.

I claimed a 1/1 and ended up owing my state $2,000 extra on my taxes. I've been essentially phased out of claiming my student loan interested debt and that was all I really had in terms of deductions aside from some extra 401 / HSA investments. 

I suppose first thing I guess I need to change my State Filing status to be a 0, but even then I am pretty sure I will still owe my state money at the end of the year.  My live-in gf has a similar situation except that she owns the house we live in, and she is getting a whopping total of around $3500K back between state/federal and that all seemed to have come from the house taxes.

Am I in the point of my life where I should be speaking to somebody about how to better serve and protect my money?  I should complete my student loans this year and have agreed to pay half of my parents remaining PLUS loans, but am close to being in a position to be able to invest into rentals, housing, larger focued investments, etc.  I do work from home full time and it's small things like that where I wonder if I can better be leveraging some tax laws (aka move my office into a 100% separate space than my gaming and claim it (have gf claim it her house idk, etc).

I hope this isn't coming across as venting or whining, but it almost feels like I'm doing something wrong here where I could claim a 0 and still owe my state $500-1K extra. I always use turbo tax but am wondering if having my taxes done by a professional would be worth it one time for a discussion and sanity check.

personalfinance,20yo filing taxes for the third time... but this year I owe $8?,"My question is simple, or at least I think it is.  In 2016, I made roughly $11000 from one job (federal tax withheld 546, state tax 225) and about $700 from another, more part time job.  The second job I had quit in 2015, but starting working again in 2016, halfway through the year.  I'm thinking they had my information on file and may have filled out a new W4 for me (?), but for some reason, the correct deductions weren't made.  I would never *not* pay taxes on my income, so that $700 was untaxed.

So, I thought I would be getting about $300 back, since I made roughly double what I did last year.  My parents claim me as a dependent, and they claim any education deductions/credits (even though I pay for it/have a scholarship).  I have used TurboTax every time I've filed, and it seems like all the right numbers went in, only this year I'm getting $8 back from the state, and I owe the federal government $16.

I don't understand why I'm getting nothing back--besides having a fucked-up W4 for my second job.  But that's the minority of my income.  Prior to adding the second W2 info, I stood to get slightly less than $100 back, which I still didn't understand.

It's not a dire situation; I wasn't banking on getting anything back, I'm mostly just confused on how it all works.",finance
personalfinance,"Thinking of buying a home in the later part of the year with a parent, though I would hypothetically only have about 3 months of work history. Is this feasible?","My family has never owned a home, and just recently my dad has decided that we finally deserve one. As much as I would love to buy a home and live somewhere I could call my own with my family, would it be feasible to actually buy one depending on our current circumstance?

My parents have never been good with money, especially my dad. Currently, they are not doing so well in the credit department because my dad was injured at work and was out for almost a year. Bills piled on and his credit took a hit. As of now, theyve been working on bringing down the credit cards ($4K+); I told them to pay off half of the balance every month until the balance is zero, not to pay it all at once. This will most likely be done with our tax returns and should be able to be covered by summer time.

The plan is to start looking around mid-july early august since his credit score would most likely recover to be around 700. He only makes about $42k a year (though he has been working alot of over time and could bump it up to almost $50K) but has been at this job for almost 6 years. As for me, I am currently finishing up my graduate degree and plan on getting a job in June (hoping for something around $50-60k; but conservatively $40k). My credit score is currently at 700 with no derogatory terms but I will be graduating with a total of $100k in loans. 

Our plan was cosigning on a mortgage to have combined wages and credit scores to be able to afford a home we would want to live in as well as get the best mortgage interest rate. If its of any importance, we would like to buy a 2 unit so that we could live in one floor but rent out the second. What would be our options in buying a home, if any?",finance
personalfinance,"Owe $2000 in federal taxes for 2016, also have $2000 in credit card debt. What is best way to manage this?","In June I started a job making $56,000 a year. Today I learned that I unwittingly marked myself as ""exempt"" when filling out my W4, and my online tax service says I now owe $2000 in federal taxes for 2016. I also currently have $2000 in credit card debt at a 9.90% interest rate, $500 in emergency funds, personal Roth and Traditional IRAs, and an employer-sponsored-but-non-matching 457(b).

I changed my W4, put a pause on my non-matching retirement contributions, am eeking out all possible deductions I can think of, and am trying to figure out my other options at this point. It's possible I can save $4000 by April 15th, but not likely.

Option 1: Pay the taxes first as soon as I get $2000 and pay minimal credit card payments in the meantime.

Option 2: Pay off the credit card balance first, shoot for $2000 by April 15th, and use my emergency money and/or a tax payment plan if I fall short.

Option 3: Put $2000 towards a retirement plan before April to qualify for the savers credit of 10% of retirement contributions, then pay the taxes and minimal credit card payments, using emergency savings/repayment plan if necessary. My adjusted gross income is currently showing as $32,750, which is $2000 over the limit to qualify for the saver's credit. In 2016 I put $800 towards my 457(b) and $500 towards my Roth IRA, so with a $2000 contribution, I believe the credit would be for $330, resulting in taxes owed of $1670. 

Option 4: Another solution I have not considered.",finance
personalfinance,I'm so sick and tired of people trying to tell me they're going to make a huge profit on their house.,"So I wanted people to understand how home ownership really works.  Firstly, there is no such thing as making a profit on a house UNLESS you flip houses for a living or are a real estate agent.  Secondly, if you can barely afford a house or ""you'll just figure it out,"" you can't actually afford a house.  Lastly, just to be clear, home ownership is not a nonstop orgasm.  I don't know where people are getting this notion that once they have a house it will be non-stop excitement and smooth sailing from there on out.  Houses require maintenance all the time, so if you're not putting away 25% more than your paying for your house each month where will that money for maintenance come from? Nowhere. TADA!
 
When you buy a house you're not actually buying a house; what you're really doing is renting it from the bank until the very last payment you make on it.  Even after this last payment you still don't really own it because you must continue to pay taxes on it every year and if you don't it can get taken away from you.
 
Here is how mortgage payments work: Let's say you have a $250,000 loan for thirty years at a 5% interest rate. You pay interest on what's left of what you owe on the house which makes up approximately 80% of the payments for the first year and goes down very, very slowly over the course of the thirty-year loan.  This means that if you have your house for a decade you've only paid about $46,800 in principal (the money that actually goes towards buying the house) and $114,000 in interest (the fee you pay the bank for allowing you to borrow their money) in 33% of the loan's time period (http://www.amortization-calc.com ).  Therefore, you have paid tens of thousands of dollars in interest that don't even go into owning your home!  If, at this point, you decide to sell your home – let's say, for 20% more than the original value, assuming you can even get that for it - you have actually lost $64,000.  Now you have sold the house for a horrible loss: You still owe the bank $203,200, which they will gladly take when you sell the house, you still have to find another place to live, and odds are you thought you could afford a better house with the money you lost (made?).  Remember, you still have to PAY to live somewhere, and when you thought you were making money, you actually lost a lot.
 
One last thing to remember: The bank is basically taking ALL the risk and reaping ALL of the reward. The bank owns that house 100% until you pay every last penny. My advice? Unless you plan on living in that house forever and NOT selling it, then don't buy a house. It is not an investment which you can make money on and only works in your favor if you stay in that same house until retirement and then do not have to worry about paying rent. I personally rent an apartment and everything and I mean EVERYTHING is included in the rent, very thorough landscaping, a very well maintained pool, plowing, a nice gym with all the weights and cardio machines and best of all HASSLE-FREE maintenance. If you can't afford all of the things listed that would apply to you house and any other surprise costs (medical bills, car maintenance, etc.) then you cannot afford a house.

**EDIT**: The part about saving 25% on top of your mortgage is intended to be only until you have a lump sum sufficient to handle some tough maintenance.  I remember spending $10k in one year living with my parents to replace the oil heater, replace the roof (it's a 6 unit condo so it was spread out over the six units),  and some other maintenance crap I can't remember.",finance

personalfinance,Is my employer correctly accounting for insurance premiums in my taxable income calculation for my W2?,"I have always thought that my employer is calculating my taxable income incorrectly, but have never been able to find information online to verify.

Because I opt out of employer paid health insurance, I receive half of the amount that my employer would pay for health insurance as premium sharing to be applied towards dental, vision, and AD&amp;D insurance premiums. Let's call this amount of premium sharing P. This is in addition to my normal salary, which I'll call S.

On my paystubs, I see a ""total gross"" pay which is S+P. However, ""fed taxable gross"" (which is also the amount on my W2), is calculated as S-P. So my federal taxable income is my salary **minus** premium sharing (which is paid on top of my salary, not taken from my salary).

It seems to me that the taxable income should be the gross income (S+P) minus the premiums, so just S (my salary).

As it is calculated currently, when my insurance premiums increase (which they recently did), I actually end up being paid **more** each paycheck because my taxable income decreases. This seems totally bizarre to me.

Does anyone know anything about this? Should my premium sharing, which is paid on top of my regular salary, be deducted from my salary for calculating my taxable income? Or should it be deducted from my gross salary (which includes premium sharing) leaving my taxable income as my base salary?",finance

-Put it all on credit cards (I have $55k in credit, so it is possible without maxing out everything)

personalfinance,A few questions about trying to rebuild my credit,"A few years ago (2008) I was sent to Collections for avoiding to pay a hospital bill. I think the statute of limitations for that in my state is 4 years. Can I get a credit card now or would that still affect me? Basically is it worth it?

I think the best option for me with bad to no credit is a secured credit card that reports to the three credit agencies. Is the best option the Capital One Secured Credit Card? I know you have to pay, but I can afford to do so if it's guaranteed and if it just works as advertised.

Also when paying a credit card (with the intent to raise my credit), should I pay the complete payment before the due date or should I pay some and let it spill over?

personalfinance,Should I dip into my savings to reduce my mortgage?,"Hello all,
 
I currently have a 285K euros mortgage to pay in 18.5 years (20 years initially) at a fixed rate of 2.4%. I also have ~60K in savings that I could use to reduce the mortgage or invest somewhere.  I’ve already deducted a certain amount to cover for at least 6 months of normal expenditure in case I lose my job.
 
My savings are literally sitting in a French bank account gaining nothing (0%).  
 
Few things to consider:
 
- The mortgage is for a property that I bought and rented in France (I am an expat at the moment). In France, we get to deduct the interest rates when we rent a property that is still under a mortgage. If I put those 60K in the mortgage, that would reduce my interest rates and therefore increase my annual tax of about 800-1000 euros. 

- Current rent doesn't cover the mortgage. I have to pay roughly 350 euros every month from my pocket. Reducing the mortgage would fix this (assuming I decide to reduce the monthly payments).

- I am currently saving 35-40K / year.  Eventually, I could wait another couple of years and invest in a new property.

- I have zero knowledge about stock markets and investments, so it is not immediately clear for me where I should invest that money (outside trying to buy a new property to rent). 
 
Questions:
 
- Should I pay off my mortgage or keep saving and try to invest in a new property?

- In case I decide to pay the mortgage, should I reduce the monthly payments or reduce the number of years left? What is the most logical option?  I am guessing that reducing the monthly payments is the most sensible thing to do, but that also means a higher mortgage cost.
 
Any advice is welcome,
 
Thanks!",finance

Right now, I attend a state-sponsored University, so basically it is about $10-20k more expensive than the traditional state school, but half the price of a private college. Right now I'm paying about $18,000 in tuition and fees, and that's without factoring in the cost of living here or commuting (it's about an hour away from where I live, so realistically I could commute and I have at one point but hated it). I have only been going here for a year (got my gen eds done at CC) and I'm already about $35.5k in student loan debt, with about $10k of that in Sallie Mae loans. I'm in a financial situation where for the next 2.5 years until I graduate, I will have to take out about $12.5k a year in federal student loans, so I'll be an estimated  $60.5k in federal loan debt by the time I graduate. 

I have to rely on loans because I have absolutely no help from my parents. I signed my private loans, I work for every penny to live in an apartment off campus, etc. 

I'm an Information Science &amp; Tech major, which will hopefully get me a job in a promising field that pays me enough to afford the loans I have NOW - but the idea of paying back so much money makes me worried. 

At the school I'm at now, I'd most likely have to continue to take out about $5k a year in Sallie Mae loans or more if I live here, which have about a 9% interest rate (for me) and a 5 year payoff period. I've commuted before, but like I said before, I hated it. My other option is perhaps transferring to Penn State's world campus which is completely online. There, my tuition would work out to around $15k (probably a little less) and I could work more and live at home, which would help offset the cost. I think that my state grant would also offset that out of pocket cost as well.

&gt; **15 Vitalik Buterin, Wanxiang**

&gt; One of the most regular expectations from corporate venturers is there will be more cross-sector
&gt; collaboration and innovative ideas funded.
&gt; The poster child for how this can happen involves China-based auto parts maker Wanxiang, which has set
&gt; up a $50m corporate venturing fund, Fenbushi Capital, which means distributed in Mandarin Chinese, in
&gt; collaboration with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born, Canada-reared, Switzerland-residing cofounder of blockchain platform Ethereum.
&gt; Buterin is the technical person behind the Ethereum foundation promoting blockchain
&gt; technologies and decentralized contracts. He is also working on a non-proft, Blockchain
&gt; Labs, Buterin co-founded with Bo Shen, who also co-founded the decentralized exchange, or
&gt; trading platform, BitShares, through his Invictus Innovations company, and Feng Xiao, vicechairman and executive director of Wanxiang Holdings, the auto parts company’s investment
&gt; unit, and founder of the Bosera mutual fund company.
&gt; And the three are all general partners in Fenbushi, which has backed Factom, Everledger,
&gt; ZCash, Abra, Circle, Tierion, Gem, Otonomos and Symbiont, according to its website, and
&gt; reportedly Ethcore.
&gt; Blockchain, best known for being the underlying technology of digital currency Bitcoin, is a
&gt; cryptographic public ledger that enables verifed, instant and low-cost transactions.
&gt; Wanxiang expects to provide $1m of funding in each of the next three years to blockchain
&gt; research through Blockchain Labs, which was instrumental in the creation of ChinaLedger, an
&gt; alliance of regional commodity exchanges, equity exchanges and fnancial asset exchanges.
&gt; In September, the Ethereum Foundation and Wanxiang’s Blockchain Labs held a joint

&gt; At the conference, Feng introduced a way of using the blockchain to track car batteries and monitor their

Before we got married he had perfect credit, and so was able to get a credit card with a limit of $16,000 shortly after we financed a used vehicle. We used it to pay for some stuff for our wedding, but he kept me in the dark, saying that we could afford everything. As far as I knew, everything that we used that card to pay for would have totalled maybe $8000.

Flash forward six months later, and suddenly he tells me that he can't pay for anything with it anymore because it is maxed out. Baffled, I asked what he had used it for, and he said there was nothing out of the ordinary on it, that I had underestimated how much everything cost. (This was shortly after we got married)

Being newlyweds, and with me having a little debt of my own from before we got married that I have been working toward paying off, we had been making the minimum payments on his card. I thought that the balance was going down, slowly but surely, and that once my debt was paid we could concentrate on his. My husband would never let me look at the balance of his credit card for myself, but would give me a rough estimate of what was on it.

Yesterday, however, I got fed up and decided to take his card in the middle of the night and look up the balance myself. To my shock, it was nearly $17,000. As it turned out, the payments we were making had been only enough to cover the balance and the insurance for the card, but not to pay down the debt itself. For almost a year our money has been getting nowhere. Furthermore, my husband had lied about what was on the card. My estimate about what we had bought together had been correct, and he bought a bunch of stuff with it without me knowing.

My husband does have a small RRSP totalling $13,000. Should we use that to pay part of our debt, or leave it alone and work to pay it off?

Right now I'm shocked and angry, and just wondering how to go from here. Obviously, there are some relationship issues that need to be worked through, but I am asking for advice with our debt. I want to pay it down but it seems like a mountain that we'll never get through. Any advice would be helpful!

Some background info:
My husband works full time and has $17,000 in debt. He does have $13,000 in RRSPs. I am in school full time right now, but have only 6 more courses to complete after this term. I have about $7,000 of debt (all from before we met - I wasn't the smartest teenager), plus some student loans to be paid once I have graduated. We definitely don't live beyond our means, yet our budget is tight at the moment.

Edit: Thanks for your replies everyone! Some of your advice is very useful.

In answer to some of your questions:

The majority of his spending that I didn't know about was fast food. Sometimes two or three times a day, in spite of the lunch he took along. There are a couple cash withdrawals, but it doesn't look like anything habitual.

The card is in my husband's name. 

Currently we make about $3500 a month altogether. About a third of that goes to rent, a third goes to debt repayment, and we live on the rest. Until a few months ago I was pretty lenient about budgeting, but have since made one up and we stick to it. We may not have lived within our means before, but we sure do now.",finance
personalfinance,Is $483k too much to spend on a house? And should I be buying a house at all?,"Hello,

Background:

I am married, my wife and I are around 28 years old and have income that totals ~$130k per year before tax, and ~$44k in student loans at a monthly payment of ~$510.  We have no other debt.  We live within a couple of miles of New York City and she works in the city, while I work in NJ.  We have $50k in cash (accruing 3.5% interest in an interest bearing checking account) and $60k in invested  retirement savings.  Currently we are renting an apartment for $1425 per month in a not so pretty part of NJ near NYC.  We have no kids but want to have kids soon.

We are in the process of buying a free standing single family house for $483k with $24.5k down payment 30 year mortgage at a fixed interest rate of 3.375%.  taxes are $11.5k yearly, PMI is $150 per month, homeowners insurance is $55 per month.  This is in a very nice neighborhood in NJ with good schools where renting a similar place would cost $2500 per month or so.

I just want to know, is this too much to spend? Is it unwise? Will my finances feel tight?  What would you advise someone to do in my situation?  Help from people who have dealt with expensive urban environments is especially appreciated.

Thanks for any help.

personalfinance,Hypothetical bonus question on 401k/IRA/student loans?,"Hi everyone, 

I look at this sub all the time &amp; just wanted to ask a question on a hypothetical bonus. 

Say you have this amount in student loans to pay each month: 
1) Student loan with mixed interest of 3%-6% at around 26k ish left to pay off and $320 monthly payment 
2) Student loan with interest rate of 9.5% at around 7k ish left to pay off and $72 monthly payment 
3) Student loan with interest rate of 9.25% at around 10k ish left to pay off and $114 monthly payment 

Contributions: 
1) You contribute 5% to 401k to get your 4% full match from employer (this equals about $270 per month contribution) 
2) You have not started an IRA
3) You have an emergency fund (~10k) 

Now, let's say you are in finance or sales or earn commission in some way fairly regularly, but you have closed something large (or whatever) and will receive a bonus check of around 17k-19k after taxes. 

Out of these scenarios, which would you pick (also open to other suggestions and smarter scenarios)? 

1. Pay off $17k student loans (total of loans #2 and #3) and utilize new cash flow of $186 per month to increase 401k to above 10%
2. Pay off full $17k student loans (total of loans #2 and #3) and utilize new cash flow of $186 per month to fund IRA + other savings toward IRA since you will not have enough for a full contribution right away (401k contribution remains same)
3. Pay off about half of student loans #2 and #3 (or some other percentage) and then increase 401k % to your new cash flow increase amount 
4. Pay off full $17k student loans (total of loans #2 and #3) and utilize new cash flow of $186 per month to just put into savings (keep in mind you already have an emergency fund, but maybe you want to beef that up as well as just have a larger savings)
5. Don't pay off any of student loans (continue regular payments) and fully fund an IRA for the year, increase 401k to 10%, put the rest into regular savings

Questions--

Would the payoff amount of #2 + #3 in loans even be around 17k or would it be much more due to interest payoff as well? I've looked into this, but it always just says ""consult our customer service #"" on the student loan website and I've never called? 
If you went with scenario 3, is this how it even works AKA do payments per month actually decrease or does your student loan payoff time just adjust (instead of paying off these loans for another 10 years it is cut down to x amount of years?


**I don't think anything else is entirely relevant in this scenario (yearly income, other bills, etc), but please let me know if you need any other information!! 

Thanks so much guys!",finance

personalfinance,Direct deposit/debit rejected for tax refund.,"Doing my taxes independently for the first time, and I filed on TurboTax roughly 2 weeks ago and opted for the direct deposit/debit option. I am due a federal refund and an Illinois refund, and I am scheduled to pay a small amount to Wisconsin for freelance work.

I checked the IRS Refund Tracker tool today to get an update on the federal, and after plugging in my info I received this:

""We are sending you a check to the address shown on your tax return because your bank returned the direct deposit of your refund.""

I don't know where the Illinois refund stands, but I imagine there will be the same issue. I'm almost certain I typed in the correct routing number and bank account number, but could there be another issue?

personalfinance,FedLoan gave me retroactive forebearance but refuses to remove late payments from credit reports. Anything I can do?,"Hey, Personal Finance.

I'm confused.

June and July of 2014 I should have been in deferment on my FedLoans. August and September of 2014  I should have been in forebearance.

FedLoan acknowledged the mistake and put a retroactive forebearance on my account in October of 2014 after I called them.

Last night I check my credit reports. 3 different FedLoans have 30, 60, and 90 days late reported from June 2014 to September 2014.

I called FedLoan today and they said they can't go back and correct late payments because the FCRA says they aren't allowed because it was my mistake that I wasn't in forebearance. In addition, they allegedly read me a script that I agreed to in October 2014 that says they cannot go back and correct any missed payments.

In total, there are 12 late payments from FedLoan during the time in question.

Is there any way I can get FedLoan to remove these late payments? I asked if I should send a goodwill letter and he said they don't do those anymore and he read another script in the FCRA that explains they don't make goodwill adjustments.

Am I screwed, and therefore stuck with these late payments?",finance

personalfinance,Have lots of outstanding student debt? Think twice before doing AmeriCorps...,"**Tl;dr:** AmeriCorps interest payments and the Segal Education Award are counted as taxable income in the year they're disbursed. If you have six figures of student loan debt (not uncommon for those with grad degrees), you could be in for a nasty surprise come tax season. I ended up with a tax bill of $4k, which is hard to afford when you're working in a low paid public interest position.

As I wrap up filing my taxes, I just wanted to put this PSA out there for folks considering doing public service in an AmeriCorps position. I was part of the inaugural class of ""justice AmeriCorps"" members--recent law grads representing indigent children in immigration court. I graduated from law school with well over 100k in debt. The AmeriCorps position has very low pay for a first year attorney, however one of the 'perks' is that you can place your loans in forbearance during your AmeriCorps service. At the end of your service, AmeriCorps will pay off the accrued interest. You are also given a lump sum award of about $5k to put towards education loans of your choice. 

Sounds like a great deal, right? Well, it's obvious that this scheme wasn't designed with higher education graduates in mind... 

The problem is that Federal law specifically treats both the interest payment and the lump sum award as taxable income in the year they're disbursed. This isn't a huge issue for those with smaller loan balances. But for law school grads, where it's not uncommon for interest to accrue at $10-15k per year, you're looking at a potentially huge increase to your Adjusted Gross Income after AmeriCorps makes the interest payment on your behalf. The increase is even higher if you then use the lump sum to make additional payments.

In my case, the AmeriCorps payments added an additional 16k to my 2016 AGI, which increased my tax liability by about 4k. Not an easy thing to pay off on you're already trying to get by on a meager public interest salary.

If I were wiser, I would NOT have put my loans into forbearance and instead, just have made minimum payments on IBR while letting the interest continue to accrue (but not capitalize). This plan makes sense for someone on the path towards ten-year public service loan forgiveness, since you're not taxed on the forgiven amount. 

I know there are a lot of aspiring social justice warriors out there who want to do good. I support people going into the public interest, however if you're considering an AmeriCorps position I would make sure you're able to afford the tax consequences of the 'award,' in addition to living on a very small stipend for the period of your service. You're going to have a hard time helping others if you're stuck in a financial mess yourself.",finance
personalfinance,"CAN - advice, how to utilize $100K.","Hi,

Long story short, inlaws want to give us $100k as an interest free loan.  We would pay them back $1000 a month until the debt was paid off.

We have a $375k mortgage and no other major debt.  The mortgage term runs to June 2018, interest rate is %2.15.  

The options we thought of were;

1 - buy a rental property with the $100k - rent would cover the mortgage and the $1000/month in law repayment.

2 - put this money into our mortgage, paying the principal down, but keeping the amortization the same (12 years, 10 months) so we could afford to give them the $1000/month.

I'm leaning towards option 1 as I don't see any major benefit to option 2.  The amortization period stays the same and I'm out of pocket the same amount of money each month.  

Any other options?",finance

I live in NYC and earn 200K/yr with a potential bonus at the end of the year.  Rent is currently $2400/mo but have seen a 5% every year.

Last year, I finished paying off my student loans of ~90k.  I paid it off in about a year and a half (interest rate was 6.8% or so; I never re-financed.)

Last year, I also started putting the maximum contribution of 18k in my 401k.  (Probably should've started earlier.)

I live very frugally.

Currently, I have saved about $70k, which I keep in a savings account that bears 1.0% interest.  At the rate I'm going, I am on target to have about $150-160k by the end of the year.

I can only see myself keeping this job for another year or two, before I see myself taking an easier job that pays ~$100k. 

As a priority, home ownership is important to me, but I don't want to buy in NYC.  I want to buy a home or condo in the next 2 years in TX in the $250k range.  Don't know if it's worth considering doing an all-cash purchase or taking on a mortgage.

I am generally very risk adverse.

1. Should I consider opening an Betterment or Vanguard account?  Can I withdraw this money without penalty at any time (say, to buy a home?)

2. If I change jobs next year, should I consider moving the money [$36k] from my 401k into my next retirement savings account?

3. Should I consider doing an all-cash purchase on a home?

SO had the idea to get 2 personal loans and try to pay off some things like our house, his motorcycle, his student loans, cars, and the credit card. The loans have a 3.5% interest rate and costs us $192 a month. However, $20K hardly seemed to put a dent in anything as our debt keeps increasing.

He has a major spending problem regarding cars, crafts, and tools for working on our house. The 2016 summary on the credit card showed us spending $26K+. We use the card for anything we can, though.

We've been making payments on time for all of the bills and some months we even pay twice on the credit card, averaging $1,800 each time we pay, however it feels like I'm still drowning in this debt. We got a super cheap and crappy house because it was supposed to save us money versus buying a traditional house, but it instead triggered a spending spree by my SO that shows no signs of abating.

2. Limit alcohol and pop
3. Reign in grocery shopping
4. We never go out to clubs, shopping, theme parks, etc. Stay inside pretty much all the time.
5. He will be selling his 2 cars and motorcycle as well

## Recent financials 

Looking at the topline, sales haven't really gone anywhere in years, though in the current interest rate environment, that's hardly a shock.

Earnings have recovered nicely, though that's a bad debts have returned to a more manageable level. And the dividend has bounced back nicely too!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $86bn | $84bn | $84bn | $86bn | $81bn|
|EPS | $4.12 | $4.10 | $3.89 | $2.82 | $2.21|
|DPS | $1.48 | $1.35 | $1.15 | $0.88 | $0.48|

But if we start looking at some of the ratios, tracking performance, it's not so pretty. Yes, returns on assets and equity have recovered, but they seem to have plateaued.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Return on assets | 1.31% | 1.45% | 1.51% | 1.41% | 1.25%|
|Return on equity | 12.6% | 13.4% | 13.9% | 13.0% | 11.9%|

And if we look at the first 9 months of 2016... revenues up 3%, EPS down 3%, RoA down 11%, RoE down 9%. And the preliminary full year figures didn't excite either.

## Competition / Regulation

There's a usual list of suspect when it comes to competition, and it's fair to say there are small regional banks that compete with them too. But I suspect the bigger issue / catalyst is regulation:

&gt; Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

And it's not just about Dodd-Frank (which Mr Trump POTUS hates) but there is Basel III forcing banks to have better capital buffers too.

That aside, the RoE of Wells Fargo is nice *nice* compared with the rest of the US industry. In fact firms like GS and MS have had terrible metrics (though you'd not know it looking at their stock prices)!

## Cash / Debt?

""Debt?"" isn't really the right question for banks... but what are the leverage ratios. Regulators expect them to have a 9.125% total capital ratio. i.e. to have no more loans out to clients that 11x the equity and permanent funding they've on their books. 

At Sept 2016 the equity/capital buffer was comfortably higher at 15.4% i.e. WFC is lending just 6.5 times it's capital base.

Nice... especially since they have better returns than their peers too.

## Wall Street says...

The professionals on Wall Street have a $57.98 for Wells Fargo &amp; Co and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. Unsurprise, since that's were the stock is today.

# Valuation

Looking at the PE ratio, at 14x it's at the top of the mega-bank pack. Though frankly, there's not a lot of a spread.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/wfc/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
WFC | $291,896M | 14x | 7% | 3% 
BAC | $247,094M | 14x | 9% | 2% 
C | $172,067M | 12x | 7% | 1% 
GS | $99,190M | 13x | 13% | 1% 
JPM | $323,940M | 14x | 6% | 2% 
MS | $86,356M | 13x | 12% | 2% 
USB | $93,499M | 16x | 5% | 2% 
RY.TO | C$147,344M | 14x | 5% | 3% 
TD.TO | C$128,711M | 13x | 8% | 3% 

Imagine, WFC has traded between 11 and 14x earnings the last 2 years. The highest anyone's got is 16x. So it feels like we are near the top on the valuation side.

# Dividends

Wells Fargo &amp; Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.57 per share which compares to a forecast EPS of $4.19.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 10% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. That 4% boost is mainly as we've moved from 2016 forecasts to 2017.

It's pretty remarkable to see the stock doing so well, with 2016 actually a down year and 2017 forecast to be a 3% EPS boost. In fact, it's not until 2018 that there's any forecast material Trumpian benefit, with a 10% EPS boost forecast.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers the only think that stood out to me were talks of continued branch closures, headwinds, and expense ratios coming in at the high end. 

But the market's not cared. Tally ho Mr T. 

So, am I worried for Wells. Not really, but I ain't buying today. It feels like the whole banking industry, is being given the benefit of the doubt. And if there's one think we should have learnt by now, is not to trust these folks!

Bitcoin,Heads up: Alloya Federal Credit Union is refusing all transfers to Gemini!,"Fourth (final?) update (3/5):
Opened an account with SunTrust (h/t /u/ytrfd) and transferred 95% of my money to them. Just keeping the credit union for smaller bills that have to be paid in fiat.

Third update (2/22):
I called both Signature Bank and Metropolitan, Signature didn't have much of a problem with it but I have to go into a branch to open an account. Metropolitan seems like a bad choice, in my case. They said I'd still have to wire the money to Coinbase's account (wtf?) and it would cost $40(!) per wire.

Second update:
I just heard from my credit union, this time Alloya clarified they won't process any Bitcoin-related transactions. Time to pull my money!

I've been doing semi-weekly buys at Gemini via Wire Transfers for the past six months. Never a word or even a question from my (small, local) credit union about the transfers.

Today I get a call saying Alloya (their wire processor) is now refusing all wires to Gemini! I asked if they banned all Bitcoin-related transfers and the employee didn't know. Guess I'll have to try a wire to Coinbase on Tuesday. :(

Does anyone know of a bank or credit union that would be OK with such transfers?

EDIT: I'm going to check into an account with Signature New York (which is Gemini's bank) or Metropolitan Commercial Bank (Coinbase's bank, they have personal accounts too). If I can open accounts there I'll see if Coinbase or Gemini would allow no-fee transfers as it's in the same bank. I'll post an update with my findings.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need help with newly financed car,"Hi,

I am currently 19 making $15/hour (40+ hour weeks guaranteed, job has peak seasons so during the summer time will be 50-60+ hours) with $2,000 saved up (down payment on car set me back a bit) while living relatively cheap. I live with my parents and only pay $200 for ""rent"" monthly. I do not pay my car insurance and I am still on their policy for auto and health. My monthly expenses are $200 (rent) + $413 (car) + $100 (food), so $713. I will bring in $31,200 before taxes annually with gradual raises throughout the years. The car in discussion is a 2016 Dodge Charger SXT with 32,600 miles on it. Monthly payment is $413 with an interest rate of 3.00%.

My previous car was a 2012 Chrysler 200 S with 40,000 miles on it and that was $256 monthly, but during the year I had that car I had 2 major engine repairs that made me anxious in keeping it for long-term so I traded that in to only go upside down by $1,000 on the Charger, but I digress.

Originally, my plan was to pay $650 towards the payment for 2+/- years, refinance to get a lower payment and then move out. I buy things on impulse so at the moment of the purchase I felt great about the decision but now thinking back, I'm not too keen on the price. Trade-in value is around $13,000 to $17,000 as the internet says. 

Long wall of text but I'm just looking for advice/reassurance. I've been lurking here and trying to improve my financial situation but not sure what would be the best route here. Either bite the bullet and trade it in for a lower-end car? Or just continue to live cheap and go with my original plan.

So, monthly expenses are ~$713 with food and car payment being added. If I go with the refinance-later-down-the-road plan, it will be ~$950.

Any advice would be great. I understand the decision was financially irresponsible but since I am living somewhat cheap, I figured at the time it wasn't bad. Not anymore.",finance
personalfinance,HSA Last Month Rule Confusion,"I enrolled in a HDHP during the Federal Open Season on December 11, 2016. Accordingly, my HSA was created before the end of the 2016 calendar year, but medical coverage did not switch over until January 2017. 

My HSA provider allowed me to deposit the full $3350 contribution limit for 2016 in February 2017.

After starting my taxes, I was informed about the Last Month Rule which states:

""[The Last-month rule] allows eligible individuals to make a full contribution for the year even if they were not an eligible individual for the entire year. They can make the full contribution for the year if:

1. They are eligible individuals on the first day of last month of their taxable year. For most people this would be December 1, and

2. They remain eligible individuals during the testing period. The testing period runs from December 1 of the current year through December 31 of the following year (for calendar taxpayers).""

Statement 1 suggests to me that I am not allowed to make the full 2016 contribution to my HSA, but the thing is when I called my HSA provider and asked them about this, they said as long as I enroll in an HDHP and make a contribution to the HSA by April 18, 2017, and stay enrolled for the entire year, I am allowed to meet the full contribution limit for 2016.

personalfinance,28k in liquid assets what should I do with it?,"So I am looking to purchase a house in Minneapolis sometime this spring and am looking for a max $250k purchase price. So far there is not much on the market and I probably won't locate a house till march sometime.

I am looking to purchase a house both to build equity and because I want a space that is mine to do what I want with, I want a yard and garage for a workshop. I also want a permanent base of operations. All things I don't get renting.

Right now I have about 14k in my savings account and 14k in my checking account. I am planning on using the savings account as my down payment and my checking for closing costs and for other things that you need when you buy a house, new washer dryer lawn mower and such things.

I do have some student loans, those are detailed below:

| Interest rate | Loan amount | Monthly Payment |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 3.15%         | 7k          | $150            |
| 3.5%          | 21k         | $150            |

I am in a good place finances wise, more money coming in than going out. I just need to figure out how to use the money I have in the best way possible.

So at this point I have some options as I see it.

1. Increase my down payment and decrease liquid cash.
1. Wait to purchase a house and do something with my money to grow it
1. Pay off my student loans some more.
1. Save some money for retirement with an IRA 
 * I don't like this option since I am already putting money away, and have other more immediate things I want to spend the money on, but I am willing to be convinced

Notes: 

* I don't have an emergency fund (besides my large amount of liquid cash).
* I am already matching 5% of my income into a retirement fund
* If I have missed any crucial bits of information please let me know.
* I don't have a car of any sort so I won't have any unexpected expenses of a car sort.

And then we get to questions:

1. Did I miss any options?
1. Is one of them clearly better a better option?
1. What should I do?

personalfinance,Dismissed from job bc lived overseas.,"Long story short, I lived abroad for a decade, came back a year and a half ago and transitioned into a new career.

After a year learning my new trade at various companies, I was recruited for a job with a federal contractor and got the job. Prior to my hire, I submitted fingerprints for a federal background check.

I performed this job successfully for about a month and a half and then I received a call from the contractor.  I was told the federal agency I worked with could not clear me for work because I had spent more than 6 months out of the country in the last 5 years. 

Well, fuck me.

I appealed with the federal agency to no avail and my appeal was denied. I found out my appeal was denied last week.

So, my 60k/year federal job is gone.

I applied with a few companies and I received an offer for 50k/ yr that I just accepted.  The thing that worries me with this job is that only 40k is in writing and the rest is in promised bonuses.

The same day I accepted this position, I was offered a 60k job guaranteed in writing.

The lower paying job is 5 minutes from my house, a local company that has recently been purchased by a national company. I feel there is a lot of upward mobility if I go with this position.

The 60k position is with a global company. Pay would be variable with a max of 70k.

I'm 44, semi-retired, married, renting with no debt. 

Even though I've accepted the lower paying position, I'm really conflicted. I feel the global company pay is more in line with what I will be doing.

personalfinance,Employer Provided Education Assistance Question,"Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening,

So my girlfriend is in grad school that has been paid in full by her employer for the last couple semesters. She was never given the money, the company paid the university directly. She did not have withholdings taken out, even though she was well over the $5250 limit for employer provided education benefit. 

Apparently for 2017, they are now going to be withholding from her paycheck for any education assistance benefits over that $5250 limit. According to her they are going to be withholding at some rate north of 40%. 

Now, when she gets her w-2 at the beginning of 2018 for FY17, the amount of education assistance benefit will be included in Box 1 (wages, tips, and other compensation), correct? And the 40 or so % that was withheld during the year for the education assistance benefit would be included in Box 2 (federal income tax withheld)? She should then get a tax return because the 40something% withheld is higher than her actual tax owed, correct?

Unfortunately she isn't the best at explaining the whole situation to me and apparently the whole company is in disarray because there has been no official paperwork to read to be able to understand the changes. They apparently just said, ""Hey, you guys are getting ""taxed"" on your education assistance now, it will be taken from your paychecks"".

With bitcoin, large balances lead to higher risk of attack and the need to diversify.

I've been given an opportunity to invest in my employer's fund, and would like to invest some of my family's (i.e. my parents') money in the fund since I just graduated and only have a little over $100k saved up.  
My parents have about $5-6 million in liquid assets, plan to work for at least 15 more years, invest current capital aggressively and are saving at a rate of ~$400k per year. If all goes well their estate will likely end up above the estate tax exemption of $10.9MM.  
We've decided we would like to put $250-300k of their money into my employer's fund for now and consider increasing that to $1 million later on. However, the fund only allows employees to invest in their own name, so my parents cannot directly invest in the fund.  
So far, we've come up with 2 ways to make the investment.  
The first way would be to just gift me the money up front and have the vast majority of it count against the lifetime gift exemption (which they are likely to surpass).  
The other option we've explored is to lend me the money (at the IRS' minimum interest rate) which would require me to pay interest to my parents, who would then have to pay taxes on that interest. We are a bit wary of engaging in something like this as it seems it could invite further scrutiny by the IRS and increase our chances of an audit, which would be a pain. Also, we are not sure of what paperwork to file for something like this, so it may involve further legal/accounting costs.  
As a family we truly share all our money, and none of us care personally whether the money is a gift or loan. We are strictly trying to do whats best for the family as a whole.  
Any thoughts on these 2 ideas or can you think of any better ways to structure this transaction?

personalfinance,"Just got a job after 6mo post-grad-school unemployment, trying to figure out best strategy to pay down CC and consolidate/refinance student loans (undergrad)","Howdy,

Couldn't find a similar situation via search, hoping someone has some thoughts to share to help me best navigate this. 

I just signed an offer letter for a new job, which will end about 6mo unemployment (which came after 4 years of grad school during which I depleted my previous savings). 

In those 6mo my credit score fell from ~765 to ~695 as I accumulated about $14k in credit card debt from living expenses. One card is maxed out, one is halfway maxed, and another has no balance. I also have about $28k in student loans (federal + private).

I would like to pay down CC debt ASAP, as well as refinance my student loans (probably through SoFi) since they are from 2009 and the interest rate is high 

**My question is: how should I proceed?** I am thinking to do a personal loan and a student loan refi, ASAP, but I could also move balances around and/or ask for a credit limit increase with my new income, and then wait for my score to recover before taking out these loans (and thereby get a lower interest rate). I believe this recovery will take a few months though, and so I would be paying interest in the meantime to save on interest over the life of the student loan (the personal loan I would be paying down hopefully within 12-14mo so interest would be less of a concern).

**Anyone have advice for how to calculate the cost of these two strategies, or a different strategy?**

personalfinance,My Aunt’s Student Loan Problem,"Hello Personal Finance- We need your help. My Aunt, a 50 year old Missourian, has an insurmountable 30,000 of federal student loan debt for an Associate's in Criminal Justice/ Certificate- Certified Nursing Assistant. 

Somewhat relevant background:

Her financial problems began in 2009,  when the factory she had worked for for 10 years closed its doors and moved to Mexico, and was not offered a position to follow the plant. She was offered a combination of two years severance/ unemployment and an opportunity to go to the local community college, but was limited to Computer Science, Criminal Justice, or General Education. She choose Criminal Justice, and then after accumulating almost enough credits to get her degree, started a CNA program at the college and got both an AS and Certificate. All in all, she currently owes 30,000- she ended up staying two years longer at half time due to needing to work and pay her mortgage. She is currently in default. 

We have determined that she qualifies for PSLF due to her employer’s status as a 501(c)3, and I am having her fill out the paperwork tomorrow. She has been eligible for 5 years, and I can’t believe nobody has told her this, and I’m honestly angry that she was afraid to ask for my help before it got this far.

Is she eligible for any forgiveness programs through the state of Missouri through her husband who is employed through the Missouri Dept. of Corrections? (It never hurts to ask when you’re in this deep).

The real question we have is Navient/Sallie Mae/Whatever they’re going by now, ""lost"" a $7000 lump sum payment she had made, and I have found the bank statements showing the payment and letters demanding this amount be paid in order to get her loans out of default, because she was cutting it too close to make payments, and was never told about IBR. After denying receiving it, they started garnishing her wages the very next week, and they told her after making 10 separate from the garnishment payments, they would remove her loans from default- and again, have failed to do so. 

She has turned to me with this because she is getting nowhere, and honestly, the first thing I thought of was to ask the ever-wise PF community. Should we file a CFPB complaint? File a complaint through myeddebt.gov?  Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Using 401(k) loan to meet 50% employer match and pay off some debt?,"Hi All,

I've done some research on 401k loans but no one seems to mention the possibility for someone like me whose employer matches 50% up to the federal maximum (eg you contribute 18k and they match 9k). 

Here is my current situation:
Age 24: 
Over the last 18 months I've contributed ~24k and have received ~12k in match. 
Current 401k Balance: ~38k 

Current debt: ~4k  
- Debt is on 0% APR credit card until September then 18.9%) 

My monthly expenses are just about equal to my monthly take home pay (after 401k contributions). I usually end up with plus or minus ~$50 a month. 

I've neglected my debt as I'm not completely matching my 401k which seems like a better investment decision given the 50% return compared to 18.9% interest on my credit card. 

I can currently take a loan out up to 50% of my 401k balance at a rate of 5.75%.

Lets say I take 12k out. 

4k payoff to debt 
8k increase to 2017 contributions 

I'm on track to contribute ~10k this year meaning I'm already making contributions of ~$833/month with the 8k increase I'm now making contributions of 1,500 a month so I would pay off the loan in 9 months or 6 months if employer match counts towards the payoff (I'm not sure if it counts or not?) 

In theory by year end, this would:  
- Pay off my debt     
- Contribute roughly the same amount to 401k by year end as I would if I continued my contributions and didn't pay my credit card debt off.  
- Would this reduce my taxable income? (probably not since year end contributions end up roughly the same?)

This all seems too good, what am I missing? 

Does Employer Match not count towards the payoff? Do I not get employer match on funds that are used to repay the loan?",finance

investing,Hedging Against Inflation and a Correction (At the Same Time),"Thesis for inflation:
Trump. All of the major initiatives suggest higher prices. Lower corporate and personal taxes, reforming the affordable care act, anti-globalization incentives and spending on defense. Clearly, he has demonstrated that he is willing to follow through on things over the first month and he has a Republican House and Senate to enable it. A secondary case for inflation would be simply looking historical charts of the US Dollar vs. the Euro and Canadian Dollar.

Thesis for a correction:
Everyone knows that stocks are over inflated but no one knows if it actually matters (as discussed in many other posts). Arguments against a correction for me are all different versions of a flight to assets in a world of low interest rates, the general idea being that there's no where else to go and this will not change any time soon. Having said this, I still worry about that bubble bursting in the medium term because of relatively new factors at play including rising interest rates, Trump, Brexit and the possibility of Frexit with Le Pen.

Medium term strategy: 
50% into EWC (iShares Canada ETF) and 50% in GLD (SPDR Gold ETF)

General thesis: 
The Canadian market is mostly an extension of the US market with a couple of mitigating factors such as currency differences and the importance of certain market segments like oil and gas. Getting into EWC seems like a good way to mirror the US market and to play USD vs. CAD at the same time. Gold would be the market counterbalance with the general idea being that as stocks go down gold prices go up (this may be the critical flaw in this thought process) while also hedging inflation. In summary, both would support a falling dollar and would be slightly weighted to rising stocks.

Questions:
- Do you share the concern around Trump driven inflation 1 month in?
- Do you think that inflation will outpace the effect of rising interest rates?
- Does anyone have other ideas for achieving the desired outcome a different way?

personalfinance,Repaying student loans,"Hey everyone, 

 If this isn't the forum for this, I will gladly move it. 

 I've been following for a while but can't seem to think of the best way for me to repay my loans. This sub has some great info, so I figured I'd ask for your help. 

  I currently have $40k in federal loans and $25k in private loans. $24k of my fed loans qualify for PSLF due to my job for the federal government. The other $16k were taken out before 2007 when PSLF started. I'm about 4 years into the 10 needed for forgiveness. But I think it'll only come out to about $5k in forgiveness total. 

  I am currently on the full standard repayment plan playing $763 for fed loans and paying the minimum payment of $213 on the private. I am thinking of switching to the IBR to lower my fed payment and upping my private payments. My interest rates are pretty decent. Fed interest varies between 2.4 and 6.55% and private is 5.1%. 

  A coworker said they their new strategy was to get his loans to the absolute minimum payment and up his TSP (401k) to the maximum amount.  The idea being that in the long run, the earnings from the maxed tsp would outweigh paying the low interest loans for a longer time. 

  I also thought about refinancing through a private lender, but the interest rates were about the same as I'm paying now. 

  I am horrible with numbers and financial strategy, so I turn to you much smarter people in my time of need! 

  Thank you in advance for any help.. This situation has been eating at me for quite some time.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on using tax refund to pay down my credit cards?,"I am refinancing my house, which should go through in April-May (after repairs are finished), and I will be able to pay off most of my credit cards with that money. But in the meantime I'd like to reduce my monthly payments on my credit cards by paying a bit off using my tax refund (about $2500). I'd like some advice on how much to pay down on each card. The payments for the first two cards are the biggest chunk out of my monthly income but I don't know if it's the wisest decision to pay the most on those or not.

My total debts on each card, with interest rates:

$11,869 (19.74 APR)
$8314 (25.49 APR)
$4394 (deferred interest until October)
$2470 (25.74 APR)

personalfinance,Choosing the best Student Loan Repayment Plan,"My student loans are about to come out of deferment and I am looking at choosing the correct repayment plan.  I am trying to decide the best route to take.  The basics:


Numbers are rounded:

Total Amount of loans - 45,000

Number of Loans - 9

Interest Rates - Vary between 3.4% and 6.8%


__________________________________________________________________________
Repayment Options

10 Year Level - $475 - (Total $56,500)

10 Year Graduated - $315 - $708 - (Total - $59,000)

10 Year Level - $265 - Total - ($79,000)

25 Year Graduated -  $200 - $425  - (Total $86,000)

I do not qualify for income based repayment and all plans are financially feasible.  At first glance, the obvious choice is the 10 year level as it will have the lowest overall cost.  


However, the loan servicer allows me to define where any excess payment is applied.  Because these loans have locked interest rates, wouldn't the wise choice be to choose the 25 year graduated plan and make payments equal to the 10 year plan and select where the excess goes?  I could target the loans with the 6.8% rates and eliminate them.  This also allows me the freedom to only make the smaller payment without being late in certain situations (say unexpected expense or even Christmas).  


Is there any real advantage to choosing one over the other if I intend to make the same payment size each month?

Thank You.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm coming into $50,000 in about 2 months. I have a few plans, but I'd like a second opinion, or at least a pointer in the right direction!","I'm 24, living in a modestly sized city. Currently about $1,000 student loan debt (lucky enough to get a lot of scholarships), and $2,000 parental debt, as they supported my move out here after finishing my education and we agreed I would pay them back as I can. Haven't had a lot of luck finding a well-paying job in my occupation, so currently working at a shitty tech support call center while applying elsewhere and trying to work on side projects to make myself more employable. I estimate ~$20,000 a year after taxes, which for me is livable but obviously not ideal. I'm optimistic that this will change for the extreme better in a couple months.

edit: I should add I have a bachelor's in Computer Science, so not interested in going back to school. I got my piece of paper, now it's mostly self-work to demonstrate my skills to employers, not spending more money on sitting in a classroom.

My parents have had a CD in my name that will mature and be given to me when I turn 25, with $50,000 in it. I have a few things I want to do, but otherwise I have no idea how to make the most of this besides the vague ""put most of it into a stock index and DON'T FUCKING TOUCH IT"". 

My roommate is offering to help me manage the majority that I am planning to save for later. He is asking 5% as a one time fee, we will draw up a contact, and he will help indefinitely with any issues or advice I need. He is someone I have known for many years, has a bachelors in Finance, and works for an international company in their finance department, doing literally million dollar deals on a consistent basis. So I trust him. He has also been pushing me to self-educate, and I've been struggling through *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*, and some other books (more titles would be great!)

Anyway, my plans are:

* Replace my gas-guzzling car I've had since high school, estimating I will do a $2k down payment on a $8k-$9k total and slowly pay it off to build credit
* Pay off debt, ~$3k
* ~$2.5k on misc. expenses (replace old computer, travel a bit, etc). This is me being selfish, I know.
* Sock away a year of rent in advance, estimate ~$6k (this is realistic for where I live)
* Turn $200 of it into one dollar bills and throw it in the air while dancing on my bed then deposit it back into the bank

So that leaves me at about ~$34k after roommate's proposed fee. He and I will be sitting down soon to discuss more in-depth what he thinks I should do to maximize long-term return (he's very clear that if it's up to him, I won't be seeing that money again for a LONG time, barring an emergency), as well as general finance advice. I also have a mechanic friend who will help me with finding the best car value, and I will be paying him with beer.

As you can probably tell by my post, I am very ignorant of a lot of these sort of things, which is why I outsource to other people and tend to listen to them after following up to make sure I can understand it enough I don't have to ask again. So any advice on my general plan, or at least thoughts would be great!

Feel free to be blunt; it won't hurt my feelings and it's the fastest way for me to learn. Even if my entire reasoning is flawed, it's way better to be called a dumbass now than two months from now.

personalfinance,HELP! Lates Paychecks Repaid But Now Extremely High Taxes,"Throwaways for obvious reasons

So at my previous job, I got into a pretty bad situation where my employer didn't pay me 10+ paychecks (in 2016). Should've never let it happened, but it did, so let's get past that. Was going to talk to Labor Board but they said they would pay me in 2017 which they did.

I received a paystub a couple weeks ago but this time the federal and state withholding taxes are EXTREMELY high. Usually they are maybe around 25%, this time they're 50%. I normally also have 2 allowances, but this time it said 0 allowances. I used http://www.esmartpaycheck.com/freecalculator/free_calculator.aspx and I plugged in my numbers, and I think because my employer put together ALL the 10+ paychecks they owed into one payment, that the withholding tax is that high because if the semi-monthly paycheck was multiplied over 24 pay periods, which would be a **LOT** of money. I'm losing a couple thousand dollars compared to what I would've received if I had received it last year as normal paycheck.

What exactly is going on? Why is my taxes 50% instead of 25%? Is it possible my employer processed it as supplemental income instead of it being the late paychecks? Most importantly, who do I talk to about this? My local labor board, some kind of lawyer?",finance

personalfinance,[Housing] 23 y/o looking to buy a house...is it possible?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a 23 year old who is looking to buy a townhouse from my mom. She is looking to sell it at market value (~$245K) or below that (~$220K). She said that she would not have me make a down payment on the house. 


**Financials:**
- I make a little bit over $30K/year

- I have no debt (credit card, school, or auto)

- I am still in college and have one more class to take before I get my degree

- I checked my credit score a week or so ago, and I have an 801.  


**Etc:**
- I own two cars 

- I am currently living at home 

- I will be moving in with my gf. Once she gets out of school she will probably be making $30K+/year


- In addition to my gf, I would also have another roommate; however, I have not decided on who it would be yet. 


**Backstory:**
Before I had a discussion with my gf's dad, I thought I was going to be able to get a good loan with a low interest rate (4%) due to my credit score. However, he was quick to shoot that down and said that since I don't have many assets, and I don't make enough money, I would actually be receiving a loan around (7-9%). This was pretty discouraging because I calculated my mortgage payment to be around ~1200/mo. He also said that I'll be denied a few times before I get approved. 


I guess my main question here is, **can I get away with buying this house at a low rate?...Is it possible?** I've been debating on waiting until I get done with school (I only have one more class to take) because it all seems too time-consuming. 


-How do I get started?
-If I shop around for rates, won't that hurt my credit score?
-How do I shop around for rates?
-Will I not get a loan because of my low income?

personalfinance,First time doing my own taxes- I think my employer underwithheld and I owe $6500 federal and $3500 state taxes?!,"Hi so I'm 24 and this is my first real adult job with a salary and before this my mom did my taxes. Anyways my taxable income for 2016 was $62,500. I claimed 1 for withholding on my w-4 and figured that would cover me and wasn't too worried about taxes. Also paid $6500 in student loan interest in 2016. I am single with no kids, plus I only have one job and I rent my apartment. No 401k, no car and no big deductions to claim.

So I just did my tax return on turbo tax and found I owe approximately $6500 in federal taxes and $3500 in NY state taxes. I didn't submit it yet as I want to wait to the last day while I try to save up money.

Even though my withholding was 1, my contributions for federal tax was only $1700, state tax was $816 plus additional $509 for NYC tax. It's my own fault because I didn't realize that only 20% of each paycheck going to my taxes/FICA/Medicare was low since it sounded high to me. I contacted my employer and they confirmed they messed up and put me in a higher withholding category, but I understand there's nothing I can do since they don't owe me anything and I should've realized.

Now I'm looking at $10,000 total in taxes owed and I am freaking out. I have $1500 in my savings right now as I've been prioritizing on making $1000 monthly payments to my student loan debt (150k in total almost).

I'm looking for advice / suggestions regarding my scenario, which is as follows (long post):

I'm 7.5 years into my 25 year student loan repayment plan (originally $130,000+).  I'm currently paying $1,000 a month with a remaining balance of just about $100,000.00.  This is a federal loan with 3 individual loan balances:  
A - ~$20,000 remaining @ 5.218% interest (~$177/mo)
B - ~ $29,000 remaining @ 5.205% interest (~$267/mo)
C - ~$59,000 remaining @ 7.362% interest ($541/mo)

My wife is also in a similar situation, she has approximately $86,000.00 remaining over the course the next 18 years, and she is paying about $866 a month.  Her federal loan is broken down into multiple smaller ones, which I won't list all of them, but of note she has three which have an interest rate of 8.0% with about $37,000 remaining (paying about $470/mo, combined for all 3).  The remaining loans on her balance are all &lt; 6.5% interest rate.

In total, our monthly student loan repayment is ~$1,866.  Our minimum fixed monthly expenses including our student loans  (federal and to her parents) is approximately $7,000 a month.  My wife gave birth to twins a couple months ago, and we will be looking at a $1,600 daycare bill every month in addition to other expenses when she returns to work next month. We both make relatively good money in a stable job situation (between 150-200k yearly combined before taxes) and are enrolled in 401k plans.  We have about 3-4 months of monthly living expenses in our checking account.  We have an additional ~ $60,000 in our savings account.  

Now I'm brainstorming options and trying to figure out if I should use some of my money in savings and pay off our high interest loans.  There is an added comfort level to having this money, even though it's not doing much, especially given the addition of the twins to the family.  Here's what I've come up with so far:

Scenario 1:
A.  Payoff my wife's 8% interest loan at $37k, freeing up an additional $470 a month.  
-this would leave about $20-25k remaining in our savings, in addition to our checking account.  Combined we would have a 6-8 month emergency fund.

B.  Look into refinancing options for my loan to either keep a similar loan term with a reduced interest rate, OR a shorter loan term to pay it off faster (10 or 15 years).  

Scenario 2:
A.  Keep things how they are and be student debt free when I'm 50.

personalfinance,"Personal finance ""loopholes"", updated","A lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: Keep expenses less than income.  Pay off highest interest rate debts first.  Compound growth is your friend.

Then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   Use tax-preferred retirement / HSA accounts.  Keep insurance in force.   Know how self-employment taxes work. 

This post is about less-obvious ways to use ""loopholes"" / little-known benefits in existing US laws to your advantage.   (Our friends in other countries are welcome to lobby for local versions *in their associated personal finance subs*.)

Here are some that you may not already know about:

Taxes / tax planning:

- Take advantage of ""[adjustments](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like IRA/HSA contributions,  student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, self-employment taxes/healh insurance paid,etc., to reduce taxable income if you are eligible.  You can take these even if you do not otherwise itemize.

- If you are not a full-time student and earn less than 30K single / 60k jointly, you can use the [Saver's Credit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit (better than a deduction!) for a portion of your IRA or 401k contributions, even for Roth contributions.  You can even deduct a contribution to get your income to qualify.  

- Gifts and inheritances are generally not taxable to the recipient.  Other untaxed ""income"" includes most insurance payouts and damage awards; child support; some scholarships; rebates and loyalty program bonuses.  Remember that loans are not income, though forgiven loans typically are.  

- You pay [no taxes at all on long-term capital gains](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  That could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  You can can do this at any age.

- Sales of a personal residence often have [no capital gains tax](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  You have to have lived in the house as your primary residence two of the past five years; you get $250,000 per sale ($500,000 for a couple).   

- If you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) [can be Schedule E expense deductions against your rental income](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income.)  You don't have taxable income / deductions if your roommates who share the lease give you money to send to your  landlord.  

- If you received a 1099 reporting income that wasn't really yours , e.g. for selling something on behalf of someone else, use a [nominee distribution](http://www.arahcpa.com/blog/don8217t-forget-those-nominee-1099s/36087) declaration to avoid being taxed on it.

- If your spouse owes money to the federal government, use an [injured spouse](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-005.html) form to keep the IRS from withholding your share of a joint tax refund.  This is different than an [innocent spouse](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html) situation, where your spouse tried to evade taxes without your knowledge.

Retirement:

- Think you make too much to contribute to Roth IRA?  Think again!  The [Backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  There's even a [mega-backdoor Roth](http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) for high-income people with certain 401k plans.

- Employer contributions to your 401k [don't count](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- If you change you mind about making an IRA contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be deductible, you can simply [remove the money](https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

- Self-employed people have [lots of options](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts, including a solo-401k and a SEP IRA.  This can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

Health insurance:

- If you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (COBRA) coverage, during which time you are eligible to be covered even if you haven't and won't pay for it.  [This works retroactively](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take COBRA at day 59 if you do have major expenses, pay for it, and be covered for the previous 59 days.  

- You won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  [brief coverage gap](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  I.e. May 3 to July 31 is OK.  May 1 to July 31 is not.",finance

I have $18,500 is federal student loans. I'm currently in graduate school, so the loans have been deferred until December 2018.

However, here's the rub. I currently work at a non-profit and have been accepted to the federal loan forgiveness program. As it stands, without deferment, based on my income, I would be paying $160.00 a month for 110 more payments, based on 4.75% interest.  Due to my deferment, I get some sort of federal interest subsidy, which I cannot figure out what the is based on my research. I also am only taking 1 class every seven weeks and working full time. I don't know why I'm eligible for deferment because of this.

My question is this. Should I accept the deferment? I plan on paying $200 a month regardless. Would it be beneficial for me to do so or to have the loans pulled out of deferment and pay the minimum amount required or $200 a month? 

I just don't know what to do and need some advice.",finance

gaming,Need help: Throttle stuffing up on steering wheel,"So I've got this Trust Vibraforce GM-3300 since october 2016.

At first it worked as it should. But recently, my throttle has started giving out inconsistent values to my laptop. (Meaning I can't control my acceleration as I would like to)

This has been the 2nd wheel that has done this as the previous wheel I had has been replaced by warrenty. (Also a GM-3300)

Both throttles have exactly the same problem. (It only took a few months longer on the 2nd.)

My question now is: How can I solve it without having to buy a new steeringwheel or without having to turn on traction-control. (Feels unrealistic in my opinion)

Throttle output is on the bottom-right. Everything between 0% and 100% = stuffed up.

personalfinance,Taxes question about tax withheld for sale of Non-qualified stock options,"Hi everyone! I need help clearing out my confusion about my taxes this year that I wasn't able to figure out from the info available online. I realized this year that I have been doing these incorrectly and will need to make sure I get it right this year and amend the past two years (2015 and 2014) accordingly... I paid taxes the past two years instead of getting a refund as I now realize I should have.

I've had a small amount of non-qualified stock options granted by my employer. In 2016, I had these exercise and do a same-day sale. When the sale was executed, my broker withheld Federal Taxes, State Taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. The compensation portion was reported on my W-2 Box 12 as 'V' and I received a 1099-B with not much more than Net Proceeds, Cost Basis, and Gain/Loss (basically Proceeds minus Cost Basis). 

I realized this year that I have been double-taxed as I have not been correcting the cost basis... however I am still confused about the taxes withheld by my broker! These are my questions right now:

* Where should I account for this information? Should I add it to 'Federal income tax withheld' in the Capital Gains/Losses worksheet of TurboTax/H&amp;R Block even if 1099-B Box 3 is empty?
* What about the 'State income tax withheld'? Should I add it manually as well?


Thank you all in advance! I see similar questions online (mainly in TurboTax), but none of them answer my questions about Tax Withheld... they just cover the Cost Basis correction or get me more confused :(.",finance
personalfinance,"Paying off loans, selling, investing","My wife and I (just got married a month ago, first for both), in our early 30s, have careers and don't really have any finance ""issues"". We are looking for advice on where to direct our money for the best results (e.g. do we pay off the house, invest in market/index funds, pay off car, buy land/property, etc). 

So our situation. Both have 780+ credit scores, have 0 credit card debt between us (we have credit cards but simply pay everything off a month and collect the cash back). She has student debt but works for government and is putting max the IRS allows into her 401k as her repayment is calculated on her AGI (adjusted gross income). I am putting 10% in 401k and 2% in ROTH. I probably should switch this but I don't think my company will match into a ROTH. If they do, should I?

For our debts we have her car payment of 350$ (i think there is 7k left on loan). I own my car (no payment). The rest is her student loans and houses (i'll explain). 

For her student loans she works for the government and is in the loan forgiveness plan (crossing our fingers it doesn't get killed). She is in the program and is working on making her 120 payments (2 years in almost).

As for the houses. Between us both, we have 3. We have our house that we currently live in (3.5% rate) cost the most. We have her town home that she had in college. This isn't worth a ton (100k or so, I think rate is ~5%). She is renting it out currently and making about 50$ a month (so basically nothing for income). And the one I dislike the most, we own her moms home (town house). To make a long story short, she was in rent to own process. The HoA changed rules to say no renters, she was classified as a renter. She didn't have enough income to get a loan for the house. She was going to lose the house, the 25k she put down for the rent to own agreement, and all the equity she had gained in the last 3 years. I don't like getting involved in ""loaning"" money, especially to family, but we agreed to it since we would be the sole owners, and we would instantly have 50k in equity as the seller agreed to sell it at the originally agreement that was made in 2012. Her mom pays us for the mortgage. The intention of this is to sell/do transfer of title when her mom can pay for it. My logic was, if her mom doesn't pay, we sell the house, give her mom the 25k she put into the house originally and the rest to cover the closing (should be well over that). Currently working on getting her mom situated to take the loan over or selling it. 


This is my plan. We have 25k sitting in our bank account. Combined together we have well over 6 figures in 401k (I don't even look at this money but figured it would be worth mentioning to realize we are saving). Have 20K+ in index funds. With this we can live 6-12 months even if our tenants quit paying and we both lost our jobs. So emergency funds are there. 

1) Pay off the car. It is the highest interest rate of everything and there is only 8k or so left on it. Unfortunately we will need to be getting new car in a year or two as both of ours are 8+ years old and have 130k+ miles). 

2) Sell the town home she had in college. I dislike this property because it is a town home and it isbasically like owning an apartment. While not horrible, the HoA fees to me are shit for what you get and it would be better putting money into an actual rental house if we are going to do that. Or even though it is a town home should we keep renting it out? It is in a fairly large city and near a school so renting hasn't been a problem.

3)Deal with getting out from under her moms home in the next year or so. This would allow us to invest in something other then tying up money.


So those are my main goals at this point. Moving forward past those items i listed, I don't know if it it would be better to just dump more money into other our home (we could double the down payment on principle), or simply invest the money in index funds. Do some type of split (50% excess money goes to index funds, 50% of our excess goes towards principle of house). Besides index funds would it be better to go invest in some land? What are some other sound investments besides index funds? We have 2-3k every month after ALL bills, and ""fun"" stuff (e.g. eating out with friends, her buying some clothes, me buying video game or 2 and or saving for a trip) to invest.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on balance transfers and money management - parents never taught me and I have some questions,"Some background: I'm 26, getting married later this year, and my fiancé and I both don't make a ton of money. He owns his own business and I'm a self-employed illustrator. He owns his house and the house next door, the rent on one pays for the mortgage on both, we pay very low ""rent"" for our area, and it covers our property taxes. We have no plans for a family ever, we are happy with our lives and we make enough to pay our bills and have a good time, so there's no real rush to start saving like crazy, but it's something we'd like to start thinking about. 

We pay for everything we can with a Cashback rewards Amex from USAA, and we pay the statement off in full at the end of the month most months. It's been tight lately, and we've had a string of unexpected medical bills, so we are penny pinching a bit, but it's nothing unmanageable. The interest rate is pretty low too, so it's working for us. 

Because of the nature of my career, some weeks I make a ton of money and some weeks I make next to nothing, so the whole credit card thing has been working really well for the past 6 months. I don't have to worry too much when I have a slow week.

The problem is that not everywhere takes AMEX, so we have had to use my other credit card for a few purchases when we don't have the cash immediately. It's a Capital One card with an interest rate of like 23.99%. It was my first credit card, used it all through college for emergencies, and it's been nothing but trouble for me. I have never been able to successfully lower the interest rate despite having it for 7 years now. I always pay it on time and the credit limit keeps going up, but there was a time in college where I carried a $2500 balance on it for a few months and I was just throwing money down the drain. I didn't know that there was any other option. 

Anyway - I just did a bunch of research and I have some questions:

1. Chase Slate - if I transfer the balance ($1000), I will have no interest rate on it for a couple months, which is plenty of time to pay it off, but after that the interest rate is 22.9% on purchases (not the balance transfer). I read that that's the best card for balance transfers, but I don't want to open another credit card with a lower limit, just to have another card with too high of an interest rate that I won't use. Is it bad to have an open and empty credit card once I pay the balance off? 

2. My credit score falls in the ""good"" range, and has been there for a long time. It's been just over 700 for years. Is that prohibiting me from getting a good interest rate? I thought 24.99% was just about the highest rate there is. 

3. I have a best buy credit card that I bought a computer with when I was 18. It's been empty since about 6 months after I got it, there's no annual fee, and I don't ever use it. I was told to keep it open because banks like to see accounts in good standing for a long time. Is that true or was that just an excuse my mom gave me for having so many credit cards?

4. My fiancé and I bank with USAA. Is there a good credit card they have that anyone can recommend? 

I guess I'm just looking for more advice. My parents are useless with this stuff. My dad doesn't even have a bank account, and my mom has declared bankruptcy and maintains a constant state of getting late fees waived and picking what bill to pay when, despite making plenty of money. Both my grandparents have perfect credit and massive amounts of money, but are terrible at passing that advice along, they just write checks when we are in trouble and I want to stop relying on that.",finance

Having that $0 payment has allowed me to leave home, move across the country, find a job in my field, and generally get a nice start. I now make about 33k per year, but am bringing home about as much money as before. I have the loans in forbearance til May 1st.

- 100 misc., includes gas and eating out

Do I check ""Has your income significantly changed"" on the application? I'd rather keep the payment at $0 for a few more months, while paying off the car fast (collision adds a nice chunk to ins too).

I haven't made a payment on many of the cards in maybe 9 months or more but I don't think any are in collections yet. Should i go to a bankruptcy attorney now or wait until they are in collections?

aside from these i also have federal student loans. I KNOW THESE DO NOT GO AWAY IN BANKRUPTCY. They aren't a problem anywaybecause my income is so low i don't have to pay anything. 

i also have medical bills with hospitals and a couple doctors totalling 1500 that I don't pay. they send me letters and call me but i don't respond. they aren't in collections yet.

I just found out today that one the BOA cards has been ""Charged off"" and the capital one card is threatening this also. 

I don't see anyway out. Do I wait until all of them are in collections before declare bankruptcy? Wait until I'm sued? What do I do?",finance
personalfinance,Let's talk car loans? or please provide a link to another post if this is asked often.,"1. Yes I understand saving up, then paying cash is the best option. But that's not the point of this thread.
2. I drive high miles to work, so a lease is not an option.
3. Should I go thru my bank for a loan, or use the dealer's wide database of lenders to get one?  Is best interest rate the only difference in these options?
4. I think I got screwed on my last car loan thru the dealership, because if I paid more than the regular amount each month, or if I wanted to pay the loan off early... there was no advantage in doing so... the final amount overall, out of my pocket, was within a few hundred dollars no matter how it was paid... for a 15k loan

personalfinance,"130k debt, 27k net income - need help prioritizing debts","I'm 28 years old and i've been ignoring these debts for a while. Thanks to lurking on this sub I've learned a lot. I decided to go with the avalanche method to pay it off and I can pay an additional $460 each month. I'm posting because I'm not sure which loans should be a priority. 

4 of my loans are with Navient and I'm in a rate reduction program which reduces my interest rate to 3.5% for the next year. I was granted a reduced rate of 3% last year. I believe unless my income increases they will grant me a reduction next year as well, however this is not guaranteed.  Outside of this program the interest rates range from 8.55%-11.75%. 

I have another loan that doesn't qualify for a rate reduction with a  8.25% interest rate. My plan was to attack this loan first, then attack the other loans once the rate increases.  Is this a good plan?

I feel I should mention - the rate reduction department of Navient warned me that if I show I can make extra payments consistently I lose the rate reduction.

And I have a feeling some of you will tell me I need to get a better job, so I'll tell you now I am working on it. I am also working to reduce my other bills so I can attack these debts more effectively. I negotiated with T-mobile and Comcast for better rates. With my current budget and plan I will be able to pay off my debts by April 2028

For those of you who are interested in my budget I'll give you the overview:

Income - 2250

Min. Loan payments - 930

Rent - 450

Groceries - 200

Entertainment - 50

Cell Phone - 50

Pet supplies - 40 (my spend is less but i'm saving the extra in case my pet gets sick)

Transportation - 40 (my spend is less since I get free rides most of the time, but budgeting for it anyway)

Internet - 30


Water is paid by my landlord and electricity is usually paid by my roomie. He knows I have crushing debt so he's helping me with that. 

Any and all advise you're willing to share is greatly appreciated. 

Edit: Fixed incorrectly reported interest rate. Loan without rate reduction is at 8.25% interest.",finance
personalfinance,I will be quitting my full-time W2 job to become at 1099 Independent Contractor. What do I need to know?,"I will be quitting my full time job to take on a contract-to-hire (3 months) that has the possibility of contract extension, conversion to full time W2 employee, or termination. I am trying to figure out what I need to know and keep track of for the upcoming year, in order to make filing for taxes smooth sailing.

First thing I’ve realized is, as a contractor I won’t have health insurance, so I need to get health insurance within 3 months in order to avoid a penalty.

I just learned I need to file a 1040 ES form and pay taxes every quarter. I’m not really sure how to fill this out because my contract is only for 3 months, with the possibility of an extension, conversion to W2, or termination.

I will be getting paid on a monthly basis, so for Q1, I will only need to pay taxes for 1 month (March), right?

 My plan is to set aside 33% of each paycheck in order to pay quarterly taxes. Is this enough? Do I only need to make one payment per quarter to the IRS for self employment taxes, federal taxes, and state taxes? Or do I need to make separate payments to their respective entities?

I’m not too worried about setting aside money and paying it, I’m more concerned about all the paperwork and forms I need to fill out and send.

I have already maxed out my IRA contributions (specifically all in Roth IRA), and if I were to ride this contract to the end of the year, I will be over the income limit. What can/should I do about that later in the year when I have a more accurate estimate of where my income will be?

This is my first time being an independent contractor and I’m sure it won’t be the last (unless I have a horrible experience). I’m just looking for things I may have missed, things I need to do, and general tips and things to remember throughout the year to make my life easier when filing for taxes.

investing,Decision Making Biases and Investing: How to benefit from our decision process in the investing world,"Being aware of biases can certainly improve our decision making processes. This awareness is the difference in foresight versus hindsight. I'm a decision science major and this sort of question is one that I appreciate very much, especially applied in this context.  
   
As you mentioned, humans suffer from overconfidence. Not only are we overconfident, our overconfidence is expressed through our nature to overestimate (as opposed to underestimate), feel as though our guesses are overprecise (more precise than they really are), and overplace themselves (relative to others). These three things can drastically effect how we make decisions, especially when it comes to the stock market and investing.  
   
Additionally, humans also tend to feel optimistic with their chances if they are given some control. For example, if you pick your own lottery numbers, you are more likely to think that your ticket can win compared to randomly assigned numbers. When it comes to the stock market, we feel as though we are in control, but the control that we have is limited. Keeping this in mind as we make investing decisions is hugely important.  
   
Another aspect of our innate irrationality that can be attributed to influencing poor investing choices is loss aversion as you mentioned. Because we dislike losses far more than we like equivalent gains, we do all we can to avoid risk. This is the very reason that we choose to purchase insurance or stay away from risky investments. If you put $100 into the stock market and lose $50, you'll need to make far more than $50 for you to feel recuperated from that loss.   
   
There's also intertemporal discounting and hedonic framing. Intertemporal discounting is when we tend to make irrational decisons (such as prefer $10 today as opposed to $15 one month from today which by the way is a 600% interest rate) due to the uncertainty of the future. We tend to overestimate as I mentioned which causes us to discount too much, which is why we may take the $10 today even though the interest rate is ridiculously high. Hedonic framing is the idea that separate gains are better than a single gain of an equal amount. You'd be happier if you won $50 and then won $100 as opposed to winning $150. This is the reason why we tend to make many expensive purchases on the same day or prefer to use credit cards (our losses are combined into one big loss which feels better than many small separate losses over time).  
   
I'm sure that at this point you can see that we are not rational decision makers we are boundedly rational. We generally seek to satisfy and suffice (satisfice) and not optimize. To be successful as an investor, we need to know when our irrationality and biases can benefit us and when it cannot. Many people may think that our irrationality is a weakness, but if controlled correctly and accounted for, it can be one of our biggest strengths. 

**TL;DR:** Irrationality can be a good thing, so long as you're aware of natural human biases.  
  
There are so many more heuristics and biases that we use daily when making decisions but these are just some of the most important ones.",finance
personalfinance,"Do you have to prove moving expenses for the tax deduction, or is it just based on the honor system?","My gf and I moved across the country this past summer for a new job (CA to NC).

The evidence I find seems it is completely based on the honor system and up to the IRS to decide if they want to investigate further. Is that true?

Here is what I consider moving expenses: We shipped one car for about $1000 and drove the other one (I paid for shipping and both cars are in my name). We drove about 2800 miles, and using the standard $0.19 per mile, that is $532. We sold/donated all of our large items and shipped about $700 worth of small/medium sized belongings via UPS/FedEx/USPS (it is surprising how fast it adds up). And hotel stays 9 * about $60 = $540. I did not get any reimbursement from my new employer.

* A) Can I deduct all of this reasonably?
* B) Am I supposed to provide proof somewhere?
* C) Has anyone ever been audited and had to prove their case?

personalfinance,Home equity line of credit to purchase income property?,"Hello, /r/personalfinance. I am seeking some advice on using a home equity line of credit to purchase an income property. I looked around the wiki and searched the sub, and didn’t find anything particularly relevant, so here is a post about my situation specifically. I made a really smart property purchase and I have built a lot of equity in the house. I am debating taking out a home equity line of credit and using it to completely fund the purchase of an income property. 

My main concern is that a home equity line of credit has a variable interest rate, which seems awfully similar to an ARM, which I know is generally not a good idea. That said, I got figures on variable interest rate history, and they have not risen above 10% in like nearly 30 years and haven’t been over 7% or so in a decade.

Has anyone done this or have personal experiences or knowledge they can share? Risks or benefits associated? I'm aware of many of these, like the possibility housing values drop, but am looking for opinions and considerations I may have missed.

I am currently a senior college student that is looking to purchase a car and need some advice to find the best option. Recently, my car broke down (gas tank leak) and I am unable to use it so I am in need of a replacement. This is where it gets a little tricky. My mother lives in Delaware and I go to school in New Jersey. During school breaks, I have to go home to Delaware which is about a three hour drive. I’m sort of confused on what my best solution is. I rarely drive around on campus and would really only need a car to get to Delaware and drive around locally. I would still like a car because I don’t want to rely on Uber and other means of transportation (especially on dates and such). I am debating whether a lease, a car payment, or a cheap used car is the best in this case. Since I am graduating this semester, I don’t want to be stuck with a cheap car that could inhibit my ability to get to work. Here is my current situation: 
I have about $14,000 in student loans that are all subsidized at an interest rate from 3.66%- 4.66%. I have currently about $5,000 saved up in my bank and a lot of stuff that I could easily sell (video game collection and assets maybe about $10,000). This semester I am getting a refund for about $2,000 with $800.00 of that being scholarships and $1200 being loans at a 3.86% interest rate. In addition, I can easily piece out my original car for ~$500.00 because it still runs (won’t pass inspection though). Currently I quit my job to focus more on schoolwork as I am already a Resident Assistant which takes up a lot of time. Would it be beneficial to buy a more expensive car at maybe $8,000 because it will be more reliable, lease a car for two years to prevent any problems from arising, or buy a $3-5k car that may be more prone to problems but it will allow me to save money and pay off loans while keeping an emergency fund. I would like to hear all available options as this is totally new to me! 

Thanks! 
Also I am aware of how leasing is never a good option, but in this circumstance I thought it may be an option.",finance

My bank is currently offering 0.5% on closing balances and 0.75% on deposits into your savings account, so I thought since I won't be spending a lot of my money, might as well dump my payroll into savings. The thing is, I'm not sure how interest rates work, I earned $0.87 in January (my first month) when I had a closing balance of $2050 or so, is that right?

So basically two questions: 

1) Should I put my earnings from work into savings or checking account? Anywhere else? 

2) How do saving account interest rates work? I know my bank account it calculated monthly... can someone give me an example of interest rates compounded monthly?

personalfinance,My mom is about to buy a house she can't afford. Looking for advice.,"Hi Reddit,



I’m posting because my mom (63) is about to make some major financial decisions which I feel are out of her means, and I’m very concerned about what this could mean for her future, as well as mine and my husbands. 



My mom began collecting Social Security this month ($1,100) and has a very small monthly pension of $250. She works approximately 20 hours a week making $12 an hour. She currently lives with a roommate who she likes a lot and pays $450 a month in rent. She has about $4,000 in total credit card debt and a monthly car loan amount of $180. She has zero savings to her name.



While her current financial situation isn’t amazing, it’s also not terrible. However, she decided two months ago that she wanted to take out a loan from Quicken Loans and buy a house on the other coast of Florida because “interest rates are so low, and the West coast of Florida is cheaper”. She got approved for a $140,000 30-year conventional mortgage loan with a 4.4% fixed interest rate and told me she planned on finding a house for “no where near $100K!” but ended up picking a (bank-owned) house for $130K. The total loan she’s buying is somewhere in the neighborhood of $252K principal and interest. Because she has almost no money, she plans on putting down a 3% down payment and then paying the house off over the next 30 years. Her closing costs will also be around $8,000, which will wipe out all of her money from the get-go and probably add debt. Initially she tried to have me co-sign her mortgage because Quicken Loans wouldn’t approve her by herself, but I told her I refused. Instead, she had my brother write a fake job offer which stated she would be making enough money on the West coast to pay her mortgage. It’s really sad. 



She plans on moving in with her roommate who promises to pay $500 in rent monthly. He’s a great guy but he’s 75, does not work, and is an unreliable source of income for the long term. He will not be contractually obligated in any way to pay rent on time, and could leave at any time leaving her with the entire mortgage. She says her monthly mortgage will be around $900, but she’s not factoring in bills, house upkeep or the furniture she needs to furnish the 2,000 square foot home. 



I am trying hard to convince her that buying this home is not a good idea. She JUST began collecting social security, and I told her it’s a wise time to save what she can and make smart investment decisions. Every time I mention this, she gets defensive and sad. My husband and I even offered to help her with a down payment in 2 years on a property if she could contribute a larger amount, but she seemed uninterested in our offer. The property she is about to buy is in Spring Hill, FL. I don’t know much about real estate in this area but I’m worried the resale value of the home is questionable too.



I would love to hear any advice you all can offer. It’s always so difficult dealing with family because they take things very personally, and I’d like to know if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and managed to convince their loved ones to not make such a huge decision. Thank you.",finance

I can leave it there, I can roll it over to an IRA/Roth IRA, or I can withdraw it for a 30 percent tax penalty. 

Right now I'm earning only $25k net a year, but I'm in the process of switching career fields and this is a filler job to keep money coming in.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation - Loan Term vs. Emergency Fund,"Hi, apologies if this was already asked and answered but I couldn't find an answer in the sidebar or through the Search function...

I have been stuck in a 'holding pattern' for the past few years, in which I accrued some debt due to legal fees (separation/custody).  I have been basically living paycheque to paycheque, and the monthly debt payments are around $300.  Until recently my income was equal to my expenses, so I came up approx. $300 short each month and had to use my credit card (~20% interest rate).  Once the credit card maxed out I went to the bank and they gave me a consolidation loan (unsecured, 10% interest rate), at the same $300/month which started the cycle all over again.  This has repeated twice already and I am about to go for round three.

The difference this time is that I recently got a new job which pays me about $350 more after taxes per month.  I've got $8500 left on the consolidation loan (34 months left to pay) and $2500 on the credit card so I'm looking to consolidate again and lower the overall interest.  The last time my bank was very flexible and basically let me pick the term, so assuming that happens again what is my best course of action?

I have no emergency fund so I would like to make that a priority, which suggests I take a longer term on the loan so I have smaller monthly payments and can put more towards the savings fund.  But then I end up paying more interest overall.

To give an overall picture, my take home is $3500/month.  I pay $1100 in rent, $1000 in child support (including daycare and extra curricular activities), $300 in utilities (heat, hydro, phone, internet), $400 household (food, laundry, etc) and $150 misc (clothing, gifts, entertainment).  I have my kids half the time so there's not much I can do to lower expenses, e.g. smaller place or getting a roommate is out of the question.

Assuming the income/expenses stay the same, I will have about $500/month extra.  If I can keep the 10% interest rate on a new consolidation loan for $11000 I can pay it off in 24 months @ $500/month and no emergency fund, 36 months @ ~$350/month and put $150/month into an emerg. fund, or 48 months @ ~$280/month and put $220/month towards an emergency fund  I could probably go as long as 60 months since that works out better for the bank.

If it matters, all amounts are in $CDN but it's really a math problem more than anything so the currency doesn't seem relevant.  Thanks in advance for any guidance!",finance
financialindependence,Trying to Figure Out Military Retirement,"Alright, so I'm trying to work out some of the basic concepts when it comes to Military Retirement and FIRE (MilFIRE). I'm also hoping that some of you might be able to point out my blind spots.

First off, there's the 20 year pension. Right now, that's 50% of your final base pay more or less. Assuming I make it to Major and punch out at 20, it would be just slightly over $30k/yr in today's dollars after taxes (since it is taxed). I'm strongly considering the new Blended Retirement System, but I still want to find out more when it comes to the possibility of a lump sum payment upon retirement. How much will it be taxed? What are they planning to value the 24 years between 43 and 67?

Next, I have my TSP contributions. I'm on track to max out my TSP for the first time this year. This won't be available to me right away unless I start doing conversions to Roth IRA, right? Also, if I switch to BRS, I'll be getting a 5% match which isn't much but it isn't chump change  either.

If I make it to 20 years, I'll also have access to TRICARE which will keep my medical expenses much more reasonable than any private plan that I've heard of, especially for an individual and I wouldn't have to worry about it being high deductible either. I think at medicare age this benefit changes a bit?

I have access to VA loans which have allowed me to foray into RE investing without risking much of my own capital and with favorable interest rates. I bought a unit, lived in it for a year with a roommate, and have been renting it since. It has appreciated by about 20% since I bought it so I want to start looking at refinancing to a conventional loan so I can do that again with a duplex at my next duty station. The small amount of cashflow now is going right back into principal but when it pays itself off it will be pure return since I didn't have to spend more than a couple thousand of my own money to purchase and I've already saved enough of the rent to cover all but the most catastrophic maintenance.

I'm currently maxing out my Roth IRA. I have it in VTTHX. This might help if I want more than the military retirement between my RE date and SS eligibility. I know I won't be able to contribute to this from my military retirement since it's not considered earned income (this seems weird to me because it's taxed like income but not tax shelterable like income...oh well).

Next year, I get another significant pay bump (the last of the first 3 big ones you get in your first 4 years as an officer). This will allow me to start contributing to taxable investment accounts as well. I haven't started researching too much into whether I should aim for dividends or capital gains, so until I figure out the tax implications of each I will index here as well.

Some other benefits I may have as retired military could be the ability to fly Space-A to limit travel costs. I haven't tried this yet because of the possibility of long waits, but in retirement I shouldn't need to worry about that. If I have to be somewhere quick, I'm sure I'll still be churning. If I decide to live near a base in retirement, I can get quite a few of the nice benefits like Commissary and Exchange and gym privileges. Then there are all of the veteran's discounts. I even get a free burial marker when I die, I think.

Am I missing any other good reasons to stick til 20 years? Am I missing any drawbacks besides the obvious of being in the military and having to possibly need to go into combat? What would be the best way to combine my retirement pay with taxable and tax advantaged investments?",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card APR way too high!,"I got my first credit card back in college, it was a student card (Discover) that I maxed out in about 4 weeks. I know, super smart of me. Once I graduated, I was still making payments on that card but needed something else in case of emergencies, so I got a Wells Fargo card. 0% for 15 months. Used it for awhile, and currently have a balance of around $2K(which is getting paid off by a Line of Credit with a 10.75% APR to avoid high interest rate). Well my 0% ended this month and my APR is 24.24%, literally the highest rate possible, same as a cash advance. The Discover card is not much better at around 20%. Called Wells Fargo to see if it was possible to lower the APR and was shot down. I don't plan on closing it since I've got a little over a year credit history with it. At the time I applied for this card I had a 650 (or less) credit score. Now that the Discover I paid off, I have around a 751 according to Credit Karma. Would it be beneficial to apply for a different card to avoid high APR if in the future I did need to have a higher balance on there? What would you do in this situation? Would the impact of running another credit card application hurt approval chances of a mortgage application in about a 1.5 years?",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"Hey, everyone. 

I have a couple of loans through HESAA/NJClass (The Worst). I have other loans through Sallie Mae/Navient, but they are much more manageable and willing to be flexible should anything happen so I'd like to look into taking care of the HESAA ones first.

Currently I have 3 loans with them
* ~16,700 @ 7.3%
* ~17,366 @ 8.67%
* ~21,230 @ 8.67% 

For a total of 55,166 outstanding balance. I pay $600/mo for these loans and I'm looking to reduce that if possible. I have been paying monthly since 2012 without any breaks (because they don't give you any, even a 6-month grace period post graduation).

The only place that will accept my not having a degree after all of that schooling and still refinance is Credible and they have a number of options at lower interest rates, some with higher monthly payments than I'm making now in exchange for discharging the debt in a fewer number of years than others with lower monthly payments and more years.

Which should I be leaning towards? Based off what I calculated, it would take me 12 more years to pay this off if I just stuck with NJClass. Should I look more towards paying it off sooner and paying more (hopefully not as much as I am now) monthly, or putting more money in my pocket (read: savings) now monthly and maybe tacking on three years for repayment as a tradeoff?

personalfinance,"Coming Off 3 Years Homelessness, Did NOT Pay Taxes, Advice on Reconciling with IRS?","No sob story and straight to the point. I'm 26 now and a guy, if that helps. 
Was going back and forth with posting this or not, but figure it's time to do the right thing and ask Reddit for some advice on this and getting straight.


For about the last three years I've been every degree of homeless for different stretches of time. From couch surfing, to sleeping in my beater car, to literally sleeping on a bench in the park. It all started back when I left a relationship and ended up being completely locked out of renting another apartment due to a surprise lease that was evicted with my name on it (family fraud). 

I made the most of it while fighting this and the entire time I've been jumping in and out of the job market when I can hold some reliable form of both transportation (public or ride share) and housing, having to start over at one point to deal with a medical emergency which delayed everything by another year. I also qualified and received food benefits during this time, applying as homeless. 

Starting this year I've finally saved enough/ found a career to afford to pay off the remainder of the debt in my name, secure the required down payment for my own place, and make enough income to actually move forward in my life. Income wise I feel pretty confident and secure that I don't think I'm gonna need any help there, but now I have a new problem... The backed up taxes. 


As far as I am aware, most of my employers were under the table, but some had me on a type of payroll or another for awhile. I did not file taxes at any point during these last three years. I make no excuses for this, I kept 100% of everything I made in order to scrape the money I needed to live while digging myself out of the hole, and I want to get things started on fixing it, I'm just clueless on where to begin and what I risk bringing it up. 


Obviously I figure I can't just pay taxes for the last few months and casually whistle past the fact I haven't filed for three years. I'm looking for advice on dealing with this ethically, legally, and most importantly I want to avoid anything that will end up with me going to jail because that would kind of suck and as someone wearing a gifted fancy fur coat drinking a fancy IPA as I type this all, I just don't think I would hack it behind [federal bars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBzvMLW0ii4).

personalfinance,"Prepping to buy a house, need advice on prepping credit","Personal Finance,

In roughly six months time, my wife and I plan on beginning the search for a house. This is earlier than we initially planned, but we would like a space for our family to grow sooner rather than later. 

In an effort to reach our goal, we've started to take a hard look at our finances to see what we can do to help the process. We checked with Quicken Loans to see what we could get approved for based on our current situation, and although the terms aren't great, we can get approved. 

Our goal over the next six months is to take steps to improve our credit ratings to hopefully improve the terms of a loan we could get in the future. These steps include:

1. Paying down debt to improve both debt-to-income ratio and credit utilization percentage
2. Saving extra towards a larger down payment
3. Monitoring existing credit to ensure accuracy of reported info

I'd like to ask for advice. I pulled my TransUnion report and there is a single adverse collection reported. It is owned by AFNI, but states AT&amp;T was the original creditor. The adverse collection is not news to me, but I would like to know the best way to approach it with the upcoming house purchase. 

*Some background on the adverse collection:* 

*In late 2015, I totaled my car. At the time, my job had a great partnership with the local transportation authority, so instead of using emergency funds as a down payment, I took a train to work for a few months while saving up a decent down payment. In February of 2016, I applied for a loan through a credit union, and was surprised at how high the offered rate was. I prodded, and was told about the adverse collection on my report. I have a cycle set up to pull a free credit report from one of the three major companies every four months, so the adverse collection surprised me. I was able to negotiate what I felt was a decent interest rate with a different lender, and I moved on to looking into the collection. I pulled my next credit report in the cycle and say the AFNI/ATT debt in collections for $50. I had AT&amp;T at an old apartment, but I had cancelled in September of 2013 and was told the account was paid in full. I was also confused because the debt stated it did not go into collections until 10/12/2015, two years after closing the account. Also, neither AT&amp;T nor AFNI had ever attempted to contact me through phone or mail about the debt. I called AT&amp;T first: they told me there was nothing they could do, since they had already sent the debt had already been given to a collection agency. I then called AFNI; the lady who answered the phone was pleasant and helpful, to an extent. I told her I didn't believe I owed the debt, and she told me there was nothing she could do over the phone. If I wanted to challenge, I would have to send an official letter. At the time, I did not expect any other major upcoming purchases, so I put off any action. The debt was only $50; it hardly seemed worth it to pay legal fees for help removing it.*

Now that I'm in a situation where I will be making a major purchase, I want to know what the best path forward is with this adverse collection. From my research both on the subreddit and other websites, my options seem to be:

1. Dispute the claim
2. Send a PFD letter
3. Do nothing  

I know the first two options aren't mutually exclusive. If one fails, I could try the other, I'm more looking for the best option or route. I'd prefer not to pay the debt (because $50 is $50), but if it means saving $3600 (rough estimate) over the course of the loan, it's obviously the fiscally responsible thing to do. I read on a few sites that having a disputed claim that isn't removed could be harmful when trying to purchase a home, as it seems like a bigger liability. I also no that if I pay, but can't get it removed, there's essentially no difference in my credit score, so the damage is already done if I can't get it removed and I may as well wait out the seven years. I've also read, however, that having unpaid collections on a credit report may prevent loan approval. This isn't a major concern to me (as I stated above, we were already told we qualified) but it is a concern. 

So that's the big mess I have going on in my head right now. Any advice on the correct path to take in regards to the adverse collection would be appreciated.",finance

I'm currently attending a university in California, but I have decided to drop out this week (7th week out of 10 per term). I've paid for the entire years worth of tuition. This means I've paid ahead for Fall, Winter, and Spring quarter. If I withdraw from the university tomorrow, how will the remaining tuition be refunded back to me?

A few details: Only a small fraction of tuition was covered by financial aid (cal grants, scholarships etc) due to this being my fifth year at university. Most of the rest of the tuition was paid for using federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Another chunk was paid for out of pocket via a couple of my dad's credit cards. My university's policy is that withdrawing by the 7th week of a quarter can refund me a certain % of the tuition. How would this tuition be paid back? Do universities typically write checks for these? Would my dad get a certain amount refunded back to his credit card?

We started with $40k debt in June 2016, so we're making decent progress.


I have all income &amp; expenses budgeted through mid-2018, but I would appreciate insight from PF - does anything look out of place or raise red flags for you guys?


DEBT - All debts are federal (student loans &amp; back taxes)

* $4400 @ 6.8%
* $2300 @ 5%
* $21800 @ 4.3%
* $2100 @ 4% 

ASSETS

* $4400 liquid savings
* $1600 Roth IRA
* $500 company 401k

EXPENSES - Monthly

* Rent: $1050 (subsidized; will increase to ~$1300 in August)
* Food: $400
* Car insurance: $70
* Gas: $125
* Wifi: $50

* Utilities: $145
* Renter's &amp; Term Life Insurance: $20
* Cats: $40
* Gym: $30
* Spending cash: $150
* Loan payments: $600 minimum


This works out to about $2700/month. We take home $3950 after retirement contributions; currently we're putting an extra $600 toward the loans for a total of $1200, and the remaining $600 is being funneled into emergency savings and eventually into wedding/honeymoon savings. I'd like to increase the loan payments this summer to ~$1500/month after we've built up the emergency savings.


Our effective retirement contribution rates are 12% and 10%. I expect bump these into the 15-20% range as soon as our debt is paid off, which should be around December 2018. Barring an emergency, by the end of 2018 we should also have around $12000 in liquid savings.
Fiancé and I both have scheduled promotions/raises this summer and are likely to see a gross income of 82k, but I'm trying not to count those chickens before they hatch.


I am hoping with this budget we'll be able to pay off the loans by the end of 2018, travel for our honeymoon in 2019 and purchase a ~$300k home around 2024.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on how to handle debt,"I’m currently $22k in credit card debt. Most of this debt came from my small business which had a really bad year last year. I got stiffed out of a $32k contract $7k contract and another $7k contract. I currently have a lien on one of the $7k contract and working on the lien for the second $7k contract. Problem here is that the lawyer that I hired botched filing the first lien so the lien is recorded but since it’s invalid, it’s very likely that I won’t get any money from that.

My small business, which is a remodeling business, is currently on hold and am currently working a 3rd shift job which pays $10/hr and I get roughly 35-40hrs a week. I have 2 roommates which rent a room from me for $250 each and they share the utilities. I bought my house under land contract which costs me $400/month. I finish paying the house of in August of this year. I have 2 vehicles both of which paid for. No student loans. I’ve gotten 4 little side jobs that has netted me $800 since January. I do plan on trying to get more remodeling projects, but not spending anything on marketing is bringing in leads very slowly.

The debt is spread out on 3 cards.  I can make the payments on 2 regularly. But I’ve fallen behind the 3rd (capital one master card).  I’ve contacted them to defer payment mentioning that I’m expecting money from this lien and that I’ll make a big chunk of payment when I receive money from the lien. 

What I plan on doing is doing a cash-out refinance on my house when I get the title transferred to my name. The issue I have about that is my credit is garbage right now since of those missed payments. When I talked to a loan officer, he said I needed at least good credit so I could do up to 85% LTV when doing a cash out refinance. 

The only family I can lean on really is my aunt. I asked her if she could cosign or take out an unsecured loan for me (I’m currently thinking lending tree) to help out consolidate my debts and hopefully hope my credit score goes up. Assuming I don’t get any from these liens, I’m leaning on asking her to take out that loan for me. Yes, I understand borrowing money from family is generally bad. But she knows that I didn’t squander that money just to party or for nonsense stuff. My business had a bad year. I learned a lot. I’ll secure that loan against my house. And hopefully by the time that I can do the cash-out refinance, my credit would raise up to good and pay off the balance I owe my aunt and whatever else I can zero from credit cards. 

Other than making more money by taking more construction projects, is there anything that I’m missing? I live pretty Spartan compared to what I see from my friends which might not mean much. $150/month in groceries. $80 in gas this year so far. My personal/business phone is costing me $120/month since my old phone died. Internet is $80/month since all which I share with my roommates. No cable. Car insurance $75/mo for 2 cars. I can go do the ramen and eggs diet to lower my grocery cost even further. But no fast food, no eating out, I don’t smoke nor drink.

stocks,Hedge Funds Can't Sue Over Investments in Fannie/Freddie,"Appeals court upholds bulk of ruling dismissing challenge
Stockholders sought to undo mortgage giant’s profits sweep
By Andrew Harris and Joe Light

(Bloomberg) -- 
A federal appeals court upheld a ruling that barred hedge funds from suing to overturn the U.S. government’s 2012 decision to capture billions of dollars in the profits generated by the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after their bailout.

Some Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors still have a shot at money damages, based on when they acquired their shares and whether they did so before or after the Federal Housing Finance Agency was created and then imposed its control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

In place since January 2013, the net worth sweep allowed the U.S. to recapture all of the $187 billion in taxpayer money it spent to stave off the companies’ collapse during the global fiscal crisis and -- by the end of last year -- at least $56 billion more. All of that without reducing Treasury’s liquidation stake in either firm.

A) They were separated into three companies, all managed by the same people, same employees, same location, all doing the same thing. I do believe they fall under the Common Ownership designation for overtime rules.
B) They would force us to work overtime without being paid overtime wages, using their 3-Company setup as an excuse. If we did not work overtime, we were told we wouldn't receive promotions or consideration for higher pay. 
C) Two years in a row, they messed up mine and my husband's taxes. Last year, they didn't take out ANY Federal taxes from my husband's paychecks, resulting in an $800 tax bill. This year, we had a $500 tax liability, even though I had asked them to withold for both of us at a single rate.

I should start off by saying this: we are very fortunate and her parents are extremely affluent. They are willing to buy our first house in cash and then work out a plan to help pay them back like a mortgage with no interest. This seems to make the whole situation much easier, but there is another wrench in the works. We currently live in New England where winters are brutal and houses are very expansive. We currently work at the same company and both make a little over $50k annually. This is a stepping stone job for both of us and in 2-5 years we plan to move to the south where the weather is nicer and property is much cheaper. 

Should we buy a house now only to turn around and sell it as little as a year later (there is 9 months left on our current rental lease) or should we continue to rent until we are ready to move somewhere more permanent? Also, with our salaries around what I mentioned above (~$50,000) what should our price range be considering it will be free of any interest rate?

As the title describes I am in a shitty situation, but i'm not hopeless (or at least don't feel hopeless anyway)!

The move has been a great learning and life experience but has removed the safety net of being able to live at home and cut down on expenses. Currently the fiance and I split all shared expenses down the middle and I am lucky enough to have family helping out the student loan endeavor, but what i'm really looking for is some further guidance on a plan of attack to kill my debt.

personalfinance,How should I save for a holiday while I have debt? (AUS),"Hi all, 

This is probably a very basic question but I would appreciate some input! Im planning in going travelling in early December this year and have a few debts I need to pay off and obviously some saving to do, but was wondering what the best order/plan off attack would be.

I currently own quite a nice motorcycle that if I was to sell would fetch at the very least AUD$9,000 - 10,000. I have $8,000 owing on a personal loan (for the motorcycle, however it isn't secured to the bike) and with an interest rate of 13.89%. I dont have much in savings as most of it currently goes to paying the loan as quickly as I can. My goal is to by the end of the year have as much saved as possible and sell my motorcycle before leaving to give me some extra cash.

My question is, whats the best order to be saving in? Should I be paying off the loan first as quick as possible, and then selling the bike at the end of the year and use that money? (even thought the bike is a depreciable asset?) Should I sell the bike and buy something cheap to use for the next year? (that will depreciate a slower rate due to being old) Should I make minimum repayments on the bike and put the rest in a savings account?",finance
personalfinance,Help with deciding what credits to pay off in what order,"Hello everyone!

So, I just got my tax return and with some major changes to my life (divorce+post military move) I need to redo my budget as well as figure out what order I want to pay off the debts I have. While paying what costs more in the long run would end up being the ""smarter"" choice mathematically, there's some life choices that make this a bit more challenging. The ultimate goal is to get EVERY debt paid before school starts in August, which is mathematically possible currently. I just need to do this intelligently.

I had recently got out of the Air Force and am going to be going to school in August, relying (the aim is solely) on the income generated by my GI Bill. At my location, this income is $1443 (not taxable) a month. This is ONLY valid for the months I'm considered in school full time. ""Break"" months will NOT pay out. 

Currently, I have $7,321.51 in the bank. There's a floating charge for my auto load for $599.36, leaving me with $6722.15; This is my CURRENT liquid assets. I have 2 more paychecks coming in from the military still which will amount to roughly $3,200 in March 1st and 15th. In addition, my new (working there for a week so far) job should pay ~$2000 before taxes, assuming a full 40-hour week. HOWEVER, it's very likely I'll be getting regular overtime with how the schedule seems to work out for other coworkers of my tier. Despite this, I'm considering any OT as additional income for budgeting purposes that will obviously be dumped towards the debt/savings. Expenses are roughly $1,000, I'm currently budgeting through mint to figure it out exactly but I can't see it being any more than $1,200 or any lower than $800. 

I have NO emergency funds or savings standing currently. Additionally, there's a potential $1500 auto repair on the horizon that will be mandatory if the issue worsens (clutch is slipping on a rare occasion, like maybe once in a 30-minute drive within the city). 

My standing debts are... 

1. an Auto loan for $4,387.47 at 12.24% interest, with a $360 monthly payment. Note that the above $599 has NOT been applied to this yet. 
2. A Credit Card with my bank (sadly, damn auto repairs) maxed at $9,088.67, currently at 0% APR until May 01, 2017 to which APR goes to 16.40% (Prime + 12.65%). Monthly Payment is currently just shy of $100 a month. THIS IS MY PRIMARY CREDIT CARD. Note: there's a $295 cash reward sitting there that hasn't been redeemed yet. 
3. A Credit Card with a Furniture Store with a $821.12 balance, 0% APR until July. This is not required to have ANY monthly payment until July.
4. A Credit Card with my old bank with a balance of $1228.39 with an interest rate of 23.24% and a monthly payment of $40
5. Finally, I owe a family member $3,400 by December. Grandma did the whole ""you don't have to"" but that's the deadline I set myself when I discussed this with her. She probably wouldn't hound but I have every intention of keeping my word. 

So there we have it. So lets discuss the options. 

Option A) Pay off Debt #4 cause the interest sucks, then pay off Debt #2 since Interest will kick in there first. Once Debt #2 is done, finish Debt #3, then Debt #1 (continuing payments as required), and finally Debt #5. Pros to this is that it should make the most financial sense when it comes to total $ spent. However, this puts my personal loan with grandma on the back burner, which COULD make me ""default"" on that. Another Con is that this has the highest ""monthly"" payment since it doesn't pay off the car, increasing my monthly budget. So basically, this is the best long term $$$ option. 

Option B) Pay off Debt #4 and Debt #1. Pros, monthly payments plummet (no more car loan) and the biggest interest Credit Card is dealt with. Con, absolute no immediate buffer for surprise expenses, as Debt #4 the card is destroyed. If new job goes south, will be relying on one month of Military pay before being in the ""oh fuck"" zone. 

Option C) Pay off Debt #1, then put the rest towards Debt #2. Pros, lower monthly expenses, as well as provides me an emergency option if needed by using Debt #2 as it's my primary credit card. This is the ""safest"" option, but not the best $$$ option.

Whew, thanks for reading this far. So basically, do I take the safe month to month route, do I take the ""well if shit goes south, good luck buddy, but this is the best, or do I settle some other way?",finance

I'm in the position now where I can completely pay off my student loans.

So I was looking to make a small personal loan of around 2K for a purchase, but as I was looking through the choices, including BMO, HSBC, TD and even RBC, which are all major institutions in canada, and I was shocked to see the Crazy interest rates. I mean, the lowest I found was 14%.

I'm new to this whole lending game, so I don't really know what I'm doing haha. I just don't want to take out this sum out of my account all at once, and would rather spread it out over something like half a year. Should I just make this small financing through my credit card, or are there some big details I'm missing? I've never spent more than 1K on a credit card, and paid it back over 2 months.

personalfinance,~$100k cc / loan debt. ~65k yearly income minimum.,"Hi all,

Not sure where to start this but here goes. Got myself into a pickle over the last ~5 years trying multiple businesses that did not pan out. Have had constant on time payments for ~7 years. Credit history / report look good other than the debt to income ratio. Nearly everything is maxed out or close to it.

My take home income is a guaranteed $5400 (un-taxed) monthly income. It could be more some months (depends on billed hours and I should be getting a decent raise very soon[3-4 weeks]). My minimum payments sum to $5525 (rounded up to the nearest $5 increment).

I have to adjust my payments into the ""grace"" period in order to make it by that month..etc.

My bills / rent is another $2125. This is before eating out / gas...etc.

Every loan/cc except for 1 has a shitty interest rate (above 20%). The one decent one is at 6% (personal loan) with a remaining balance of ~12k. I can work the math and the interest rates myself.

What I would like some feedback on is to see if debt settlement (edit) *negotiations* are worth it. The one I had someone contact me through was through an affiliate company of Peerform. They offer to assume the role of negotiating my debt with my current creditors. This in turn closes my accounts and stops interest accumulation (which is what has been raping me for years). My monthly payment through this program is coming out to nearly half what I am paying now (about 57.35%) but the caveat is that I have to let my accounts go past due for them to negotiate the lower rates.

I have pristine payment history and am really weary about letting my accounts (the ones I will include in this program) to go past due. I am going to keep my longest credit cards as I do not want to close those.

Has anyone gone through a similar program or can offer some advice for my situation. I have been literally paying every dime I make, back to these loans / ccs and it's not getting anywhere.

With this program I can have everything (meaning the settled debt; the amount is set up front) paid off in ~2.25 years.

I'm leaning toward the option of doing it because of the extra cash in pocket I can have and save, not to mention the debt burden relief and not having to pay or worry about 34 different accounts and if there's enough money in the bank...etc.

I'd appreciate some input.

Thanks!

How do you feel about the following:

""**Why debt settlement could be better**

For several reasons, many financial professionals consider debt settlement to be a superior alternative to bankruptcy. One of the principal reasons is the relatively mild effect it has on the typical borrower’s credit score.

When you enroll in a debt settlement program, your credit score is all but guaranteed to drop. The same basic rule that governs the post-bankruptcy credit score drop holds true for post-settlement drops: Higher credit scores tend to fall farther than lower credit scores.

However, the drop you will see after debt settlement is both less jarring and shorter-lived. In general, a program of debt settlement will cause your credit score to drop by about half as many points as a bankruptcy. Since the post-settlement drop is typically less, it’s measurably easier to begin rebuilding your credit after debt settlement than after bankruptcy. Since your credit score won’t be affected to such a serious degree, you’ll have more opportunities to procure the credit you will need to begin rebuilding your financial life.

There are plenty of additional reasons to choose debt settlement over bankruptcy. Whereas bankruptcy immediately becomes a matter of public record and remains open to discovery by your future employers and lenders, debt settlement is an accepted practice that shows you did as much as you could to repay your debts.

The debt settlement process also tends to wrap up within two to four years and may successfully wipe away thousands of dollars in outstanding unsecured debts. By contrast, the consequences of bankruptcy will remain for years. During that time, you may be unable to obtain a car loan, credit card or bank account.""",finance

personalfinance,"Tell me everything I need to know about getting a car, please!","I'm about to graduate college, and I need a car. I have kind of a strange family situation that I should explain first, though. In high school, I wasn't *allowed* to get my driver's license. Once I got to college, I tried to get my dad to teach me how to drive every summer when I was home, but it never really went anywhere. I go to college in a very rural town, and in my state people with driver's permits can only practice driving with people who are 21 or older. Since all of my friends are more or less the same age as me, I only ended up getting my license last summer at age 21. Because I haven't had a car, my job opportunities have been very limited. The town I live in  is so rural that my only job options were too far away for me to walk to (theres no public transit infrastructure, no sidewalks, no streetlights), and student employment is limited to people eligible for federal assistance. Basically, I don't have a ton of money saved up. I have about $3,000 saved from summer jobs, birthday money, and money saved from my allowance. My parents partially pay for school, and the rest of the cost is covered by student loans and scholarships. Despite not having a ton of work experience, I've completed several internships and am heavily involved in student leadership. I've worked really hard over these four years to distinguish myself, and I'm ready to go out on my own, start a career and be self sufficient. However, I know I can't afford a car without help. I'm going to have to ask for assistance from my parents, but every time I bring it up I get shut down. My dad seems to be content to not think about the issue at all, and my mom keeps hinting that she'd like me to live at home so she could *drive me to and from work every day*. I'm 22 and I need to figure out a way to support myself so I don't have to rely on my parents anymore. I'm grateful they've supported me throughout my education, and I know lots of people have to go it alone. However, without a car, I won't be able to put that education to use. If I don't have a car, I can't get a job. If I don't get a job, I won't be able to be financially independent, and based on my experiences with my parents in the past, part of me feels like they're content to keep me at this stage.

Anyway, I want to know all of my options. I want to be able to approach my parents from a knowledgable place and to present them with as many scenarios as possible so they can't brush me off. Both of my parents work, and we're approximately upper middle class. They made it a rule to never talk about money when I was a kid, so I couldn't tell you what either of my parents make. My parents have always leased cars, except my mother's current car, which she purchased in cash she got after my grandfather died. I obviously want to keep my car payments as low as possible, so I've been looking at used cars. In the long term the most important thing for me is keeping the monthly payment low at this point in my life, so while I understand the argument that leasing cars isn't a great investment, for the next few years I think that's a reasonable option for me. 

However, I have been working with an idea for a while that would involve purchasing a used car. I was thinking that my parents could take out a car loan. They'd purchase a used car, and be reimbursed in monthly payments that would eventually pay them back in full for the loan, including the interest it accumulates. The payments would be spread over 56 months, or four and a half years. I actually have a sister who is in the same boat as me. Not allowed to drive in high school, very restricted by my parents. She has no money. She's graduating high school when I graduate college. My plan is for me to contribute a bit of my savings to the downpayment on the loan, and then to pay my parents in monthly installments for two years. Then I'd give the car to my sister, and she'd pay my parents for 2.5 years, roughly equalizing our investments. This gives her two years to find a job (she'll likely go to a more urban college and have wider employment opportunities), and she'd pay off the car about 6 months after graduating college. Once the car is paid off, my parents have the option of selling it and keeping the money, my sister selling it and keeping the money, or my sister keeping the car. I like this idea because it doesn't feel like charity, but an investment that they can either use for themselves or pass along to my sister. The only problem: I don't really understand how to get a car loan, how to calculate the interest on it, or know what kind of downsides taking one out might have for my parents other than the initial investment.

Anyway, this is kind of open ended. Can anyone help me understand better how get a car inexpensively? Does my idea sound feasible? Are there any concepts I should know about before I approach my parents again? I want to emphasize that I really do understand that it's not the worst thing in the world to be supported by my parents, but at this point in my life I want to start taking care of myself, and every time I make moves to do so my parents try to keep me from doing so.",finance

*Macys 167.32
Macys (75%):125.49 
*Care Credit 646.57
Care Credit (75%): 484:93
*Capitol One 764.88
Capitol One (75%): 573.66
*Amazon 1460.29
Amazon (75%): 1095.22

*OR*

Would it be better for my credit score to pay them all off (while keeping the accounts open) except for amazon, with the 25% remaining of $828.77 on my amazon card?

I would lower my ratio either way but is it better to make payments on 4 items on time each month or 1 item?


EDIT:
Here are my interest rates:

* Care Credit: 26.99%

* Capitol One: 25.40%

A store has 8 employees and currently an average item price of 3.65 and allocates 120 hours a week to be scheduled for employees. They decide to make the move to reduce the hours to 115, add an employee (reducing average hours per employee and benefits to some of those employees) and drop the average item price to 3.50. This makes them more competitive with the drop in price, and if they expect they can get the same amount of work out of their employees at 5 less hours then they save a ton of money when you multiply that 5 hours by payrate and then by number of stores.

In theory this all makes sense, and i think many companies have done basically exactly this (on a base level), often many times over in the last few years. My question revolves around how these types of decisions are effected by intangibles that are hard to quantify. 

For instance its easy for me to write up a proposal for any given company using the above strategy and show you how its going to save 100k+ a year. For that I will probably get a pat on the back, maybe a promotion if it works out well, etc, but it doesn't factor in some other things such as:

- Are people less likely to shop in my store since this 5 hours a week that has just been cut will certainly have some effect on the store (messier maybe? product takes a little longer to get on the shelf maybe? They have to wait an extra 30 seconds+ at the register maybe?), etc.

- How much more often are my employees quitting now that they are getting less hours and being asked to do more? Is the time it takes to hire and train them (not to mention their low productivity during the early weeks of their hiring) worth the money im saving on less hours/lower pay?

- How hard is it going to be to retain good managers with the new added stress I've put on them by reducing those hours.

- How much is the store/company effected by the loss of loyalty that will come from the added stress/lower wages, etc. (Bill mightve been tooting the company horn to everyone he met and getting his family to shop in the store when he was making 60k a year and felt he had adequate hours given to him to run his store. He might have more of a ""screw the big bosses"" type mentality when he feels overworked and understaffed at his job)

- When I do get a good manager, have I reduced my chances of keeping them and even promoting them by adding stress to their jobs. Are they more likely to look at outside companies for promotion now rather than promotions at my company (even if outside companies are generally the same, the grass is greener effect makes sense)

Id really like to see some studies and get some opinions on this type of stuff because it seems to me that the reason business is going the way it is (Especially in the United States is because its extremely easy to quantify the profit made with moves like cutting hours to the stores, etc, but very hard to quantify the profit that could be made by doing the opposite. Could companies perhaps be making more money in the end by upping wages and giving more hours out to the stores by not having such a high turnover rate, having improved stores, keeping good managers around and adding some company pride to the people that work there by being a ""great place to work"" or would those types of moves just end up with the same result of people wanting more and more (""Oh the wage for this job used to be 30k and now its 50k, it should be 70k, I'm still mad!"")

Its felt increasingly to me that if I had more hours and better wages to offer my store could head over heels create more profit for the company than I'm currently giving them. Adding an extra 20 hours a week to my store would only cost the company about 200$ and there is just no way that we wouldn't recoup that 200$ by getting the product on the floor a day earlier after deliveries and keeping the store in a better state with more help available to customers and shorter lines, etc. But I mean clearly the people at the top of these corporations are making these decisions for a reason and I'm interested in what research shows on the issue.",finance

personalfinance,"Over $150,000 in debt and about to graduate, no idea how to handle this","I'm about to graduate possibly before October, it really depends on if the school decides to teach the last 3 classes I need to take.

Here's my loan amounts:

Federal: $61,003

Sallie Mae: $91,522.88 with maybe another $15k added before I graduate.
*At least $22,000 of this is interest.

Anyway, I have no concept of how to approach this. My grandma is my cosigner for my Sallie Mae loans and I can't have her pay a single penny. I will hopefully get a job sometime this year. I'd like to stay anonymous on this but based on feedback I'm ready to get a job already in this industry. There just hasn't been any openings for me to apply for.  I've been looking at having a starting pay of $50k with no benefits. After some math, I figured that I would have roughly $2500 per month that can be spent on healthcare and loan repayments. I have no idea how much healthcare would be. I also have no idea how much my loan payments will be per month. I'm guessing it'll be around $2000 a month based on Sallie Mae's loan calculator and the multiple plans offered by the government for repaying the loans. 


My ideal plan is that if I can get a job before I graduate that pays around $50k, I should try to save up as much as I possibly can. Then when the grace periods are over, I can pay a few monthly payments with the money saved up so that way I can never miss a payment if I keep putting money into that savings.

However if I can't get a job before graduating, along within the 6 month grace period, what do I do? How do I handle something like this? I still don't fucking understand why I'm nearly $100k in more debt than my classmates that I started out at the same time as. 


I recently tried to figure out why I was in so much more debt than I should be, and it looks like there's $20-40,000 debt that's just there for no reason in my Sallie Mae loans. I checked, it's not my interest.",finance
investing,"Why is ETF a ""safer"" investment?","Complete finance n00b here.

As far as I understand, ETF basically goes up and down just like the index it attempts to track. Some etf are even less volatile comparing to the index.

But since the index will go up and down randomly, doesn't that mean the etf will just go up and down randomly as well? Say I am a relatively conservative investor, does that mean I should only buy etf if I feel the general market will be going up? Is there any incentive in holding a etf at all?

But reading a bunch articles online, it seems etf is almost like buying bonds that guaranteed to make a very small percentage of money slightly higher than interest rate? Why is it not just as volatile as the stock market?

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my credit card debt?,"Hello PF,

As my income has recently increased, I've been able to start seriously paying down CC debt. My income is $77,000/yr (net $4000 monthly post-taxes and deductions) and CC debt sits at about $9,000 @~17.5% (down from over $11,000). I'm throwing about $1,000 per month at my credit cards right now. The reason I'm considering consolidating my credit card debts is my apartment lease is up in about three months, and I need a stellar credit score to compete for a good apartment. In the city where I live, there are often 10-20 people applying for the same apartment, and the one with the best renter/credit profile will get the place. My credit score has shot up from below 600 to right around 640 since I began my debt repayment, but multiple credit score simulators put me at a score of 750 or higher if I pay all my credit card balances down to $0. If I continue my current trajectory of paying down my debt, I should be debt free by November, but I need a place in June. (I'm so excited to be free from this revolving debt and begin contributing to my company's amazing 401k and Roth IRA.)

I've done extensive [research](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/debt-consolidation-loans/) on consolidation loans, and it seems that after a couple thousand dollars more in payments, once I pass the 670 credit score threshold, I can get away from the loan shark territory (20-30% interest) to a more workable interest rate, around 15% or so. 

Could you offer me your collective insight as to whether or not I should get a consolidation loan to pay off my credit card debt?

personalfinance,Why are my car insurance quotes so high?,"You I'm fed up with taking the bus everywhere, especially with this hell of a winter, so I want to buy a car. 

My credit is good. I know I can get a loan on a car fairly easily, that's not my problem. It's the car insurance that makes it so I can't afford anything. 

I'm an 18 year old male, and got my license when I was 16, I've had it now for 2.5 years. I had my first accident a few weeks within having my license, I just backed up into another car in a parking lot. I then got my second accident about 5 months later. I rearended a car. No one was hurt, the cars were just damaged. 

I have had 0 accidents since then. I have never gotten a ticket, I've never even gotten pulled over. I'm a good driver I just had two accidents when I first stated driving. I haven't had any accidents for 2 years now. 2 years clean. 

Yet every single time I go to get a quote it's around 600$ a month. Why is this? It's actually insane that I have to pay that much? Every single car insurance company who I've called is always shocked to find out I would have to pay so much. Granted, that's full coverage since I would have to buy the car off of a loan, but still. It's insane. It's still like 350-400 just for liability.

personalfinance,Has anyone ever used Unisom?,"**Edit: *Unison, not the sleep aid.***

I'm looking into buying my second house ever later this year with my fiance. We currently have ~12% of what we decided our absolute max ($350k) house price stored away for a down payment. It's largely from my side (I'm an engineer, she's a preschool teacher, guess which pays substantially more.), but that's less of my concern. 

We'd like to buy a house as my lease is coming up on expiration later this year, timing it around then. I had purchased a house a number of years ago through the FHA program. My main concern this time around/knowing more is avoiding PMI if I can avoid it. I know there's things like SoFi, which basically just charge a higher interest rate in order to get a no-PMI loan for 10% down.

Then I stumbled across Unisom.  https://www.myunison.com/how-it-works/ They basically match you up to 10% of a down payment on a house in exchange for 35% of any ""profit"" (profit being increased sell/appraised value) on the home, plus the initial contribution they made. If you lose money, they deduct 35% of the ""loss"" from the original amount they put in as a down payment. They asay you can operate on the full equity of the home.

Has anyone on this community used/heard of them before? It does seem like a pretty decent service, however I'm unsure of a few things. 



* What happens if they go into bankruptcy/hit their own financial woes, do they call in the payment?
* What happens if I'm in a situation where I'm sued for all I'm worth (bad car accident, whatever else), go bankrupt, etc, and have to put my home as collateral?



This service is tempting simply because paying PMI in my head is akin to lighting money on fire. But in the market I'm in, saving for 20% of a down payment is also a huge chunk of change, especially with rents being as high as they are in my area (were we to go find a place together after my lease is up, something with decent space for our tastes in the location we are targeting would easily be 1800-2200+ a month, roughly what even a mortgage **with** PMI is at our max/10% down. 

   
Are we better off just paying a PMI while just paying down more of the principal? I'm largely curious if anyone has heard of/used this service before, and what questions were asked/should be asked of the people there before giving it the yay/nay?

I don't know a ton about student loans so seeking advice from people who have gone through this before. 

My BF has at least 100k in student debt, probably closer to 150k. 
He currently makes 120k a year, and is paying almost exactly $2000 a month. 1/3 of his monthly take home goes to the $2000 in student loan payments.
  
Would consolidation/refinancing be a good idea for him? 

Some other details:

-His father co-signed on a lot of the larger loans. The father makes a little over 100k a year. The father also cosigned for around 20k in student loans for his other son. Has a car payment and $1100 monthly mortgage. 

-My BF started college right as the recession hit so the interest rates on a lot of the loans are at least 6%, with some as high as 10% for the bigger loans. 

-When my BF and his father looked into refinancing/consolidation a year ago, the company said the debt to income ratio was too high. At that point my BF was making 100k. How soon after being denied should someone try again? If it is worth trying again?

Fed loans

I could use some advice on how to move forward. I'm in my early 30's and I just had my $1500 Tax Return taken from a defaulted Student Loan that's gone to collection with GC Services. I've accepted my Tax Return is long gone, but I forgot this loan existed and now I'm panicking as this ""surprise"" loan has essentially screwed up all my financial plans for the next few years. 

**Abridged Backstory:** I went to University between 2008-2010. Dropped out due to personal problems (depression, anxiety, etc...). I essentially became a [hikkikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) until late 2014. During that 4 year gap, I didn't have a real job and didn't pay off any of my student loans, which caused them to balloon because of defaulting and interest.

Now in 2017 things are looking up but I need a plan to get my life back on track and quickly. I've been whittling down some of my loans and have paid about $7,000 into one of them so far. 

Currently I make about $35,000/yr before taxes and I have 2 Loans. One that's now with GC Services and is approximately $8,000 (I don't know the interest rate but I'll find out when I call them tomorrow) and another one through New Mexico Student loans. It's about $19,500 with an interest rate at around 6.3%. 

I don't have any credit card debt and I currently have about $7,250 in my checking account. I don't mind using a good portion of this money to pay off my loans, but I would like to keep a cushion of at least $2,000 for emergencies. 

My only real bills are gas and maintenance for my car which is $100/month, insurance which is $75/month, and $400/month for rent since I'm still staying with my family. That being said, I'm getting sick of my current living situation and have been considering getting my own place soon.

Here is the link to the spreadsheet.    http://i.imgur.com/C8VwKlb.png



*NOTE: This is all in Canadian money, and based on 15000km/year driving.*

For the **new vehicle prices**, that is all in price, after tax (in Alberta), calculated from car cost canada, after adding in 3% dealer mark up.

**Financing interest rates** are real quotes from websites

**Insurance rates** are real quotes, with full coverage, 1000$ deductible. (27 y/o male, 1 collision in past)

**Average fuel economy** is from fuelly.com

**Fuel price** is based on: 0.93c/L for diesel, 1.00/L for gas, 1.20/L Premium Gas

**Maintenance** is an estimate, based on research of vehicle reliability. For new cars, is lower b/c of warranty.

**Depreciation** is averaged from same model vehicles, that are 5 years older then vehicle in question, with 75000 additional km's. (prices from kijiji, knocked off 15% asking price, to account for negotiations).

Interestingly enough, I have found that the cost of owning a new vehicle, over 5 years is only marginally more then a used one!

I just thought this was an interesting little exercise. I really want a new tacoma, but the sticker price is quite high. But considering that even if I buy a used vehicle for 1/4 of the price, it will cost me nearly the same to own it over 5 years.

My mother is a tad bit insane. She's really smart though and offered to help me do my taxes. She did them the past two years. However I just found out that she actually didn't do them at all. She lied and told me she completed them and I wouldn't be receiving a refund so I just let it go. So thats two years of no taxes being filed. Looking back, I was in school for that first year, so i definitely should have gotten something back. Now I need to know in order to file my taxes this year do my previous years also need to be filed? If so, how do I do that? 

I'm also in a huge bind with college. I took classes in 2014, my first and only year. I stopped going because I was supposed to be getting a loan with my father for $8,000 but we got into a huge fight and he refused to help. We haven't spoken since. However I still got stuck with that $8,000 bill. So I signed a promise to pay with my university. I haven't payed them back. I just got a letter from my state attorney General that my university have my debt to the state collections department and I now owe them the money, which after interest is around $8900. I also have student loans that defaulted from the federal government totaling nearly $6,000. 

So to summarize, I haven't filled taxes in two years, defaulted on federal student loans, and was sent to collections for my past due balance with my university.
My only saving grace is that I have been working a lot lately and have saved $8,000 so i feel all hope isn't lost.

personalfinance,Buying a new car with big down payment vs. paying off the remainder of my student loans,"As I am in the market for a new vehicle and have been for several weeks it occurred to me that I should possibly change my tactic 

I was original going to put a big down payment for a new vehicle (like 80% of the total cost) in order to get my monthly vehicle payment right around $100 or slightly below. In this scenario my monthly student loan payment is unaffected and stays at the same rate I have been paying for the past couple of years 

Here's the thing though, rather then use it for a down payment I could potentially use that money to just pay off the remainder of my student loans in one lump sum. 

Now, if I did pay off the student loan I would still need to buy a car I would just be financing nearly all of it rather than my original plan of financing only a small portion of it. My current average interest rate for my student loans is 5.15% and since I have good credit I could almost assuredly get a lower interest rate than that for a new car. I did the math and my monthly cost of car payment + student loan payment would be comparable in both situations, however, in the scenario where I payoff my student loans the balance on a car loan has a lower APR, therefore in the long run I would be saving money accruing less interest (my current student loan payoff is scheduled to continued until 2025 whereas a 60 month car loan would be done in 2022, so 3 fewer years of interest)

Am I missing something obvious here or does paying off the student loan and financing a larger portion of the car make more sense?",finance

personalfinance,15 year mortgage vs 30 year mortgage is effectively a guaranteed 13% annual return on investment at todays rates if you sell within 4 years?,"EDIT2:
Okay, Final Updates, mostly for posterity. 
A professor emeritus from Wharton lays it out better than I do [here](https://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Term/30_years_or_15.htm)  

The consensus is that yes, this is true, as long as your house doesn't decline in value. Most people are confused because they use the logic that it doesn't make sense to pay off a home loan at 4% interest if you can invest in the stock market and get an average 6-8% return over the long haul. THAT IS TRUE. I am not disputing that. HOWEVER. When 30 yr mortgage rates are at 4.4%, and 15 year mortgage rates are at 3.6%, and you take out a 250k loan, opting for the 15 year mortgage instead of the 30yr results in net savings that are equivalent to investing the difference in monthly payments in an investment that yields 13% average annual return, AS LONG AS you were already planning to sell the house in 4-7 years. This is because the difference in monthly payments is approximately $550, or $6600/year. However, the difference in interest rates is 0.8% of 250,000, or 2,000. So by spending $6600 more a year on the principal of the loan (which you get back if your house doesn't lose value, just like a regular investment), you save $2000 in that first year, relative to the 30yr loan. In order to achieve a comparable feat in the stock market and turn 6600 into 8800, you would need a 30% rate of return. In the second year, you compare 4.4% of 246k (the balance on the 30yr loan), against 238k (balance on 15 yr), for total savings of $2256. Although the savings are higher in the 2nd year than the 1st, you are comparing against an investment that includes the investments and compounded interest from the first year. So to arrive at a net total of $4,256 from a 550/month investment over two years, you would need to average a 20% average annual return on investment. In the third year, you need to average 15%. And in the fourth, 13%, and I believe by the tenth year it is still at something like an 8% rate of return. There are lots of caveats though. Primarily, you don't realize any of these benefits until you sell the house, so your investment is not liquid.

Many people have pointed out that buying a house with the intention of selling a house after 4 years is stupid. This is true in many contexts. However, we chose a price point based on the fact that rental prices in my area are quite high and we will actually save money by buying a comparable house, with the intention of selling in 4-7 years, even after accounting for closing costs and realtor fees and maintenance, etc. Also, fully half of mortgage holders sell after 7 years, so I would say this exercise is actually quite relevant for most homebuyers, regardless of the ""stupidity"" of buying vs renting. What this is NOT, is, it is NOT a way to make 13% guaranteed annual rate of return by buying a house. We are comparing two mortgages, NOT one mortgage against no mortgage. By buying a house, compared to not buying a house (and, for instance, living for free in your parents basement), you will almost certainly lose money (i.e., WILL NOT ACHIEVE A 13% RATE OF RETURN). This is called home ownership. And it is also called paying interest. However, if you were ALREADY going to buy a house, and you plan to be in it for less than 10 years, choosing the 15 yr over the 30 yr nets you the equivalent of a guaranteed average annual rate of return anywhere between 8 and 15%, depending on how long you stay in it, and as long as the house doesn't lose its value (because then your 6600/yr ""investment"" is gone, although the difference in the mortgage balance remains). This is 100% not the same as paying down a 4.4% mortgage faster, because you are still paying 4.4% interest, not 3.6%. Paying down a 4.4% mortgage faster is just paying it down faster, it doesn't change the rate at which interest is charged.

I have not accounted for mortgage interest deductions (higher for the 30yr) or capital gains taxes. Half of homeowners don't itemize and therefore never get the deduction, but fully everyone has to pay capital gains taxes, which makes the 15 yr an even better deal for those people. Do the calculations yourself if you usually itemize and get the deduction.  

END EDIT 2

So we are currently renting and are in the market for a house. However, for various reasons, we plan to only be in this next house for 4-7 years before essentially moving into a ""forever"" house (yes we looked at the NYTimes rent v buy calculator and yes we chose a price point based on that, which is about half of what we would otherwise qualify for). I was looking at ARMs and at 15 vs 30 year mortgages when I ran across this little known/advertised fact -- because of amortization schedules, if you sell within a few years, and you can afford it, a 15 year mortgage vs a 30 year mortgage IS A GREAT DEAL as long as you are already maxing out your 401k employer match. Here is an example: todays rate for a 30yr mortgage is 4.4%. The rate for a 15 yr mortgage is 3.6%. Lets say you take out a loan for 250,000 (ignore taxes insurance PMI etc). Monthly payment is 1252 (30 yrs) vs 1800 (15 yrs). After 4 years on the 30 yr loan, you would have a balance of 232,441. After 4 years on the 15 yr loan, you would have a balance of 195,903. That's a difference of $36k that you get back after paying off the bank from the house sale. So I know what you're thinking/asking -- what if you had taken the difference in the monthly payments and invested it? Surely you would get back more than 36k? The difference in monthly payments is about 550, which is $6,600ish a year. Assuming compounded interest on a yearly basis, you would need a guaranteed return of 13% to turn 6600/year into 36,000 over a 4 year period. Thus, getting a 15 year mortgage relative to a 30 year mortgage is essentially a guaranteed annual interest rate of 13%. This is NOT EQUIVALENT to taking out a 30 year mortgage and making the higher payments, because you are STILL paying more in interest than principal in the first few years because of the way it's amortized. This calculation only applies to selling within a few years though, not when you're holding over the life of the loan, since at the tail end you're paying almost entirely principal rather than interest (on a 30 yr loan). I just realized this last night. Someone tell me why I'm wrong before I commit to a 15 yr mortgage.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your feedback!! I wanted to note that this also works regardless of whether the house plummets in value, as long as you plan to actually pay the bank and not foreclose, because you still have to pay the bank. I'm copying and pasting an answer from below:  If you take out a 30 yr mortgage at 250k, and your house plummets in value to 150k, and you sell for 150k after 4 years, you owe the bank 100-17 = 83k. If you take out a 15 yr mortgage, you owe the bank 100-54=46k. The difference between what you owe is still ~37k, so you are still 37k ahead with the 15 year mortgage. Your mortgage did cost you more per month, or approximately 550 more per month, but you've turned that 550/month over 4 years into a total of 37k (equivalent to a 13% annual interest rate), REGARDLESS of whether your home plummets in value. However, if you are willing to just foreclose on a house and walk away in the event of a market crash, that's different.
All that money is still tied up in the house though, that part is true, so you dont realize any gains until you sell, and all of the gains are relative to the 30 yr mortgage. Thats the baseline here. 

Also, someone mentioned that the 15 yr mortgage is an even better deal than it appears, because you don't have to pay capital gains on that extra 37k. Although you no longer get to deduct as much interest paid from your taxes either.

I realize this is sort of mind blowing, which is why I wanted to share. If you are in the market for a 4-7 year house, and you can do it, take the 15 year mortgage! Or a 10 year! I seriously encourage you to do the math yourself and confirm.",finance
personalfinance,Why are two banks writing charge offs for the same loan?,"I had a student loan default. I'm still paying it back but why do two banks have the opportunity to ding my credit twice a year with charge offs for the exact same loan? Please explain the mindset of banks. And why two charge offs each a year?

History:
I took a loan out from my university a twelve ago to supplement the cost of school and what I was receiving from federal loans. It was maybe around $6,000 at the time. It was then given to Firstmark to manage after I graduated. This loan, though dubbed a student loan, was still private and would not consolidate with my federal loans so I was always dealing with Firstmark, and they were not easy to deal with. I was on time with my payments for years. I used up both my hardship leniences (which were only 4 months long each) during the time my mother passed away a decade ago. Then two years ago I lost my job. I called Firstmark to ask them to lower my monthly payments due to my hardship. They refused. I asked different people, I asked for my options, they all said the same thing: you have to find a way to pay us. So I did, I just paid them what I could and not the amount they asked for hoping they'd recognize I wasn't giving up on paying the loan. Well, it defaulted in four months and was sent back to the university to manage (not a third party collection agency).

I wrote the university for my options and they gave me two: Pay double what Firstmark was asking per month or leave loan in default status and pay $50/month until it's paid off. I had to go with the second route and my payments went to the university (aka original lender). It's almost been two years since then and on time monthly payments to university each month with records to prove it.  

Fast forward to today, finally got settled in a decent paying steady job. I'm excited to get my finances on track. I have heaps of federal loans and credit card debt. This little defaulted loan is the smallest sum I owe at $1500. So I contact my credit union for some financial guidance in hopes to get a private loan to consolidate my credit card debt, pay less in interest, and hopefully pay that stuff off faster. My credit score is in the ""average"" area, but I know that's different than a credit report. I learned then about these charge offs. I called university and asked them about it. They said they paid Firstmark in full for the amount I couldn't pay. Okay, understandable. So they got their money back. They didn't lose money on this, why do they have a right to write a charge off? And University is getting their money back plus interest as well, so how are THEY losing money? This isn't a loan that was absorbed somewhere, I'm still paying it back. I just want someone to explain to me why this is happening and the functions behind it.   University stated as soon as it is paid off the charge offs will stop. How can I trust that? Firstmark has no hand in this loan anymore and they still feel happy to ping my credit twice a year. I'm frustrated. I want to be responsible and pay off my debt but the system has these road blocks preventing me from doing this.",finance

technology,It seems I cannot simply have software and technology that works and gets better over time without trying to abuse and misuse me.,"Intense and mounting **abuse and adversarial treatment of customers** is why I found myself starting to not just avoid upgrading to new versions of software, but having to actively defend myself from newer software and technology.



The problem is pervasive, but the tale of how I've been affected by this ""innovation"" across major operating systems is particularly telling.


First came Windows - since forever.  Some transitions were massive and understandably disruptive - like DOS, win 3.1... But then... I was a win 98 holdout for game compatibility and driver problems in XP which took years to settle, then in XP for driver, DRM, and UI bullcrap in Vista; now I'm sticking with 7 because of 8's ""everything's mobile"" bandwagon bid and good lord look at 10, it's a shameful pile of **adware spyware crap** that aggressively overrides your preferences, breaks stuff without warning or permission, and gathers extensive telemetry.  Microsoft haven't offered anything substantive in the OS to the user except more control of your destiny since Windows XP.



Then Apple OS X: a miracle melding of desktop usability, unix guts/dev, and good professional apps that far outshined Linux in 2001.  Most everything after Snow Leopard (10.6.8 by 2011) has been pretty obviously inspired by beancounters trying to turn some hardware upgrade crank.  Concurrent with a bunch of inept, minor, or irrelevant changes,  Apple keeps taking out or breaking features I like, while adding the occasional useful feature that should not break compatibility, but does because *$reasons$*.



So, you're telling me... I have to upgrade the OS to use the new versions of your *purely user-land* **photo** and **slide show making** apps, which then break back-compatibility with their own file formats and libraries, breaking interoperability between your own devices I've bought from you?  SRSLY?  **Big reveal**: no fundamental OS interface *necessary* for **editing photos** or **making slide presentations** has crucially changed for the last ~15 years (~10 if you want to get picky) so this is purely strategic breakage.


Dropping support for PowerPC and 32bit CPUs in due time was fine; violating sound operating system layering principles to lock in your lazy profit strategy is not.  And all the while creeping inexorably away from generalized computation towards the mobile model. *Shudder*.  I can only imagine that everyone at Apple who cared about the vision OS X represented when it came out quit in disgust long ago.




Most sadly for a long-time Linux user excited about the potential for a widely adopted open source desktop was watching Ubuntu being misused ever more to prop up Shuttleworth's shabby business plan - diverting focus and resources from areas of needed improvement and change, forcing excellent devs to devote time to its regressive, derivative, and incoherent UI, all to add a platform for shoving ineffective ads and nagware down the user's throat.  I call Papal bull on that.





""Innovation"" continued, and this style of abusive opportunism spread and intensified.




It went nuclear with the rise of constantly connected service-oriented products.  Now you have ""failsafes"" that automatically break your stuff if someone in corporate somewhere doesn't like the cut of your jib, or you don't upgrade, or you simply dare to disconnect from the Internet for too long.


*Exercise for the reader*:


&gt; Buy a Blu-ray drive for your PC and try to watch a new movie in a couple of years without either having to do something potentially illegal or pay more than the cost of the drive for a service subscription simply to keep the certs up to date so that the hardware and ""compatible"" media you physically purchased continue to work.




Then it went positively, pandemically *post-apocalyptic* with the rise of ubiquitous zaibatsu-style **MegaCorp border-controlled smartphone 'burbclaves** straight out of Neal Stephenson's sweaty tangential nightmares:


Corporation-proscribed telemetry-laden OS, IDE, and libraries monolithically produce apps continuously delivered by the corporate store, the phone as data nexus thus transformed to parasitic symbiote feeding and sucking every detail of social-web-connected activity and behavior through Corporate Mining Operations, using *highly evolved* feedback reward mechanisms to maximize eyeballs-on-screen time for the sake of more output to sell, and with immensely complex privacy and permission controls that may or may not work paired with woefully inadequate tools, little transparency and no effective laws for protection from violation - all designed right in and required for viability in the 'burbclave.



It's a pattern fractally repeated at different scales all the way from the apps running on the platform down to the hardware components that physically make up the devices.




Remember the adage that **if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product?**  I remember being all excited about trying to mostly do business with companies whose business model rests solely on you paying them directly so there'd be no conflict of interest and they wouldn't become adversarial.  Ha ha ha.



**""Innovation"" has seen that restriction lifted** as naïve. Current standard practice is to extract as much additional value from paying customers as you can get away with.  As producer *or* consumer **on any relevant modern platform**, regardless of any agreement you create amongst yourselves,  **nothing can protect anyone involved from having every aspect of their existence controlled, mined, and optimized for monetization**.  If that sounds bad, don't even think about the designs the intelligence community has on this extraction of personal ""value"".



**I am the product - and so are you.**


With such exploitative business models driving design decisions and corrupting implementations, it's little wonder why more and more software and technology has become so hostile, risky, and costly in the larger sense of the rights, control, and freedom that must be sacrificed in order to use it.


Software and technology culture is suffering greatly from this move to monetize people against their will. Working in adversarial models all day inevitably warps the sound thinking of the industry's engineers and software developers, leading to further progress down this dark path. Even the brightest, well-intentioned people are not immune to this, and plenty just don't get it or see the jeopardy.



Companies using such models would have you believe that there's no other way forward, that anything else is unprofitable, too difficult, stifles innovation and progress, drastically slows down the development cycle, etc.


They are wrong, but what else do you expect when the game plan is platform lock-in via service-based ecosystems under continuous deployment?


I'm done with apologist defenses of lazy or intentionally poor development and design methodologies and I'm fed up with the abuse arising from inhuman business models.  We shouldn't have to give up dignity just to participate in modern society.  I know there is a better way, but it is going to take huge changes.



TL;DR: Techploitation has gotten out of hand.  If I want less abusive technology, it looks like I'm gonna have to do it myself.

Today, I switched over my car (2007 ford sportrac title from my dad to me.

I intentionally use little utilities at home. One light on at a time, quick showers, low heat in winter, etc. I feed my self weekly for $30-40. I love inexpenise shirts and pants from old navy, like the $20 4 pack of black tshirts. My hobbys/passion is drawing  comics, which has paper costs of $15 or so and pens and pencils about $2 each. My dog has $50 anti flea/tick pill pack of 6, plus her yearly check up, around $170. Also, my internet bill is $50. Everything else, stays in the bank.

At this point, with all this information, i just want to say I'm terrified of something similiar to 2008 happening. I intentionally live a low key life for that reason, even though my family is affulent and didn't face any economic hardship. But that was then, and obviously I can't see the future

personalfinance,My family got into a huge debt related to mortgage; no idea what to do now (CZ),"Hi. I'm pretty depressed right now, sorry for a sad/depressing post. Will try to keep it short. 

Here's what happened. My family moved from Moscow, Russia to Prague, Czech Republic about nine years ago. It was a huge, enormous effort on my mother's part, because she was the one who did 95% of the work. I don't have a father, and the only other adult in our family is my grandmother, who's pretty old, old and slowly going insane - she contributed most of the money left from her old business, but apart from that she only complicated things, basically. 

We bought a large house on the outskirts of Prague with the money from my grandmother and then proceeded to rent our two flats in Moscow so we had some passive income to sustain us. That was the plan, at least. We also had some reserves left in case something'd go wrong. I was very young back then, so I simply went to school and didn't care about anything, just like most kids my age; my grandmother continued spending most of her time watching TV and dusting some expensive bullshit porcelain cups that apparently used to be cool during the USSR (so she spent 2/3 of her income hoarding this useless shit instead of supporting my coming-of-age mom financially). 

My mother was the only one who actually cared about our future and figured out we won't be able to live off the apartment rent money forever. Because she had troubles learning the language and couldn't find a normal job (she used to be a journalist, but got rejected in the few Russian magazines here - and also hated working ""under"" someone), she decided to start a business of her own. Unfortunately, most of her business ideas were horrible (like buying and selling tapestries, which, if you have no idea, are something like paintings, only made of textile. Mom simply said people in Europe love fancy medieval-looking things and bought about 100 of them right away. That was eight years ago and she only sold like 10 so far. Yeah, I know.). 

Mom's failed businesses were only half the trouble, though. The worst part is what happened back in Russia. First, the people who used to rent our apartment stopped paying. Since the apartments belonged to my grandmother, she was the one who eventually had to return to Moscow for a while to sort it out, as well as to do some personal stuff. Since then she went on several trips like that and had to find new tenants/collect cash/etc each time. On one of her trips she collected a huge sum of money (we managed to sell one of the two flats)... and then invested **all** of it into some shady project which promised highly unrealistic returns (like 150% per year). And yes, the project disappeared shortly after that, along with all the money invested in it. And yes, she lost the contract. 

Yeah, I know.

The thing is, a lot of things depended on that cash. First of all, mortgage. My mom literally begged the bank to give her slightly better (and very unusual, for a normal customer) conditions so she could pay most of it immediately, which would hugely reduce the % we had to pay each month in the following years and made it **way** easier. When the news came, the bank cancelled the contract and made her sign a new one, even worse than the original one. She's been trying to sell the house so we'd move into a small apartment and save some money, but nobody wants it and it quickly became a disgusting, draining, impossible-to-sustain burden.

That was about two years ago. Since then, my family lost almost all of the money that was left and we're getting almost nothing from the apartment in Moscow. My mom's businesses are still failing; I'm trying to get into college and can't get a normal job, only part-time (and even if I could, my salary wouldn't even get near to what we have to pay each month). My mom is **heavily** depressed; she's over 55 now and is absolutely fucking exhausted - partly from trying to hold it all together, partly from her rotting relationship with her mother, partly because she's watching her own life and work getting wrecked more and more with each passing day. The bank doesn't want to lend us money any more; some friends gave us money, but it is far from enough and we don't even have a source of income to return what they gave us. My mom cries herself to sleep every fucking night and casually tells me that the only reason she's still alive is that she wants to be here for me because I'm still young and may need her. She tried to work as a waitress and wash dishes in a restaurant, but couldn't stay there for even a week due to poor health and heavy arthritis. I had a few part-time jobs as well, but didn't manage to stay there for too long for several reasons.

Seriously, I have no idea what to do now. Basically, we're fucked. The only reasonable way out of this pit is to sell the house, but, as I've said, nobody wants it. I could abandon my plans to go to college and get a job, but even a very good starting position that I could hope for would only give me roughly 40-50 % of what needs to be paid each month. I don't even include every day expenses like food and internet. And if I don't go to college, I'll probably get my life fucked up as well in the long run and will get stuck in an office for life. And if we don't pay the debts, we'll probably get our house and other belongings taken from us and won't have where to go. And, considering that our family consists of me, my ill and depressed mom, my retarded grandmother who believes in UFOs and angels and has dire diabetes, and two dogs who need to be fed and taken to a doctor from time to time as well, that would be a **pinnacle of fun**. 

Well, that's it, I guess. Turned out to be a long rant, sorry. Any ideas what to do?

TL;DR: My family moved from Russia to Europe and bought a house; everything seemed fine for a while, but due to some very stupid financial decisions we lost 95% of our money and were left with a huge debt for mortgage and a few lesser debts which are also urgent. Also, our family is falling apart due to some interpersonal reasons, none of us has a decent job to pay the debts and it's getting worse each day. I don't know what to do, and my life's slowly becoming a depressing nightmare (as does my mom's, who is really struggling to get us out of this pit).",finance

personalfinance,Never Ending Student Loans,"Posting for a friend here.  Friend originally had about 130k of student loans after undergrad and law school.  For whatever reason, Friend paid off federal loans first, and 90k @6% of private loans are left after 10 years.  Friend has been on an income based repayment plan, but its been so long that the payment is about to go up significantly (income has not).  Friend really wants to manage payments, and is willing to pay longer/more interest to get lower payments.

Just wanted to make sure I've covered all the options:

PSLF is not an option since these are private.

Sofi and others are not an option since the payback period is so short (7 years or less) which would make the payment much higher than current payment plan.

Friend does own a home, but not much equity so no HELOC.

0% credit cards may be an option, but would require a bunch of effort to maintain and transfer.

Any other ideas for refinancing?  Friend really wants to refinance with a longer amortization, but is not having luck on that end.",finance

stocks,DGAZ DD (Xpost WSB),"Currently I have 110% (100% of my account +10% margin, the most my broker would give me at the time) invested in DGAZ , I recommended to my good friend he also go balls deep and I told everyone on pretty much every natural gas thread to do the same. Here is why.

&amp;nbsp;
  

First, for the noobs, DGAZ is a 3x leveraged ETF that trades inversely with Natural Gas. so if Natural Gas goes down 1%, DGAZ goes up 3%. So for the remainder of the post I'm going to talk about price action of natural gas. remember, down good, up bad.

&amp;nbsp;


###Bearish Fundamentals
- Currently we have a 4% surplus over the 5 year average in the national stores of natural gas.   
- The next 4 weeks we have a projected draw of [-218](http://www.celsiusenergy.net/), compare this to a year ago when we had a draw of over -550. Less than half.       
- Coal production is being improved by the trump administration (shaky argument, but worth noting. probably not immediate enough to impact the price too much)    
- All that snow that got dumped on California? did you read how the dams are close to bursting? yeah those are cranking out hydroelectric power right now, which is displacing NG power there.     
- Open your door and realize the average temperature outside is 66 degrees for the US. in February. whos using natural gas right now?     

&amp;nbsp;


###Bullish Fundamentals  
- exports to mexico have been improving all winter, and we are currently close to exporting our maximum amount until transportation increases   
- A particularly warm winter may buoy hopes for a hot summer   
- There may still be hope for a cold snap  

&amp;nbsp;

###Technicals   
The [weekly chart](http://imgur.com/a/rNso0) shows us in a downtrend. you can tell because the indicator at the bottom called TSI is going DOWN. when TSI crosses over zero, generally price movement INCREASES. When you look at this chart, take note of that giant black line I drew, that's the support line. see how we bounced off that many, many times? that's currently about 7-8% below our current position. **that's going to be our first sell point if you're a pussy for 22% gain on DGAZ.** If we break that support line, this shit is going to the moon.

&amp;nbsp;

 This is the [daily chart](http://imgur.com/a/ghBRq). notice how it was oversold yesterday after that monster 10% drop? it bounced technically off our support line and today the chart 'breathed' to reset the RSI/TSI. This sets up the next big movement. **near term we may retrace if we get more cold weather, or if the reports are much more bullish then expected, but I don't expect either**.

&amp;nbsp;

###NEAR TERM CATALYSTS  

So when are we moving down again? Every Thursday the feds release a ""draw report"" that shows the national Natural Gas usage and storage levels. This comes out at 10:30am.  

- This Thursdays report is [reportedly bearish](http://www.celsiusenergy.net/p/weekone.html), one of the most bearish in 22 years for that week. This could already be priced into the 10% drop down, but I have a feeling that drop is is more due to the reduction in the probability we get another winter storm.  
- [Next Thursdays report is going to be a blood bath](http://www.celsiusenergy.net/p/weektwo.html). Its supposed to be an injection (they are adding) 6BCF of natural gas to stores. ADDING NATURAL GAS TO STORES. DURING FUCKING WINTER.  

&amp;nbsp;

  You should be saying, but asshole why the fuck are you so special in reading these reports? Can't anyone read these projections and trade accordingly?  Yes. but the weather is turning warmer, and the projections are rising, and we are in a downtrend. Seeing 'projections' and actually having the report in your hand that says ""you're fucked"" are completely different. Once these bearish reports come out and are confirmed the price should plummet.

personalfinance,College student who's father (single parent) is chronically ill and unable to return to work.,"Background information: Currently a full-time sophomore attending a rather expensive institution on scholarship money. I pay roughly $10000/year out of pocket, which is money that has come from previous internships and jobs that I worked prior to starting this year of school (I worked 35 hours/week during high school). I stopped working this year due to a heavier course load that required more time and attention to achieve the grades worth the price of the tuition. Currently no loans, but that may change because I only have about $5000 left in my savings. I do not qualify for federal aid (FAFSA). I'm a commuter and live at home with my father and older brother, both of whom were working full-time prior to November of 2016. In exchange for my father paying for my brother's schooling, I do not have to contribute to monthly bills (water, electric, phone, insurance etc.). I can estimate that the bills total to roughly $2000/month. 

In November, my father was diagnosed with an advanced illness carrying a poor prognosis (&lt;1 year). He progressively became more de-conditioned and in December, was laid off from work due to budget cutbacks at his job. He made about $70,000/year, but has very little savings due to spending most of his income on my brother's education. My brother is continuing to work as we alternate staying at home with my father to take care of him. He makes about $50,000/year, but he only started working 6 months ago. 

Unfortunately, during this very rough patch in our lives, reality still exists. Medical bills, house bills, groceries etc. are beginning to pile up, and we need some assistance with only one family member earning money, one a college student, and the other with a serious illness. For this reason, I wanted to reach out to ask what assistance programs there may be available for my family? I've not very well-versed in personal finance, and am only mildly familiar with things like disability insurance, unemployment benefits etc. Any and all advice is very much welcome and appreciated.",finance

* First off, I have a (state) tax lien on my report. Issued in 2012 and paid off in 2013 (involving overpayment of unemployment due to a stupid, stupid mistake on my behalf for ~$700). I've read several things about removing tax liens, the fresh start program, etc., but all only seem to pertain to federal tax liens. It's my understanding that this *should/could* fall of my report after 7 years, but have read they can remain indefinitely. Any pointers or suggestions on the best way to go about attempting to have this removed from my credit report?


* Secondly, I have an (medical) account currently in collections. I just have questions about how this could/should play out. So the ""brief"" explanation is I was rear ended in an automobile accident in 2015 and had to go to the hospital for a neck and lower back injury. The guy was obviously at fault and had insurance (through the taxi company he was driving for) but every one highly recommended I seek an attorney, which I did. So after going to the hospital and dealing with insurance companies and the attorney and all that fun stuff, I was told by the attorney that the hospital is aware that this will be handled by the other party's insurance and to disregard medical bills. So sure enough medical bills started showing up, and I disregarded and brushed them off. Well fast forward nearly a year and a half and there was finally a settlement and everything and I find out there is a portion of that settlement designated for paying off the medical bills. So confused, I start digging around and come to find out the bills hadn't been paid, and they are now in collections. No letters, phone calls, anything. After discussing the matter with the attorney, I supposedly received a form of some sort from *my* insurance provider, right around the time of the accident, that I was supposed to fill out and send in and I guess they'd cover the hospital bills, and later be reimbursed by the other party's insurance or something. I never got this form. So after all this time, the attorney has spoke with a rep at my insurance provider and they agreed to resend me the form and resubmit the claim or something along those lines. I'm still kind of confused. So I guess what I'm asking, is (assuming I provided enough info), does anyone know how this will play out? Will the account be removed from collections? Will it still be on my report? 

Any help or suggestions or knowledge on the matter(s) in general are greatly appreciated, as always. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Junior College Student Struggling with Debt,"I'll try to keep this short...I dropped out of college due to depression and a trove of emotional abuse from my parents. I simply couldn't keep focused in school with the amount of financial hardship my parents were putting on me. I lost a significant portion of my financial aid mid 2nd year (Parent Plus Loan) due to my parent's credit score tanking after finding out numerous accounts that went into collections. In addition, I also figured out from the financial aid department at my university that my parent's claimed a credit refund for courses that I took at college without me knowing. I am not sure of the exact details, but supposedly the usage of grants &amp; loans ""overpaid"" for tuition and thus, the residual amount was refunded to whomever had their checking/savings account applied to my student account. As for what these funds were used for, I am not sure.

I am currently taking courses at a community college in hopes of obtaining a bachelor and have completed coursework for an Associate's degree. However, this was not without a cost.

I have itemized a list of expenses occurred during this time. For reference my annual income is around ~$11,500 and is contingent on the hours given to me at a certain job. (I have 3 jobs - 1 of which I work part-time and the rest, below part-time hours).

So they wrote a check to the auto company whom disclosed my credit score to them (WTF?) without even telling me and then assisted me in purchasing the vehicle. I was just shocked that the auto company disclosed my personal finances to them with the reports they pulled up.

FedLoan: $32,711.09 Monthly Payments: $319.13 - Considering IBR plan, but if I were to get a well paying job in the future could I switch plans or pay more than the monthly amount?

Credit Cards: (Primarily used for tuition, books, and school-related expenses).

Capital One QuicksilverOne: $479.16 Open, $25 min/paying $30 per month.
Platinum MasterCard: $481.59 Open, $25 min/paying $30 per month.

Community College: $615/$205 for 3 mos.

Medical Bill due to Examination: $200 for 3 mos. I only have one last payment of $200 on this.

Parents: Expect $150/mo. due to the check they wrote out and Filial Piety. My parents are Asian for cultural context and have been literally asking me non-stop for money every other Friday to pay back the rent for the townhouse I am staying in, the check they wrote out for the car, etc. 

As of the moment, I am struggling to get by. Although, I get to live in a townhouse with my parents -- it's just so damn toxic and hurtful to my mental health to deal with their demands. I have been sleeping way less than usual, waking up constantly exhausted, and am constantly having anxiety issues with bad ideas of self-worth. It really sucks constantly having to deal with statements such as ""You owe us money, give it back next Friday and pay us every month"" &amp; ""When you get a good job, buy us a house etc. etc."" My parent's will not listen to my financial situation and I see that this lack of communication is reflected in their finances as my father has pulled out numerous loans and credit cards only to become overwhelmed and eventually ignore them. I don't want to follow in my father's footsteps but as of now, it feels like their financial hardships are continuing to rub on me and there's simply nothing I can do about it.

In total, combining both federal and private loans, I owe $85188.68. Currently, my monthly payment is pretty high at 896.14, and was hoping for this to be lowered. 
I didn't really have much guidance when taking out loans for school, so not really looking to be scolded at for my current financial situation, just advice to help better it. I listed out how my loans are looking now below.

&amp;nbsp;


Some specific questions I was hoping to have answered: 


1. Should I consolidate/refinance my federal loans and loans from Bank 1? What are the advantages/disadvantages of this? Not entirely sure how consolidating works.


2. Would consolidating lower the interest rates on these loans as well?


3. When loans are consolidated is it done per loan giver or would they all come together into one? For example, all my federal would consolidate to one bg federal loan or would they combine with my private loans?


4. Are there other options, besides consolidating, that I should be considering?


5. I have heard of the snowball and avalanche methods. Is one of these methods supposed to work better than the other?

investing,Margin (Buy and Hold),"How many of you use margin?  I just looked into it a bit through my Schwab account and was a bit turned off to see that the interest rate is between 6 and 8.5%, depending on the size of your account.  This is about the average return of the market, which makes it seem like leveraging an index fund would be fruitless.  Meanwhile, you have amplified your risk quite considerably.  

Those who do use margin, has it gone well? Did you buy in 10% correction? Do you plan on holding forever?  Did you lump sum or DCA? Are you fully levered and if not what is more appropriate?",finance

personalfinance,NAVIENT Student Loans: Can someone help me understand how interest is being calculated on my loans?,"Hello! I am having a hard time understanding exactly how interest is being calculated on my student loans from Navient.

I currently have 5 loans that I am paying off, down from 8. To keep things simple (and not share too much personal information), I will only share information from two of these loans.

Issue is that the amount of interest I am being charged every month doesn't make sense to me. For 3 of my loans, the fixed monthly payment being paid towards the loan stays fairly consistent month to month (though it does change here or there), and no interest is accruing. The monthly payment amount being paid towards these loans shows 100% goes towards interest and interest only. No principal is ever paid down on these loans unless if I opt to pay extra. If I do pay extra towards the principal, the fixed monthly payments after that still continue to just pay interest only.

The two other loans make more sense. Interest accrues as expected (for the most part). These two loans are also the only loans having payments go towards the principal. One loan (not featured in this post) is the highest interest loan which I am currently focused on paying off, and pay extra towards the loan every month. The other loan is the lowest interest loan (see below), which I rarely pay extra towards, but tends to have a small portion of the monthly fixed payment goes towards the principal.

-----------------------------------------------

***Example:***

Excel snapshots are provided below. The grey header columns is data directly downloaded from Navient and has not been altered. The blue header columns are the ones that I added.

-----------------------------------------------

**Loan 1 (lowest interest): Interest rate = 5.16%**

This loan is the only loan where the fixed monthly payment is actually paying down the loan principal. You can see the monthly interest accrual they are charging me is pretty consistent with the [formula on their website](https://www.navient.com/loan-customers/interest-and-taxes/how-to-calculate-your-interest/) found under the Calculated Interest column.

[Loan 1 Snapshot](http://imgur.com/UCSEVxl)

-----------------------------------------------

**Loan 8 (second highest interest rate): Interest Rate = 6.16%**

With this loan, we see that the monthly payment does not vary often. However, based on my interest calculations based on the formula, I am actually underpaying in interest (under Interest Difference column, the orange highlight means I owe Navient interest money, red means that Navient owes me interest money for that specific transaction.) Two times I paid extra towards the loan (highlighted in yellow under Transaction), and it overcharged me in interest for that transaction. It seems to be trying to play catch up for undercharging me interest for the previous months (if you compare all the time I was undercharge up to the amount I was overcharged, it comes out about even). I am not accruing interest on top of the principal, so I am confused exactly what's going on.

[Loan 8 Snapshot](http://imgur.com/Dgpn2HB)

-----------------------------------------------

Overall, it looks like interest accrues as expected when any amount is paid towards the principal. When only interest is being paid off and the principal stays stagnate month to month... the math gets fuzzy. I also think it's interesting that the only loan designed to get it's principal paid down through the fixed monthly payments is the lowest interest loan. The other higher interest loans never have any amount paid towards the principal through the automatic monthly payment.

**TL;DR: I don't understand how interest is being calculated on my Navient student loans. Can one of you very smart and awesome people tell me what I am doing wrong or how I should be interpreting this?**",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out what the best avenue for high interest for my fiance's credit card is. We've got the option to transfer part of the balance to another card.,"So, here's the lowdown.

We've been battling down one of her credit cards from before we met.  Currently at about $6400, interest rate is killing us at 16.49% Variable.  That added about $90 a month just in interest last month.

Fiance has another card with a different company that has no balance.   $2000 limit with one card that's completely paid off.  That card has made us an offer to transfer balances.

The offer is the following:

 - 0% APR until 4/1/18 with a one-time fee of 4% ($80).
 - 3.99% APR until 1/1/19 with the same one-time fee ($80).

After this, the interest rate rockets up to 24%.  Either way, we'll have it paid off by the time that kicks in.  So, I'm not actually too worried about the high interest after the promotional period.

What I'm trying to figure out is if we go with the 0% offer, how much are we actually saving over the course of the next 14 months?

Sorry for reaching out in advanced.  Every time I run the numbers, I seem to come up with it a different way.  Kinda over my head here.",finance

financialindependence,The balance between happiness and saving...need some advice from others in this position.,"Hi folks,  
  
A year ago I finished the Bogleheads book, then finished the Simple Path to Wealth, after which I totally revamped my finances. Now I'm not as good as some you yet but my savings are a total 180 of what they used to be.  
  
Quick background. I make good money currently. Maxing out 401k, HSA, ESP(10% discount), and max out a Roth every year. I own a small condo and lease a car(I know I know but I grew up poor we always dealt with broken down cars, it's a personal thing).  
  
Now, my question that I'd like some opinions on. I absolutely love the mountains where I live. Every time I come back from spending time at a friend's family cabin I realize how much happier it makes me when I'm out in the wilderness with no people around, no cars, city lights, or noise. It's almost as if I forget the thing that truly makes me happy if it makes sense.  
  
I recently found a piece of land with a small cabin on it. It's a really near looking thing, no utilities yet but I definitely don't mind. When I saw the listing I new this is it, this would perfect.  
  
**The problem.**  
After talking to a lender I was told that because there is no utilities, it's considered vacant land and I would need at least 25% down and the interest rate is 7%!!! There is no other option. This was a big bummer, I didn't realize they treat land differently. So now my last resort is to take out a line of credit or equity loan whatever she said it was on my mortgage for the down payment, but then I would still have a loan of 7%.  
  
**The objective side:**  
Off the bat it's a bad thing. Don't make more debt. And you'll have a payment of ~$500 a month on a 7% 15yr loan. Not sure how loans work on your house, but my mortgage payment will go up obviously on top of the $500. Plus small insurance fee on the little cabin.
  
**The ""feeling"" side trying to justify it:**  
I make good money and can afford a $500 payment no problem. Plus, I can funnel my bonus into the loan as well as my ESPP that pays out every year roughly $4800 twice a year. Yes stock prices vary but just a ball park. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to secure the 20k equity loan if I need to. Having a small place I can go to quite often sounds amazing. It borders BLM land with tons of hiking, snowshoeing in winter, having good times with friends etc. Every damn time I come back from a cabin trip I get this feeling that I need something remote to make my happy place.  
  
Some of you might want to punch me because the objective side wins no doubt. I can't help thinking that I want something like this, obviously it's long term. Upside, I have a best friend that is willing to go in with me. I would still need the equity loan to make the downpayment, but the loan payments will essentailly be $250 each.  
  
I just need some opinions. Has anyone done this? Bought land or something because it makes you happy and is not necessarily in line with saving?",finance

personalfinance,Saving for a house down payment,"Hi Personal Finance! 


I've recently decided to get serious about my finances and saving for a down payment on a house. I would really appreciate your sage financial advice on the best choices I can make to save for a down payment and correct all other financial mistakes I'm sure I'm making. My current financial and living situation is not what it was just a few months ago. I've been a longtime lurker on Reddit and PersonalFinance more recently, but not a contributor so please forgive and help me with formatting and etiquette where necessary.  


I'm a 28 year old single male making $85,000/year working for the federal government with a bi-weekly paycheck. I'm going on 7 years with the federal government (not the same agency the entire time) and feel very secure in the position with expected decent raises each year (6%?) and a bonus, but I'm not considering that into any calculation because I have no idea what it will or won't be.


I'm maxing out the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) with a per paycheck contribution of $693, the government matches 5% of my salary for a total contribution of about $855 per pay period. I'm currently 100% allocated and contributing to the S fund (small-mid cap US stocks, mostly). The current value is $61,000. I have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and a Health Savings Account (HSA) which the government contributes $62.50 per month to and I contribute $101 per pay period which should also max it out to ~$3,400 per year. I have about $800 in the HSA and will invest it in an index fund when it reaches $1,000 as per the rules. I do not have an IRA, but would like to open one eventually.


I don't know what my exact, stable, per per paycheck net take home will be due to payroll mistakes during a recent promotion and the calendar year Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) increase, but it should be close to $1,700 per paycheck. I should know what it is by the next pay check. A rough per month estimate is $1,700/paycheck * 26 paycheck/year / 12 months/year = $3,683/month net.


My best estimated, rounded up, fixed monthly expenses are:
* Car payment: $684

* Car insurance: $100

* Car registration: $60

* Car gas: $215

* Car oil changes: $30

* Netflix: $13

* Pet care: $70

* Food &amp; utilities: $300

* Credit cards: $0 (I pay off in entirety every month).


The total is $1,472/month. I'm currently living with my parents and brother so I don't have a rent payment. We cook at home and tend to buy very healthy (high priced) food. Combined with utilities, I'll be contributing an estimated $300/month to my parents for food and utilities. This leaves $2,211/month unallocated. Fudging $211/month for unaccounted for expenses leaves $2,000/month for saving for a down payment. Housing prices in my area are extremely high relative to my income (in my opinion) with an average price of $1,000,000/house. If I can get a 5% down payment loan, that is $50,000 which will take about 2 years to save via my basic calculations. I don't plan on buying a $1,000,000 house, but I think $50,000 is a good goal.


What can I do to improve the amount I save for a down payment? Should I reduce my TSP contribution to the minimum, fully matched amount? Considering taxes (very roughly), this would net me about $370 per pay period. Should I stop contributing to my HSA? Considering taxes (very roughly) this would net me $70 per pay period. Over a year, combined this would be about $11,000. Would reducing my contributions be a good idea to increase my savings? I'm fairly sure it's a terrible idea.


How should I store my savings? The safe bet seems to be in a high interest, online savings account. I'm open to suggestions for which one to choose. I'm considering a bond index fund for better return or even a stock index fund for the best possible return, but very risky. Opinions? 


Additional information: 


Clearly my vehicle (2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Hard Rock) is my biggest expense. I owe about $44,000 on it at a 3.48% interest rate with about 6.5 years left on the loan. My Discover credit card account has my FICO score at 809, my Mint.com account has it at 791. I'm sure I'm currently underwater on the loan so I probably can't refinance it at a lower rate until I'm not underwater. Do you have any advice on this to pay less over time? Should I prioritize paying this loan or just pay the minimum because the interest is so low? I don't foresee any major expenses on this vehicle for many years. I have a new set of all terrain tires and studded snow tires to switch between for the next few years. On a non-financial note, I'm very happy with my purchase because I enjoy my 70 mile/day commute (more than I would have with my previous beater vehicle), am much safer driving in a winter environment, and have rescued several drivers already who couldn't safely handle the environment (karma). My previous car (2006 Ford Taurus with 60,000 miles) was costing more per year in repairs than its Kelly Blue Book value so I traded it in as a down payment on the Jeep.


My checking account is abysmal with about $4,000 in it. I have no other savings accounts. I have three credit cards with about a $20,000 limit on each. The PF flowchart says I need to increase my emergency savings to 3-6 months expenses. I'm, perhaps naively, thinking my down payment savings can double as my emergency savings, for the time being at least.


I, perhaps naively, focused on paying down my moderately high interest student loans before saving for emergencies and a house down payment. I graduated with a bachelors in 2010 with about $80,000 in loans and paid them off in 2016. I earned a masters, with the government's help, in 2012 which helps my current financial situation.


Thank you for all your advice; I really appreciate it!

Bitcoin,"an ""open source"" generic offline Linux QR/2key generator and secure cold storage wallet that is small portable quickly acquired and easy to use.","A Bitcoin Root for Linux/Android Phones

 A  simple Ledger Program and Offline Bitcoin Address/2Key Generator With a Friendly Integrated GUI Written in Linux and Installed on a Cold Bricked Android Phone.

   Let me briefly introduce myself, . I am a 10 year Linux PC user (Fedora, Mint, )  which I installed myself through time on various old PCs , Laptops, and Netbooks either online or by usb. . I am trying to find someone who might be interested in writing a:  Rooted, Data bricked, Linux Android Phone Program for me, 

The program I am proposing and putting forth to the current Linux Open Source, community, for help on would be installed on a unwanted older android phones,

The exact program is  “a Linux,  “Open Source”,  Offline Bitcoin Account Ledger &amp; address QR code generator with a save to memory capability for backups   These Backups can be done offline either through tether/usb to offline computer to usb thumbdrive, or to offline printer for paper backup, or without tether, to an already existing external SD card slot if available.  And lastly it would have a friendly simple integrated ledger GUI.” 

  It's a vary small program root and total install, intended to be installed upon a rooted android device which is then immediately wiped clean of the pre existing software file system.  The pure Linux open source program would then upon installation as a whole program be vacant and devoid of any files designed to recognize any data transfer capabilities of the physical phone hardware itself” After installation it becomes unaware of such things as bluetooth and wifi, hardware. Thus it cannot transfer data .  .  The phone is no longer a phone and it does not, nor ever will again' transmit data, for lack of a better term I am calling this cold bricking a phone, . The only means left of communication would be through the screen/camera of a single displayed QR code.,  This program is intended and permanent unless a re root and re installation is done.  The Cold storage function has been ""air gapped"" The proposed program is so basic in its entire existence.   It would easily not over exceed nor ever tax any current cell phone's memory resources or processing requirements.  The more minimal and simplistic the entire program the better its meant to be a simple device.  Free to the masses in need.

   Some of the bottlenecks of the current growing Bitcoin system i can see existing in the world today are

!. It's current lack of a simple use for the common man.
2. It lacks of security for the first time user.

  My reason for wanting to make this open source and free and easy is that it might help many people in emergency situations around the world today. Im hoping to make Bitcoin more immediately accessible to this population and the global community as well. This software upon root installation”  should provide A safe and secure alternate currency offline cold wallet with quick reliable immediate access to all currently existing online crypto currency exchanges within the global network,.  one can then use those existing exchanges to transfer with other entities such as ATM and personal one on one trade as well.and then one can safely secure ones funds and private keys offline.  . 

  This cold bricking physically changes the devices hereafter purpose and function permanently.  The old device is now a new device.” 

An installed Bitcoin QR code offline generating software program should also have an easy to use user friendly GUI through a Account Books/Ledger GUI.   . In the background it would run a Bitcoin Address/2Key offline creation program letting the user have the final 2key QR code image upon users command.  It would use camera QR code transfer input and phone screen QR code transfer output  The Account Book GUI will prompt the user for type of transfer and amount.

In the end you should have a secure offline cold wallet, portable, with internal offline QR code generating capabilities.

  Why I personally want this program, . 
      The Bitcoin phenomena itself has shown that a globally owned currency might be of good use in our world today.  Especially in the areas of rescuing localized economic fiat collapse. For a large percentage of citizens living upon within these regional local communities (communities such as Venezuela and Greece 2017). It has in very recent modern times shown that BTC might be be a possible economic rescue tool. 
     The gold and silver community have always believed that precious metals could be used in times of economic collapse, And a long history would dictate their reasoning to be a possible valid and working system.   . But as of late there has been a new competitor in this arena of economic relief brought on by the advent of industrial computerization and the world wide web, . This digital global currency system currently BTC may in fact help all of humanity as a tool in stabilizing stressed individuals within collapsing economies.  I believe both systems (precious metals and BTC) are valid opportunities and tools for economic rescue,  And both can be tried. The Global Digital System is a new one yet to be looked into and fully tried.

   In countries today such as those afore mentioned, We as of now currently can find a small percentage of the population experimenting with this global digital currency as refuge while their local fiat slowly collapses around them. This new global BTC currency system may be a large step forwards in protecting many local communities during economic duress in the near future. But it is not widely used amongst these troubled populations.

The problem I see in this new Global BTC System,  is in its infancy and growing pains it still lacks ease of use, and availability, which then leads to mistakes in security of assets, 

  Today, as of this date, . in order to acquire and secure your digital currency in the event of an emergency,  You must be tech wise concerning all the avenues of online and digital offline cold storage transfer. You must then purchase an airgapped  cold wallet device and you must learn how to use and correctly manipulate this difficult technology, To do this You can download apps that are simply more middlemen in the system of exchange and some not cold secured. , Some apps are better than others, but most fail at differing points.  If you do not use and learn how to tranfer amongst apps into total cold storage where you own your private key, Then  you can learn make a linux bbotable usb, .and generate offline addresses. then From a laptop or PC, making paper copies on a printer or save offline on digital format, You must then also know the correct ways to transfer and connect this digital data without losing it. (sweeping/importing).  For the common man this task is currently daunting and time consuming. 

   I believe this small open source program largely helps answer the “availability and ease” for most citizens in todays world  whether in distressed economies or not,  It would also stand to reason that the faster the individuals within an economicly distressed population can get onto a mass globally supported reserve currency,  The sooner their people can begin to repair their local system.   Once a local community fixes their economic problems the local people by nature while on BTC should then migrate back into the repaired local system. They should migrate naturally back once it becomes more desirable again at a local level, . as long as both systems (global and local) co exist and if the global currency is always freely open to the citizens across the world to invest in at will freely decentralized and anonymously,  the global digital currency may have possible avenues of a stable reserve rescue for those in localized economic distress. 

   Yet, . .  as I said it needs  at this current time to be more quickly and readily available and easier for the people to use. This is whats lacking in the system as I see it, . . I dont think this new global digital currency is an answer to all and everything, . . . But I do believe it has its advantages. If you have a global wide increased acceptance and use of BTC on a grand geographically diversified scale

   What I have done so far , . I have taken an old beloved and reliable android phone laying in my drawer, (a Samsung sch1200) and without rooting it, and by simply downloading two apps from the google play store , I have successfully made it a secure Bitcoin cold storage offline wallet that generates Bitcoin  addresses and keys offline, it has a QR code scanner though the phone camera and a screen to display before said QR codes.  The device I now have was inexpensive, widely available, and gets easier for me to use for BTC transactions every day, It also securely saves all my BTC offline where I am in charge of protecting those assets myself. 

   It is an offline bitcoin QR generator and cold storage device.

   So if I have done this already why am I asking the Linux community for help.

   The one I have right now is tedious as I have hodge podged it together with various apps and must manually create and move my QR data around between apps and ledgers.  I Scan a QR code with “QR-Droid”  save it manually, cut and paste both adresses and keys. Then save them on a word processor doc.  All my addresses key pairs are then saved on individually named docs like unto a digital paper wallet and finally integrated into a single folder for cold storage backup, 

As a side note for “random QR code adress and bitcoin key generation” I must, open a previously installed browser “Opera Mini” and the generate the random Bit address and QR key set from the previously saved offline page “bitaddress.org”, (I believe its a simple jave script HTML program, but im not sure), 

   I have successfully and easily then there after moved funds to my Coinbase and Mycelium accounts and back again,  cross platform with no problems and great efficiency and ease,  Its totally offline portable code generation and cold storage . IT works well for me, I am in control of my private keys, I also easily back up my data, and I do it often, .  every time I generate a new key set I back it up to an external SD , . . and its extreamly portable.

A simple ledger checkbook offline QR cold storage system that creates and manages offline private keys in the background on a reliable no longer used dormant  phone, since old phones might fail as in any technology, , (But mine is running strong), It has backup capabilities to either the existing usb tether or if so equipped and my favorite, . external SD card.

  In closing I will say, . . .I have the utmost respect for the Linux open source community as a whole,. The only way I would ever pursue this endeavor would be through them, .  any other way will not do.


   And if by now it falls to nothingness like dreams never written ,  . . .At least I would urge you all to go to any nice high spot overlooking all people spread across your local community (city or town).  Look out upon it, and then ask yourself, what would happen if these my friends below found out they had lost their local fiat currency suddenly all at once today.

  And if you don't do that, . .  Meh, . .I still have the utmost respect for you anyways, and its all good, . .  yeah I just went Crazy today,

personalfinance,Oh Lord Have Mercy,"I'm going to try and keep this short, but believe me it's kind of a lengthy tangent.

I've been going to college for ten years, and there's a lot of bad reasons why that's still a thing; especially since I don't have a Bachelors to speak of. I'm in a new school right now and will be completing my first year (with probably two more to go plus summer school). 

I've been living off of financial aid like a fucking idiot because I wasted the first six years of financial aid on nothing. I was a young kid and did not know what to do. I goofed around, failed several years and stopped showing up for some of them.

I've learned my lesson, I'm not here to fix my mistakes, I'm here to ask for advice on what to do next.

I'm quite sure this is my last semester for receiving financial aid, and I'm not surprised in the least. Although on the other hand, I have applied for financial aid again. I'm dead broke all of the time, but here's where I'm trying to change things: I go to school full time, I'm constantly applying for internships (hopefully paid ones), and trying to stay as far away from the garbage food industry jobs I've been tied down to for the past ten years. Most of those jobs could give a rats ass about what you do outside of them, and I've often let them control me because rent has always prevailed as a more important task than school itself.

This obviously sucks, but I've quit my job and have some money in the bank and have been trying to figure out what to do with that. 

Now what I will be discussing next, I need no advice on what I'm getting into other than what I should be doing with the money.... I'm sorry to put it bluntly but this is to try and figure out quickly what it is I should be doing with the money I have now. 

First off, I have about $4,850 in the bank right now, and March's rent is going to be $850. I have no real source of income besides the coins and other crap I sell on eBay; it doesn't come in very often, and I'll also be getting $1000 in cash once we sell my girlfriends home (I helped her flip it). On the other hand, we're having more people move in during March and April, and rent will be reduced to $500 a month which is much more reasonable. And I also have other bills to pay as well...

My roommate and I were thinking of opening up a retail store on Etsy, Redbubble, Designbyhumans, Shopify, and eBay as well to sell some product that we design (I.e. Buttons, shirts, patches, and lapel pins; all of which are somewhat affordable to buy in mass quantity). Our designs are also intelligent, thoughtful, and humorous in many ways. The trouble is starting it, and the fact that we're both scared shirtless of that aspect that we could fail.

So I'm sort of wondering if there isn't some better way of me trying to do something with the money I have now. I don't want to waste it, but I believe it's a decent amount of change that could help me actually do something with so that I don't have to watch it wither away. I know there's no magical solution, but I'm wondering if there are any options I haven't explored just yet. 

I'm willing to hear whatever it is you guys got. I apologize in advance for any grammatical or punctuation mistakes I may have made and can't wait to see what you folks have to say. Please be gentle... if not I guess this is the internet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",finance

personalfinance,Is it time to sell the rental?,"I've been renting out my condo for 2 years and this summer it will be time to renew for a 3rd year lease. I'm assuming that after next year I will not be able to sell it without capital gains tax. Is that right? If so, how do I think about the hit due to capital gains tax? Is it just the percentage off the profits of my effective federal tax rate, or the tax bracket that I am in?

Some numbers: it can probably​ sell for ~325k, I still owe ~105k on it, bought it for $145k and lived in it for 2 years before renting it out. I get ~1.75k/mo and have expenses of ~1.25k/mo (includes HoA and insurance). Note that the rental price is lower than market rate. If I was to rent it out new I would ask for 2.1k/mo and maybe get 2k/mo but the current renter is great: pays on time, no complaints, etc. It also benefits my federal taxes (AFAICT).

If I sold it, I would just stick the money into intex funds to pay for future college tuition in 12 years. (No debt, own my house, etc.)

personalfinance,In a weird financial situation with no expenses and a lot of stocks/some debt looking to see if I have the right idea,"Hey folks,

I am a recent college graduate and American citizen working abroad. I have read the wiki and a bunch of “I have just received X amount of money, now what"" posts but I wanted to pose my question due to the particularities of my situation and to make sure that I have the right idea going forward.

Getting down to the brass tacks:

-	 I currently have no personal expenses (a complicated blessing that has arisen as part of my employment) aside from paying around $140 a month for storage of my stuff stateside.

-	I’m making a decent hourly rate, but I don’t receive any payment until the end of my current employment stint (should be a sum of around 20k in cash for work done from October to April). I will then return to the US for a month before coming back to continue working. 

-	My family has gotten together a sum of money to help me pay off my remaining student loans. This was gifted to me in the form of stocks currently held in an Edward Jones account amounting to 25k. This portfolio is not very diversified and those assets are comprised of entirely of shares of ESRX and MRK.

-	I have four subsidized loans amounting to 17k and interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.3%

-	Currently have 3k in the bank

From what I gather, I should sell the stocks and pay of the loans ASAP, take the remaining money and set up an emergency fund (again, no expenses, but I will create one based on theoretical costs of living in the US), and open an IRA, and that’s it for now? Sorry if these are simplistic questions, but I don’t have anyone else to turn to when it comes to figuring out the management of finances in the US.",finance

personalfinance,529 College plans vs. Investments in the Trump Presidency,"This is not a political post but I am worried about some serious financial crashing in the near future and trying to plan around it.

I have some investments that are fairly high risk put aside in my mind for my kid's college funds.  Should I move that savings into a 529 fund?  The interest rates are a joke but they sound safer/more protected.   I need to start pulling money in 4 years for the next 6+.   Any ideas welcome",finance
personalfinance,"Employer offered salary, but will I make less $ that way?","I currently work for $15-hourly, typically working 45-50 hours per week in a retail store. The store manager is leaving and they are moving me into his position. 
They offered me a salary of $38,000 for the year.

Now, based on some googling I learned (I think) that the cutoff for the next federal income bracket is $37,950 (tax foundation.org), so the $38k will be subject to a higher tax rate (25% up from 15%), but just barely. They're are several opportunities for bonuses, but I'm not convinced they would really balance out the new tax rate. It might equal $2k in bonuses all year. 

The basic math I did was
$15/hour x 80 hours x 26 paychecks x .85 = about $26,500. (For simplicity I excluded overtime from this calculation but I probably get an hour or two per pay period at 1.5x.) 

38,000 x .75 = about $28,500 

First, does that math follow any financial logic? Second, am I correct thinking that I would only see about $2,000 real dollars over the course of the year, even though on paper I'm getting paid about $7k more? I will be pushing more like 50-55 hours a week, plus have all the responsibility of a store manager. 

And third, how do I use this information with my employer to get into a better situation? I feel like they won't care about MY taxes because they are offering me more money. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but if Im working harder and getting less for it, that will not be a sustainable situation. 

But at the same time, if my math is right, I'll make more real money over the year getting bumped to maybe $16.50 hourly and being non-exempt. OR being paid $45k salary, but that just won't happen. 

Any advice is appreciated. I love this job and absolutely think I'm the best person to take over for the manager. I just can't wrap my head around working harder and seeing less money per hour. 

Edit: Thank you all! TIL tax brackets! My mistake was obvious as soon as I started reading posts and it makes a lot more sense as explained.

personalfinance,"I'm having issues with my credit score, I can't seem to get past 640.","I'm trying to build my credit and have been working at it for over 2 years now. I was a low 500 when I started. I financed a car a little over a year ago and have paid on time every month. I have a credit card that I never exceed 10% of the limit and pay in full on time every month, usually the same day the balance is posted. I am paying my student loans on time every month. I do have a few collections that I am working on (mostly a repossession from about 5 years ago that I've been paying down). It all shows on my credit, but I can't seem to get my credit score beyond 640.

Right now (according to Credit Karma) My TransUnion is at 641 and my Equifax is at 638. I did notice that I had an increase in my credit card usage from around $4 to $6 and I got 1 point knocked off on Equifax for the increase. I don't understand why that happened. The change hasn't been posted to TransUnion yet but I'll just assume that will happen as well. What's the point of having a credit card and paying in full on time &lt;10% of my total limit (which is only $300 at the moment) if it just brings my credit down? When I first got the credit card and paid the first balance my credit shot up from a 617/614 (could be off by a few points) to a 639/638 (TU/Eq) but it hasn't risen much since.

I'm allowing my credit card to post the charge before paying it in full so it shows a balance on my both my credit and my statement. Is this the correct way to pay credit cards? I still feel like I have no idea how credit cards work and I've had it for almost 6 months.

I don't understand what I need to do to increase my credit further. I'm wanting to buy a house sometime in the next few years but I can't even get my credit score high enough to get a decent interest rate.

I have about 12,000 USD worth of investments I am about to cash in, personal investment account (not 401k), in order to steamroll a lot of the debt.  The thing is this, this is enough money to: 

option A. Pay off my fiancee's student loan, and nearly all of the credit cards except the largest one. The interest rates are 3% APR (SL - $750), 8% APR CC1 ($6000), 25% APR CC2 ($3000). However, this would not increase the monthly income available to pay the debt by much more than 100 USD (minimum payments are super low).  

Option B is I could pay off my car and the student loan (car is 11,000 owed, 4.5% interest) and gain 420 USD a month towards paying the debt.  So the snowball would grow a lot pretty fast that way.

personalfinance,Gambling winnings and my tax refund,"I just filed my taxes and I'm confused on how gambling winnings affect my tax refund.

For 2016 I made $16,013.00 and my adjusted gross income was $17,555.00 including some unemployment benefits I received.

My dad won the lottery in mid 2016 for $5000.00 in Michigan (winning 5000 or less in Michigan does not get taxed so I was awarded the full amount) and did not want to claim the winning ticket because it would have went towards his outstanding debt. So we decided that I would cash in the winning ticket to avoid that from happening.

Fast forward to now, and I just filed for my tax return yesterday.

I filed my taxes yesterday and I forgot that I had to claim the gambling winnings using form W-2G, so initially my refund amount was the total without the $5000.00 included from the gambling winnings, which was $860 and my state return was around $150.

I filed my taxes initially without adding my gambling winnings from form W-2G and I realize I will have to do an amended tax return soon. I actually lost my form W-2G and will have to request for a new one.

So I went back on the tax filing website I used and entered the $5000.00 for my gambling winnings and that $5000.00 boosted my adjusted gross income to $22,555.00 on my tax website. As a result, my federal return amount decreased from $850 to around $200.

So my question is, is this normal for my federal tax refund to decrease because I claimed that $5,000 from gambling winnings?

I'm thinking that since I cashed in that ticket for my dad it raised my adjusted gross income up too high and now as a result I will get less back from my tax refund.

Thanks for reading and hopefully somebody can shed some light on this for me, because I was very disappointed to see my tax refund shrink.",finance

I'm going to owe ~$13000 in federal taxes on ~$60,000 gross income. 

Throughout the year I set aside money for taxes. However, I also have a fair amount of debt to pay down. This year I decided to use some of my tax savings to pay down debt earlier in the year to save on interest, and also use it as an emergency fund...and then just pay my taxes all at once. I won't lie laziness/indiference was also a factor.

I was a bit afraid of the underpayment penalty involved, but I just calculated it out... the penalty is only going to cost me ~$130 based on my previous year's return. And next year, i'll be making close to ~$100k, and  if I don't pay estimated itll probably be ~$300 penalty based on this year's return.

If I use my accountant to figure/submit my estimated taxes, he charges me ~$100-$200.  If I do it myself, its still a lot of hassle, I lose almost as much or more money on debt interest, and I don't have that extra fallback emergency fund throughout the year. Worst comes to worse if I had to tap into it and came up short I could do a payment plan for the difference.

I do see the upside in that you don't risk spending your tax money. But It is definitely nice to get rid of debt and have that emergency reserve. 

Seems kind of like a no brainer to skip the hassle and keep that cash reserve if you're not making all that much.

personalfinance,How should I go about saving/paying for an MBA? Use loans or taxable investments?,"Hi all, 

I have a question regarding how I should go about financing an MBA. 

I plan to start an MBA in about 2.5 years. The total cost for the MBA should be around 160-170k by the time I start paying for the program. 

My monthly take home pay is roughly 4300 after taxes, 401k match and healthcare. My expenses are roughly 1000 dollars a month so that leaves me with 3300 dollars left over post tax. 

In my mind I have two options:

* I fully fund my 401k and my Roth IRA and then just take loans out to pay for my MBA 

* I minimally contribute to my 401k and then put the rest in taxable accounts. When the MBA bills come around I slowly sell them to pay for the MBA.  

In either scenario i'll probably have to take out a loan of some size as 3300*30 ~ 100k will not come out to being enough to pay for it. I have about 20k in taxable savings as well, but i'm planning to hold on to those in case I need them for out of the ordinary expenses: ie cars, laptops, expensive vehicle repairs etc. 

On one hand, I can contribute to my Roth IRA and Roth 401k while i'm in a particularly low bracket. I expect to be in a much higher tax bracket once I finish my MBA. On the other hand, I will have to take high interest loans to pay off for my education and I don't know if the risk is worth it. 

Current fixed interest rates for mba educational loans are between 6.5 and 10% interest rates. Which puts them roughly at the same rate of return as taxable investments. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Gone - Emergency Fund Achieved - How do I best pay off my Student Loans?,"I've been mulling this post for a while, but I wanted to wait until I paid my Credit Cards off and hit my emergency fund. I have $0 of credit card debt and my emergency fund is healthy at $6K. I also participate to the full amount in my employer sponsored 401k.

What I don't understand is the best strategy to pay off my student loans. I have loans through Great Lakes (at a variety of rates between 4%-4.85%), which applies your payment to your highest interest loans first and one loan with one rate (5%) through ACS. I also use Ally Bank for my savings, which gives a healthy 1%.

Does anyone have any guidance as to how I pay off my loans? Great Lakes has a lot of options such as graduated payments, which are enticing and a constant payment program. If I do the graduate route it will cost me an extra $1200 over a 10 year period. I'm not off-put by that, but the last few years will have payments near $350, which feels concerning. The ACS has me paying quarterly, which is odd.

The Avalanche Method says to pay the highest interest rate first so there is less interest on those payments. That means I would focus on ACS over the next few years as opposed to Great Lakes. Does it make more sense to pay ACS monthly instead of quarterly? Will that affect my interest paid over the lifetime of the loan?

Do extra payments matter? Does that help someone in my circumstances?

investing,Market Indicators: Thoughts?,"I received this information from someone who attended a webinar a week ago. What does everyone think about this information? Is it accurate/make sense?

The three indicators that have predicted the last two crashes are:

1.  Sharp spike in interest rates.  This is not the Federal Reserve rate, but the yield on 10 year Treasury notes.  November 2016, 1.55 now, 2.55  This is a 60% increase in the last 90 days.

2.  Hitting a record amount of debt.  This is the amount of money that is being used to buy stocks on margin.  Buying on margin means that you are borrowing money to buy a stock.  Since Dec 2016 the amount of stocks being bought on margin is over $500B.  THIS has never happened before.  The crash of 2001 and 2008 the debt number was about $380B and $410B.

3.  When  the S &amp; P plunges below it’s 20 month exponential moving average.  (This is the most critical of the 3!)  The moving average compilation of stock prices over a specific time frame.  “Exponential” is a mathy way to say that the more recent prices are given more weight in this particular type of moving average.  The S &amp; P 500 crossed beneath the 20 month EMA right before the 2001 and 2008 crashes.

The 3rd strike has not happened...yet.  

So, the prediction right now is that May 2017 will be the peak of this market and the inevitable correction should start no later than Aug 2017.",finance

personalfinance,understanding w-4 form ..did I mess up?,"Hello all,

I checked tax-tuesday thread, and other online resources, and I can't find a simple explanations on this (or rather I just don't understand it).

For quick context - I filed my 2015 return using turbotax last year and with federal and state (I live in NJ and work in NYC.. so double state) I got a return of about $450.

Now that I'm filing my 2016 return, my federal and state come out to me owing about $1200.

I started earning a higher salary in 2016 so I wasn't expecting much of a return anyway since my previous year was only $450... but to go from getting a few hundred dollars, to now having to owe over $1000 makes me seem like I messed up somewhere.

I'm 25 and mostly learning about this stuff as I go, but what I understand so far is that your w-4 is where you sort of specify how much taxes should be taken out of your checks.   IIRC, this form is easy to fill out... as in it asks you very basic questions (are you married/single, do you have kids, etc.).

The only reason I can think of as to why I have to owe so much money is that perhaps my w-4 form was filled out incorrectly?  How would I even go about verifying that my w-4 is set up appropriately (by that I mean, take out as much taxes that are needed so that I don't have to owe $1000+ every tax return season).

I'm pasting the below from turbotax.. i think its interesting that these summary numbers are pretty similary, yet my refund amount is so different.  As you can see, my income is more in 2016 but my taxes withheld are actually less (just by a buck, but still less).  This further supports my idea that my w-4 was not set up correctly right?

                    2015	        2016
    Filing Status	Single	Single
    Total Income	$74,652	$79,994
    Taxes withheld	$12,171	$12,170
    Federal deductions and exemptions	$10,968	$10,351

personalfinance,Feeling lost in debt at 20 years old. Need help budgeting/planning.,"I love spending money. Until now, I have never even thought about saving. I have been working for six years at fast food/random jobs. I am now 20 and in college. It wasn't until this year that I realized how fucked I am. My first year of college I had to take out a personal loan through Wells Fargo for 10,000 with an interest rate of 3.75 (around there but not 100% sure).  As well as about 3,000 a semester in federal loans. Luckily for me I got $5,500 per semester in scholarships this year so I didn't have to take out another personal loan, however I did take out the federal loans. I currently owe $500 on my credit card but I plan on using a refund check through the school and my income tax return to pay for that. I owe $1,000 on a trip to Costa Rica in August that I stupidly booked when I had money and the mindset that I needed to spend money. I would cancel but it is a $550 dollar cancellation fee so I figured I will just go. Right now I am working at papa murpheys 20 hours a week and donating plasma for $40 per time, two times a week. 
I have decided to live frugally and not spend ANY more. My parents never talked finances to me. My mom is 38 and just paid off her college loans. My dad is 40 and already cashed in his 401k so they are not people I really want to get advice from. 
I am literally like a little kid when it comes to saving money and anything with money. Is there any advice anybody can give me that will help me? I don't pay ANY bills (besides gas but I never drive and groceries but I have a school food plan so I spend like 10 a week on food) but I also don't know how much to put in savings, to my loans, or anything. Do I pay off my credit card all at once? Do I pay my loans down now? My credit score is also 720 if that matters. I would like to know these things now because in August I will be paying for my own apartment (300 a month) (grandparents paying half of the rent) and I won't have a food plan. I got a brand new car for high school graduation so I won't need a car for years to come. Is there a rule I should be following to save? 
ANY advice would be GREATLY appreciated as I already feel so lost and down about my finances. 

I also am a public relations major and communications minor so I won't be making THAT much. I also make $8.70 at papa murpheys

TL;DR- I have never saved any money. Now in college and broke and want to save to better my future. Any advice would help me. Already in debt. Not happy about it.",finance
personalfinance,Should I withdraw from my 401K?,"Hi all,

I recently started a new job, and the 401K here doesn't allow rollovers from programs outside of the company. So I have about $2000 sitting in a 401K doing nothing as I can't rollover to my new one.

Yesterday I got an email saying that I was able to withdraw my money from my first 401K. I've read I'll take a 10% hit when withdrawing, but when looking at withdrawing on the website, it gives me the option of a ""Federal Tax Withholding,"" of 0%, 10% or 20%.

I'm not really sure what this means, or whether it's the same as the 10% hit I've read about online.

I was thinking I could withdraw in to my savings account as I'm looking at buying a house towards the end of the year and it'd be nice to have that extra amount to put towards a down payment, but I have no idea if this is a wise or stupid decision.

Should I leave it in there and just not worry about it?

personalfinance,My 2016 MAGI was 136% of the Federal Poverty Line--will I have to pay the government back for my Medicaid coverage?,"I was on Medicaid for the first few months of the year and then got a job and employer-sponsored health insurance halfway through the year. I've calculated my MAGI for 2016 at $16,192 which is below $16,394 (138% of the Federal Poverty Line), but some sources cite Medicaid eligibility as MAGI below (133% of FPL). I am finding conflicting information on both the MAGI calculation and the Medicaid eligibility cutoff, so I am wondering:

-What is the actual Medicaid eligibility cutoff?

-Can I contribute to a tIRA or do anything to reduce my MAGI below the eligibility cutoff?

-If I cannot reduce my MAGI below the cutoff, will I have to pay the government back for my coverage?

The instructions on Form 8962 say the following: ""**Modified AGI.** For purposes of the PTC, modified AGI is the AGI on your tax return plus certain  income that is not subject to tax (foreign earned income, tax-exempt interest, and the portion of social security benefits that is not taxable).""

personalfinance,"Receiving ~$60k inheritance, guidance appreciated","I like to think I've already got a decent handle on how to manage my finances, but this will effectively double my entire wealth (retirement, savings, checking, HSA, a mutual fund my dad set up, contents of wallet and spare change jar all combined), so I'm intending to write out a plan with a couple questions and open up to suggestions.

**First, where I'm at in life and current financial situation:**

* Single, Under 30

* No debt

* Been working for a few years still in my first job out of grad school

* Been looking to potentially make a job change in the near future

* Driving a family hand-me-down 2005 Ford Taurus (relevant later)

* Highly volatile checking account that swings between 1k-3k depending on the time of the month (rent, bills, etc.), and a closely linked savings account with another 3k to cover big expenses like Christmas and summer travel.

* A few days transfer away is a Goldman Sachs (formerly GE Capital) ""high interest rate"" online account where I've hid a few more $k away from myself.

I've already received the check and deposited it, and it is currently in a pretty prolonged hold period by the bank, as would be expected. So this isn't a maybe thing, it's in process. All taxes should be taken care of already. The lawyer's letter with the check said that they handled the estate to result in certain tax advantages, and my parents said that they've reserved some of their share to cover any eventual taxes or issues that arise after the fact.

**What I'm planning to do:**

* Immediately transfer the entire sum to the high interest GS account, let it grow a bit there while I figure out longer term plans.

* Purchase a Tesla Model 3. I'm sure this is a red flag that you all want to jump on, but hear me out. Before I even knew when/if I was going to get the inheritance, I was planning to upgrade to a M3. My trusty steed has been less trusty lately, and I'm sinking nearly the full Kelly Blue Book value of my current car back into itself every year on maintenance and repairs. I even went to the closest Tesla store in person on March 31st last year to put down a deposit, and thought I'd figure out some way to pay for it when the time came. Now the answer has just gotten a lot easier. Counting on that being $35k (which is the base price, estimating that the $7.5k tax credit and optional extras cancel each other out). My mind is pretty made up on this part, and I am confident that I've done the appropriate research. 

That leaves me with about $25k of unencumbered funds to try to do something productive with:

* Invest in an index fund. I've been thinking about this for a couple years, and figured I'd start with $1-5k in a Nasdaq index fund and see how that goes. **How do I start this? Is it through something like Scott Trade or T.Rowe Price or my bank or what?**

* Start a new CD ladder through my GS account. I've currently got one I started a few years ago with $500 per year, but could now establish something a bit more substantial.

Really nothing else planned apart from that. I might splurge a couple thousand to finally replace my laptop I've had since my second year of undergrad, but I'm being very conscious to make any uses of this money be one-time expenses and not think that I can suddenly move into a nicer apartment or do anything unsustainable that requires continual money. Maybe I'll get my dog a really nice bone chew the next time I get food for him.",finance

Here is my issue: my servicer is saying that I have until 2022 to finish paying off my student loans. My understanding is that the standard plan is 10 years, so shouldn’t I have until 2027 to pay them off?

My wife and I found out this morning the IRS is using our tax money to go towards $51000 in student loans that are in my wife's name and are in collections. 

My in-laws were cosigners on five federal loans my wife took out before we met and settled them for $6000 a number of years ago and we're making payments directly to them to pay them back, and my wife took out 2 private loans after we got married that we've been making payments on for the last two years. As far as we knew everything was accounted for and being paid off, so we definitely weren't expecting this. 

My wife just got off the phone with the Department of Education and they said we are delinquent on 7 federal loans and they can't reverse their decision to put our tax return money towards the debt. My wife explained that we only owe on two loans that are private and are currently making on time payments towards that debt, and the 5 federal loans she did have were fully paid off. They told her they had no record of anything being paid off, and the school is reporting to them that the two loans she says are private are in fact federal (they aren't).

What can we do? My wife lost her job last week and we were counting on our tax return to help us get by until she finds another job. I work as an independent contractor so my income isn't steady but I've been trying to get more work to make up the difference. We have a 16 month old and I feel like we're on the brink of losing everything. If we legimately owed this money I'd have no right to expect anything other than what's happening, but we don't. And in the mean time of trying to find out all the information on what went wrong and trying to prove it we've lost the only safety net we thought we had coming.  I'm not sure anyone here will have any advice that will help but I figured it's worth a shot.

personalfinance,Please help! Parent's poultry farm is in trouble. Don't know what to do... file bankruptcy or just go with it...?,"So here's the story: 
My parents bought a poultry farm back in 2007 for $1.1 million. After the first 4 years since purchasing the farm, they spent tens of thousands of dollars upgrading the farm to meet the requirements of their employer Tyson. Back in 2011, part of the farm burned down due to some electrical wiring. Long story short, insurance paid for most of it but my parents had to pull out more loans to cover the cost that the insurance didn't. In total, over the last 10 years, my parents has probably spent almost $200K in upgrades and rebuilding part of the farm that was burned down. 
As of today, their remaining principal balance is $830K. The way the loan payment works is that the banks takes a certain percentage of their income from the poultry farm and applies that to the interest/principal balance each month. (Annual gross income is about $280K) 

Now, to the problem...
My mother just got diagnosed with lupus and my dad is old and needs to retire soon.. so they decided to put the farm up for sale for $1 million. They found a buyer (who was willing to buy it for the asking price) and the buyer is going through the same bank my parents used. They redid the appraisal and said they would approve of a loan of $750K only. This means a loss of $80K if they decide to sell it. Also, Tyson told my parents that two of the poultry houses will have to upgraded within 3 years or else they will be deemed unusable (loss of half of income).

Can someone give me any advice so I can help my parents? I've come up with the following:
-Declare bankruptcy (I'm not sure how or what goes on when this is done. Do they repossess everything you own? To what extent?)
-Upgrade the farm, build more poultry houses to bring its worth up and then sell it?
-Try to find another loaner with lower interest rates, apply for a $830K loan to pay off the current bank and go on from there...
-Work until more of the principal balance is paid off (really don't want this because my mom is too sick to work now) then sell it to break even...

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",finance

My wife and I purchased a house last year and quite honestly didn't get the best interest rate.

We have a loan for $298,000 at an APR of 5.75%. Awful, I know. This higher interest rate was due to having a lower down payment and each of us had a credit score in the 720-730s.

I'm now a proud member of the 800 club (805), and have some disposable income (roughly $20K or so, not including our emergency fund).

Just got a notice from Chase that with qualified credit scores, we could get down to somewhere in the 3.5ish range for APR.

Question 1) Does it make sense to refinance after a year?
Question 2) Will it ultimately screw us over, since we have already essentially paid a shitload in interest this year on the loan?

I've been trying to read up on this - and I'm getting differing opinions. The (slightly higher)consensus is to refinance quickly to save 1-2% hopefully, as it will pay off quicker in the long run.

Question 3) If I DO refinance, should I put more as a down payment? Our house will absolutely re-appraise at a LOT more than what we bought it for. (Comps on the market are 30-40K higher, and we just installed brand new flooring/cabinetry and a new AC/Furnace)

So total would be $33k fed @ 5.31%, $60k institution @ 0% at graduation. Feds start repayment 6mo after graduation, school loan can be deferred at 0% until 2 years into residency. All in all a great deal for becoming a physician imo..

What else can she or I do during her journey? I make $60k before taxes and save around 60% of it (I'm even more frugal than her ha!). We've discussed my helping to pay off her loans for now but her parents are against it since we don't have a commitment for marriage yet. I do what I can and pick up the food and Amazon bills sometimes.

### On becoming freelance
When I was an employee at big-corp, having a high salary and no worries in life, I was receiving quite a lot of job offers already. So when I finally got fed up with a new manager, yet again, I decided there is virtually no risk to quit. I believe that I can always find a job. Being homeless on the street is not a probably future for me. So when and if I do fail, a high-pay salary awaits me in dozens of companies.

### Why everything is just in your mind
Your own mind is the biggest barrier, especially at the beginning. Fear of jumping towards a risky freelance life, is in your mind. Fear about asking for double your regular freelance wage, is in your mind. All these things are in your own mind, and it is important to overcome them. For example I was charging $30/h at first, then $50/h, then $70, now after five years I usually ask for $300, and it is not even me doing the asking. The sense of your own worth needs to be high to start with. Again, it is a must to have the confidence that even if you fail, you are not loosing anything but rather learning.


### Super powers
When you are alone, freelance, you have a super power! That super power is your ability to accept high variability in your work. Even accept to work on things you are not fully experienced with. This ability to absorb variability diminishes when you start employing employees of your own. You are also the sales person when you work alone, and can be flexible to accept the very variable work coming your way. This also goes away once you partner with someone who does the sales and administrative tasks for you. Don't be surprised when suddenly your customers who expect to get a techie over the phone get a sales guy/gal and don't want to work with you anymore. Anyway, accepting high variability == Superpower! You has it.


### Getting your first clients
At the beginning, you must get some recognition in the community to have people approach you. I personally find it much easier to accept work when people approach me, rather than try and push it via sales. Our company now has 15 people and for the last 5 years, we never did outbound sales to companies. Always received their phone call first. Clients these days find us based on word of mouth because we already have clients. At first, it is all based on reputation and how visible you are.

A great shortcut to receive lots of reputation is to use your superpower for variability. You can go learn some new fizzbang that was released last week by some important company, say some new AWS service, or a HashiCorp tool. You invest in learning it, invest in a killer presentation that has humor / story telling / etc.. all the good bits. And you peddle yourself as a speaker to meetups in your area. The more you stand on stage and people know you, the faster you'll get recognition and incoming work. Don't forget to include your offer in your presentation. Just include a slide saying you are freelance, and your doors are open to clients. You can even start doing this without quitting your day job.


### Passion
You pretty much must love this sysadmin stuff. If new feature for AWS released just now makes you giddy - go tell about it! Stand on some stage and present! Soon you get known and respected by other leaders in your community. These are often other consulting companies, who just might just refer their clients to you from time to time. Thuth is, there is much more work than number of people who can do it.


### DevOps consulting market
The state of the market today is amazing. Demand for people is sky high, new technologies are coming every day and no one can keep up. Some years ago everyone wanted Puppet, then Chef, then AWS, then Docker. Today everyone wants a Kubernetes, and there is no one to help them get it working. Keeping up to date with the latest trends is extremely important, and without it the variability absorption superpower is worthless.

So these days you go present about K8s as if you are an expert, fake it till you make it. Do invest the time to learn the tool properly, be professional about it. Surprisingly most employees at companies who need your help never bother to learn their tools, often it was even forced upon them by management. Excellent opportunity to come in and help out. They win, you win, everyone is happy.


### More superpowers
You also have another second superpower. As an outsider, when you consult, people listen.
Read that again, ""people listen to you"". Unless you are talking nonsense, people are smart they know when you don't know something. So do be honest, when you don't know something, do say so. Eventually most people who call you in to help them will know less about the subject than yourself. Or else what would be the reason to call you up and pay you money?

Having people listen to your stuff and the power to influence is a very powerful thing to have. You probably notice this yourself when consultants come in - their opinion is more important than any the current employees. I know it's silly, but it is the truth.

personalfinance,"Being forced to move from hourly to salary (no pay increase), though I signed a contract as hourly","Hi there! I'm in my early twenties and work as a reporter/weekend anchor for a local TV station in a very small media market. I signed a two year contract to work here last spring, right as my station was moving everyone over to hourly pay from salary because of the Obama administration's federal overtime rule. I never signed a contract as a salary employee, though I had (verbally) agreed to work there under the pretense that I'd be paid $25k/year. The day I signed my contract, my HR person told me I'd actually be hourly, still making the $25k a year, plus overtime. 
Fast forward about a year... since the federal overtime rule wasn't passed, all of the anchors (weekday anchors who make double or triple what I make, and who signed contracts as salary) who were moved over to hourly, have since been moved back to salary, and as the Weekend Anchor they're now insisting I move over too. 
I'm not sure what my rights are here. I have a meeting with HR tomorrow morning, to get a copy of my contract (since this place never sent me a copy in the first place... wtf) and I'm going to see if there's a clause in there stating they're allowed to do this. 
I work on average about 90-95hrs a pay period (every two weeks). The hourly overtime pay has protected me from being over worked, and also I'm getting paid for the long hours and extra work I do. This bump from hourly to salary will cost me hundreds of dollars a month when I'm already not making much. This is especially frustrating because reporters under me have not been forced to move to salary, meaning they could easily be making more than me for less time worked. 

Let me know if you have any ideas of what I can do.  I'll be looking at my contract this weekend. Thanks!

personalfinance,Planning for Future Wedding/Mid-30s (V. Long),"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Sorry for the length. 

Current Situation: My spouse-to-be (STB) are living together and maintaining separate finances, which has worked well (all expenses by dollar and split 50-50). Our incomes are sufficient for each of us to afford our share monthly expenses comfortably.  Cost of living is between $38K to $45K each, due to high COL area. STB's are similar, plus $36K annually for student loans. We expect and will try our best to keep our current jobs, but are not sure what will happen if kids come along.

Basics: We've been together around 2.5 years.  My income is around $300,000 annually.  STB's income increased around 150% around 2 years ago, to around $170,000 with bonus, which has improved STB's financial situation.

To me, the major matters we're facing are STB's student debt totaling to around $200,000, with interest, and subpar retirement/ investment situation for us both based on risk averseness (mine, failed to do anything but squirrel away savings in .01% interest til recently) and life circumstances (STB's - little chance to save).

Current Situation (Me)
$412K - Schwab Brokerage, comprised of $412K in roboadvisor portfolio, for down payment  in next 3-5 years, if kids)
$80K - Set aside in Schwab for investments 
$102,000 - Etrade Account, in a couple of stocks and cash
$11,000 - Schwab Roth IRA
$100,000 - Citi Savings
$10,000 - Citi Checking
$200,000 - Current 401K ($172K, in target date fund) and 401K from old job ($24K invested in lord knows what)

Questions:
- Student Debt: The 170K is at a low interest rate due to refinancing. Monthly payments are around $1,500, STB making double payments. Is there any sense in my paying off some or all of the debt so STB can focus on catching up on retirement savings and saving to put something down on any future property we own. It would be risky for me since I'll be out the money if it doesn't work out, unless we have a legal agreement. I know for our communal benefit it would be better to invest due to the low interest, but the other aspect is that STB hates the debt and putting money towards that makes him unable to save for things we jointly want to do, like buy property. 

-House: If we buy a house (kids) or apartment (no kids), it will end up being 550K to 1.1M.  My inclination is to put down a large payment of $400K - $550K (risk averse and wanting to minimize payments). Any suggestions on  what to do with the money for the next few years would be helpful - right now its in a roboportfolio that's weighted to bonds, with some equity, but not sure this is best.

- PreNup - Have gone back and forth on this. Provided that we keep assets separate, in our state (NJ), it looks like only thing that would need to be shared would be assets earned after the marriage, with carve outs for inheritances.  Is it worth consulting an attorney and having one, in view of STB's improved income? I'd rather not spend the money and have to raise this, but would do so if necessary. 

-Other: My parents are late sixties and mid-70s, in decent health. My biggest concern is potential long term care costs, as I am very resistant to putting them in care - they have saved enough ($1.5M+ and SS as well) that they likely will not need financial help right away, but am wondering with recent political changes whether it makes sense to put aside something (or buy a larger house with an extra space). 

Any advice or strategy appreciated. I realize we're very fortunate and in a good position, but I have no real idea how to manage and best apply my savings.",finance

personalfinance,Denied for secured card. Credit advice?,"First time posting here. Just looking for a little feedback. 
Due to some poor decisions and a problem with substance abuse in my past, my credit score is horrible (around 500 last time I checked). This has caused issues for me getting approved for apartments and I usually have to pay a very large deposit. I've been sober for a little over two years now and the last bit of my past I'm trying to clean up is my financial issues. I believe the two major debts I owe are to an old apartment complex - roughly $900-  (which is actually viewed as a broken lease) and to Wells Fargo - roughly 2K. I have since opened up an account with BofA and it was suggested that i apply for a secured card. Unfortunately my application was denied. I'm planning on contacting the collection agency that owns the debt from my old apartment and trying to negotiate a pay for delete in May when the debt is 4 years old. I have heard that the statute of limitations is 4 years and that the debt will just fall off my report after 7. 

I'm wondering if there are any other ways to improve my credit in the meantime. How do I establish better credit habits if I am denied a secured card? Should I look into getting a card from another bank or credit union? Or will they deny me as well? Also, I have recently bought a car that I am making payments on and luckily I was able to get a good interest rate due to having a consigner. I assume making those payments on time will help my credit but I'm unsure how quickly that will have and what sort of impact it will have on my credit score?

personalfinance,Is it wise to borrow against 401k to pay off student debt?,"Hi everyone,

First post here and long time student loan debt owner.  For the first 5 years out of school I was making almost nothing and in a hardship deferment. Found out much too late that I should have been in an income based repayment considering I was on my own and making less than $20k/year.  Anyway, the first $45k of loans turned into more than $55k as they sat and transferred between loan handlers.  Pretty sure I got screwed on this because when they transferred they capitalized and I started getting charged interest on the interest and I can no longer write it off as interest paid.  In my current situation it's not possible to ride out the 20 year forgiveness  to cut my interest debts so I'm figuring I can pay ultra aggressive and clear them out in ~2-3 years.  I also considered the option of borrowing against my 401k to pay off my student debt.  

The Numbers :
My debt is $54k and I'm about to pay down $10k leaving sadly the original amount borrowed to still pay off.  It hurts to see the money go but it saves me $9k on the tail end (yaay me!)
My interest rate is 5.5% with a .25% reduction for automatic payments.
In about a month or two I should be able to comfortably afford $1k/mo payments to the debt and potentially as much as $1400 after I see the real numbers of my salary increase.

I have $40k+ in 401k with some pre-tax and some post-tax and my PRR on investments has been anywhere from 10-15%.

My question here after reading some of the negative impacts about borrowing against 401k is, should I pay off that student debt with 401k money?  As I understand, I get the interest paid to myself so I would actually benefit in that sense.  It would also save me a few thousand more in interest accrued but does that outweigh the tax penalties paid on the income and lost growth?

What else should I be looking at to help make this decision?

personalfinance,Advice about saving or paying off debt before going back to school,"To start, I recently went from taking home 2,200 to 3,500 a month. I'm a nurse and this change happened after I left my regular job to start doing travel work (taking short assignments across the country at hospitals with low staff). Because I travel, I do not get PTO or vacation time, so if I dont work, I dont take home money. And I must work at least 40 hours per week or my pay gets slashed in half.  

Prior to this income increase I was not able to make ends meet with rent, student loans, ect, so my credit card has about 2k on it. I have about 38k in federal student loans (with interest rates raning from 3.4 - 6.8%) and about 500 in savings. 

I am getting ready to go to graduate school full-time in the fall. I will not be able to work.

How should I manage this? I will be in class full-time fall, spring, and summer for 2.5 years. After I graduate I expect to make a minimum of 100k/year. Obviously, I will be taking out crazy student loans to cover tuition and living expenses. I can't commit to working, the program is strenuous, you can't repeat courses, and you must make at least a B. I expect to take out at least 30k/year while in school. 

I have a couple months left to work, but should I aggressively try to pay down my current student loans, credit card, build my emeregency savings up, or save to make interest payments while in school? I can save about 1k/month right now. 2 of my fed loans are at 6.8% interest and I could pay off one of them, and most of the other one during this time frame. The other loans are all below 4.6% interest.

I feel buried in debt and want to start dealing with it. But I also feel like I just gained quality of life with this pay increase and the irresponsible side of me wants to have fun with it. I busted my butt through nursing school and working over the last couple years (in a poor state that didn't pay anything), and I honestly feel that those years of my life were wasted because I didn't have the time or energy to enjoy anything.

Anyway...

There are maximums for student loans to consider too. I think you can have something like 138k total in fed loans. Keep in mind I already have 38k, so with taking out 30k/year, I will be pushing it by the end of my program. I do expect to have a job offer prior to leaving school, but since I will need to take a licensing test, realistically it will probably be about a month before I will start working after graduation.

I'm not too worried about managing things after I'm done with grad school. I know I'll have a lot of loans, but my earning potential is good. I expect to work for around 100k for about 2 years and then start my own practice, where I should see even greater increase in income. I just that I want to make the right choices now so a not to make things worse later.

Bitcoin,How an anchored Proof of Stake Sidechain can help the Bitcoin main chain,"#Steps:

1. Soft fork Bitcoin to enable side chains
2. Create a side chain that is secured with Proof of Stake. Call blocks on this chain ""POS-blocks."" The original chain is made of ""POW-blocks.""
3. Side chain mints one POS-block after each POW-block on the main chain, and contains the hash of the POW-block, and the hash of the previous POS-block. See diagram [here.](https://s32.postimg.org/916n9zxlx/Pos_Sf1.png)
4. Side chain Minters must make a deposit in order to mint. If they mint an invalid POS-block, they lose the deposit.
5. Side chain blocks are small enough to broadcast and validate quickly (e.g. 100 - 300 KB).
6. Soft fork a new rule into Bitcoin that encourages POW-blocks to include the hash of the prior POS-block. Specifically, penalize POW-blocks which do not point to the prior POS-block by doubling the difficulty necessary for them to be valid. Call POW-blocks which do not point to the prior POS-block but are valid because of their very high POW ""hard blocks.""

In [this diagram](https://s27.postimg.org/6hc0b8ejn/Pos_Sf2.png) POW2 and POW4 are valid because they point to the prior POS-block and also satisfy the difficulty requirement. POW3 does not point to the prior POS-bock, but is valid anyway because it contains proof of work at twice the normal difficulty.

#Advantages:

1. Allow people who do not control ASICs to influence which transactions happen.
2. Allow people who do not control ASICs to influence which chain gets extended.
3. Reduce the incentive to selfish mine. Once a miner discovers a block, they should broadcast it immediately in the hopes that a Minter will build on it, because that is the most likely way their block will not go stale. Miners will also immediately start trying to build a hard block. (Maybe statistics could tell us what is the proper range for the Hardness Multiplier. I guessed 2 would be good.)
4. Reduces the effective block interval while reducing the incidence of stale blocks, empty blocks and SPV mining. After a POW-block is mined, it is immediately broadcast to the network, seeking a qualified Minter to extend it. Minters have a deposit, which they will lose if they mint an invalid block. Pointing to the hash of an invalid POW-block would produce an invalid minted block, so Minters have a strong incentive to completely validate the POW-block before they mint on top of it. After validating, they mint a block and broadcast it. While the Minter is validating the previous POW-block, competing miners also have time to fully validate the previous POW-block. By the time the Miners receive the POS-block, they know what transactions they can and cannot include in their own block, because the Minter only processes transactions on the side chain. There is less reason to mine empty blocks, because there is adequate time to update the mempool before mining the next soft block begins, and because hard blocks take a long time to produce. The risks involved with mining on an un-validated POS-block can be made small by the fact that there is a deposit that will be destroyed if the POS-block is invalid. POS-blocks can be validated quickly because they are small. Here is a [gantt chart](https://s22.postimg.org/hvnkyac5d/Pos_Sf3.png) of the schedule described above.
5. Unlike a pure POS system, a cabal of early Stake holders cannot cheaply hatch an alternate history. Much less imperative for nodes to go to a trusted peer and ask whether the chain they are being fed is legitimate.
6. After step 6 above, the side chain would have essentially the same security characteristics as the main chain, and could be used interchangeably.
7. No hard fork required, and this soft fork could be deployed even if the miners do not consent to it. Some hybrid POS system would be my recommendation as preferable to simply changing POW algorithms in the face of miners abusing their power.
8. Users can opt into the POS sidechain, and it can fully prove itself in production before there is any attempt to anchor the main chain back to it. Even if consensus cannot be obtained to execute step 6, the mere existence of such a chain could deter tomfoolery on the part of POW miners, lest they galvanize the community into throwing the switch.",cryptocurrency

I am aware that you cannot deduct legal expenses on personal legal issues.  However, section 212 allows deductions for expenses for production of income.

As part of a FOAH, I agreed to pay opposing side's attorney $6,000 in attorney and court fees.  It was agreed that I would take the money from a 457 deferred-compensation plan.  The 457 plan administrators applied a 20% mandated deduction in Fed and State taxes.  

Would a situation like this qualify for a section 212 deduction?

personalfinance,Help me calculate my 2017 withholding allowances,"Hello pf!  I'd like some help determining how many allowances to claim for an internship I'll be taking this summer.  I am filing single, full-time undergrad student.  My state of residence is IL.


My 2017 projected taxable income:



Current employer (Jan-Apr) (note 1): 6,795

Chase bank bonus: 300

Future employer (May-Aug): 30,675

TA position (Aug-Dec): 1,800

Current employer's pension (note 2): 2,067

Current employer's 401k rollover (note 3): $5,917

Total: 47,554

**note 1** I've claimed exemption from federal tax withholding on my W-4 here.  The American Opportunity Tax Credit has wiped out all federal taxes for the past three years.  I project a IL tax withholding of around $255.

**note 2** I'm fully vested in this pension plan, and the online tool tells me I'll get a lump sum payment of about $2,067 when I leave in April.  It also tells me I need to roll this into my Roth IRA to avoid penalties, and that the entire lump sum will be taxable.

**note 3** I expect my 401k to have a balance of around $10,500 when I leave.  My contributions are all Roth, so this portion of my 401k rollover isn't taxable again, right?  But my employer's contribution is fully taxable?  The $5,917 listed above is my employer's contribution.


Ok, so my taxable income will be around $47,554 for 2017.  Subtract the standard deduction and my personal exemption, that's $34,154 taxable federal, $45,379 taxable IL.  Projected federal income tax: $5,107.  Projected IL income tax: $1702.


The AOTC takes out $2,500 of my federal tax liability.  I'll have around $255 withheld for IL my April.  So the amounts I'll have to pay are **$2,607 federal** and **$1,447 IL**.


**This is my main question:**

My monthly gross pay for my summer internship is $10,225.  If I want to pay off my entire income tax liability over these three months, I will have to have $869/month of federal income tax withheld, and $483/month of IL income tax withheld.  According to various online take home pay calculators, I should claim 16 federal allowances + $5 additional withholding and 0 IL allowances + $51 additional withholding.  Does this seem right to you?  Are my calculations above correct?  Thanks!

personalfinance,"Selling a house, can I use its high interest rate to my advantage?","Hello, thanks for reading this. My wife bought a house right before the collapse. The interest rate is 6.75 and she paid 110k. We decided to move and rent the house, as its current market is nowhere near that. After a nightmare renter, we decided to take our chances. We finally got a signed contract and sold it for what we owe on it. Closing is two months away. We will be paying the real estate commission and attorney fees out of pocket. To cover the mortgage payment, we have been using a line of credit on our residences equity. It's at 3.5%. We have about 15k available still, and closer to 20k once we get our refund.

Since we have access to money at half the percentage rate as the mortgage, would putting a significant amount of money against principle make sense? Or is that getting too cute? The contract stipulates no inspection and the buyers are only requesting 50% of the purchase as a mortgage, so I'm fairly confident the sale will go through, and we have a lot of equity or familial support if something terrible happens. My wife stays at home and a few hundred dollars is fairly significant to us, especially after taking a beating with this second home. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Save for taxes or payoff debt?,"Working off credit card debt. 19k. (Used card instead of student loans for school).

Currently I have a full-time solid job, and I'm driving with lyft/uber after work and on weekends. 
Since it's independent contractor, I save my ""worst case scenario"" of 40% for federal and state taxes. I do have a CPA who helps me with deductions.

Is it better for me to just keep grinding away at the debt or take this ""tax fund"" I'm saving and throw everything at the debt and then just save up money for taxes afterwords. 

Current interest on the card is about $200 per month finance charge.
With my regular paycheck and weekly driving paychecks (withholding the 40% in taxes), I can put about $1,100 a month towards the CC debt.
If I throw everything at it, I would be able to put upwards of $1,800-2k depending on how the rides go. 

I just made a balance transfer of 7k to a 0% balance card for 15 months. So my interest-generating card interest payment should drop quite a bit. But I want to be out of debt by the end of the year (personal goal). 

So regarding the rideshare taxes, Is it better to just try and shoot the debt out of the sky and ""pay my tax fund back"" by next April, or just keep grinding it out.

personalfinance,Crippling Debt at 25 - Best Way to Get Out?,"Hi PF friends, I'm 25 and have just taken a huge leap backwards in my finances over this past year. Background story, I had some health issues about a year and a half ago that lead me to rack up a few thousand on my credit cards. This came right after a vacation that I put on my credit card. Fast forward 6 months to me taking a gamble and accepting a position with a startup, then moving into a really sweet(and super expensive) apartment in the city with my boyfriend with the expectations of making much more money than I actually did. Due to leadership changes and changes in my commission plan as soon as I started, I ended up actually losing money working for this company. I started putting pretty much everything on my credit cards aside from rent, and slowed down a little on fun related expenses. Surprise! My boyfriend and I had already purchase an international trip before I knew these financial woes, so add another couple thousand on. Even bigger surprise! The startup I took a gamble on laid off almost 100 people, me being one of them.

So here I am, searching for a new job that I anticipate to pay in the $40K-$50K range, still putting everything on my credit card because unemployment barely keeps me afloat, and I need some serious advice.

I currently have:
• $21,000 in credit card debt (on 4 different cards)
• $40,000 remaining in student loans
• $10,500 remaining on an auto loan

We won't even count my current unemployment as income, but estimating that I'll be making somewhere between $40-$50K, how can I start paying this off the most efficient way?

My first thoughts are to get rid of the car. That free's up $270/mo from my auto loan payments and saves money by not having to pay for car insurance which costs me about $2400/yr.

Second thought - I have 3 pretty high interest rate credit cards, is it wise to consolidate them? If so, do you have companies that you recommend working with to do that? Just about a year ago I was at a 720 credit score - not the best but not terrible either. Now I'm down to a 640 and I'm afraid of what consolidation will do to that score. Any advice here?

Third thought - moving to a fancy apartment downtown has definitely been a learning experience. We will be moving out in June to a cheaper place, but that will probably only save me around $200/mo.

I appreciate any advice/insight/experience/resources you all could send my way. I love reading blogs about people getting out of similar slumps so even forwarding on some of those would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",finance

My mom does not work, and has a closed head brain injury and is unable to manage finances.  If I do not step in and force my dad to get his crap together and allow me to take over in his absence, my mom will absolutely squander all of my dads life savings and work with MLM and pyramid schemes.

My question is - Where do i even start to ensure that my mother has a home, and is financially stable in my fathers inevitable death?  What numbers do I need to obtain?

My father has agreed to give me power of attorney, but that hasn't happened yet, and he still has not been open with me about finances.  I also have limited knowledge on situations like this, so i don't even know where to begin.

My wife and I are deciding if I should file for bankruptcy. We were married recently, but due to prior drug abuse, I have a good amount of debt and no real way to pay it off. I'm clean now, and trying to restart a good foundation for us.

&amp;nbsp;

I also just recently lost my job (unrelated), so we are struggling to pay for even the basics.  We are seriously considering bankruptcy now, as my rental property was foreclosed in September, so my credit is already pretty useless (plus multiple accounts in collections).  

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are the details of my debt:**
*Foreclosed property ~$150,000 (Sept 2016 foreclosed)  
*Credit card 1= $3,818  
*Credit card 2= $9,530  
*Small student loan debt, which thankfully my mom is helping me out with (I know we can't discharge this anyway)  
*Multiple accounts which have gone to collections but have been paid off/negotiated once in collections.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Income**- Temporarily $9/hr (I just started working at a pizza delivery place last week, I've been able to work 4 shifts so far and am hoping to work more, but haven't gotten any paychecks yet)  
  Hoping to make $40-60k in new job (most of my experience is in sales)- I've had a few interviews, but no offers yet, so can't count on this income yet.  
*Wife's income- Full time grad student; makes ~$200-350/mo in spare time; Should be $85k+ come Sept

&amp;nbsp;

We've been living off savings for the past 3 months since I got treatment and then lost my job.  We only have enough saved to cover bills through March 1 (but will have nothing to pay our April 1 bills/credit cards).  

&amp;nbsp;

**Total monthly bills** ~$1800 (does not include debt listed about in collections)  
*[Rent $720; Electric/Gas $150; Internet $48; Netflix $9.99; Groceries $200; Car insurance $90; Gas $170; Home/pet supplies $30; Everything else $350 (or less, but this is the average)]  

&amp;nbsp;

We've scoured our budget and are struggling to cut things out. We did recently cut our gym membership and combined bank accounts to avoid bank fees, and have been trying to eat as simply as possible (rice, beans, generic cereals, box mac &amp; cheese, etc). Sometimes we will get a large $5.99 pizza out since its about $1.50/meal.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Wife's Tuition**- Paid by federal loans, but the idea was I would be supporting us while she finished her last year of school.  Once graduated (June) and credentialed (August?) she can get a job making $85,000-100,000/year (but will have to make monthly payments of $800+/mo for student loans)  

&amp;nbsp;

**Other items**
*Joint debt: $3,657 on Chase slate (no interest until Sept 2017, so our goal was to pay it off before then)
*Wife debt: $66,000 student loans  
*Both cars are paid off. Mine is broken down right now and needs a $100 fix (old hyundai). Wife's is 2013 toyota corolla and dependable, but needs a new tire and an oil change (she drives 80 miles round trip/weekday).  

&amp;nbsp;

*Should I file for bankruptcy now since both our incomes are low and we are almost homeless, or should I try to come up with a payment plan, as our income should improve by the end of this year?* 

&amp;nbsp;

My wife has good credit and no revolving debts. How would bankruptcy affect her?

&amp;nbsp;

Any other advice about how to get ourselves out of this hole?  Obviously generating more income is #1- I am applying to as many jobs as I can and have gotten interviews at a few places already (income ~$50,000/yr), but that money will take a while to come through even if I do get the job.

I literally can't respond to you guys fast enough.  I apologize.  The original numbers I received were from a 55-year-old Delta pilot who has been with the company for more than 10 years.  He was not ever in the military and he did get hired on originally only after a couple years at a minor airline.  **I don't care what the salary is** this is something that I've wanted to do for over a decade and I've never been one to care about being incredibly rich.  I know that's a hard concept for this subreddit, but I am an active member here on my main account and am very familiar with /r/personalfinance.  Honestly, the lifestyle (and free/cheap flights in the US) of a major airline pilot is the main thing I am after.  
*Last edit for the salary haters:* http://www.airlinepilotcentral.com/airlines Check out regionals or majors, it's up to you.  Just know that ATP graduates are pretty much guaranteed a job at half of those regional airlines.  The top of which is Horizon.

&amp;nbsp;

*Edited to remove backstory as per /u/yddeyma 's comment below.*  
**tldr: want to become airline pilot, need to go through a fast-track program that costs a lot.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Our income, expenditures, and savings**  
*Edited to remove walls of text.  Instead here is a summary:*  
* +$3200/mo average income  
* -$1350/mo rent (willing to move if absolutely necessary to lower)  
* -$600/mo utilities  
* -$193/mo school loans (cannot defer these any longer)  
* -$510/mo car loans (willing to sell one car and subtract $327/mo from this if absolutely necessary)  
* -$700/mo gas &amp; groceries  
* -$450/mo other necessary monthly costs  
* -$600/mo fun money (can likely drop this to about $150 during crunch mode)  
* $4000 in emergency fund  
* $3000 in savings  
* $1700 in tax refund on its way

&amp;nbsp;

You’re likely now seeing why I’m a little overwhelmed.  The monthly expenditures outweigh our income by about $750, and that’s in crunch mode.  $1200 if we changed nothing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cost of program and other potential costs**  
Upfront, the program costs $64,000.  Oh, lord.  Okay, so what else?  Books/supplies/pilot gear/examiners fees all bring the **total cost up to $71,715**.  Fortunately ATP has a partnership with Wells Fargo (yuck) and Sallie Mae (kill me now) in order to get an education loan for this amount.  I can ask for up to another $5000 for living expenses as well, but this just rubs me the wrong way.  Especially taking into account that the interest rate on the fixed loan can go as high as 10.99% for a 15-year term.  It will likely be less due to my credit score sitting at about 750 and my wife, who would be co-signing, sitting around 725.  Can I get an education loan from anyone?  For this amount?  I hate both of these banks with a burning passion and would rather take my business elsewhere if possible.  I’m fairly clueless in this matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other considerations**  
My parents are amazing.  They know my passion for flying is there and they’ve offered to help.  I have no idea to what extent, but my dad is the type that if I figure some numbers out on my own and show the effort, he’ll tell me what they can afford.  It likely won’t be a lot as they’re moving halfway across the country soon, but it might just be enough to get us by for the amount of time I’m without a job.

&amp;nbsp;

The program lasts at least 7 months, up to 9-10 if the weather isn’t great.  All the trainees I’ve talked to said expect 8-9.  This is the amount of time I will not have an income.

&amp;nbsp;

After this time, I’m guaranteed a job as a flight instructor.  It’s required that I remain a flight instructor until I accumulate 1500 flight hours in order to become an airline pilot.  These hours take about a year and a half to accumulate on average.  So for a year and a half I’ll be making on average $10/hr before I set my own taxes aside, which comes to roughly half of what I’m currently making net at the coffee shop.  This can spike to $15/hr during the summer so long as I work 50 hrs/week.  This is taking into account that I stay with the lower-paying-but-better-contacts-and-network option.  It sounds like most instructors get fed up with the low pay about half way through their accumulation of hours and switch to another company.  Usually they’ll have gotten their minor airline offer by then because of the network of ATP.

&amp;nbsp;

**Specific concerns I have**  
I’ve never made less than my spending.  Should I take more out on that loan for living expenses?  Should I save my current savings and use that to cover the cost of going in the red for up to nine months?  A little of both?  It sounds like ATP can ask my lender to front more living expenses if I’m in a pinch, but that might only apply to Wells Fargo.

&amp;nbsp;

Can I get an education loan from someone other than Wells Fargo for $70-75k?  Are interest rates any better at, say, a credit union?  I hate WF, but if it’s the only way for me to achieve my dream, then I guess I have to bite the bullet.

&amp;nbsp;

Are there any financing options I’m not considering?  Should I ask the owner of my coffee shop (who has been a great mentor to me for the last six years) if he can front me some of that amount at a lower interest rate?  I can trade him some buddy passes when I get into a good airline, haha.

&amp;nbsp;

Should my wife seek another job?  I’m really happy that she’s working less than the past and enjoying life more and don’t want to force that on her, but she has mentioned it multiple times and I genuinely think she wouldn’t mind having another job for a little while.  This alone would cover our going in the red.  No car would have to be sold, and there’s a chance she could get really good health insurance for me if it’s for a company like Costco.  

&amp;nbsp;

**I know I’m not considering other what-ifs** so please bring those to my attention.  And there’s a good chance I missed mentioning other numbers or scenarios, so please ask any questions you need.  I will be treating this like an AMA, haha.  I will drain my main account’s karma pool if it means I can get some help from you amazing people.  Thank you in advance.",finance
energy,[Serious] Help me understand a $40 Carbon Tax,"I'm hoping r/energy can help me understand the below proposal by the Climate Leadership Council. Please note, I am looking to foster an unbiased and educational discussion.

[A Conservative Case for Climate Action
](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/a-conservative-case-for-climate-action.html?_r=0)

&gt;Our plan is built on four pillars.

&gt;First, the federal government would impose a gradually increasing tax on carbon dioxide emissions. It might begin at $40 per ton and increase steadily. This tax would send a powerful signal to businesses and consumers to reduce their carbon footprints.

&gt;Second, the proceeds would be returned to the American people on an equal basis via quarterly dividend checks. With a carbon tax of $40 per ton, a family of four would receive about $2,000 in the first year. As the tax rate rose over time to further reduce emissions, so would the dividend payments.

&gt;Third, American companies exporting to countries without comparable carbon pricing would receive rebates on the carbon taxes they’ve paid on those products, while imports from such countries would face fees on the carbon content of their products. This would protect American competitiveness and punish free-riding by other nations, encouraging them to adopt their own carbon pricing.

&gt;Finally, regulations made unnecessary by the carbon tax would be eliminated, including an outright repeal of the Clean Power Plan.

**Questions**

* 1) Does this mean that the price of electricity from coal and natural gas will increase?
* 2) Will these costs be passed onto the consumer?
* 3) Is the purpose of the dividend checks mentioned in Pillar 2 designed to offset the increase in prices?
* 4) Does this make renewable energy more attractive to utilities?
* 5) Since the dividend check is distributed on an equal basis, does this mean that people with small carbon footprints benefit more from the dividend as the tax impacts them less? (BTW - I'm all for this, I just wanted clarification).",energy
personalfinance,"Tax question: 20 year old full time student who made $12,000 in 2016 between 2 jobs. Can my parents still claim me?","Hi Reddit, 

First time posting here and could really use your help.

I've always done my own Fed/state taxes, and have always gotten the full amount back because I made less that $7000 (or whatever the threshold is - I live in MA)

However, in 2016 I made well over that limit (~$12000) between 2 jobs and my W2's are saying that Fed took $0, so I'm very confused. 

Can my parents still claim me? Every other time I did my taxes it was only one sheet of paper (1040EZ) that I just mailed in, and my parents would still claim me with no problems. 

Side note: I also just moved into my first apartment and am paying half the rent. I needed to be closer to school, otherwise it would be a 3 hour commute everyday. I moved in Feb 2017, so it doesn't matter now, but in the future how would I handle this?

Renewable,Biogas for network of independent generators,"Hey guys,

Through a discussion I've had some weeks ago about charging electric vehicles I was wondering if it would be possible to use biogas as an alternative energy source for charging stations. Now I haven't had much to do with energy production itself so far, so I started looking around google, and most of the information I found there was related to biogas plants that directly use the produced gas. The electricity can then be used immediately or fed into the grid. I've however found some information about a plant in Sweden which produces both compressed and liquefied biogas, which is what I'm interested in.  
The area here is very rural, but also with very little agriculture. The source material would therefore mainly be either human waste/ sewage or food waste. I'm afraid that the amount of electricity produced by a plant would be way too marginal if it was fed into the local grid directly. So I was thinking if it was possible and feasible to produce the gas, clean/compress it and then deliver it to the ev charging stations where a generator produces the electricity whenever needed. The Swedish research mentioned that compressing is the way to go for transport distances under 200 km, which is what I'm looking at here.  
So what I'm looking for is more information on distribution systems like this. Maybe something similar does already exist? What could be the biggest challenges? I'll keep digging through google, but any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",energy

personalfinance,Just got notice I need to pay 40k in property taxes by March 1st or I lose the 400k house...Advice please.,"To make a very long story short, Im 25, and when my grandparents passed ~6 years ago they left me their house. 

The house is in another state (moved for school, haven't moved back yet) and my parent is living in the house. The agreement was that my parent would pay all the property taxes while they were living there. I just found out that they haven't paid property taxes in 3 years, and my deadline to pay is March 1st or I lose the property. The tax lien was already sold.

My financial situation:
I make around 65k/year, but I'm salary/commission and the way my company pays commission my W2 is only showing 32k. I can prove with bank statements 80k worth of deposits in the past 12 months.
660-690 credit score
I have 28k in available credit on various credit cards, and approximately 6k in my checking/saving accounts as my emergency fund.

I went to every bank in my area, and they all said I could do a HELOC since the property is paid off, but the timeline for that is approximately 60 days. Obviously that doesn't fit my timeline. One suggested I take out loans on my paid off vehicles (I work on vehicles on the side) which would total around 13k. I applied for a loan on lending club, was approved for 32k at 29% interest rate, but it doesn't look like thats going to go through because they're asking for other proof of income besides my bank statements.

Basically I'm wondering if anyone has any other ideas. My brain is fried trying to think of ways to make this happen. I appreciate any advice given. I don't care too much about interest rates to be honest, because my plan is to just get it paid and get a HELOC to pay off whatever I have to immediately.",finance

I have recently rediscovered my 28 $50 denomination EE patriot bonds. Two were issued to me every year from 1998 to 2011 from a family member.

Because inflation outpaces the interest rate for these bonds, should I redeem them now, or wait until they finally mature?  
I figure these are worth anywhere from $700 to $1000.  
I am afraid the inflation will outpace these and the longer I wait, the less buying power they will have.

personalfinance,Help a noob out? How much rent should I be looking to pay? Any other advice/criticism welcome.,"Hi guys.  So brief overview:  I finally got my career started (software developer).  I've only been working 10 months and have already had two raises, currently at $60k/yr (about $3940 per month in take-home pay, pretty ok for Memphis, TN).  Single.  Currently live at my aunt's, but she said she's ready for me to move out now that I make more money than she does lol.  

Gonna rent a place with my little brother, but he's going back to school and I told him wherever we go I'll only charge him $400 for everything except groceries (50/50 on that), and I'll pick up the rest.  

Here's a breakdown with some notes on my structured expenses:

* **Car Payment: $337.00 --** probably gonna go up.  I have a little over 2 years left with maybe $9,000 left in payments, but it's a 24% apr loan (credit was awful at the time but i needed a car quickly).  I'm way upside down, and the car is constantly requiring expensive repairs, like for real once a month.  Just going to suck it up, trade it in at a loss, and hopefully get a much better interest rate and less problematic car.

* **Mobile: $260.00 --** family plan with me and both my younger brothers.  

* **Student Loan: $226.00 --** set to rise this year based on higher income
* **Car Insurance: $216 --** seems high to me too considering I've only ever had two speeding tickets and no accidents in 10+ years of driving but I actually shopped around when I got this policy and this was the lowest I could find.  I think I was required to have gap insurance on my car because I owe so much more than its worth.
* **Life Insurance: $87.00 --** I'm overweight and a smoker but I really wanted to have this so that if something happens to me my bros will be alright
* **Assorted subscriptions:  ~$60 --** Netflix, Amazon Prime, Xbox, Lynda.com, etc

I'm estimating about $400 total for utilities and internet.  But this is what I told my brother he'd pay so it's a wash.

So if you add all that up:  that's $1186/mo as of this very moment.  As I noted, some of these costs will probably rise by an unknown amount, so let's call it $1300.  So that leaves $2640 for rent, food, gas, misc expenses, and savings.  I don't go out to bars and stuff anymore, only ""luxuries"" I really spend significant money on is tech and video games, but even then it's pretty tame.

I honestly don't know how much food costs (has basically just been part of my rent the last couple years) and don't know what I spend on gas (I never buy only gas so I'm not sure exactly), so my question I guess is how much I should budget for each of the things I just mentioned (rent, food, gas, misc, and savings)?  But in particular the rent... where is the low end where it's probably not worth the crappy neighborhood and cramped living space, and the high end where I'm basically just going to be living paycheck to paycheck and having a hard time saving anything?

1. subsidizing graduate school life expenses.
2. If I can't finish in 5 years and my advisor won't fund me for whatever reason, I plan to at least have 30k so then I can fund myself for a year without having to drop out. (I heard too many graduate school horror stories) But this is money that I definitely won't need until 3.5 years later.

I just received my tax refund and after taking out what I need to pay in property tax later this year I have about $8613 left. I never use my refund for anything fun, just to pay off debt.

My only debts are:

1) Car loan, Own $8,200 @ 2.09%

2) ~$33,000 in student loans, all federal. I have 6 separate loans averaging about 3.8%.
I just finished school in December so I am still in my grace period, and my subsidized loans are still not accruing interest.

So what is better? Pay off my car note and then apply my $200/mo that I would have paid to my C.C. (paid off), + $224/mo car payment (now paid off) + extra unused income to the student loans.

-or-

Pay off one of my 6 student loans. I am thinking one that is unsubsidized currently $7653 @ 4.2% and then just continue the minimum balance at the loans but all extra to car until it is paid off.


I am trending more towards paying the car off and then attacking the student loans debt snowball method, but I am just not sure if paying off a higher interest loan is better here.

My paycheck is for my loans totaling $182.5K; husband’s paycheck is for everything else. Husband wants to add to the payments but wants to make it count. What are our options?

&amp;nbsp;            

Hello everybody,

I have lurked in PF on several occasions trying to get a grip on my situation and thought I could figure it out but need some guidance at this juncture. I currently live in an inexpensive city with my husband in a house. He got a new job making 100K at the end of last year and has asked me about my loans because we will want kids in the near future. 

&amp;nbsp;            

I had undergraduate loans from 2009 ($124.5K of the overall total is from that) and I had gone back to school and got my masters in 2015 (the added 58K). I had amounts and interest rates in spread sheets and I was paying them down very slowly. Due to all of the loans having daily interest accrual, I learned on PF that if I paid them weekly, it would drastically cut down on the interest I would pay over the life of the loan. Before April 2016 I had set up all payments to automatically deduct from my bank account to get that 0.25% interest rate deduction. After I read that here, I calculated the payments to manually pay weekly between the 3 loans and have dropped the private loans from $97K to almost $92K since then. 

&amp;nbsp;            

Monthly bills/loan amounts:

* Take home per month, just me: $2,656
* Work matches 50% of my contributions between 1 and 6% of my 401K, I’m currently contributing 6%
*  Federal loans total approx. $86.5K, private loans total approx. $96K, overall total: $182.5K
 * Federal loans – Based on my income alone, I qualify for the income contingent based payment plan so for all of these I pay $234 a month. The principal, however, is not being reduced at all. I’ve put all my attention into the private loans with the highest interest rates.
      * Direct Subsidized Stafford loan: $14.5K @ 5.875% fixed
      * Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loans: 

         $14K @ 5.875 fixed

         $14K @ 6.55% fixed

         $22K @ 5.16% fixed

         $22K @ 5.96% fixed

 * Private loans -  
  * Chase turned AES: I was paying $838 per month until the weekly thing caught my attention, now it’s $212 per week. The interest rate deduction is gone but I’m definitely paying it off quicker now.

       $20K @ 9.56% - $220

       $25K @ 7.06% - $233
 
       $47K @ 7.5% -  $385

 * Discover: $4K @ 8% - minimum payment is $60, it was originally a $5K loan (in 2008), now paying $150 per month and am “paid ahead” until 7/18 and it's not moving very much which is ridiculous. If I'm paid ahead, why does that not mean

* Car payment: $430.65 per month, $28K Refinanced @ 3.24% for 72 months
* LA Fitness: $21.30 per month (on a friends’ family plan)
* Rewards credit card: Was using the rest of my paycheck to pay this off, husband went ahead and used some savings to pay off the $5K on it and now I just use it to get groceries and pay it off every month. Now it’s around $300 - $400 per month.
* Points credit card: $1K left on this one, used this for wedding/birthday/Christmas gifts (and lately it’s been sympathy flowers unfortunately) that I can’t afford at the moment. Yeah, I know, it’s not ideal.   
* Overall I’m paying ~$2,084 out of my paychecks per month + whatever is left over to paying down balances on credit cards
* Have $300 in savings just so I don't have to pay the maintenance fee. Husband keeps his savings over $5K and anything over that we can use for extra things, like my credit card he paid off or house stuff like the fence we had to install after it was taken out by a hurricane or a new air handler in the future.

When we got married in 2015 after I graduated, we decided that since he was making 65K which would cover all the bills: the mortgage (he bought a house before we were married and I moved in), internet, his car payment, electric, water and dog, I could focus my paychecks on paying down my loans and since I wanted to contribute I would buy our groceries every month. I also bought a car for graduate school because some classes were at a campus 3 hours away one way. I put 18K miles on that car in a year, it turned out to be less per month than maintaining my gas guzzler. What really had my credit score down was the 90 days late for each of these private loans when it was through Chase in 2011, so next year it should fall off and my credit score will jump I’m hoping. I sent a goodwill letter a couple years ago, after I had a steady job and was paying more per month, to remove the late payments, and they flat out denied my request even though they sold it to AES and AES told me they couldn’t remove it as they weren’t the original lender. 

&amp;nbsp;            

So anyway, my husband had some thoughts/suggestions that maybe you guys can help us out with. 

1. Buy a bigger house now (we were going to upgrade anyway for kids), take the equity from the increased market value on our current house (Valued at just over $200K, he’s paid $40K and the original mortgage was for $140K) to pay the 20% down on a max ~$250K house and the remaining chunk he’d put towards or two of my private loans. I hope I explained that right. Also, since we are married in FL, is he able to buy a house just in his name? Or would they have to use both of us because we are married and therefore have to run both of our credit scores?

1. He asked if I could refinance my loans. I have tried with SoFi and earnest and to refinance all of them, I would lose all my federal benefits, especially the forgiveness after 25 years if that is still a thing. I could see refinancing the private loans, definitely. My credit score was under 700 until just recently, so they didn’t approve me when I tried last year alone and that total might’ve been too high compared to my earnings. He then offered to cosign. Would this be a smart way to do it? Should I do all of them at a 3.92% fixed rate (lowest SoFi offers) or just the private loans? That would increase the monthly payment but if he helps it would be paid off in ~8 years instead of 19 that I have left paying the way I’m paying according to my amortization spreadsheet. Also, if we refinance through one of these providers, does the interest accrue daily? And I guess if it’s paid off in 8 years, the forgiveness after 25 years is not a factor. 

&amp;nbsp;            

Any guidance would be appreciated. Even doing a combination of the two, would we wait until after a chunk is paid off and then refinance the rest? Or would we try to refinance all of it and then pay a chunk of the refinanced total with the lower interest? Or are there other options like investing in stocks? We're open to anything. There are actually options now with his help. 

&amp;nbsp;            

Edit – Doing yard work and I missed all the fun, so I'll sum up some of the answers to your questions. 

&amp;nbsp;            

My undergraduate degree was in Oceanography and my masters was in environmental sciences. The undergraduate school was expensive and I wish there had been a class, or even Reddit back then, before signing anything to do with your education. Hindsight is 20/20 and I wish I would’ve stayed home and taken classes at a community college first while working full time at the job I had in high school. But that shit didn’t happen, I wanted the college experience and to get away from my family. Only recently do I realize everything that I did wrong and that’s only by researching what everyone else did. Granted, if I didn’t go to the university, I wouldn’t have met my husband, so there’s that. I will try and refinance again without my husband as a cosigner and will just refinance my private loans to get a smaller interest rate on those, then I could put more into all of them (federal and private).

&amp;nbsp;            

I showed my husband all these comments and we talked and agreed to really cut back. We were not having kids yet, just planning on the possibility of thinking about it in a few years, so cool your jets. We’ll give it a few more years beyond that, we’re still young. I agree that the car is too much, I definitely fell into that trap of the monthly payment vs the overall debt so once our savings gets back up I’ll be selling it, paying the difference, buying a much cheaper car. We will not be selling the house to live in an apartment or to buy a bigger house. We’ll just stay put for now, seems like the best option. Paying for an apartment is just wasting money, at least with a house it’s an investment and collateral should you need it. Plus, the small 2-bedroom apartment we moved out of to move into this house cost more per month than the mortgage on the house does.

&amp;nbsp;            

I have been looking for a new job and we agreed that I should be looking outside my current field (GIS Analyst) as well to widen the search radius. Even if I had to drive a bit, if the increase in salary outweighs the cost of gas to get there, it could be worth it, just extra time for me on the road. None of the jobs I’ve found are in my city, a couple I applied to are 2 hours away and others are in other states. So don’t think I’m not currently looking to broaden my horizons. We’ve played with the idea of a 2nd job for me, but if I did that we would have no time together, so I just have to focus on getting a better job. I was more wondering if the options I laid out were feasible and I got advice on everything but the options except on a couple of posts. I needed to hear it though. Thank you for all of the advice, I do appreciate the tough love.",finance
personalfinance,"First full-time job &amp; getting first company stocks, have low-interest car loan.","I'm 22 working my first full-time job as a software developer making about $110k / yr. Monthly take-home pay is about $5,500 with rent about $2,000 and other bills, food, gas, car payment, etc. adding up to about another $1,500. The rest is split about even between savings and fun stuff. I've got about $10k in the bank in an emergency fund that I've been building up for a few years now, it's about where I want it now. I've been contributing the max ($18k) to my 401k and get a $9k employer match, I don't have any other retirement or investment accounts.

I have $15k left on my 1.99% APR car loan that I pay off at $650/mo, I'm quite fortunate that this is my only debt. I'll be getting $20k of company stock vesting this month and I'm not sure what to do with it. It's a big company that's not going anywhere.

Should I sell it all, pay the tax penalty (for selling before 1 year, right?), put it towards my car and be debt-free? If I were to pay it off I'd start putting about $1k / mo. into an IRA or index fund. 

I could sell it and open a Roth IRA and put the max for 2016 and 2017 into it, right? I've already filed my 2016 tax return.

Or would it make more sense to keep some stock and sell the rest, sell it all and invest in an index fund, or some combination of the two? If the growth of an investment is bigger than the interest rate on my loan does that mean anything?

personalfinance,[Housing] My wife and I are being gifted a lot by a generous father-in-law. Questions about building a home.,"Hey Personal Finance! Long time lurker (and obvious throwaway account) here.

My father-in-law is a silent partner with subdivider and they're doing a development with a large number of lots here in town. He's decided that once the loan for all the developing has been paid off, he wants to gift each of his children one of the lots. Of my wife's siblings, each one either already owns a home and lot outside of town or is too young to do anything with the lot other than sell it, with the exception of my wife and I - we'd love to build a home for our future children.

Our current financial state:

We own a town home right now that we got for a decent deal and the local market has gone up a small amount. If we sell it, we're hoping to get 10-20 thousand out of it, but expecting the lower end of that range.

We're working on making ourselves more financially stable: between two cars, we only have one car payment of $110; we've got 3k in credit card debt; we're building up our emergency fund savings; we've got a fairly strict budget that we (mostly) keep to; my wife works part-time from home, and I am in a great position at my job (more details below).

The two owners of the company I work for have promoted me to the 'Director of Operations' in training. They're slowly teaching me everything that they do so that they can retire. As my responsibilities grow, so to does my pay. For the last year, they've been giving me $2/hr raises each quarter and will continue doing so until I'm making a little over $80k/yr, at which point they'll convert me to a salaried position. I'm at $20/hr right now and will increase again in April, July, etc.

So here come the real questions: We'd love to use this lot we'll be getting (later this year) to build a home on. It'll likely be about 1/4 of an acre, valued around $100,000. It's within our current budget to build a home that's $150,000 to $210,000 and still pay all our bills while having having extra each month for savings / breathing room. However, other than what we make on selling our current home, we likely won't have a down payment for a construction loan. Do all loans require a down payment, or a down payment of 20%? Is there some way to use some value from the lot as a form of down payment? (Note - we used a state-funded first time home buyer's loan for our current place if that matters; not sure if those apply to construction anyway. Our mortgage is ~$650 a month with 3.6% interest rate, with $150 a month HOA fees)

We could always wait for me to be making more money and save up, but we'd rather not pay fees while holding onto a lot if we're not living there, and we'd love to be there as it's in a great location.

Thanks so much in advance! Let me know if something doesn't make sense or if I need to clear something up.",finance

personalfinance,Grants are taxable?,"Hi PF, 

I'm a senior in college about to graduate in May. The only reason I was able to come to college is that I received a full state tuition grant, as well as a ""match"" from my university to pay for room, board, and supplies. This year, and this year alone, my tax preparer told me that I would have to pay federal and state taxes to the tune of $1,500 for the part of the grant that did not go toward tuition or books. (Adding to the $750 I just spent on car repairs.)

This money was being saved strictly for relocation costs after college. Now I am worried that I will have to scramble to find a low-wage job and be someone who has a liberal arts degree (broadcast news/political science) and never escapes their college town. 

My parents offered to take loans out for me (bless them), but they do not do well themselves, making around 50K across 3 jobs.

I'm hoping to get a little advice on which debt to focus my ""excess"" funds. I feel like I'm on the right track in general, but I'd love some PF feedback to boost my confidence a bit. Thanks much for your time/help. I've been at my job for 7 years, and my position is as ""safe"" as one can be. I'm 32 years old and live in the Seattle area. **All the details I can think of that are relevant:**

* Salary recently increased to $95,000/yr (Net +$400/month after taxes)
* Also two annual profit sharing bonuses (adds up to roughly +$25k/yr)
* I'm maxing 401k (20% of my paychecks, 18k/yr. Employer has a great match)
* Already maxed Roth IRA for 2016, 2017 (vanguard)
* Car loan @ 2.5% - ~13k left. $303/mo
* 401k loan for down payment on house @ 3.5% - ~37.5k left. $400/mo auto-deducted from paycheck
* Conventional Home loan @ 3.5% - ~396k left, but only paid 10% down, so have ~$100/month PMI
* House monthly payment is $2,200/month, but fiance pays half and her brother is renting a room for $500/month that we're putting in a shared account for home improvements
* **Parent PLUS loan @ 5% - ~145k left**. Total is ~$1,700/mo, I pay half (details below)
* Recently finished paying off 15k of student debt that was in my name (thanks mostly to you great people)
* I have about ~25k in savings (outside retirement accounts)
* I have no investment accounts outside retirement accounts
* I'm getting married in about a year, but her parents are covering the cost (lucky me, no sarcasm)
* No credit card debt
* Total expenses add up to about ~$3500/mo (includes loans/food/meals/etc)
* Total NET income is ~$4,400/mo

The parent plus loan is in my dad's name and is about half mine/half my brother's. We recently refinanced through SOFI to get to 5% and are 1 year through a 10 year complete payment plan (original amount was 155k). My brother and I send my dad money each month for the minimum payments. My brother makes about as much as I do, but has more debt in his own name (about an additional 50k) from grad school. He also has a high paying, stable position in the same area. Our family is close / functional. 

I have access to the Sofi account and was considering adding an additional monthly payment from my own account to pay it down faster because it has the highest interest rate. I know I have more than the recommended 6 months of emergency savings liquid, but I've got the majority in a money market account. I'd like to start paying more than the minimum on the parent plus loan OR my home loan to remove the PMI, but wanted to pose these options to you guys for feedback. It seems prudent to focus on this debt before doing any proactive investment.

Please let me know your thoughts/feedback or if you have any questions.

Under MTM designation any trading losses are categorized as Net Operating Losses (NOL) and not Capital Loss Carryovers, which are capped at a $3K deduction. Classifying losses as NOL allows one to apply the deduction two years backwards or forward 20 years. Wash sales are excluded since open positions at year end are marked to the market price on Dec 31. **Note:** This election is supposedly difficult to reverse, so consider implications before moving forward.

Back taxes are assessed the standard fees at the IRS interest rate + any fines levied. [Click here for Source] (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes)

personalfinance,Getting a loan on a car from my credit union.,Not sure if this is the right sub or if this breaks any guild lines but I just finished paying off a 2k loan from my credit union and am wondering how I go about asking for a loan for a vehicle.  I don't understand anything about refinancing and interest rates so I feel a bit overwhelmed when they start throwing out percentages and banking terms.  I guess my question is what makes a good deal?  I aim to try and get at least 4k on the loan for maybe a 13-15k vehicle.  Is that a reasonable expectation or am I way out of the ball park?  Any advice or direction would help me a bunch before I head in on Tuesday.  Thank you for your time.,finance
personalfinance,Pay off debt or extra towards down payment?,"Hi PF. Long time lurker and first time poster to PF. First off - thanks for all the sage advice on this subreddit. This sub has helped my wife and I crawl out from under some significant debt in the past as well as assist our friends with doing the same. 

Myself (29), Wife (29), and Daughter (2) are currently living with family as we have been paying off debt and saving money. We are in a position where we need to purchase a home. 
Given our area, a good sized starter home can be found for 170-190k in a good area with good schools. This is our target budget for a home. The goal is to find a home in the next 3-6 months. 

Our incomes are:

* Mine (57K OT Exempt + OT (2K per year approx) + Bonus (3K).

* Wife (35K Gross)

Our combined take home after insurance, taxes and auto insurance (payroll deducted) and retirement accounts is $2600 every 2 weeks. 


We currently have saved:

* $5k emergency fund

* $5k closing cost fund

* $10k down payment fund


Our debts are:

* $490/month student loans (42K balance all federal sub/unsub w/ 9 years remaining)

* $167 Car 1 - 2015 Subaru w/ balance of $8900 at 2%

* $233 Car 2 - 2010 Subaru w/ balance of $10,800 at 4.9%

* $152/week - daycare


We are currently saving approx. 2k per month. 


My primary question is this: Should we be looking at taking $2k per month from here on and paying off Car 1, Car 2, or saving additional money towards the down payment on the home? I know the general instruction here is to avoid PMI at all costs, but realistically that will not be feasible, even with an additional 12K saved toward down payment given the $10K that we have currently. 


Paying off car 1 would be the quickest move and would reduce our debt to income by $167. Paying off car 2 would take about 1 month longer obviously and reduce our debt to income ratio by $233. The only reason I question putting more towards a down payment would be in order to reduce an interest rate and have more equity in the home. I am inclined to pay off car 2 for two reasons, to reduce debt to income by the greatest amount and also to build some equity in that vehicle as currently we are break even on ACV vs Owed, whereas on car 1 we have a 7 year warranty as well as about 16k in equity. 


One other option I have toyed with is selling car 1 and purchasing something less expensive, paying off car 2 with the remaining equity, and then saving the extra money towards the down payment while we are looking for a home. The only fear of mine is that we have an extended warranty on that vehicle, its reliable, and won't take long to pay off once one car 2 is paid off. 


As a secondary question, if we were to decide to pay off one of the vehicles before moving - should we do this before going in for qualification/approval on a mortgage? Or does it matter? 


Our current debt strategy is pay off 1 car, chunk money towards the other car, then chunk money towards student loans in order to eliminate debt in the next 5 years besides mortgage. 
Any advice is much appreciated.

personalfinance,Any point in itemizing deductions if you can only deduct state taxes and after state refund the taxes are below the standard deduction?,"I'm puzzling over this one because it's telling me to itemize on Federal because I paid somewhere between $7000 and $8000 in state taxes.

From what I understand, next year, this $2500 amount would be taxable in the case I itemize. So basically this would mean I'm just *deferring* taxes, not actually saving anything...especially since I'm going to make a lot more money next year.

personalfinance,Major student loan issue where the school seems to be at fault. Do I have any options?,"Like most college students I filled out my FAFSA before the 2016-2017 school year to become eligible for aid. At the time I thought that I would be living on campus, so I listed that as my housing status for the school I ended up attending. This was February 2016

In April 2016 I made the decision to attend that school but live at home with my parents. At that time I submitted a formal FAFSA correction to change my housing status from ""on-campus"" to ""with parent"". That correction was successfully submitted and processed and is visible under my FAFSA corrections history.

For the fall semester I was awarded a scholarship and made eligible for both subsidized and unsubsidized student loans. I chose to reject the loans because I was able to pay for the fall semester out of pocket.

For the spring semester I realized I needed a loan and asked my school's financial office if I could reapply for financial aid, because by rejecting the loans in the fall they were completely removed from my account. They said that I did not need to do anything to reapply since my approval status was the same. They just put the same subsidized and unsubsidized loans back on my account. I accepted a federal subsidized loan to cover some of my fall semester expenses.

So fast forward to this week, nearly 6 weeks into the spring semester. I receive an email stating that I was in an ""overaward situation."" The gist of the email:

* My 2016-2017 FAFSA listed me as living on campus, but I chose to live at home. This meant that my cost of attending was drastically decreased, effecting my aid eligibility.

* I should not have been eligible for the subsidized loan I took out, so it was canceled immediately and I now owe that money back to the school immediately. 

* They placed an unsubsidized loan on my account if I so choose to accept it, to cover the cost that I now owed back to the university. It effectively could replace my subsidized loan.

So here's where I'm at. I went through all of the proper channels to report my change in housing status. Yet I have to change from a loan that accrues no interest while I'm in school to a loan that accrues interest for its whole life. Not only did my school award me aid for the fall, which I could understand them not having updated info for, but they also awarded it to me again 6 months later. That gave them 2 different opportunities to get my housing status right.

I know there are rules in the FAFSA program to protect students from schools' incompetence or malicious practices. Do any of those apply to me?",finance

There's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that a large chunk of the total cost ($39.1k) is taken care of through scholarships ($22.3k) that I had applied for previously with the letter adding in subsidized ($3.5k) and unsubsidized ($2k) federal loans that I can choose whether to accept them or not.

 The bad news comes with the rest of the cost being unaccounted for, meaning I would have to somehow pay $11.3k out of pocket or through some other means. I don't have any experience in the financial side of college or the financial side of life in general so I'm totally at a loss for how to proceed.

personalfinance,Question about total interest paid on multiple debt at high interest versus larger mortgage at lower interest.,"Let's say I start with a 25 year mortgage for 112000, interest rate fixed at 2.97 for 5 years. My five years are coming up and I am due to renew with a new balance of 104000. I carry approximately 25000 debt from a personal loan (5years remaining), car loan (3 years remaining) and credit card (approx 2000) with 8.8%, 4.5% and 9% interest respectively.  
My goal is to pay down my debt the fastest, hopefully freeing up some $ each month but also to own my home outright in 20 years or less. 
Would it make sense to roll my debt into a new 25 year mortgage with a fixed rate of around 3.5% for 5 years OR renew a 20 year mortgage that is fixed at 3.5% for 5 years and possibly roll my debt into one consolidation loan for 5 or 6 years but at a higher interest rate?
Would I not be paying way more interest in the long run if I were to roll my debt into a mortgage (even at a lower interest rate)?

So, if we are considering another 3-5 years in our current house, would it be worth it to refinance to a conventional loan? It seems like we would save money monthly. But we would have to counter the cost of closing and anything else I am forgetting.

My thoughts:
  
1.	Get new insurance quote.  $1,908 annually seems too high of insurance for a roughly $150k home.  Granted LA has flood issues which drive the cost up but still seems too high.  
 +	This insurance is through the bank with the loan.  Should we get insurance quotes outside of the bank for better deals?

2.	Try to refinance current loan.  She is almost at the 80% loan to value so not only can she potentially get a reduction in rate but she could also eliminate mortgage insurance.  
 +	Is it better to refinance with the current bank or look outside?

3.	Get a HELOC.  Wait until the original is refinanced the get a HELOC and put the entire amount towards the high interest credit cards.  To be conservative we believe a $10k HELOC which is less than 10% of value.

personalfinance,"Traditional IRA for 2016, even though I made 19k last year and have student loans","Alternative title: ""Does the long term benefit of maxing tax advantaged accounts really outweigh the risks of carrying larger debt?""

I made under 19k in 2016 and had somewhat high expenses for me. I managed to contribute about $1,000 to an HSA, but did not save beyond that. I ended the year unemployed with $78 in the bank.

Thankfully, I began 2017 by starting a job making 126k + bonus + options + employer contribution &amp; match to 401k &amp; HSA. I've spent quite a lot of time in the last few months researching how to best manage my finances. In doing so, I think I've come to a counter-intuitive conclusion about what to do with my first bit of surplus cash. I would like to see what the community's thoughts on this plan of mine are.

I have 96k of student loans. 28k of this is through Sallie Mae, split between 11% and 9% interest. The rest are federal loans, split between ~6% and ~3%. To me, the obvious thing to do with my income is, beyond paying rent and keeping a short term emergency fund, to nuke the 11% and then 9% loans as fast as possible (avalanche style). I expect I could pay off the Sallie  Mae loans in a bit over a year, while contributing the max to 401k, HSA, and IRA for 2017. 

Instead, I have decided to put the first $5,500 I have (beyond short term living expenses) into a *traditional* IRA with Vanguard for 2016. I have until April 18th 2017 to do this, and will likely choose VTSMX / VTSAX.

I have opted for the traditional IRA over the Roth IRA for nuanced reasons. The first is that I expect to [pay little to literally no taxes on my traditional IRA](https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-mechanics-of-the-0-long-term-capital-gains-tax-rate-how-to-harvest-capital-gains-for-a-free-step-up-in-basis/) in early retirement. I consider this strategy more attractive than locking in a low tax rate now with a Roth because a traditional IRA helps with my 2016 tax return, thus helping me pay down the debt. I figure that in the worst case the Roth and traditional IRA are similar, and this only happens if the tax code for long term capital gains is significantly changed or if I have *too much* retirement income (a problem I'd love to have).

However, it is natural to ask if contributing to *any* type of IRA for 2016 is worthwhile. [I wrote a script to compare two scenarios over 15 years and found the answer is a strong ""yes"".](http://i.imgur.com/NbtIk4V.jpg)

In the first scenario, I choose to put 5,500 in an IRA gaining 9% per year (no inflation adjustment), but carry $5,500 further debt at 11% for 3 years. (This is overly pessimistic - I will not be carrying debt at 11% for 3 years.)

In the second, I neglect the IRA and pay down the bulk of my debt faster. At the end of 3 years I will have $5,500 * (1 + 0.11)^3 more money to put into taxable accounts. This money grows slightly slower because I assume a 15% tax on 2% dividends per annum. After this amount, both accounts contribute to taxable accounts at equal rates, which is not plotted.

In both scenarios both accounts pay down the bulk of my debt at equal rates, so this is also not plotted. Only the differences between the two scenarios are plotted. 

Note that this disregards the traditional IRA's more immediate tax advantages for the 2016 year, including the saver's tax credit, which I will easily qualify for. The result is that the above plot is systematically unfair to the 2016 IRA: contributing $5,500 to my IRA will not decrease the amount I can contribute to my loan by $5,500 but by some lesser amount (sorry for the double negatives: decreasing by a lesser amount is favorable). However, even neglecting that, the IRA *still wins* because of the impact of taxes on compound growth. If I include this difference, the IRA doesn't just ""pull ahead"", it dominates the ""loans first"" strategy.

However, it should be noted that carrying a larger debt longer is inherently riskier. If I became unable to work the consequences could be severe. Thankfully I am not very dependent upon my specific employer. If I were to be fired tomorrow I reasonably expect I could find another job paying a similar or greater amount in short order. This gives me the peace of mind to plan aggressively. 

Also, the market could tank and cause this strategy to appear to underperform short term by failing to provide 9% CAGR. However, I reasonably expect that I will not need to touch my tax advantaged accounts for a long time (&gt;20 years), and on those time scales the IRA's higher growth dominates the taxable accounts.

I know that my position is a little weird (large increase in income as of the new year, significant debt), but I am curious as to what /r/personalfinance thinks of my plan. Does the long term benefit of maxing tax advantaged accounts really outweigh the risks of carrying larger debt? Personally, I was surprised by the results, but am convinced by them.",finance

personalfinance,I'd like to ask for a raise because I think I'd be difficult to replace. Any advice on how to frame this to my boss?,"I work as a physics teacher at a private school in a relatively remote area in the US. I am the only physics teacher in the school, and our science department in general is relatively stretched thin (only one chemistry teacher, two bio teachers). I do like working at the school--kids are great and we have a lot of resources. However, it doesn't pay as well as the public schools in the area, and I have much greater time commitments than the public schools (our school day is 7:30-3:30 while most public schools are 7:30-2:00). If the salary was the same, I'd rather stay where I am, but it's tough to essentially turn down the extra money and better benefits. I can't see myself staying here if I stay on the same salary track, because it'll take me nearly ten years to crack $65,000 while the same time in the public schools would have me at above $80,000.

For most subjects, it isn't hard to find a teacher. All humanities job postings get tons and tons of applicants. Math jobs usually get 15-20 applicants. Science jobs struggle to break 5, and most of those are for biology. We are already short-staffed for physics and chemistry. We need to cover 5 class sections of each, but each teacher only has space for 4 classes a day. Right now I'm doing all 4 physics, the chem teacher does 1 physics and 3 chem, then each of the bio teachers do 1 chem in addition to their bio sections. Neither of the bio teachers feel comfortable with physics, and I give the chem teacher a lot of support (I essentially make all his lesson materials for that class). It's as tight as can be, and we have no space for electives. The school wants to add an engineering course, but would need to hire an additional teacher for it. I've only been here 1 year, but I know that when I applied, they had postings for 2 physics teachers and a chem teacher because they wanted to be able to have space to add more AP sections (they didn't find anyone, and I was the only one hired).

All that being said, I know I'd be hard to replace. It's hard to fill a physics job in general, but is even harder for a school that pays less than the surrounding public schools. They'd need to invest money into either recruitment or making a competitive offer if they needed to replace me. Can I parlay this into a higher salary? The school generally pays teachers equally regardless of subject, but I think that given the cost to replace me, they'd rather pay more for someone who's already in the system. I've performed well on my evaluations, and have good relationships with staff, students, and the administrators. I think they'd want to keep me around.

gaming,"[Spoilers and Discussion] Assassin's creed. What shoulda Happened. According to me, a slightly drunk guy.","Sorry in advance for the possible wall of text. and maybe formatting.


This is going to be a little rant like.

The things imma talk about have probably been covered here at some point but hey, whatever.

I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's creed series, though (with the exceptions of Black flag and syndicate) the series has really shot itself in the foot. (Ubisoft, go figure).

Here is my take on how it should've gone down.

Ignoring all the problems of AC3, at the end Desmond has a **HUGE** choice to make, to let the world burn as it has before (at least once as far as we know) and become the next jesus/phrophet/god-like figure/thing of legend or save it and most likely let an essentially immortal wicked powerful crazy bitch of a goddess out to wreak havoc on the world.

We as the player should've had this choice.

Both options have an assassins view and a Templar view.

The first option to let the world get all toasty is AC because it means you could rebuild and create a freer world with no hate/money/greed etc but would also open the option up for templars to easily start a new world order with the reduced population.

The second is AC as it allows the Assassins to carry on inn they're struggle towards freedom etc but the templar choice because they are close to defeating the AC.

once the game had given you the choice and you had chosen, the matching cutscene would play, the credits roll.

rather than do the yearly release, they should've spent the next 3-5 years developing not one but *two* games. why?

One where things got crispy, one where ghosty goddess is fucking both the assassins and templars shit up.

This would be the start of the second Desmond Trilogy, The first game of Toasty World (TW) could be the assassins simultaneously setting up shelters and growing their numbers etc (not forcefully like the templars may do) while trying to find some kind of first civilisation city underground via the animus.

In option 2 game one, the assassins are trying to grow in numbers to better battle the templars while fighting on two fronts against ghost lady. (good way to re-introduce subject 16 and have him find a new body, that dud was crazy but he knew the future and shit)

Both games end with the revelation that there is a third secret group that is actively trying to bring the first beings back to life or become like them.

The sequels for both will continue their modern day struggles trying to uncover who this 'new' group is and how to thwart them and discover artefacts in the past that can improve living in the present, either against the now TW or ghost lady.
The second one in option one trilogy should end with ghost lady plus 5 to 10 new first civ ghost people coming back to life and the second one in option two ends with templars getting decimated by ghost lady and again 5-10 ghost peeps coming to life.
In both they end with the Assassins and templars entering an unsteady alliance to better tackle these new threats.

The trilogy concludes in the TW with the templar/ assassin alliance going all rebel alliance vs. the empire on those motherfuckers, though at the cost of either Desmond or his father. It ends with them staying as one organisation sharing goals to strive towards a better future. 
There is an end credit scene with an assassin planning to upset this new peace.

the option 2 ending game concludes in a similar manner, but under a much more volatile alliance. This one both a templar character and either Desmond or his dad die to save the day.
This has an end credit scene showing a cabal of templars **and** assassin's plotting to betray the new peace.

In both of the concluding games there is a true blurring of the lines between assassins and templar with people starting to understand their enemies point of view with some on both sides feeling as though their loyalty is being challenged etc, maybe have a 100% completion ending (or dlc) showing the possibility of a more sane and rational group of people (both assassin and templar) breaking away from the main factions and have these as main characters in the third trilogy?

Sorry for the long post, I needed to get this out ya'know?

personalfinance,First time home buying - how should I think about my budget?,"Hey guys, love this sub - hoping you can offer some advice or tell me if I'm thinking about things clearly. 

My wife and I are looking to move at the end of May. We've been renting and are looking to buy a house and get ready to try start a family. 

Our finances:

We have ~90k in cash. 50 set aside for a down payment and the rest is basically an emergency fund and a vacation account. This is a bit more cash than I'd like to be sitting on, but my wife is pretty risk averse and cash makes her feel safe. We are still investing in our Roth IRA and 403 bs. 

I've heard the rule of thumb that your housing shouldn't cost more than 30% of your take home. This move will require my wife leaving her job and we want to live on income alone (or at least budget that way). I make 52k and after taxes and 403b contributions will be brining home around 3.1k/month.

My question is how much house can we afford? Should we get a 30 mortgage and try to pay it off in 15? Does it ever make sense to pay it off in 30? The houses we really like are in the low 200s. Would this be stretching us too thin? If we want a house for that price, should we increase our down-payment? Or with interest rates this low, is now the time to borrow more money and put cash elsewhere? I want to set us up for success and not bite off more than we can chew, but I also want to provide my family with a home that will last us a while and that we love.

personalfinance,Best Ways to Reduce Interest Rates while Paying Down Credit Card Debt?,"Hello all, 

I recently got married, and in the process accumulated around 10k credit card debt. I am doing my best to get a handle on paying down my debts, with the goal of being CC debt free in 12-18 months. I'm using YNAB to track my spending, and I've completely stopped spending on credit. I'm confident that we're on the right track, but I hate seeing so much money go towards interest - our debt is spread across several cards, 2 of which have interest rates that are 20%+. Another is still in it's 0% promotional period, but will jump to 24% this fall. I know that the best strategy is to live frugally while paying down debt aggressively, but I'd like to look into every option for reduce the amount of money that goes towards interest. 

What are the options available for reducing credit card interest? I've been considering a few strategies: getting a debt consolidation loan through my bank, working with a debt consolidation company, or even applying for a credit card like the Chase Slate card that has a 0% transfer fee and interest rate. Are any of these ideas advisable? 

I know that anything I do must go along with making behavioral changes to how I spend, and I plan to close out old credit cards to avoid repeating my mistakes in the future. My goal is to get debt-free and stay that way, while wasting as little money as possible on interest.",finance
personalfinance,"IRS took my refund, in school, always made little money","Hello,


I have been an artist for many years and never made enough money to file a tax return. In 2016, I started school with a TAship that paid me $2000 and withheld about $200 in income. I filed a tax return and the IRS status checker told me they took my refund to pay someone else for something (reference code 1091). I'm unsure what this might be since I haven't really worked since 2009 and my parents were always filing my taxes for me, also I do not owe child support or have a defaulted federal loan. I haven't committed unemployment fraud (I believe someone would tell me if I did?!).....


Anyway, I still haven't received the letter from the IRS and kinda nervous about what the problem is. I'm in school out of state and turbo tax did say that I owe my home state $4 for taxes.... could they just be delaying my tax payment because of the $4? '


Also, I would like to change the amount of allowances on my paycheck from ""0"" to ""2."" Will my employer get a letter saying I'm not allowed to change my allowances? Can I still change my allowances?

personalfinance,Should I stop Roth contributions in favor of increasing 457b (similar to 401k) contributions?,"I didn't have much luck getting a response over the weekend, so I'm posting this again. 

I'm 35 and a public employee. I make $55k, I contribute to a defined benefit pension fund, a 457b ($200/mo soon to be $400/mo), and a Roth IRA ($5500/yr). My pension benefit will be anywhere from 60-100% of my last year's pay, depending on when I retire. I do not pay into Social Security and so will not receive Social Security in retirement. I file as Head of Household with one (adult) dependent. I'm in the 15% federal, 2% state tax margin and have an effective rate of about 7% federal, 0% state.

I only started saving for retirement, outside of my pension, in the last couple of years, so I don't have a bunch invested so far. If you were in my situation, would you switch your Roth contributions to 457b (it's like a 401k) contributions? Aka would you stop post-tax contributions and make them all pre-tax?

If it matters, my Roth expense ratio is 0.15% and my 457b's expense ratio is 0.22%.

personalfinance,"#DEBTFREEBY2018 Is it okay to stop saving completely and aggressively attack my student loans, as long as I have a 4-month emergency fund and am taking advantage of employee match?","I've been a lurker for a while and have found great help from the people here. 

I budget pretty hard and have been for 3 years now. All logged in excel. Last night I created a Student Loan Early Payoff ""Waterfall"" Worksheet, essentially a payoff plan of my student loans, putting max payment on the highest interest rate, then transitioning to max payment on the next highest rate starting at the date the ""attack loan"" gets paid off. It really helped put things in perspective as I had a plan to be debt free by the time I'm 30 (~end of 2018).

This all kind of changed when I updated my budget, saw the status of my savings and started playing with numbers seeing what it would take to payoff my student loans by the end of the 2017 (is it possible?). It's not horrible. Basically I have $13,500 across 4 different loans of ranging interest rate. I would essentially have to throw about $1250 a month at it, and then a small closer chunk from my savings come year end.

MY QUESTION BECOMES: Would this be a horrible idea if it requires me to basically shut down my current automatic 100/week into savings? Right now I have about $13k saved which is 4-month emergency fund for me, plus $3k in a certificate, roughly $12k in assets (cars/motorcycle). I JUST started my 401k, and am putting 8% of salary, getting max 4% match. 

Is there anything else I should be aware of with this plan? It'd only be for 10 months. And my savings/checking will practically skyrocket in the months following. The only other route I could see someone steering me is to delay paying of the loans and focus more on recouping lost time in my 401k. 

Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

personalfinance,Need advice on what to do with allowances!,"My wife started working this past fall for the first time in years since we started having children. I am not sure if our allowances have been entered correctly so I am here seeking advice. 

I used the IRS Witholding calculator but wanted to verify I was understanding it correctly.

We currently have 3 children ages 8 and younger.

According to this, it says I should be claiming 6 allowances on my income and my wife to be claiming 5. Currently we are at 5 a piece. She has 0 dollars taken out for Fed income tax, only SS and medicare.

What throws me off is it says if we change it to the recommended allowances, we will get a refund of only $700 but when I used the Tax refund estimating calculators it estimates we should be getting $5000 returned to us. The 5k sounds about right since we were getting close to 8 before she started working.

What am I missing here and should I change to the recommended allowances?

personalfinance,"5k credit card debt, my 0% interest is only for 6 more months, what should I do?","Hello all,

Having recently moved to San Francisco due to being stationed there for my new job as a flight attendant I have maxed out my first credit card. My card was a BOA travel rewards card with 0% interest for the first year, I had a limit of 5k and my card is now over that limit by ~$900. I had kept my card just under the limit and put it away (aka DO NOT USE) until I could get back on my feet with my finances. Unfortunately the airline I work for does not provide a relocation supplement or a higher salary depending on the city's cost of living. With San Francisco being so expensive it was easy to rack up some debt. I will admit making some poor financial decisions along the way a couple of times. I got hit with a $1,000 towing fee from Getaround, a car rental company, after I had stopped using my card at around $4,700. I thought this was fraud because I parked the car exactly where I picked it up and the pictures of the towing tickets and where the car was seemed to not mach up in my opinion. I called BOA to report the fraud and investigate this situation. The charge was removed, yet 90 days later returned to my card because they said the charge was valid...  I digress I am in this situation and I have about 6 more months until the interest rate is applied to this card and I am not sure if I need to just budget significantly better, transfer my debt to a different card, or spread my debt over a couple cards and start to chip away at this. If anyone has any thoughts or advice it would be greatly appreciated.

ethereum,What if you want to edit data on the blockchain? Solution: data hosted with IPFS/Swarm associated with a contract that only the contract owner can change.,"So I was recently talking with a friend about some Ethereum use cases and it came up that everything on a blockchain is permanent and only a hardfork can change the data. This is usually advertised as a pro rather than a con, but my friend mentioned child porn. If someone can upload child porn photos or maybe even doxx someone and post their personal info on the blockchain for everyone to see, how would you take down the photos or info?


The solution I came up with was the idea of letting the owner of a contract change the data in that contract by sending a specfic token to a certain address or to the contract itself. The transaction can include code that tell the miners what the new data should be. This way we can add edit-ability to data on Ethereum but still maintain censorship resistance because only the original poster of the data can change it. If child porn or other insidious data is posted on the blockchain, the police/feds can obtain a warrant to the owner of the contract to get his token to erase the photos or data.


What do you guys think? Would this require a change in the protocol or could this be accomplished a different way? Is this even feasible or could this be a major problem to the consensus protocol?

personalfinance,Work Retirement Plan has Pre-tax and Roth. How does this affect limits?,"My work sponsored retirement account offers Roth investments as an option. I'm currently saving 16% into it total split evenly between pre-tax and Roth, which would be about $6300 as each type of contribution.

My question is how does this interact with federal limits and IRAs?

The FAQ has these lines about contributions:
&gt; You may make Roth contributions up to the Plan rate limit which is generally 30% of base pay... Roth contributions also apply to the annual IRS contribution limit. If you are making both pretax and Roth contributions, the combined contributions will apply to the same annual IRS contribution limit.

The key limits listed say $18,000 for 401(k) (makes sense), but also that the max contribution is $54k. How does this all break down? Does this mean I can contribute up to $18k as pre-tax *and* 30% a year as Roth, or would all contributions over $18k be treated like a taxable account? Is this all separate from IRA limits?

Considering this plan has good, low expense index funds, should I focus on maxing this out before looking at an IRA, or should I open one anyway?",finance
personalfinance,Just dropped out of Grad School. Need advice on student loans.,"I am 24 years old and I just withdrew from graduate school, after attending for just under 2 months. My undergrad was paid for so I did not have any student loans before then. Here is my loan information:

* Direct unsubsidized loan (5.31%) of $20,500 
* Direct loan grad plus (6.31%) of $2,200 
* Total interest accrued for my direct unsubsidized loan is $157.16, and for my grad plus loan is $9.15. So, my current loan balance is $22,866.31

And my checking account information:

* My total payments for tuition and other fees totaled to $14,786 and I am expecting $6,066 of that back from 6 credits of tuition (two of my classes had not started yet). 
* The remainder of my loans not used for tuition/fees was deposited into my checking account, total to $7,914
* My parents had offered to pay for my housing during graduate school, so they had given me $10,000 in advance.
* Regular expenses during the last 2 months total to $2,500. This puts my checking account at about $15,000
* I have not yet received a bill for my housing there, which I expect to be around $2,000. So let's just say that the university owes me $4,000. Adding that to my current checking account puts me at $19,000

I have not been contacted by my financial services about paying back the loan. The policy is that as long as I am in school full time, then I don't need to start making payments. Payments are scheduled to begin in October 2018. As interest is accruing, I think it is my best option to make a payment right now. My parents are understanding of my situation and have offered to help me pay off my loans in full if I decide that is the best thing to do. I hate asking them for more as they have been very generous with helping me financially my entire life, and now I have moved back in with them. My goal is to find work, and then an apartment ASAP.

So, I think I want to leave myself with a little spending money as I do not have any income right now. Do I pay off the grad plus loan in full? And pay off a portion of the direct unsubsidized loan? Also, is there anything I should know about student loans that I am missing (such as if I am required to start making payments now that I'm not in school)?

Edit: I realize that my unsubsidized loan is quite a bit bigger than the grad plus loan, so even though the interest rate is smaller, it is accruing more interest. Does this mean I should pay off a big portion of the unsubsidized loan first?",finance

&amp;nbsp;

I desperately want to get out of paying $500 a month for my car 2016 Altima 2.5S. The minimum payment is $491 and change. The interest rate is 4.29% with Amplify CU in Austin, TX. The expected payoff date is 10/28/2022. Bought it on July 4, 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

I bought the car for $18,750 plus extended warranty (I think. I also think I dropped the ball on this one because I didn't ask for it) and GAP insurance along with finance charges. Plus $6,000 upside down loan from the previous car that was totaled in an accident, which has been rolled over to my current car. So the total balance came to a final about $32k. Since buying Altima, I have about 30k left.

&amp;nbsp;

Car payment: $500
Geico Auto Insurance: $167 with $1000 deductible comp/collision

&amp;nbsp;

I got in accident again on the 19th of February, so my insurance premium is going up, again within a year. I'll see it go up again this April. I had my tax returns at $1900, and I already put $900 towards the other debt I had. So I have about $1000 left that I need to save for the deductible.

&amp;nbsp;

Housing: $1,400 with 2 other roommates, my rent is $565.

&amp;nbsp;

Credit cards:  
CapOne: $84/mo min ($2,722.19 balance/4k limit) 23.40% APR (2 years old)  
CapOne: $35/mo min ($1,076.82 balance/2k limit) 19% APR (2 years old)  
Chase: $25/mo min ($624.72 balance/800 limit), 18.74% APR (I've had this card for for 9 years)  
Discover: $25/mo min ($641.87 balance/800 limit), 23.49% (1 year old)    

&amp;nbsp;

I was being irresponsible with credit cards. I cut up the CapitalOne credit cards so I only have Chase and Discover cards, but I do not use them. Lately, however, I am using the Discover card for the gas only and I pay before statement closes. It also has cash back rewards @ 5% for gas.

&amp;nbsp;

I took out personal loans about $2500, so I have $2200 balance at $97/monthly.

&amp;nbsp;

So essentially, I'm paying $1,500~ a month before groceries, gas, other expenses. I have a dog, I pay $40 a month for dog food. Details about my income is below.

&amp;nbsp;

On Discover's statement, as of January 29, 2017, my FICO score is 617. On CapitalOne's credit score tracker, as of February 20, it shows 610.

&amp;nbsp;

According to my credit reports, I only have one account in collection, which is $343. I can pay-to-delete when time comes. I also have a student loan that was originally with Sallie Mae, which has been charged off, now with Navient. According to the credit reports, it show that my balance is $16,913 as of January 2017. I originally took out $12,000. I never graduated at the same college. I have Dept of Ed loans of $28k, also same college, and the payments begin in March 2017. I don't know if I can defer again yet but I am still in school, at least half-time student as status, at community college. 

&amp;nbsp;

To point out about my federal student loans and private student loans, I went to an University in DC and I left due to poor academic advising poor academic support. The University has low graduation rate, 24% 4-year graduation rate. So I don't know if this could be a good excuse for discharging the loans?

&amp;nbsp;

My job is Tier 3 Technical Rep with hourly rate of $14.50, 7AM-4PM full time in video call center. Health insurance deducts from my paycheck about $225 monthly. Cigna with low plan. I just started the 401k with 1% contribution. I bring home about $837 biweekly after all the deductions. I am underpaid, but I have no degree or certification, the company has been on 8 to 10 years pay raise freeze. However, the pay raise proposal on table, but not a priority at this time.

&amp;nbsp;

As for my side job, I do Amazon Flex (PrimeNow delivery driver), independent contractor. In the past, I was able to earn at least $300 a week. But since I got back in school as part time, two classes per semester in the evenings (this time, Tuesday thru Thursday), it's kind of hard to come by. But for the last month or so, I was able to make maybe $200 a week or less, sometimes nothing for a week.

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, I can bring home a wide range from $400 to $1200 a month from Amazon, but could be less. And $1600~ a month from my day, full-time job, after tax. That's $2000 a month minimum when counting Amazon.

&amp;nbsp;

I've read about bankruptcy, sometimes I feel like this is the only way to go to get rid of these debt, but I don't want to. And the student loans can't go away? 7 years of destroyed credit. I'm single, going on 30 years old with the goal of completing school by Fall 2018 in Network Administrations with Associate degrees. I also have to have a car. I live in Austin, the public transportation is not as reliable. I also want to be prepared to live on my own possibility in the future. 

&amp;nbsp;

I even spoke with one bankruptcy lawyer through free consultation. I was informed that Navient will not be discharged. She is willing to support me in discharging my credit cards and personal loan. I have discussed on buying another car while letting Altima go through repossession then file for bankruptcy. I also have the choice to surrender my car in the process of filing bankruptcy. Continuing making payments until case closes, then surrender my car, then from there buy another car. Or file bankruptcy, surrender right away, and get another car while getting hit with high interest rate (obviously not feasible route).

&amp;nbsp;

I acknowledge how stupidly irresponsible I was with money. I want to take charge and be a better responsible person financially. I want to bounce back. I want to be financially stable. But at this time, I feel so stressed, I am overthinking, it's abusing me mentally. So any help will be greatly appreciated.

They stated the car was $10,000 and they took $1000 off of it plus the $2000 for our trade in and $1700 that we paid for down payment bringing the car down to $5300. Which was reasonable as KBB value was at $7700 and the trade in was an '89 Corolla with 101K miles.
I asked if there was any extra fees and he said the only extras would be sales tax (lie) which we were okay with and we had signed a piece of paper there under the idea we would be getting a loan for $5300 + sales tax and they had stated that there was a 45 day grace period without interest. (also a lie)

Once we got to the finance department. They had taxed on an extra $1700 dollars. $420 for sales tax, $800 for Gap insurance (which we could get back by paying off the loan early) and $480 in extra fees. Also, by the way, the interest percentage is at 19.99% and they never told us who our loan was through, just that they would call and set that up with us.

Since it was going to be my girlfriend's car the plan is in the 45 days we would put her tax refund towards it and sell off a few things bringing it down to around $2000 which I could pay off and then she can pay me back no interest. I did verify there is no penalty for paying off the loan too early.

Today we got a call from the loan company as they were reviewing her paperwork and stated that interest has already started to accrue but they are still going through and processing paperwork so she is unable to start paying yet. What can we do?

TLDR - car dealership told us we had 45 days interest fee on our new loan which we had planned to pay off by then. Loan company just called to ask followup questions and told us interest (19.99%) has already started but we can't pay yet because they're still going through paperwork. What can we do?",finance
personalfinance,Foreign Tax Credit [US Expat in Canada],"Im a US self-employed resident in Canada.  Im exempt from self-employment tax (social security) because of the totalization agreement between Canada and the US and I have CPP (Canadian Pension Plan) deducted from my income.

I understand I can invoke a foreign tax credit for income tax paid to the Canadian government. Does this also apply for CPP taken from my income or does it only include federal / provincial tax?

As a side note: I owe ~$600 in federal / provincial tax and $1600 in CPP. The $600 is not enough to wipe out my IRS tax owed.

My girlfriend defaulted on her student loans and ended up coming to an agreement with the collector for monthly payments to avoid having her paychecks garnished.  We are together and living together if that helps or matters.

I filed her taxes for her and we were getting back a nice chunk of change with claiming our daughter.  Turns out that chunk of change went completely towards her student loan.

personalfinance,Question Regarding Roth IRA withdrawal to Payoff Student Loan,"Hi All;

My wife and I have been working very hard on our finances this year and (I hope) are making significant improvements towards our financial situation. 

Here is one specific question I had - my wife has a Roth IRA started in her childhood that currently has about $13,000. We have always just set this aside as 'hidden money'. My question is, is it worth kicking-off a snow-ball debt payment by withdrawing about $3000 from this account and using it to eliminate her student loan balance? This would pay off her student loan which is both our lowest value debt and our highest interest rate debt. We would then use the $250/mo now freed up against our next debt. 

Are there any tax implications of removing the $3,000 from the Roth IRA? If week stay the path and just keep making our payments on the loan it would get paid off anyway by the end of the year, we were just hoping push the process a bit more. 

We are simultaneously budgeting to build up our emergency fund (which is going well) and whittle away at 0% interest credit card debt before the end of the interest free period.",finance

Every time I logged out of Credit Karma it would change my estimated refund amount from $6k federal/$2k state to $112 federal/$228 state.  It kept overriding my K-1 information when I would log out, so I would have to go back in and uncheck a box... then re-check the box and it would recalculate to the correct value.

Well, I made sure before I filed that it showed the correct amounts.  I even have the pdf it said it was submitting to the IRS with all the correct amounts on it.  But I got an email minutes later saying my federal return was accepted and I thought that was strange because I figured they would want to review a $6k refund, and when I checked, they had accepted the $112 amount, because Credit Karma submitted the incorrect information without my K-1 deduction.  State is pending at $228 instead of $2k as well.

So what can I do?  Is there any way to amend a return for a bigger refund or am I going to get penalized if I try and change it?

personalfinance,Next Steps &amp; UPDATE - 2017 Plan: Student Loan to Zero - But How?,"Hello all!


Just wanted to update you with my plan to pay my student loan down to zero this calendar year. See my original post here: [Original Post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5krbqc/2017_plan_student_loan_to_zero_but_how/)


Ill give you the TL;DR version.


* **Issue #1: Student loan to Zero**- *Unexpectedly, I received a bonus of 5k based on my 2016 performance. So, I used my bonus plus 5k of my savings to pay off my half of my loans. My parents were thrilled to match my large payment. The remaining 2k I paid off just the last week.*

* **Issue #2: Credit Card Debt**- *Having 4.5k in CC debt at high interest rate was definitely not ideal. Based on advice from this sub, I knew I had to pay it off immediately. I just received my tax return and was able to use it to pay off my CC debt almost entirely. The remaining 1K I hope to pay off in the next few months.*

* **Other Updates:**

* Paying off more than half my total debts has felt amazing. The only remaining debt I have is my car loan, which I received tons of advice on as well (which was all very much appreciated). 

* Moving into my grandparents and having no rent home fell through, but I was able to find a roommate and move into an apartment within walking distance from work to cut down on gas and parking costs downtown. 

* **Next Steps &amp; Questions:**

* Recently opened an Roth IRA via Fidelity which I will now be throwing $150/month at. **Any suggestions on funds for investment strategies?** *I also have a traditional 401K and Roth 401K through my employer which I am contributing at 4% and 3%, respectively. Match is 4%.*

* Also considering to go back to school for another year for a paralegal studies certificate since my job requires me to work with regulations and many lawyers. Program should cost less than 3K. **Is this worth it?**

* How/Where should I begin saving $$ aimed at property investment?


Thank you all for the great advice. I feel much more confident in my financial position because of you all. Again, I look forward to hearing your advice!",finance

This seems somehow illegal... would I be breaking any tax laws or is my idea sound? Can anyone point out an immediately better option for me as an expat making under the FEIE amount?

I just realized while writing this, I'll have to pay my residential country's capital gains tax as well, correct? Ugh. I guess I'm not sure what my options are. The whole situation is a mess actually.

I have told her that she needs to get a part-time on campus job (they usually have them filled by financial aid qualifications which she would qualify for) and that any money made from that job needs to go toward her ""fun"" money such as dates, eating out, clothes etc. 
The real problem lies in her parents. Her dad is (mostly) absent since they don't get along but because she is under 19, her mom is on her savings and checking accounts. Her mom recently was let go from her job because, ""the supervisor didn't like her."" This is the third job of its kind that the mom has been fired from. My little cousin knows that she will have to be secretive with the money. As far as anyone else knows, tuition costs 24k+ to attend this university (they lump the projected costs for living, food, tuition all into one) and to our knowledge they have not worked out that actual yearly tuition is only 12k. I will be able to get her an account opened through some connections while she is under 19 that I have told her only she needs to be on. I do not want any access to money and I am not willing to be on an account with anyone but my husband. Used to work for a bank, been there, seen how that all happens. I know that if her mom (or any siblings) find out how much money she will have reimbursed, they will start seeing stars and end up needing to ""borrow"" money. I refuse to let this happen. She has worked too hard for her grades and music scholarships to have to put up with freeloaders. As far as any of her family knows, she will have to get a job to pay rent and other expenses. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or good tips who has been in a situation like this? Have I missed anything? Is there anything that you cannot spend scholarship/grant money on? 

When it comes time for her to re-file her FAFSA, I do not want any residual money to affect her qualifying. I am fully aware that we may need a plan to hide (yes, I know its probably illegal) the residual money so that she is technically not lying on her FAFSA. I am thinking in the form of a cashier's check made out to herself that she will hold on to. Does FAFSA have the ability to check accounts when they ask how much is in an account? Will this affect her next year's qualifications?

I really just want her to be able to live comfortably and make good grades without having to deal with all of the extra family drama. She is getting an opportunity that so many others don't typically have by having everything essentially paid for. 

edit 1: I just wanted to add that I have no intentions of helping her financially because I have my own bills to worry about, nor do I intend to let her live with me.

personalfinance,Is it worth it for me to hire a CPA?,"So basically, I have a normal W-2 job, but then I also rent out a room in my house on Airbnb.  I made about $7,000 last year in Airbnb income and I'm really confused about how to handle deductions.  My Airbnb business has a few deductions that I'd like to consider, namely:

-Internet costs

-My furnace broke in the middle of winter and had to replace it.

-Dryer broke earlier in the year and had to buy a new one

-Utility costs (water, electricity, etc)

-Purchased a new bed frame and night stand for the Airbnb guest room

-Purchased some new sheets for the Airbnb room.

-I live in my significant other's house and I split the mortgage with her, but I'm not on the mortgage - would like to be able to deduct some of that cost if possible

My main confusion is how to handle deductions for things that I benefit from as well.  For example, we needed to repair the furnace in order to have heat in our house, and obviously, any guests that stay with us need heat.  But at the same time, we need heat too.  Same goes with the dryer.  We need it in order to clean sheets for guests, but obviously, we need the dryer for ourselves too.

I feel like deductions for things that are exclusively for the Airbnb room are probably easier, but even then, I'm not sure if I'm permitted to deduct the entire cost all at once or if it has to be staggered out over years (i.e. bed frame cost $150 or so, could I deduct the entire $150 from my Airbnb earnings now?)

Recently talked to a CPA who estimated it would cost me between $350 and $450 to do my taxes.  Before, I've always just done them myself for free.

I'm firmly in the 25% marginal tax bracket for federal and in the 7.85% marginal tax bracket in my state (so effectively, a 32.85% marginal tax rate).

It would seem to me that I'd need to save more than whatever the cost of the tax preparation services would be in order to make it worthwhile.  Doing some really basic math, it seems like I'd need to be able to deduct at least $1400 or so from my Airbnb income  in order to break even (assuming CPA costs on the high end of $450).

I guess my question is, does my situation seem like one in which it would make sense to hire a CPA?  

The other option would be to try to research it myself and figure out the permissible deductions, but not sure how comfortable I feel doing that.",finance

personalfinance,Budgeting and financial stability help for a young couple and my SO can't work.,"I've recently gathered the information I needed from my SO about her college loan debt and medical debt. I was reviewing it, and I'm not sure where to start, as my own family won't be of help, nor hers, as both of our families are currently in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.

We both have no idea how to budget, or handle finances. And since both of our families filed for similar reasons; medical debt, student loans, both of our mothers didn't understand the importance of paying credit bills, et, we don't really feel comfortable talking to them about the issues.

In November/December we'll be moving in together once I complete training for the US Navy. So my income will be approximately $1,800 before taxes getting out of RTC in July. We're getting married in September while I'm in school, which will add $1,200 to my income as that's the BAH allowance for my current permanent address, but we won't be touching that until we move.

Here's the issue. My SO has multiple sclerosis, and is unfit to drive, and at this point her doctor has recommended applying for disability, but SO doesn't want to. She has cognitive and memory impairment, absolutely cannot get hot in the slightest, needs to have the option to sleep during the day due to severe fatigue, and is on a slew of medications and chemotherapy at the moment.

She's unfit to work. So we're going to try and live on base wherever I'm stationed so she won't be alone in an unfamiliar city while I'm on base.

Currently she's in school, but about to drop out because she hates college and sees no benefit to staying to get a degree she can't use. So she's smart about that at least.

She has $3,500 in federal loans, and they won't start accruing interest until 6 months after she either drops below full time/quits/graduates, but she's been making smaller payments towards that will her left over scholarship money. So that is the current balance.

She also has almost $8,000 in medical bills, which is sure to grow before we get married and I can get her on my medical insurance. She pays the minimum $68 a month, due to only having her part time library work-study job, and the pay is shit, so she can't afford to make any higher payments right now.

So, I want to know what I need to do to plan for our life. We've talked in dept about everything relating to finances and how we want to handle money. We're on the same page. 

But on such a limited income, I'm not sure how to go about being able to save for a cushion since medical emergencies are bound to happen and so are unforeseen circumstances. 

I want to pay off the debt, save for a cushion, budget our expenses, save for retirement, and, later on, attempt to save for a trip overseas so I can meet her family and she can meet mine. 

And also what I need to keep for taxes next year. I know she has kept the itemized bills and receipts for her student loans, tuition, and medical bills, but is there anything else I should be doing?

Sorry for the long ass wall of text but I'm pretty alone in this situation and not sure how to go about this, so this was my only option right now since I live way out in the boonies at the moment and the closest thing we have to a financial planner is a church treasurer.",finance

Thanks for this, but I've been reading a lot of the topics recently and just need some eli5 clarification... or a translator. :D

If it helps with answers:
I'm 40 and just retired from the military. Going to school now and just want to be financially stable in the future. I have 2 CDs at NAVY FCU (2% and 3%) and heard in these recent threads that CDs are not the way to go. Please advise :)

1. Its been recommended to buy Vanguard retirement funds for the year you want to retire. I've seen that I can actually purchase those from my Ameritrade app. Is there a difference doing it through Vanguard's website? Is this an account you keep putting money into?

2. I-Bonds are good? What's the benefit over other bonds?

3. VOO and VTI? Again, is it the same as buying in Vanguard website? In the theme of the Warren Buffet threads these were recommended. I believe I saw Spy as well. What about the other Vanguard funds? There are a lot... Any info Or recommendations would be awesome.

4. Any truth in getting a discount on insurance from GEICO if you own one stock of BRK.B? How do you get discount if real?

5. Someone mentioned a minimum of $3000 to get a Vanguard 500 index fund (are those the VOO and VTI above?) but the ETF for that fund is $216. ELI5 what's the better investment?

6. CDs are no good?

7. What about those online accounts like Brinks, Netspend, etc... are they trust worthy? I am always skeptical of to-good-to-be-true... 5%!? Up to $5000? So you get more than one account? Set up auto deductions? What happens when you go over $5000 (like the interest earned pushes you over). Does it drop your interest rate? Or do you keep account at $4900 to take into account interest?

8. Should I start a 401k or IRA? Or am I too old? Which is better for my situation? Is a 401k just a retirement fund that earns interest? I never had one sorry for ignorance. I just see it thrown around a lot.

Thanks to anyone and everyone that sheds a little light on these items.

personalfinance,Some lessons learned and tips to stay on top of your finance and retirement goals,"Very quick story and some lessons I learned.

I went from broke graduate student / government intern at 25, living in Manhattan, to mildly successful Director at 32. During these 7 years, between two different jobs, my salary changed more than 8 times (always in the right direction, thankfully.) I want to retire early and comfortably, so I started trying to set myself up for that. I am nowhere near my goals, but you need a goal to start down this road at all.


I was always contributing to 401ks and saving what I could (not much). Rent and food was always an upsetting pain (extremely high in NYC if you aren't crafty about it) and took a big chunk out of my extra cash, and still does.
So lazily, instead of drastically cutting expenses, I tried to grow my salary, which did work.

My point is this: When you start to become successful *(and all of you will, since you already took the first step to educate yourselves and read forums like this)* and get some breathing room in your budget, it is a natural tendency to increase you spending WHILE decreasing you vigilance over your finances.


Do not let lifestyle creep or extra cash put you behind where you started by not monitoring and adjusting to your new financial situation. Here are some the ways I try to stay ahead of the curve into early retirement. All of these concepts revolve around the idea of **PAYING YOUR FUTURE SELF AS IF YOU WERE A BILL.** Think about that and reflect on it.

* **Maximize ALL pre and post tax advantaged investment accounts.** It only takes $692 pre-tax dollars to maximize your 401k, only about half of which you would see if you don't invest it. You are buying your own money from the government basically. Even if your company offers expensive shitty, investment plans, absolutely take advantage of them and try to move your money to lower cost funds in the future.


* **Open a low-fee Roth IRA IMMEDIATELY if you don't have one**. Vanguard will let you open one with only $1,500. $10,000 in a single qualifying fund gets you admiral shares, which typically have an Expense Ratio of 0.05%. Check your MAGI against the limits which I believe are $118,000 (phase out begins) to $133,000 (ineligible) for single filers. The contributions are post-tax, and the withdrawals are not taxed when you are of age. Contributions can be taken out at any time with no penalty (except for the future earnings you lose on them)


* **Start investing (smartly) outside of your retirement accounts.** I use Acorns, which uses low Vanguard index funds. I set up a daily contribution of $7. This adds up to $2,500 a year, just as a little piggy bank. I also use eTrade to invest in companies I like, but this is just play money. Never invest money that you need or don't have, since is it literally gambling.


* One thing I do not do and am chastised about is not keeping a **separate emergency fund**. The arguments are that there is a chance that when you need the money, the market is probably doing poorly also so you would have to sell investments at a loss to get the cash you need. For me, I have no family and no car or home, so any large, unexpected cash needs I can easily come up with, between liquid investments, cash on hand and credit. I would rather every dollar I have be working for me, at a risk level I can pre-determine and tolerate, than have a pile of cash sitting and earning nothing. It is still recommended to have a few months living expenses on hand for when you need it. Not a bad idea.


* **Get your student loans in order.** Check your interest rates. If you are paying more than about 5-6%, start paying extra on every payment if you can. My loans total about $40,000 at 4.6% for undergrad and graduate school because I went to CUNY to save money. The minimum payments are about $280 a month, which I contribute $380 to. That extra hundred bucks is basically like earning 4.6% on an investment because the interest on that part of the principal does not capitalize. Try to consolidate your loans into a lower interest loan if you can, there are some companies that do this, but be careful, there are a lot of predatory practices in this field (just like issuing student loans themselves - what 18 year old understands the day they leave college they will start paying $1200 a month forever after graduating from NYU? none.)

* **Don't Use Credit Cards.** Even if there are rewards, letting the interest capitalize on the balance even just for one month will outweigh the rewards of the card,like cash back. I have an Amazon rewards card and the only time I use it is when I immediately log onto the Chase app and pay the card off completely that instant. Even having autopay pay the full balance is risky depending on the card, since they like to charge interest for even just one day after interest kicks in. Don't get scammed. If you have Credit Card debt- snowball it by transferring high APR balances to low APR cards and prioritize paying those debts down first and foremost before any post tax investments.

* **Keep watch of your finances.** I did everything wrong and still struggle with this. There is a story about a famous basketball player, many of whom go broke after leaving the NBA/NFL because they don't know how to manage their finances and are taken advantage of- This one fellow was paying 60 peoples' cell phone bills, since he felt he owed them and they expected him to because it was so little compared to his multi-million dollar contract. Don't do it. I stopped monitoring my finances like a hawk - I used to check every bill and autopayment that went out because each one was painful. I stopped doing that when I had the extra cash, and went back and found incorrect bills and fraudulent charges. Don't make that mistake. Many rich people are rich because they live like they make or have much less. Stay on top of your spending with budgets that you stick to, and monitor all outgoing money.


* **Entertain yourself with cheap hobbies.** I play WoW on some weekends instead of going out, and I know I save hundreds of dollars by not leaving the house for a night out between drinks, cabs, dinners and entertainment. Absolutely go out, and have fun, but don't party every weekend. It isn't healthy for your body or your wallet, even though t feels nice to spend $100 on dinner and not flinch because there is $7,000 cash in your checking account. Don't do this. Get outside, exercise, enjoy nature and be thrifty with your hard earned money. (but treat yourself within reason once in while.)

This is something I struggle with still: Every Penny Counts. Really it does. I still buy $4 coffee form Starbucks, and order seamless a few times a week because I don't feel like preparing food. But I am aware of this, and working to reduce unnecessary spending


There is a lot more, but trust me when I say, you will be successful, and you will be smart enough to keep that success forever.

personalfinance,I'm a high school senior and I have some questions about student loans.,"I'm a senior in high school and will be attending college at Southern Oregon University next year to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I lurk on r/personalfinance a lot and I feel like you guys could give me some insight on some things.
My college has a program for computer science majors where it cuts your 4 year degree into 3 years, you get your 3rd year completely paid for, and for the other two your credit costs get halved. So, I'm not getting a bad deal. I also have about $7K in renewable scholarships and will be living at home for Freshman year. 
However, I will not be getting any financial support from family or anything, so what I have is what I have. I'm 99% sure I'll be needing to take out student loans as I only have about $1000 in my savings account. I work at Sears and am lucky to get 20 hours a week. So that begs my questions:

-are student loans really as bad as people make them seem?
-how much hassle is it to get loans?
-can you get a student loan when you're 17?
-seeing as I'm only going to be paying for two years of school with just about half the cost, will I need a student loan?
-is there an interest rate on student loans, and if so, what's the going rate?

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to cover my credit card debt and pay that down instead? (US),"I currently have a little less that $10,000 worth of credit card debt and I really want to be able to pay this down. It's spread over 4 credit cards and the average interest rate is about 18%. It was stupid college spending and I didn't understand anything at the time about credit cards, interest rates, etc. which is how I got here. My yearly salary is $46,200 right now, after taxes, making $2,388/month and I'm also paying off student loans, about $870/month at 6.7% interest which I've already refinanced. 

I have a full budget already laid out which I try to follow to the letter and only from my debit card. However, the credit card debt still seems overwhelming and I haven't been able to throw more money at student loans because of it. 

Is it a good idea to refinance the credit card debt through personal loans out there that I see nowadays? If yes, which is the best place to do so?",finance
personalfinance,"Considering mortgage refinance, couple preliminary thoughts and questions.","Bought our house in June 2016, used an FHA 203k streamline mortgage. The property was sold to us for about $115 which included the services of a realtor due to the complexity of this type of loan process. Borrowed an additional 30k for renovations and all of the work was completed by early fall. Total note was about 145k at 4.375 percent (high due to risk associated with 203k loan) 

Fast forward to now, the guy we got our original loan through contacted me about a refinance. We discussed this last summer and he had told me that I would be able to potentially lower my payment, remove PMI and lower my interest rate when we refinance based on equity alone from the 203k renovations and other various out of pocket improvements we've made. Comps on my block are selling in the 200k range. 

My question is basically can the added value of the property work for me in terms of covering the costs associated with refinancing, can I move to a conventional loan rather than FHA to drop PMI and is all of this worth it so soon after buying the place? 

I definitely plan on staying in the house for quite a while and I'm willing to provide more detailed numbers, but I just wanted to open a dialog prior to doing so.",finance

personalfinance,Bond index funds and rising interests rates... need help allocating my money!,"My partner and I are two PhD students with 4 years remaining towards our degrees. We both worked prior to starting graduate school, and so have some assets saved up; I'm hoping to get some advice as to how to allocate them.  I'm concerned that we are perhaps skewed too heavily towards stocks, but all of Vanguard's lower risk options generally contain bond index funds.  Since we're likely to be in an environment of rising interest rates over the next several years, won't bond index funds lose value?  
&amp;nbsp;  

When we finish graduate school, we'll likely want to buy a house, though we could always rent for a few years and save up a down payment if the market was down and we didn't want to withdraw from our taxable accounts at that time.  
&amp;nbsp;    

Anyway, here's what we currently have **excluding** our retirement accounts:  
&amp;nbsp;  

*~$55k in cash (emergency fund)  
*~$110k in stock market index funds in taxable accounts  
*~$30k in US gov't savings bonds (given to me by my grandparents when I was a baby/child, earning 4% interest and will begin maturing over the next few years)  
&amp;nbsp;  

Since we'll be wanting to buy a house in the next 5 or 6 years,  should we move some of the money in the taxable account to something less risky, or at least put any additional money we add to it in something less risky? Am I correct in my evaluation the bond index funds aren't the best idea right now?  Are there other, better options that are less risky than VTSAX but that will still yield a decent return?  
&amp;nbsp;  

Also, since we are quite frugal and in a LCOL area with decent PhD stipends, we can likely save some more money over the course of our graduate programs.  My wonderful parents are maxing out my Roth IRA for me while I am in school, so I know we should focus first on maxing my partner's Roth IRA.  If there's money left over after doing that, where should we park it?

Currently 27yo, making 68k in a high COL city. I have approx 44k in 401k and 12k in Roth IRA. I have around 7k remaining in student loans with interest rates around 3-4%. Around 15k in savings. Pay off my credit card in full every month. No property. My savings rate hasn't been the best, as I've gotten into some hobbies that have kinda high entry costs but provide me a lot of satisfaction, exercise, and life experience. Overall, my upbringing instilled frugal values in me that I abide by and I think overall that I'm doing okay financially. 

I have recently been offered and accepted an opportunity through work to relocate to TX, and I was able to negotiate a 25% salary increase. This is a great opportunity for me professionally, with good potential for additional increase in future earnings. Combined with the new location and lower COL, I think I'm in a favorable position for a high savings rate and to start planning for FIRE. 

I currently contribute 21% to my 401k with 6% employer match and a couple thousand to my Roth IRA annually. So maximizing neither. Following the move, I expect that I should be able to maximize annual contributions to both. 

Here are my questions:

- I have options to contribute to a traditional 401k and/or a Roth 401k (though employer with Fidelity). A financial advisor at UBS suggested I contribute all towards my Roth 401k, and contribute what/when I can to my Roth IRA (that I have with UBS). That's what I've currently been doing. But with the consideration that I'll be able to max both 401k and IRA going forward, is a Roth or traditional 401k better to use?

- Are there better brokers than UBS for my Roth IRA? I see Vanguard getting used around here a lot. What kinds of questions should I be asking brokers?

- How focused should I be on paying off my remaining student loans?

Anything else I should be considering? Maybe one other thing is that I have a medical condition where I can generally expect to max my insured out of pocket expenses annually. This is 2k total, with 1k through employer HRA and 1k that I contribute to an FSA. Not sure if the FSA is the best approach or if looking into the HSA option is better.

personalfinance,Advice regarding revocable living trust,"Hello PF,

My parent has asked me to look into the possibility of creating a trust that lists me and my brother (we are both adults) as beneficiaries in case something happens to him or if he retires in a different country (we are currently in the US). The main asset of said trust would be his home (located in southern CA, worth about 500k with 350k still owed on the mortgage). Ideally he would want us to be able to continue making the payments on the mortgage on his behalf (it is currently his primary residence but since it is a duplex the rent from the other unit more than covers the mortgage and bills) if he were to move to a different country. His interest rate is unbeatable currently (think 2%), and since it practically pays for itself this is very doable. 

I've done some preliminary reading and think a revocable living trust sounds like a reasonable way to go. Does anyone here have any advice on whether this is the right way to go about this? If so, what information do we need to gather before speaking to an estate lawyer? What are your experiences with something like this?

I've received a 1099-misc of my income from one of these people, and the other hasn't sent me anything yet but I can figure out what they paid me by looking at my records. 

First, should I file as an independent contractor/self-employed? Which forms do I need to fill out? And can I just treat my federal income as one lump sum or do I have to specify how much came from each person? They are in related fields of work so someone told me I could just put them together and say my ""business"" consists of me offering one general service (even though they are different things for each person).

Also, each of the two are in different states, and they're both out of state for me. How does this affect how I should file state taxes?

One last question: in 2015 I made just about the same with the same situation and I didn't file taxes because I thought I was under the income threshold that doesn't require you to file. But now I'm seeing that if you make over $400 as an independent contractor you have to file. Should I go back and file taxes for 2015 too?

personalfinance,Car loan question,"Hi PF! Long time reader and finally ready to get my finances in order! I was approved for my first car loan and the interest rate is retarded due to some credit card issues in college. The rate is 13% and my dad offer to loan me the money, but I want to take the loan to help rebuilt my credit. Ive been heading in the right direction (increased score by almost 100 points in a year or so) but the $13K loan will cost me a little more than $17K over the lifetime. 

I have a plan but would appreciate some advice on what would help build credit. 
Would it be beneficial if I accepted the loan (a personal car loan from WellsFargo since Im purchasing from a private party) and then have my dad help pay it off in a year or so? 

Thank you in advance!!

personalfinance,"Promotional interest rate on credit card is about to end, should I focus on paying that or another card I have with a higher interest rate?","So I know typically you want to pay down lines of credit with the highest interest rate first.  However I currently have two credit cards, one with an interest rate of 22% and one with a rate of 25%.  The 25% cards balance consists mostly of money with a promotional interest rate of 0%, but it ends in April at which point I will have to pay the 25% and deferred interest charges.  I am going to use most of my tax refund to put towards my credit cards, but I don't know whether to put it towards the 22% card which would take away about 2/3 of the total balance, or towards the 25% card which would actually wipe out the balance with about $200 to spare to put wherever else.  Please let me know what you guys think, again I know typically to go with the higher interest percent but since the promo ends soon I didn't know which to go with.  Thanks!

Edit:  So the overwhelming response is to pay off the 25% and avoid deferred interest charges, so that is what I think I'll do, thanks everyone for your input!  I was initially uncertain because the other card had a higher balance so I didn't know if the higher accrued interest charges would end up costing more than the deferred interest charges in the long run.   Seriously though you guys are the best!",finance
personalfinance,What is my best loan repayment plan right now?,"Hi guys, I would like to have your help on choosing the best repayment plan for me.  I am an mechanical engineering student and I will be graduating in May. Right now I am working at the internship and only taking half time at school. Since I am below 12 unit I am considered as a half time and and the Federal loan required me to chose a repayment plan.  My loan is $35k and my annual income from the internship is $20k. What would be the best repayment plan right now if I'm expecting for a salary increase after graduation ($55 -$ 65k).  The option that I have look into is PAYE. If my salary increase can I change the payment plan to standard? Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Excited to begin the avalanche (and snowball) in three days,"This Friday it all begins. I've taken my debt, put it all in order and discovered that in addition to the snowball method (which I was aiming for thanks to seeing debts disappear quickly), it's all set up to fulfill the avalanche method too. This is purely to get rid of my debt as my credit rating is good at 780.

I've always paid extra above the minimum due on credit cards and, while it's helped, I'm still just spinning my wheels with nothing concrete to show for it.

This paycheck (Friday) I'm stopping all of that. I'm paying minimums on all other debts and putting the money I would have spread around to the smallest debt instead. That moves a total of $100 now going toward a debt with a $28 minimum payment and a 26% interest rate.

Here's what I'm looking at:

*Son's preschool tuition: $151/mo, 0% interest, last payment due in May and then this money will be free to snowball. (I'm not considering this a debt with the other balances, just including it as the jumping off point for the snowball to really start to grow.)

*Home Depot: $900 balance, 25.99% interest, $28 min. payment

*BofA Visa: $2,800 balance, 20.49% interest, $77 min. payment

*Amex (AKA the bane of my existence): $11,000 balance, 15.24% interest, $244 min. payment. This card was maxed out only a few years ago at $22k so I do feel pleased with the progress I've made.

*Car: $12,000 balance, 2.59%, $320 min. payment, less than three and a half years left on the loan.

From my calculations, Home Depot will be paid off in July (giving it a little extra nudge thanks to a padded paycheck that's coming). The Visa maybe nine months later. Amex will still take a while, but by that point I will be putting $650 per month toward payments rather than $250-300.

So fingers crossed and I'm excited to post in the future about milestones and hopefully about one day soon being debt free!

personalfinance,"I accidentally cashed what i believe to be an incorrect tax return. What can i do, if anything?","So i went to cash my tax return check (supposed to be for about 90 dollars) today. Before getting to the bank, i hadn't opened my check at all as i thought it would be better to keep it safe in the envelope. When i went to cash it, i took it out and handed it to the clerk, who indicated that the return was only 10 dollars. I, being the person that i am, foolishly went along with this as i didn't particularly want to make things difficult and i wasn't sure what else to do. 

I'm aware that i screwed up and that i should have just taken the check back and gotten things sorted out that way, but it's too late for that. I'm interested in seeing if there's a way to get back the money I'm owed, as long as my estimation of my return is correct, or if there's nothing more i can do. Any constructive advice is appreciated.

Edit: So apparently your state and federal returns are mailed separately. Oops. I'm just waiting on the state return. Thanks u/dswpro for your input though.",finance
personalfinance,Can I pay my stay-at-home wife on the books?,"Okay, here's a weird one.

My wife has better credit than I do (~718 vs ~760). We're looking to buy a home, and a 750+ score is huge for your interest rate. However, I make the sole income, so I have to be on the loan.

Can I pay my wife as an independent contractor for home care so that she has enough income to qualify for a mortgage? This would have dual benefit; her credit would get us a better rate for the mortgage, but it would also keep the mortgage off of my Debt-to-income ratio, leaving me lots of room to invest in real estate down the road.",finance
