personalfinance,Offered a no-closing cost refinance from lender - trying to figure out the catch?,"I apologize as I know this is a common question, but I couldn't find one that really answered for this situation.

Our lender with whom we got our mortgage for our house back in November 2019 (7 months ago) reached out offering us a no closing cost refinance. Our original loan was a 30-year with a 3.75% interest rate, and it was sold to a servicing company.

The lender is offering us a new loan at a 2.99% interest rate with no points, no fees, and he says it is unlikely we will need a new appraisal. It would save us $100 a month, or he said we could just keep paying as we are and pay off the loan in about 26 years instead of 30. He said we will be responsible for any accrued or prepaid interest plus setting up a new escrow account for property taxes and home insurance, but we will receive our escrow refund and skip the payment the month after closing so we'd be recouping that cost.

My husband and I are confused because this seems like a ""too good to be true"" situation - responses to similar situations online all said ""the closing costs are usually rolled into the loan amount"" or ""they're offering you a higher rate than you could get elsewhere"" but the loan being offered isn't significantly more than our current balance (higher by about $150), and 2.99% seems about as low as I assume we could get. When we asked the lender what the deal was, he said it is a repeat client incentive program and all we're responsible for is the new escrow account.

My husband and I are still just super skeptical because we don't understand how this benefits the lender at all - how are they getting money from this? Even if it is a repeat client incentive, wouldn't the incentive be...to get money from us? Are we overthinking it and should just go for it?",finance

I'm trying to refinance my home for the first time and I'm not that great with the math on what would be a good closing cost for the rate, I've just recently contacted a company and they were giving me 2.625% for an interest rate with the closing cost of $4100.

personalfinance,Most optimal Financial Approach for young adult,"Hi everyone, thank you for clicking on my post :)

I am a 22M full-time college student with a part-time job. My annual income is around 20-25k. I have never been one to save and had a bad spending habit which eventually got me in around 1.5k in credit card debt, 9k in a personal loan, and 10k in student loans. ATM my CC interest rate is at 0%, PLoan interest rate @ 26.7% and student loans at \~4%. I previously had another CC debt for about 7k that has been paid off. I am not in a rush to pay my current CC as I have time and have been making on-time payments for my Ploans while accumulating more student loans.

As of MARCH 2020, I have learned from my mistakes and have managed to teach myself some basic finance. I was able to pull finances and spending together and paid off 7k in previous debt and saved away 6k in an emergency fund. I have even gone as far as setting up an HYSA, ROTH IRA, regular brokerage account, and a monthly budget. I have been investing since MARCH 2020. I am not stressing about my financial situation ATM. Should I be?

Would it also be advisable for me to be investing with all the debt that I have? I have been receiving COVID funding and have been saving and paying off these amounts on time and before the interest rate goes up. The reason I'm investing is that I want to start on a retirement fund early and the economy right now seems to be a good entry point. I am currently using any funds that are left over after I distribute them in my budget and savings to invest.

If investing is not a good approach right now, how can I go about handling the rest of my debts and loans quickly so I can resume investing? I already have the fund to pay off the CC debt as I'm just milking the 0% interest rates a little longer. Should I pay off my Personal loan early?

HYSA 6K

personalfinance,Paying off debts at home closing,"My credit score is much higher than my husband (who has some serious law school debt). We are buying a house with only my name on the loan so we can get a better interest rate. Without counting my husbands income, I am right at the line of qualifying for the loan. The lender wants me to pay off all my credit card debt at closing. It’s nothing crazy, less than 10k. 

I sold my house with a decent profit and I’m really having a hard time putting more money down at closing. We are putting a huge chunk of the profits for the 20% down payment to avoid PMI, and I am just watching the rest dwindle away slowly with all the other added fees and requests. 

I could avoid paying off these credit cards if I include gift money given to me yearly through inheritance. However this involves my parents and more paperwork. I want to know if it is the best choice, financially, to pay off the credit cards at closing instead of having more cash. There is some maintenance needed in the new house that we will need the money for, and I worry some will just end up back on credit anyway. I’m just having a hard time giving up the cash and want to be sure it is the best decision. 

Summary: made money from sale of my home. Husband and I are buying a new home and lender  requests that I pay off credit card debt at closing. I could supplement the funds in other ways if needed to avoid paying them off. Is it the best financial choice to pay off credit debt at closing instead of holding on to the extra cash for home maintenance and other potential investments? Are there any circumstances where it is better to have the cash versus no credit card debt?",finance
Banking,[USA] Sent a domestic wire transfer to Escrow company to close on a home. Entered the receiving bank's name in the 'Beneficiary' field. What now?,"Hi r/Banking - I wired my escrow company the funds I'm required to send to close on a home. Unfortunately, when I completed the domestic wire transfer form, I entered the escrow company's bank as the beneficiary INSTEAD of the escrow company itself.

All other information was correct: Account number is CORRECT; routing number is CORRECT; and escrow number is CORRECT.

The money left my account on Monday morning (June 29th) and I have the federal reference number for the transfer

I have called my escrow company to explain the error. Throughout the day, the escrow officer claims she has called her bank and provided them with the federal reference number for the wire, but was told they hadn't received anything.

I was able to call my bank earlier today (6/30) and have them send an amendment to the wire with the escrow company correctly listed as the beneficiary. 

My questions are as follows:

- Do bank's normally reject a wire transfer if the account number and routing number are correct, but the beneficiary name is wrong?


- If a wire IS rejected, what is the usual time frame for this to happen in? (counting on Redditors who may have experience with this) - Also, is there a waiting period for the money to be wired back? Essentially, I want to know if the wire transfer can be returned as quickly as its initial sending.


- In your experience, how long does it take a wire amendment to reach the receiving bank?


- Could my escrow officer have called her bank, explained the wire transfer she was looking for and confirmed with them that, yes, that money should be deposited to her account? I actually called her bank and explained the situation to them. The rep couldn't give me any information about whether or not they received the transfer (and I didn't expect her to share that kind of confidential information with me but I just needed to see what I could learn). The rep did say what I did happens a lot and that they will usually call the account holder to verify if the funds should be deposited in their account (provided the account and routing number are correct).


- Should I be worried?  (That is, any more than I am - which is a lot!)


At this point, I'm calling the wire department at my bank as soon as they open in the morning to confirm they processed and sent the wire amendment.

My real estate agent is working with the seller's agent and the seller agent's broker to see what we can do.

Anyways, I'm a little stressed and bummed out because I'm so close and made such a dumb mistake. My lender has already funded my loan and wired the money to the escrow company, but the escrow officer can't accept the funds until she has verified receipt of the money I owe. So now I'm worried about this deal falling through.

What are your thoughts?

Update - July 1st: My bank's called me first thing this morning and said the wire transfer was indeed returned. I immediately sent out a new one with the escrow company as the beneficiary. As of now (about 4 hours since I sent the new wire), the money has left my account and we are waiting to hear back from the Escrow officer if she has received the money. Anyways, it looks like we.mighybfinally close either later today or tomorrow morning.

Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,How do I pay taxes on a 30+ year old mutual fund?,"Hello /r/personalfinance. Posting on a throwaway  account for privacy reasons...

30+ years ago my family lived in the USA (Massachusetts), and during that time my parents saved money for me in a mutual fund - the account is in my name, and I believe it was saved through ""UGMA"" but I am not sure about that. We moved back to our home country, and my parents lost track of the account which was eventually transferred to the custody of the state through it's unclaimed property division. I've now completed the process of re-claiming the account, and I have received a check to cash out the value of the mutual fund.

I have a few questions:

1. How do I figure out how much taxes I owe? I have no idea how much money my parents initially deposited into the account or even when they did so, so I'm not able to calculate the appreciation. I assume the mutual fund could help here, but I don't know what type of documentation I need to ask for.
2. To whom do I owe taxes? I am not a US citizen (never was) or resident (haven't been for nearly 30 years). I do still have a SSN.
3. How do I pay any taxes owed? Supposing I owe taxes to the US federal government or the state government - how do I report them and pay them?
4. If I don't owe any taxes; what documents do I need to obtain (and from who) to certify that the money is post-tax?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

EDIT

Updates &amp; answers to common questions,

1. The amount is less than 40K.
2. Following the threads advice, I have consulted a CPA. He said he couldn't help without seeing documentation regarding the history/taxable events of the money in the fund. He said I would need a form 1099 or 1042S. So... I called the fund and unfortunately they do not have any documentation regarding any transfers since it has been purged from their system.
3. The Massachusetts lost property division is not answering calls due to COVID19, so I don't know if they can be of help.

Anyways - seems like I'm going to be hunting for any documentation of the history of the money for a while.

investing,"1 - Wednesday Morning Thoughts - Short, Medium, and Long-Term Focus Points","Below is a brief synopsis of the things I will be watching in the coming months and years to drive my investment decisions. I am not suggesting that these are the most important things to consider nor am I saying they are the only things that matter; this is just a list of things I believe will be significant market drivers going forward, and it will change over time. If this is well-received and helpful to the community, I may do this on a recurring basis.


**Short Term (3 months)**

1)	S&amp;P 500

2)	VIX

3)	Economic Indicators

4)	US Gov’t policy response to COVID resurgence


S&amp;P 500 appears to be trading in a horizontal channel right now, with support at 3,000 and resistance at 3140. Trading volume remains at elevated relative to pre-COVID levels, but risk-off days have seen greater-than-average trading volumes during June and since this channel formed. Average trading volume during 2Q20 rally has been rather weak compared to the activity which took place during the sell-off; this is important because volume confirms the trend, and if volume is weak (relatively speaking), the rally might be weaker than anticipated or a reversal may be on the horizon. SPY P/C ratio sits at 1.407 as of this writing (2:55 AM, 7/1/2020), suggesting that investors are protecting themselves against potential downward swings in the future or that there is speculation of another sell-off.




VIX sits at 30.43 as of this writing. This is an extremely elevated level relative to what is otherwise considered “normal” levels of volatility. Technicals suggest a range between 24 and 48 on VIX. These are quite critical technical indicators to watch: if VIX drops beneath 24, that would be a strong bullish indicator for risk-on sentiment and a sign that investors think the worst of the COVID crisis is behind us; if VIX breaks out above 48 and stays above that level, we may see a resurgence of aggressive risk-off sentiment. P/C ratio for VIX currently sits at 0.396, suggesting that many investors and traders are using VIX to take out a form of insurance against rising vol. This makes sense given the significant uncertainty regarding COVID, the upcoming elections, and near-term economic conditions that continue to remain murky. While SPY is not at levels registered by RSI as being “overbought” at the moment across any medium/long term timeframe, spiking volatility and poor readings from economic indicators could drive SPY into another risk-off mode.

Economic indicators will be the primary gauge for the market for the next several weeks; barring any sweeping gov’t intervention or policy responses to COVID or changes in trade policy, it is unlikely that the market will have material reactions to anything else outside of measures of economic recovery. The primary measure I will be watching is continuing unemployment claims – if PPP loans and fiscal policy intervention to protect American workers truly worked as well as intended, we should see an almost complete reversal in unemployment claims over the next 3 months as furloughed employees return to work and small businesses reopen their doors to customers. Such a reversal would likely be a huge driver for risk-on sentiment in markets, even though this should really be priced into the market at this point. While not an economic indicator, in conjunction with measures of manufacturing activity and consumer sentiment, watching raw material commodity prices will be an important measure of just how much activity is actually going on in terms of manufacturing production.

Senate republicans have generally come out against further stimulus to Americans in response to COVID until “more data” is available that shows how effective the first stimulus was. Timing here is everything; if data shows more stimulus is needed, some damage to market sentiment might be done before this stimulus reaches people in need. It will also be interesting to see what kind of stimulus actually comes down the pipeline: there is serious concern about an eviction crisis that will ensue once accrued rent over 2Q20 that was deferred comes due, and a policy response may be able to prevent this from happening (even if only kicking the can down the road once again). Without getting political, simply put this is an important thing to watch that will have an immediate near-term market impact once it comes down the pipeline if it comes at all.


**Medium Term (6 months)**

1)	US election

2)	US policy towards China

3)	COVID cases &amp; hospital crowding

4)	Small Cap solvency

5)	Large Cap technicals


Not much really needs to be said about the election in the US in November that people aren’t aware of – Biden = likely risk-off, Trump = likely risk-on. Markets like Trump more than the prospect of Biden and democratic involvement in market regulation. VIX has already priced in an increase in volatility during this period, which is why option contracts with October/November expiries have significant premiums. Even though this is straightforward and easy to understand, it is still critical to monitor if you will be involved in the markets during this period.

Regardless of the election results, there is growing bipartisan support in the US for being “tough on China.” While there is speculation as to what actions will be taken to reduce US dependency on China and the long-term knock-on effects of such actions, it would be wise to start positioning yourself defensively against any blowback from sanctions, policy shifts or growing tensions between the US and China now before liquidity becomes an enemy (in my opinion, of course). US behavior towards China could also impact the decisions of other world leaders, but I would personally not be surprised if we start seeing more independent decisions being made by the EU as a result of what has been called “weak leadership” in the US. Policies towards China globally are important to watch, and it would be wise to know what companies exist in your portfolio have exposure to China.

The resurgence of COVID in the US is worrying, but apparently not too much to shake market optimism. It is possible to argue this is a result of the “Fed put”, but regardless of why market optimism is drowning out this negative development, it is. The problem is not exactly the current resurgence, though; it is testing capacity for hospitals that will likely be strained across the country this fall when the flu season and COVID coincide. It only took a few weeks for Houston to reach capacity and need to install contingency overflow, which is a severe reminder that the virus can wreak havoc if left unchecked. Trump and senate republicans have openly come out against closing the economy again to stifle the virus, which could be a contributing factor to the market’s unwillingness to allow this to negatively affect current valuation levels. While this will allow businesses to stay open while COVID remains a threat, consumer sentiment will likely be driven by fear more than anything else in the near term; it would be wise to keep consumer sentiment in mind as the COVID crisis continues and evolves.

Small cap and small business solvency is a severe concern of economists and the Fed. Jerome Powell himself said that “the Fed can provide liquidity, but we cannot prevent insolvency.” Many businesses that are forced to cap capacity at 50% cannot remain solvent over the long term, and we may begin to see the first wave of insolvency for these vulnerable companies prior to the election. I have not done enough research to pinpoint specifically which industries/companies are the most vulnerable (outside of the obvious, like hospitality and restaurants), but once I look into it I will try to provide more insights here.

Monitoring daily trading volume, price action, trading channels and other technical indicators for large cap ETFs and indexes will be a fascinating endeavor for the coming months. Keeping the broader picture in mind, we’ve seen one of the most aggressive sell-offs, one of the most significant monetary/fiscal policy interventions, and one of the most profitable rallies the market has ever seen in a single quarter. This is a personal opinion, so it may be a point of contention for some: this rally from the March bottom has been entirely technically driven. There is noise driven by a spike in retail trader volume and there are some industry developments that affect price action, but it is difficult to argue that current price levels are reflective of fundamental valuations. Trading right now is fruitful because there is ample liquidity in most corners of the equity markets and technical traders have found that strategies they have not been able to successfully use in years are effective again due to hedge funds removing some of their algos and due to the inflow of “dumb money” from retail traders.


**Long Term (1+ years)**

1)	Inflation/deflation expectations

2)	Infrastructure reorganization in US

3)	Global geopolitical relationships

4)	EM stability

5)	Global policies influencing investment opportunities


The current consensus regarding inflation amongst economists is generally as follows: in the near-term, deflation is more likely and a major threat; in the long-term, inflation is likely but not until several years down the road. Deflation and a strengthening dollar will become a real possibility if consumer confidence remains low and spending remains stifled due to COVID, but (in my opinion) the Fed will do whatever it takes to crush deflation. Inflation will be the eventual outcome of current and future policies used to stifle the recession in the near-term and drive growth in the long-term. I could discuss this particular topic for quite a while, but will leave it at this for simplicity purposes.

If the US does truly work to gain economic independence of China, investment in infrastructure and production automation will be a key driver towards gaining this independence. Whether or not we see this in the next 12-18 months will likely be determined by how much economic damage is done by COVID-19.  It is difficult to predict the scale and magnitude that this kind of change would manifest, as well as how fast we would see the changes actually materialize; however, I think it is not a question of if this change will take place, but rather when it finally comes down the pipeline. Even if production is only partially moved onshore and some production and aspects of supply chains remain on other continents, onshoring any aspects of supply chains and production would be a radical shift to the US which had forfeited its manufacturing economy to become an information economy.

We are witnessing an odd shift in leadership and power around the world in real-time: the US is rapidly losing standing as a global leader, the EU has lost trust in China, Germany is looked to as a leader but has no defined successor to Angela Merkel after her protégé declined to be considered, tensions are rising in the middle east and between North and South Korea, and several other important things I’m sure are equally if not more important but I cannot recall at the moment. I personally will be watching how the following relationships evolve: US – EU, China – US, China – HK, and US – RU. I believe these relationships in particular could have the broadest impact on US markets and broader market sentiment.

The stability of Emerging Markets (EMs) is not broadly covered, but it is where some of the best investment opportunities will arise. In a recent conversation with Jonathan Ferro, Mohammed El-Erian said that opportunities do/will exist in EM, but they are “highly selective.” EMs have been broadly driven to a state of fragility due to the COVID crisis, so it would be very easy to make a poor investment decision in this area without proper due diligence. This is another area I intend to research in more depth to understand better myself, so I will not cover it in great detail here. This is something investors should follow, though, if they want to use EMs to diversify their portfolios.

Climate change has come to the forefront lately as a critical issue, not just socially but also from an investment perspective. “Green” funds have seen consistent inflows even as actively managed funds have seen broad capital outflows, despite having rather high fees. The writing may very well be on the wall with this particular point: ESG is the way forward, with a particular focus on the “E” and “S”, in light of recent events. A lot of this momentum was driven by global leaders banding together to establish goal and targets to reduce adverse impacts on the environment. In the coming months and years, I will be following the initiatives and policies enacted by government bodies closely as they relate to ESG, as I think government policies may become a leading indicator of what to expect from corporations going forward.

personalfinance,Help understanding interest rates,"Hello! I’m UK based and with Lloyd’s Bank. 

I had a savings account with them which just matured, so I’ve moved my money from there and want to open a new savings account.

When looking through their savings accounts they all have examples of what the paid interest will be upon the closing account balance. All of the examples of closing account balances have interest rates which are half of what I would expect?
I am expecting that I am just an idiot and you are all going to laugh at me but let me give you an example:

Club Lloyd’s Monthly Saver Account:

Saving £100/month for 12 months (totalling £1200 into account) at a 2% FIXED interest rate.

They have said that upon closing the balance would be £1212.

This makes no sense to me as to my working:
2% of £100 = £2
£2 x 12 months = £24
So closing balance should = £1224?

Am I just being an idiot? Tell me why!!

I tried asking them if there was hidden taxes taking a 50% cut and they said there wasn’t. They said the reason for the difference is because the paid amount the account holder puts into the account is not fixed each month it can vary (well, obviously) but that is not what their example says! Their example is showing that £100 has been entered each month.

Please tell me I’m being stupid, but most importantly explain why. I don’t understand interest rates in the slightest.

personalfinance,Inherited IRA Options,"Hello everyone. I need some help on the best way to manage an Inherited IRA.

My mother passed away on June 1st after a long battle with breast cancer, and left my sisters and I 10% each from her Vanguard Rollover IRA (my father has the other 70%). Thanks to the new SECURE act, we have 10 years to liquidate the funds before we start taking heavy penalties on what is left. My 10% is around 75K depending on the market that day.

My husband and I have decided to take out about 10K per year for the next 10 years, since this will avoid going into the next highest tax bracket, and we will pay about 12% taxes on what we take out. I am not terribly well versed in the stock market, but I know a bit. My biggest question is which funds do I take the money from? My mother had invested into 10 funds, and has a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund. The funds with the most value right now are a mid cap index fund and a retirement 2025 fund. So do I take some money from each fund, drain the funds one at a time, reinvest some of the funds into safer investments while they wait to be liquidated, or something different? It is currently set to reinvest dividends, but I can change that to put them into the money market fund. 

Is it worth it to hire a fiduciary to help with this? The only two in my city have yearly contracts, so I would rather not go that route, but I would be willing to look into consulting with someone.

Some background on me: I live in the midwest, the only debt I currently have is our mortgage (my husband still has some student loan debt, but it is lower interest than our mortgage), and we are currently child free (but have a good amount of pets). I have a decent retirement account and pension going through my job, and we have an emergency fund for 5+ months already. We are in an amazingly great financial position all things considered, so this money is not something we NEED, but it will be very nice to have. I appreciate any and all advice you can offer. Hope everyone is staying as well as possible right now!",finance
personalfinance,Rocket Mortgage Forbearance seems like a bad deal.,"This whole concept isn't sitting well with me.  I was furloughed for a month and a half. I decided to take advantage of all the offers my lenders made (well, just my car and house is it).  I went to Rocket Mortgage (Formally Quicken) and I filled out the form.  Just before I was done, I asked an agent over chat about how this will work.  I assumed it would be like my credit union did my van loan, and just extend the loan maturity date (add the payments to the end of the loan).  Turns out, it will not be at all.

You have three options.  1.  Pay it all back at the end of the forbearance (Three months' worth plus that month's payment!).  2. Create a new loan and a new payment to pay on top of the mortgage until it's paid back.  3. They will modify the loan to absorb the outstanding balance (this is cool, they would basically lower the interest rate to make the payment stay about the same and the loan maturity date would be the same).  I want option 3, but they will decide when it is over.

In the middle of all this, however, your interest will accrue.  So that means if they decide you don't qualify for a modification, they will make you pay it all back now, PLUS you now owe more due to interest still building.  I decided I didn't want this as my payment isn't that big and I could still make it while furloughed.  Creating a new debt with interest seemed dumb.  So, I never e-signed.  A few days later I check my account and see they processed it anyway without me ever finishing.  Big red flag...

When I was hired back, I logged in to report it and see what I needed to do to end it.  They have NO options to end it yet.  I have to stay in it.  I decided to make a partial payment.  I go back and look, and I find out they are not applying what you pay to the loan balance yet.  So the interest is still building on the full amount past due, whether you pay some or not.  What kind of mess is this?  How is this helpful to people?  I was told to come back July 1st, and I'll have options to end it.  I log in today, and do their little ""Check-in.""  I check the box that I CAN start back making payments.  The next screen says ""Congratulations your forbearance been approved to extend to Oct!""  What?!

This whole thing is really starting to sound like a financial trap to me.  I'm considering refinancing just to get away from these people, but I only owe 57k at 3.75% and around 10 years.  Resetting to a 10yr loan would add 4-5k to the balance due to closing, and I would likely only see a 1% rate drop.  Basically I would lose money doing this, but I am so tempted just to get away from Rocket Mortgage.  They call all the time wanting me to refinance even when I tell them to stop.  I still have all the money sitting in my YNAB house payment category.  I'm hoping they will modify the loan and I'll get to pocket that.",finance

personalfinance,Paying Off Debt vs Saving For Down Payment,"My wife and I have around $21,000 in debt. This is mostly old credit card debt that we were able to use a personal loan (36 month term) from our Credit Union to consolidate to a 9% interest rate. We are scheduled to pay off this amount early in 24 months. My wife would rather pay the loan off in the standard 36 months and use the extra money to save up for a down payment for a house.

To me, this doesn’t make sense as the money we are currently paying towards the loan would be the additional funds that would go towards a mortgage. If we are still paying off the loan, we would not be able to buy a house because we wouldn’t have the additional monthly funds to afford the house that we want. 

Does this make sense? Am I missing something that makes saving up for a down payment the better choice?",finance
investing,Long-Term Falling Interest Rates and the Rise of Neofeudalism,"Historian Paul Schmelzing recently [published](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2020/eight-centuries-of-global-real-interest-rates-r-g-and-the-suprasecular-decline-1311-2018.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=5197703E8834998B56DD8121C0B64BFB09FF4881) an exceptional working paper on eight centuries of global real and nominal interest rates, from 1311 to 2018.

 [Nominal rates graph](http://theyieldblog.com/interest_rates)

What he discovered surprised me: nominal and real rates over very long periods of time are in ""suprasecular decline"" and that the fall in real and nominal interest rates over the last forty years are merely a reversion to long-term historical trends. When I say ""interest rates"", I mean both literal rates (paid for debt servicing), as well as effective rates (i.e., at what earnings multiple stocks trade). Schmelzing is more limited in his definition but I will use the term ""falling rates"" to mean both lowering bond yields and rising equity multiples.  
What's more surprising, the rate of decline is fairly ""rapid"" across human history at about 2 basis points (.02%) a year. In 100 years, interest rates will be a full 2% lower in expectation. If this phenomenon is reliable and persists into the future, what will the world look like when interest rates are near-zero or negative? Allow me to engage in some rank speculation.  


1). Outsized wealth creation will no longer be possible by professional ""asset compounders"" like Warren Buffett because there's not a lot of ""compounding"" one can do when rates are so low. I mean this very literally: since expected human lifespans are only getting a little bit longer, and the [Rule of 72](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp) remains true for all [non-relativistic finance](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568257) we literally can't live long enough to compound enough money to move the needle.  
Instead, capitalism will heavily favor ""asset gatherers"" and ""money-raisers"" that invest in direct capital projects -- people who raise a lot of money to do something low-return and (legally) skim a bit off the top, because there's going to be simply so much more money floating around and the return hurdle is so much lower. Insofar as this is already painfully true of capitalism by the early 2000s and 2010s, it will be even more the dominant reality for our grandchildren's grandchildren. Someone like Warren Buffett was truly born in the right decade: a time when, at the midpoint of his life, interest rates were unusually high (i.e., assets were unusually cheap) and began a long decline, driving outsized returns for ""professional capitalists"" and especially for value investors who correctly assigned a very high cost of capital to earnings. The dominant model of wealth creation has shifted from squirrely hoarders like Buffett to either bombastic asset gatherers like Adam Neumann, or to extremely talented builders like Elon Musk, in part because interest rates are much, much lower.  


2). Monopolies will be more valuable than ever and non-monopolies will trade at more significant discounts. As required returns lower, capital will flow toward non-monopolistic, competitive industries (think Quip, Boll &amp; Branch, and whatever other favorite podcast sponsor you have) and reduce returns in those industries even further than where they are now. What really matters isn't how much money a company is making per se, but the certainty that they will earn those returns in the future. This certainty in maintaining pricing, margins, and market share enables investors to capitalize businesses at very high multiples because there's ""nothing else left to invest in"". More on this later.  


3). Commodity-capital industries become particularly bad industries over time. Finance (all of it: main street banking, investment management, insurance) becomes even more commoditized than it already is. Funnily, I think investment banking is a service and will be excluded from this implosion, and the high-end firms should remain well-insulated as capital raising and valuation-setting activities from IPOs remain a fairly sensitive activity. Real estate cap rates should continue to decline and so should their associated capitalization requirements and costs of capital: one day we'll commonly start to get 100% debt financed apartment complexes that only cost 3% to service (China is perilously close to this phenomenon already).  


4). The rise of what I can only describe as Neofeudalism. Imagine a world where a ""typically risky"" asset has a 2.5% nominal return:  
a. If you can build an income stream, it will trade at 40x earnings.  
b. If you fail to build an income stream, you need 40x the money to replicate the same-sized income stream.  
c. If your parents were rich and frugal, you will be rich, because they amassed all of the asset increase benefits from when interest rates were high and dropped. Inheritances, in some weird reversion to the mean, will once again become a greater determinant of wealth.  
d. It will be almost impossible to become independently wealthy as a wage-worker, because if you save money, you'll only be earning a 2% nominal return.  
e. ""High-certainty assets"" will be seen as even more valuable than before, relative to peers. This is due a weird intersection of behavioral finance and arithmetic: an investor being willing to accept a company valued at 1% cap rate instead of 2% will go from valuing a company at 50x earnings to 100x earnings. In low interest rate worlds, the value of securitizing and financializing income streams only grows, because the equivalent capital required to generate those equivalent streams becomes very high. This is why payments startups make so much more sense today than ever before: their revenue streams are incredibly reliable, on an ever-growing churn of economic activity. Even if their profits are low now, the certainty of the growth of future cash-flows is extremely high, and being certain as interest rates asymptote to zero enables the biggest and best valuations.  


Why do low future rates bring about Neofeudalism? Interest rates are like a very long lever. As rates go lower, the lever gets longer, and the more valuable income streams become. At some point the lever itself becomes a sort of king-maker: if you are able to build a perpetual-income business of any kind, you will effectively control an economic fiefdom, because that income stream will be considered incredibly valuable. And if you fail to create that perpetual income stream, you'll be a serf, forced to either deplete your savings (since returns aren't high enough) or work forever.  


This also re-calibrates our understanding of Baby Boomer wealth. They entered the job market when interest rates were at their very highest in recent human history. If you were a reasonably competent young person who could secure a job, you could compound an unbelievable amount of wealth over the ensuing 5 decades.",finance

personalfinance,Is my situation a good candidate to refinance?,"In February 2016, I bought a house ($300K) and took out a conventional mortgage at 30-year fixed. My original loan balance was $291,000.00, with interest rate of 4.75%. A while ago I requested to have my house appraised and it is valued at $460K and the PMI has been removed. 

My Current Principal Balance is now at $271,600, and my credit score has now gone up to 780. I am located in Colorado. I talked to a mortgage person and he said I could get a 15-year refi at 2.25% interest rate. After making calculations, my monthly payment will go up by about $300. Closing costs is about $12800 and new loan is $283,150. I can afford that extra monthly payment. I have paid all my credit card debt so I have no other interest rate to pay off.

What concerns me is the uncertainty of things these days. I have a good savings, good enough to cover me for 6 months. I've been with my company for 7 years and I don't feel worried about losing my job.

With this information, would it make sense for me to refinance?

/addition - there was some questions about the closing cost: The closings costs includes the $10,720 loan cost which includes the 2.125% (points) of loan amount, fees + $2089 for taxes and insurance. However, my cash to close is just $1,300, and they had the loyalty promo and I only have to pay $100 for cash to close.

I had a family loan I had to pay back quickly which has consumed most of my income so I haven't really been able to grow my emergency fund.

personalfinance,How Should I Pay Extra on My Student Loans?,"Hi everyone. I think I speak for some on this subreddit when I say that I have saved money during quarantine due to the National Emergency Forbearance (NEF) and working at Target. Thanks to NEF, I don't need to pay my Navient loans, and the total amount I won't have to pay through the current end date of NEF is greater than my smallest student loan.

This brings me to my question: how should I pay extra on my loans? On one hand, I can take all the money I haven't used on these loans and push it directly towards the smallest amount. This will finish off that loan, and I'll never need to make another payment on that loan.

However, it had the smallest interest rate of every loan I have. Thanks to refinancing, that title is with my private loans, which I have still been paying off during quarantine. I have heard of the snowballing repayment method, so if I pay off my smallest loan, it would lessen my monthly payment once NEF ends. However, that payment was less than $20 per month, so it seems negligible.

Would I be better off paying more on the higher interest loans so I pay less over the loans' entire lifetime? Better yet, do I wait and see if a bill is passed to address student loans or NEF is extended? What do you think?",finance

My only other debt is my student loans, which the balances are pretty hefty but the highest rate is 4.15%, with roughly a fourth of my total owed sitting at 0% until the federal thing runs out in a couple months, which then they would return to 3.5% interest.

I live at home rent free and make $73k a year right now (23, one year out of college).

I renew my car insurance in August and then again in February, I pay upfront and it equals out to about $150 a month.

Upon paying my car off I’m going to bump my deductibles up. My bank requires $500 deductible in the car while they hold the loan.

I’m thinking of getting it paid off right before my renewal in February. This allows me to keep cash in case of an emergency, still throw one whole paycheck at my student loans, and I’ll have the car paid off right before an insurance renewal period.

**Personal Loan, Student Loan, and Car Loan Debt**

The old adage of a financially irresponsible individual with bad spending habits and no care getting bailed out by a personal loan (or student loan - yes I used FAFSA checks to pay off debt, only to re-rack it again) will never learn and only fall back into the same trap, proves true again, because hello, it me. However, this time I'm adamantly set on paying debt off, because I want to be able to have a house soon, for my family and my sake.

**Second Job or Third Job?**

Being in IT, I can work some weird hours. I may have a maintenance window, or three a week, and sometimes may go for weeks/months without one. There are occasional emergency nights (I work for a large hospital system), so I may get pinged. I'm online at 10AM, or 10PM. Also, because I work on projects as well, that may eat up my days/weeks. However, I've heard of IT guys getting short-term projects while working their full time, OR freelancing, which is what I've wanted to learn to do for a long time, but no one will help me. I've asked around, but to no avail.

If it is any help, I'm a network engineer, currently working in the wireless space. I know I haven't maxed out my earning potential, especially in the IT space, so I'm continually working on getting a Palo Alto firewall certification, as well as my CCNP.

Other areas of expertise in which I *think* I could make some money, even if its $10 here and there, is in fitness and nutrition consulting, as well as beard care. I have knowledge in both (being a fitness and nutrition consultant/coach), as well as creating beard care products (not that this involves rocket science).

I haven't graduated college yet, still working on my associates. I have a couple (or three) semesters left.

I'm ready to get ripped a new one, because I've made some absolutely crucial and stupid mistakes that I may not break away from anytime soon. But I come to you all for help, and I'll take any and all advice I can get.

I think this wall-load of information will suffice, I can't think of anything else at the moment to provide. However, if there is anything else anyone needs to know about me to better understand my picture, please ask.

personalfinance,Paying student debt vs saving for retirement.,"I am trying to workout if I should invest some of my income into my job's retirement plan or pay student debt. I am a 27 year old school psychologist in the NYC DOE and currently make about $75000 annually. I pay about 4 percent of my check to my pension plan which is required. I also have the option of contributing additional funds (on top of the standard pension) to the teacher's retirement system' tax deferred annuity program (up to $19,000) which has a 7% fixed interest return. With the TDA, I would  only be responsible for federal taxes (current NY state + city tax rate is 12% ) when I withdraw the money. It seems like a secure investment. The issue is, I have  $44,000 in federal student loan debt from grad school with 5.1% fixed interest though this is currently paused due to the pandemic (I think until October). I've been paying the loans since 2018 and know how fast the interest can build. For that reason, and because I am about 30+ years from retirement, I've been focussing on loan payments. However, I've noticed that NYC pension and retirement plans have a historical trend of being restructured to be less generous for new members  (ex. the 7% return used to be 8%) so part of me is wondering, and I know this is speculative, if I should get in now while the opportunity is there and if so, what amount of an investment is appropriate. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I have an opportunity to invest money in a tax deferred annuity w  7% return but I also have $44,000 in federal student loan debt with 5.1% interest. I am looking for advise on the most frugal way to allocate my money.",finance

Her income has not changed much since we refinanced a few years ago so even the variable rate refinance options for just her would only reduce her payment by about $30 while keeping the repayment term the same.",finance

* ""Jo"" (mom)
* ""Dean"" (dad)
* ""Wendy"" (sister, middle)
* ""Miriam"" (sister, oldest)
* ""Karen"" (local bank branch manager)

# Background

Hi everyone. I'm a long-time Reddit lurker, and I've always admired the power of these communities, especially how experts in various fields have come together to help a stranger. I'd been dragging my heels on actually joining, so sad to say I finally did under frustrating circumstances. I will try to be succinct (**he said, after an arguably needless introduction**).

My 71 y/o mom (we'll call her ""Jo""), has been a nurse for more than 30 years, and generally serves as my north star for dedication to one's work. In supervisory positions for most of that time, she has had a solid income, save for some health difficulties in the mid-late 2000s that forced her out of work.

Her and my dad (we'll call him ""Dean"") have some antiquated views around personal finances, and frankly a lack of knowledge or experience with money management. As a result, Jo has always had 100% of her available funds sitting in a checking account of the local community bank.

I saw her balance some time ago and was extremely alarmed to find the amount of money (**\~$98,000**)just sitting in this bank's checking account. So, over the past 1.5-2 years, I'd been advising her (read: pleading with her) to move her money to a reputable bank, open a savings account, etc. In hindsight, I wish I'd pushed harder or insisting on putting the advice into action — but I've also had enough therapy to know that taking on the battles of our parents can sometimes be to one's detriment.

# Recent Events

Since the COVID lockdown, I left my apartment and have been staying with both of my parents here on Staten Island.

The other day I was running to 7-Eleven (lemme get that oil sludge you call iced coffee, plz) and Jo asked me to take out some cash for her at the ATM. When the ATM asked if I wanted a receipt, I remembered my concerns and thought ""*I should probably check on her money now  that she's working more again*"". The printed receipt showed a balance that was **less than half** of the amount I was expecting to see (**\~55,000**).

Unsure if I should say anything as these aren't my finances, I showed Jo the receipt and asked if she'd had significantly more money in there, and she couldn't recall. I was pretty certain, so the thought festered overnight. The next day, Jo said ""*I think you're right, I think I did have a lot more money*.""

That validation was all I needed to tag in my 2 older sisters, ""Wendy"" and ""Miriam"" — we tend to create this 3-headed Super Team when a family crisis arises. Think like, the Three Musketeers ... or, the Boston Three Party if you're into sports, or.... sorry I'll stop.

Now, the first step was making sure none of us were responsible, so I asked the obligatory ""*do you guys know what happened?*"" question, and found they were both as horrified as I was.

Wendy had set up Jo's online account, with the goal of making things easier and more accessible. That said, Jo did not have an email address at the time, so Wendy tied it to *her* email address, e.g. [wendy@wendy.wendy](mailto:wendy@wendy.wendy). It's not clear if this fact is important / relevant, but I expect it will be as Wendy was understandably not monitoring statements and paper statements were no longer sent after that point.

It should be mentioned that Jo is a very giving mom, something I'm eternally grateful for — so it's not uncommon for her to treat us to dinners, gifts, etc. (she even helped me with a security deposit on the pre-COVID apartment). So part of the initial exercise was making sure which charges might be ours, and which are obviously made by this criminal (or group of criminals).

Once we looked at the statements, the fears were confirmed — we found tens of thousands of dollars worth of charges, dating back to early 2019 (this investigation is still ongoing, so they may predate that even). The spending seemed to rapidly accelerate this year, and included tens of online retailers, apps, hotels, and many others. Currently we've confirmed **$54,390 worth of fraud charges.**

I called the bank to report the fraudulent activity, and enumerated 10 of the hundreds of fraud charges to the Customer Service Representative. I was told that these matters were ""handled by the local branch"" and was transferred to ""Karen"", whose branch location is a 5-minute drive from my parents' house.

It was immediately clear that Karen didn't seem to have any standard operating procedure to follow.  She couldn't answer any questions about how fraudulent activity is typically detected, why we received no communication indicating potential fraudulent activity, why this wasn't caught at *any* point, etc. She gave no direction on putting a hold on the account, filing a police report, no actions proactively taken whatsoever. I was told I could not speak to anyone in the fraud department, which they allegedly have  as part of their org. structure.

Wendy, in a similar panic to mine, called as well and was asked if any of the charges were hers — to which she enumerated a few Lyft charges from this year that Jo was aware of. **More on this later.**

We called the cops in order to put as many things in motion as we could, and were reasonably told that this would need to go directly to a detective as it's grand larceny (and paper copies of the statements were needed, with all fraudulent charges highlighted). We called Karen back, and we asked that paper statements be printed from all of 2018, 2019, and 2020.

I was told that not only could I not speak to anyone in their fraud department, but that there was no reference number, case number, or any record that I would be able to reference with their institution internally. That conversation was less civil, given the lack of action on their part.

Miriam, a bit of a spreadsheet wiz, imported the .csv of the statements and categorized fraud charges, legitimate charges, and calculated the amounts spent at various retailers. Next, we'll be transferring those findings to the printed statements by highlighting all of the fraudulent line items, one-by-one, to pass off to a detective.

Yesterday, 06/30/20, I drove Jo to that local branch, where Karen came out with the bag of statements and we exchanged unpleasantries. When I told her a detective would be on our case, she said that she had advised me to contact the authorities (spoiler: she did not. All actions taken have been by our family). She also had the gall to say to my poor, already confused mom:

&gt;**""Some of those charges were your daughter's. I hope you're willing to press charges.""**

You'll remember above when Wendy noted that *some small number of the hundreds of transactions* were hers, and that Jo was aware of them. Because of that, Karen's comment is extremely concerning to us, as we're worried that the bank will attempt to absolve themselves of any negligence or wrongdoing here and therefore not return the funds.

# Actions Being Taken By Us

* Itemized list of all fraudulent charges, highlighted
* All line items and amounts reported at our local precinct
* Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint will be filed against the bank
* After nearly 4 hours of calling various CS numbers of the bank, I finally convinced a representative to transfer me to the voicemail box Regional Manager (Assistant to the Regional Manager?) — I left a message that was an abridged version of this post
* Another CS rep, after a lot of coaxing, assured me that an email would  be sent to the shared group handle containing all regional managers of the bank

# Actions Not Currently Being Taken, But Like... I Wanna

* Message executive-level employees of this bank via LinkedIn. While my career profile isn't anything to stop traffic, my experience in CX/CS has taught me that rattling the cages of those in powerful positions should make something happen
* Play ""ding, dong, ditch"" at Kare's doorstep (j/k ... kinda).

# Notes

* I unfortunately did not record the phone calls with the bank
* All 3 of us (the musketeers) have somewhat demanding jobs, but we are acting as quickly as possible

# Questions

1. At what point, if any, should a lawyer be involved?
2. Is there anything we should say/do with respect to the bank at this point, or would any action whatsoever potentially do us a disservice?
3. If nothing comes of the police investigation, or the bank entity itself, is this just a ""pick up the pieces and move on"" situation?
4. How do we handle the housekeeping of auto-payments tied to that account, and automatic deposits from Social Security &amp; her job?
5. At what point do we demand to take the remaining funds out of this horrendous bank?

**If anyone at all reads this, I'm already grateful. Thanks guys.**

**tl;dr** Fraudulent charges amounting to at least **$54,390** have been made on my mom's checking account, dating back more than a year. The bank has been unhelpful, admitted no wrongdoing in not notifying us at any point, and has taken no action. **What should we do?**",finance
personalfinance,How does accepting a settlement actually affect credit?,"Hi All,

I need some advice, I feel awful. Historically I've had excellent credit, but because of a period of depression, which led to me neglect our finances, I've racked up a lot of credit card debt. I feel terrible because I've really messed up; my husband is the cardholder, but I manage all our money so not only am I harming my credit, I'm harming his too.

I got him to call the credit card company (Bank of America) and they offered a settlement of 16k on 23k of debt (it's not gone to collections yet). Everything I've read though says this will harm us and is the credit equivalent of bankruptcy. We have also have the 5 missed payments on our report.

Is there a way I can negotiate down the interest rate so I can pay it off? Is taking the settlement so terrible? What questions should I ask my husband to ask them? We were hoping to be able to move at some point and I don't want any new mortgage to be penalized by my hideous mistakes.

Any advice would be most welcome, I don't know how to get out of this mess. Obviously I feel terribly ashamed.",finance
personalfinance,"We plan on moving to CT next year and buying a house, but I am unsure how my financial status will affect everything","Hello,

So my wife and I currently live in Western Virginia, and would like to move to the southern Connecticut area sometime in the summer next year.  
I (30M) am an imaging technologist currently making around 24/hr, working full time. I anticipate making around 30$-40$/hr in CT (Based on several google/glassdoor/hospital webpage searches).  
My wife (26F) is a Registered Nurse currently making around 27/hr, working full time. She anticipates making around 35$-45$/hr in CT (Based on several google/glassdoor/hospital webpage searches).  
We are currently renting an apartment.  
We currently have a car debt that is scheduled to be paid off sometime early next year.   
I currently have federal loans totaling around 215,000 dollars. I am currently paying this off using Income-based repayment (around 150$/month). This very unfortunate high debt is due to attending medical school for 2 years and dropping out due to unfortunate events. It is my hope that with 10 years worth of repayment, PSLF will still be in effect and help me out with this.

Other than monthly credit card bills that are paid in full each month, we do not have any other debt.

We have never had any issues with loans like defaulting, bankruptcy, etc.

I am an OEF veteran. U.S. Army, honorable discharge 2015.

Our credits are both above 760+, the lowest my credit has been in the last five years was above 740.

We have some savings for a potential down payment.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So I guess my main questions are

1) How much do you think we can get pre-qualified for? What price ranges of house should we be looking at? I tried getting a pre-qualified amount on websites, but they all required me to start an application process and talk with someone first, but I felt it was too early to do that.

2) With moving to CT, with new anticipated wages, would it be better to get an apartment and a job first in CT before buying a house? would that get us a better pre-qualified amount and conditions?

3) I know the student loan amount is damning, but I read that most banks with conventional loans typically look at monthly expenses rather than total loan amounts - is that true?

4) As a veteran, am I correct to assume it is better to use a VA-backed home loan like Navy Fed? Also, is there a place I can learn more about the VA home loan program? I tried googling but couldn't seem to get my hands on an official site with all the info.

5) Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance - I'm really worried about how my student loans may affect all this, and a bit worried about the process.",finance

     * Roth IRA started this week, but haven't invested the money yet. I have had so many questions surrounding a Roth IRA, and didn't know what it was until recently... so I feel like I may have made a big mistake by not utilizing this, and now need to learn about a backdoor IRA since I think I will have income over the maximum threshold for it this year. Good problem, but still something I need to learn more about..

Okay, so with that out of the way, here are my questions!

1: Am I taking all of the right steps here to cover the basic retirement strategies? I feel a bit silly not having taken advantage of the Roth IRA previously, and this may be the last year that I'm able to utilize it before needing to move to a ""back-door"" IRA strategy. Am I missing anything else here when it comes to retirement planning?

2: The House. The Car. I purchased a new car in Q4 of 2018 that was $35,000, and put down ~$13500 on it at time of purchase. The interest rate was pretty low, so I felt alright about the purchase, but in hindsight, I know this was not a great financial decision. I wish I would have bought something used and kept the price down another $10K or so. For the house, I bought it at the end of 2019 and put ~$27K down towards principal (around 9.5% of the total house cost). My plan, pre-Covid, was to live in this house with my SO for 3-4 years, and then if/when we start a family, move to a single-family home (current is a townhome) with a bit more space to settle down into, and to keep this current property as a rental property for long-term wealth building.

My main concern with the house situation is that I don't know if it's worth refinancing right now. I've looked around a bit, and there are more competitive rates then what I currently have on the house, but I'm just not sure if I should prioritize a refi, with a potential upcoming engagement, and all of the potential costs that surrounds that. I see on this sub that many times the advice is ""it depends on how long you plan to live in the house""... but what if I don't personally plan to live in the current house, but want to use the refi as a chance to have better margins when renting to generate additional income? Is there any sort of ""it makes sense if you can hit x% of profit margin"" guidance for situations like this?

3: What else can I do with my money at this age to create long-term wealth? I certainly don't expect my career and income to have peaked yet, but I am also incredibly thankful for the chance to have this level of income at my age. Assuming 401K and IRA's are maxed, and I have a safety-net of savings, what should my next priority be? Aggressively paying down my mortgage? Or saving for future expenses?

Right now we have saved some money (around 100k), that are invested in some assetes (stocks and goverment- bonds) that generates around 2k per year. We currently pay 3k per month in rent, and saw an appartament that costs 300k. If we give our savings as a downpayment, and finnance the difference in a 10 year loan, the monthly cost would be around 2.7k. We don't have plans to move to another city in the next years, and in terms os location, both apartaments are relatively close to our work. Is it financial wise to do this?

personalfinance,Buying GIC vs leaving money in TFSA,"I’ve just recently found out if GICs, and I’m wondering about the specifics as I’m finding the information offered by my bank difficult to understand for an investing beginner like me. I think understand the basics of a GIC, but the interest rates stated by my bank (TD) has been very confusing. 

I am confused both in the interest rates stated, and the GIC option being offered. First, comparing the option of 0.01% GIC for 100 days, cashable after 30 days va. leaving money in my TFSA account which offers 0.05%, it seems like that this GIC is not worth it at all. Secondly, interest rates stated by TD are all in the ball parks of 0.X%, which is extremely low, and I’m wondering if this was a mistake. Here’s the link to the rates offered with different types of accounts: [TD Bank Interest Calculation ](https://www.tdcanadatrust.com/document/PDF/accounts/513782-20200519.pdf)

Would really appreciate advices on how much interest I can expect if I bought $1000 of the 0.01% 100 Day cashable GIC vs. leaving the money in my TFSA account at 0.05% over the same time period of 100 days",finance

personalfinance,Lack of Transparency in Obtaining a Mortgage,"I am working on buying my first home. I've been pre-approved with one lender so far, but I have been surprised with the lack of transparency and information up-front. I chose a lender that could provide a quick closing since I live in an area with a competitive market. 

I've asked about getting more information about the terms, additional fees, and points on paper. However, all I seem to get is rough estimates over the phone. I've been told we will be able to discuss/make decisions regarding points on the loan when we put in an offer and are working on closing. All I've gotten on paper is an amount that I am approved for with 20% down, and a payment chart that includes estimated insurance, property taxes, HOA, and mortgage payments with an assumed interest rate.

Everything just seems very nebulous. I know interest rates float, but can't they give me an expected range? How am I supposed to shop around for a loan if I don't really have anything concrete in hand to do comparisons? I was under the impression I would be able to leverage an offer from one lender against another to get the best deal, but this sounds near impossible with the information I have in-hand.

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.


_________

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

personalfinance,I have no idea what is going on with my credit report,"Hi,

My radiator split in my Chrysler 300. This happened when I first bought this car ( I was 19 and it was used) and my lines crossed. Now, it has happened again. I've been planning on buying a used vehicle from a dealership anyways, so this was just urging the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to go look at some vehicles at a dealership (Nissan specifically). On top of that, my cousin's husband owns a dealership and had a car I was interested in. At this Nissan dealer, they pulled my credit report and saw several student loans, an auto loan, and multiple credit cards. They came to ask me about the auto loan I already had, but I told them I had never bought a car with a loan before. Now, in my hands, I hold this report they gave me with 5 student loans that don't belong to me, 3 credit cards, and an auto loan that is preventing me from getting a car. When I went to my cousin's husbands dealership, he pulled my credit report and saw the same thing. He put in all of my exact info ( address, social, DOB) when pulling the report.There is another girls name who shows on my report, her employer, and her address. Some how, we live two miles away from each other, have similar spelling of our first name, and when I pulled her up on facebook we know the same people and have the same date of birth. She went to my rival high school. Her facebook has been inactive since 2012. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what have I done to fix this? I called the federal trade commission and reported the fraud, called non emergency police, and my next step was calling experian because they are the credit union this report was pulled from. When I called them, they say none of these accounts are on my report. I called the FCU that has the auto loan. I gave them the account number and they said my name nor my social are attached to that loan. I check credit karma, my FICO score with my bank, and my Experian account and none of those accounts are showing. What is happening? How do I fix this? Does anyone have any idea of how this is possible or any advice? Thanks!

personalfinance,"I am aware the IRS is slammed, but I am growing worried. Was asked to send more paper in through mail for my refund in April, still no update on taxes","Sup yall

I filed my taxes back during the first week of March, through TurboTax. However, apparently I had missed something because I received a 1099 and it wasn't completely input. So I received a letter in the mail the first week of April, asking me to fill out an 8962 (PTC) and mail it with the included envelope and a copy of my 1099 to them. I did exactly that, and then obviously COVID struck. So while I e-filed through TurboTax, I still had to submit a paper as well. 

As far as I've read, they still haven't processed paper filings as of June 1st. But I'm growing worried as the deadline approaches. I received my State Refund, but not my Federal. 

Has anyone else had to mail in a form who is also still waiting on a refund? I just want to make sure I've filed correctly more than anything, honestly. I'd hate for them to FINALLY get to my form only to say, ""no this is still incorrect"" or something.",finance
personalfinance,Why are there such large disparities between savings account interest rates from bank to bank?,"I’m a postdoc researcher and just got moved to a new funding source that cannot be taxed monthly. So, I was looking to open a new savings account that I can move a portion of my paycheck into each month to prepare for paying in taxes next March.

In my search, I found a wide spread in available interest rates. My hometown bank was offering 0.05%. I happened to check Discover, who I already use for credit, and they’re giving 1%. Both of these accounts are simple savings, no fees, no minimum deposit, no minimum balance, and 6 allowed withdrawals per month. I get the basic economics that result in brick and mortar banks having less room to offer profits back to customers (when compared to a mostly/fully online bank), but even other online banks that I saw had much lower rates.

Basically, that 1% seemed too good to be true, and I’m wondering what I’m missing.",finance

personalfinance,Furloughed &amp; on unemployment. New job starts on the 20th. Need advice on how to leave current job. [Michigan],"#Situation:

* Began this job in September of 2019.
* Furloughed since April 18th due to Covid. 
* I have been on unemployment since then, collecting the maximum weekly benefit of $362 state + $600 federal.
* My company has stated something along the lines of (summarized for anonymity):
 
 &gt; ""We intend to bring everyone that is temporarily laid off back in the future, but due to the current situation we can't guarantee that everyone will be asked to return to their position.""

* I do not believe that I will be asked to return to my position.
* I signed an offer letter with a new company, and my start date is set for July 20th.
* I have 151 hours of earned PTO, and my hourly pay rate is/was $36.05. (~$5400 PTO value)
* The employee handbook is silent on whether or not PTO is paid out upon termination of employment.
* I always give 2-weeks notice when leaving a job. However, I (and many of my colleagues) have been treated very poorly, and the company has a history of high turnover of very skilled employees (engineers, MBA's, technical specialists, all making near/over $100k.) Due to the short time I was with them, and no desire to work with them again in the future, I would not regret quitting without notice if it meant I guaranteed my financial outcome. 

#Relevant Info:

* Employmentlawhandbook.com states [""An employer is required to pay accrued vacation leave upon separation from employment if the employer’s established policy or employment contract is silent on the matter.""](https://www.employmentlawhandbook.com/leave-laws/state-leave-laws/michigan/) However, when you follow the link they provide, the Michigan.gov website states [""The employer would not be legally obligated to pay you for unused time if the company policy does not address the issue.""](https://www.michigan.gov/leo/0,5863,7-336-78421_94422_59886_27856-101137--,00.html) 
* A colleague in the same position as myself also on furlough recently left the company for another job. He gave his 2-week notice, and they required him to sit through it (they didn't terminate him immediately.) He was paid out his accrued PTO time.

#Questions:

1. How do I leave my current employer and maximize my outcome?
2. How do I make sense of the law(s) regarding the payout of unused PTO upon termination/quitting?
3. In the event that the company is legally required to pay out my accrued PTO and does not, how do I prepare myself legally to get my PTO paid? Who would I contact, and what would the process look like?

#Possible Scenarios:

1. I give my 2-week notice on July 6th. Company acknowledges, and I remain on furlough until the 17th. I continue to receive unemployment. 
 * a. Company pays out my PTO time. Total paid: 2 weeks of unemployment ($1,924), plus 151 hours of PTO ($5,400) = $7,324.
 * b. Company does not pay out my PTO time. Total paid: 2 weeks of unemployment = $1,924.
2. I give my 2-week notice on July 6th. Company terminates me immediately. I can no longer collect unemployment since I voluntarily left my job. 
 * a. Company pays out my PTO time. Total paid: 151 hours of PTO = $5,400.
 * b. Company does not pay out my PTO time. Total paid: $0
3. I give my 2-week notice on July 6th. Company requires me to use my PTO time for those two weeks. I can no longer collect unemployment, since I am being paid by my company. I lose 80 hours from my PTO balance, leaving 71 hours. 
 * a. Company pays out my remaining PTO time. Total paid: 80 hours PTO ($2,884) + remaining 71 hours PTO ($2,559) = $5,400.
 * b. Company does not pay out my remaining PTO time. Total paid: 80 hours PTO = $2,884.
4. I give an immediate notice on July 17th. Since I was still technically furloughed, I would have collected unemployment for those two weeks.
 * a. Company pays out my PTO time. Total paid: 2 weeks of unemployment ($1,924) + 151 hours of PTO ($5,400) = $7,324.
 * b. Company does not pay out my PTO time. Total paid: 2 weeks of unemployment ($1,924).

personalfinance,"Given low mortgage rates, is there any financial reason not to do a 30-year mortgage?","We're getting ready to put an offer on a house and have been discussing mortgage rates with lenders. Originally we were looking to do a 15-year mortgage due to rates in the mid-2%'s, and to stretch ourselves a bit to reach the 20% down payment. However, right now even 30 year mortgages are hovering around 3%, and the estimates we received for PMI if we do less than 20% down payment is only like ~$500 a year and falls off after a couple years.

With interest rates so low, is there any reason not to go with the 30-year mortage and invest the difference in a brokerage account? Since the investment windows would be the life of the loan, over 10/20/30 years I don't think it would be unreasonable to assume an overall average return that would beat the 3% interest rate. 

I understand that there are definitely peace-of-mind and other reasons to pursue a 15 year mortgage and have the house completely paid off sooner. Looking at it for us, even though we could probably afford the 15 year payments it would obviously leave less left over at the end of each month to put away for maintenance funds, other investments, or any other purchases we want to save for. Plus, if a major life event occurred the lower monthly required payment would be easier to meet.

I have a sizable amount in my 401k with the company about 19,000.00. The issue is a bad car loan i took when i first started to help with the commute. I still owe 10,000.00 on the car but its only worth like 4K. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to take out a loan for roughly 6-8k to start having value for the vehicle or even manage to pay it off within a year. 

I make the payments on the vehicle perfectly fine never missed a payment but have refinanced it since the first interest rate was at 19% (had no credit when i needed the car) the rate now is 3.5%. 

I have some credit card debit, under 4k, half of it is 0% interest

Also bought a house 10 months ago got a good rate and have no issues with those payments either 

I'm concerned if the car breaks down id be 10k in the hole and would then need another car loan. The car has always ran fine no issues so far but its now a 5 yr vehicle with over 100,000 miles and i owe more than double its worth. 

Terms from my 401k company says id be able to take out 8,600 on a loan up to 5 years at 4.9%. But i would be fine repaying roughly 160 bi weekly for this loan to repay in 3yrs.

personalfinance,Looking for advice regarding student loans,"Hey everyone,

Honestly, I'm feeling pretty lost in the search for how I should best finance my education and I was wondering if anyone had recommendations on how I should go about it. I was stuck between taking loans from PHEAA and paying the interest each month or some weird combination of the federal govt + PHEAA or some other course. I would take everything the federal govt., but unfortunately the loan limits wouldn't be enough to cover me for my first year. I grew up low income so I've always been pretty cautionary with money so the thought of taking loans from the wrong vendor and screwing myself over with high interest once I graduate is terrifying. 

If it makes any difference or helps give insight into how I should approach this here's the specifics of how much I'd owe per year: 10.2k/yr 3.5k of which is available to me in work-study 6.5k out of pocket. For my first year I'd like to not due work-study, especially with everything currently going on, so it'd be the whole 10.2k.

personalfinance,Will paying off student loan raise my credit?,"Hi, I'm sorry if this has been answered elsewhere, I have searched and can't quite find an answer.

I am trying to take advantage of the low interest rates and am looking into buying my first home. I understand that the FICO score my credit card shows may differ from the actual credit report pulled for a mortgage. Last month my FICO showed 753, this month 722. Obviously, I need it to be above 740 for the best rates. The two dings it shows is a late payment, and the proportion of loan balance to loan amount is too high. 

Late payment I'm not sure how or when, but I can't do anything about that now. Loan proportion I can fix. I have two credit cards- one with zero balance and 2000 limit, the other with ~1000 balance and 8000 limit. I pay off the balance every two weeks when I get paid, I use it for all my purchases to gain airline miles. I never pay interest. I also have a student loan, the balance is less than $4000, which I make low monthly payments. I could pay this off, but would rather keep the cash for a down payment. 

How can I bump my credit over the short term to get it above 740? I've worked hard to fix it from my younger years at &lt;500, so this is frustrating I don't have it where I want it when I need it.

personalfinance,Moving to NYC: Rent or buy?,"Throwaway, long time lurker first time poster

I (22M) just graduated college and will start a job making 85k + 10k relocation bonus in August. The job is a 2 year program after which roughly half of people in the program stay with the company and half join other firms. The position is based in NYC but is indefinitely remote due to COVID-19 so I'm going to continue living with my parents in a LCOL area to save money until we're called back to the office. My **net worth is $20k** which is half in stocks and CDs right now, I have no student loans, I own my car, so I have no outstanding debt whatsoever and my credit score is 750+.

Given the low interest rate environment and my personal economic outlook, I'm considering purchasing an apartment/condo instead of renting. It will always be easy to shovel money into stocks when that's what I want to do but I think this is a unique opportunity/time to buy RE and I like the idea of a tangible investment. **My plan is to live in it myself for at least the duration of the program and potentially longer if I stay with the company or recruit out to somewhere else in NYC and rent it out whenever I decide to leave NYC.** Both according to my models and rent vs buy calculators I've found online suggest that regardless of if I rent it out after or not, buying becomes more profitable around the 3 year mark in my position/assumptions/environment.

I'm be looking at around **$200k-300k places so I'd get an FHA loan and put 3.5 or 5% down**.

I've made two models in excel and both seem to suggest that this is a good decision with a modest rate of return even with unfavorable assumptions. I considered taxes, NYC HOA/building fees, private mortgage insurance, homeowner's insurance, maintenance, and a few other things. That being said **I've never done this before and am looking for a sanity check.**

I've seen the flow chart, I've heard most of the traditional advice, but

* Does this seem like a good decision for me in this environment?
* What should I look out for? Anything I should know about NYC specifically?
* Am I making an informed decision?
* At what point should I try to get prequalified for a mortgage if that's what I decide to do?
* Should I save up more and get a more expensive place?

Deutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG’s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.

The Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank’s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard’s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn’t made a final decision.

Deutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.

Deutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany’s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn’t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.

Wirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.

While Wirecard Bank isn’t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.

“We are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,” Deutsche Bank said. “We are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.”

Insolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he’s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn’t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.

To fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.

In addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he’s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.

Sewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it’s operating in.

The collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany’s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as “massive fraud” on Thursday in Frankfurt.",finance

Every business news article I read, I encounter some smart-ass comments about how everything is a bubble, printing money out of thin air, printers go brrr (alright guys, that meme was funny in March...), how the companies that ought to have gone bankrupt are surviving, etc. A lot of market participants, retail and otherwise, give full vent to these sentiments even as they profit from the abrupt market recovery of Q2.

It's all getting a little grating now. I feel like shouting ""WE KNOW!"". More importantly, what alternatives do they suggest? **To the best of my knowledge, the Fed and the Treasury Department's extremely prompt, extremely large-scale accommodative policies have saved millions from financial destitution.** Possibly tens of millions across the world. If we are going to do QE and helicopter money, we might as well do it sooner rather than later, and that's what we did. More importantly, this time helicopter money is going into the hands of citizens as well, and not just the companies.

None of this situation is ideal. And I certainly don't express any sentiment whatsoever on whether current equity prices are justified (they are probably a little frothy). **But did we have any other choice?** Were we really going to keep working, as if nothing had happened, and have this disease wipe out millions?

personalfinance,Is leaving a job after 4 months too soon?,"I started a new job in April after being unemployed for a month. I work in retail; my previous store closed and gave me severance. I was making $15.55 an hour in a non-management salesperson position. I started up with a new company making $16.50 as a manager, doing something very similar for a competitor.

I was told I would get “at least one dollar more” going in, but instead got .95¢. No big deal to me, but I’m also working 8 hours less a week, and I don’t receive the same bonus pay I used to, so ultimately I am making a good $100-$300 less per paycheck than I was previously (and I’m sure bonuses will be less as a result as well).

I’ve recently started some light job searching. Partly because the job doesn’t pay me enough, partly because I want out of retail. I don’t really care for the company, but I will definitely feel bad for my team if I leave them. (The company came out and told us they didn’t have enough Cash on Hand to pay their employees a “hazard pay” even though we were open throughout the lockdown. They also greatly reduced our labor but maintained the same demand as a fully staffed store. Our district manager is even frustrated with his overhead management as he can’t even get good guidance from corporate. So the company can go blow a fat one).

Should I feel bad about looking for a new opportunity? I’m starting school again in the fall and would ideally like something related to my field, but I also will take anything that pays more than currently and that is not retail.

Penny stocks are cheap and only available for new startup companies but are the highest risks in the stock markets when volume/liquidity dries up but can possibly offer the most rewards and equity ownership of a company if things turn good?

Bonds are only good investments if Interest rates are high? What happens on negative interest rates? Is bonds buying Government debt?

The best real economy indicators of a country is GDP and Unemployment numbers? Why is it that stock markets dont always reflect this?

Is DCA Dollar Cost Averaging just putting a bit of your salary/wages every month/week into the stock market regardless of share price and regardless of bull and bear markets?

How do you compound your investments over decades? Is it through dividends and interest only? If dividends then what happens when your stock portfolio crashes after decades of holding so how it compounds on losses?
 
Which best non affiliated website allows me to find good companies and their share prices at fair prices below intrinsic value? What search filters I use for this?
Which is more important PE Ratio or EPS when making a investment decision? 
How do I find shares that are undervalued?

Warren Buffet said dont sell shares unless company changes, did he mean sell if company is bought by another company or company is under new management or company changes its product/service/brand/image/logo?

How do I find out total supply of shares offered from a company from their initial IPO? If a company increases supply of their shares after IPO then does that reduce my equity/ownership of a company or devalue my existing share holdings?

If a company offers fractional shares then is that a good indicator because it attracts poorer investors to get a slice of the company pie which means more volume right?

Does a shareholder who has low amount of shares gets invited to shareholder meetings or gets like staff discounts/freebies of that company? For example if I buy 10 mcdonalds shares at $1 each but Im entitled to a free big mac meal token once a week, every week as long im holding their shares? Is it possible to get both freebies/discounts &amp; dividends payouts?

Dividends, will I lose dividend if I sell my share a day before dividend payout date, also are dividends yields paid on share price that I bought at or calculated on whatever the market daily price of that share is?

Which best website that has no affiliation with companies offers good fundamental analysis of companies and also shows red flags/scandals of a company before tv news shows it?
To look at companies financial statements &amp; annual reports, which site is best that offers this information that has no affiliation with companies so due diligence can be done? So I am to look at the Total revenue on a company income statement to see if its increasing quarterly or yearly? Also I gotta look at a company debts/liabilities and as long debts are below company assets value then that is good? Finally how do I know theres good Cash flow in a company?

If I buy a ETF shares will it show the individual share or shares from what companies the ETF basket holds and do I get same rights as a direct shareholder like having equity ownership of a company &amp; getting dividends?
Also for example if I buy ETF that tracks FTSE 100 then that means if FTSE 100 crashes like it did with the corona virus black swan event back in march then my ETF investment has gone down losing my capital?

Finally which is best most reliable stock chart pattern indicator for long term fundamental analysis to go long on a stock/share or ETF and which is the best for short term day trading on going long too?

- Trend-lines
- Channels
- Support and Resistance lines
- Head &amp; Shoulders
- Reverse Head &amp; Shoulders

I haven't mentioned shorting stocks/shares or going short or margin trading/leverage trading as I believe this is borrowing other peoples money to trade but really risky if markets go against you so I leave this out for beginners as you can go into minus - debt balance for this which is worse than losing your capital to 0.

I already have a Citicard secured card with a limit of $200 which was what I put down in cash and had it for 4 months. Going to give it 1 solid year and call them up and ask if they can turn it in to a regualr card and increase limit. With that said.

My question is this.  Since I am able to put down a good amount on another secured card.  If I get a Navy Federal Credit Union secured card and put down say $2000 or $5000 as collateral and get same limit and keep using it once a month for gas and paying off on time.  After 1 year or sooner, when they decide to turn it to a regular card, will the increase in limit be greater/based on how much was initial.     

I had a Capitol One secured card before which I put down $200 I think or maybe $500 ( don't remember), and after 6 months they increased limit by $250.  

So I figure with a $5000 secured card in good standing, after 6months or 1 year the limit should be increased way more since it had more in it?

Because if not, then I will just get a $500 secured limit card rather than a few K.

personalfinance,Seeking Advice for Negotiating Entry-Level Salary,"I graduated from Virginia Tech in December of 2019 with a degree in Management Consulting &amp; Analytics and a minor in Political Science. I believe I have a resume within the top 5% of applicants and an okay GPA (3.2) so I would like to be compensated appropriately. Since graduation, I've been actively looking for a job in the D.C. area in government contracting, management consulting, and politics. The pandemic threw the entire process for a loop, but I'm getting back on track now. 

One company I applied to performs business development research for federal service contractors as well as IT firms. This field interests me a lot and they seem like a great firm to work for! They are small and have opportunities to advance within over time. They have also told me there are opportunities for commission, end of year bonuses, and raise negotiations within the first year. 

Initially, I said I was interested in a salary range of $60,000 - $70,000. They emailed me telling me that their starting salary was typically closer to $40,000 and that before I advanced in the interview process they wanted to make sure I ""fit within their base salary figures before proceeding.""I believe there is one more meeting with the executives at the company before a formal offer is extended. I looked on Glassdoor and there is only one entry which states an Analyst makes between $40,000 - 43,000 a year plus about $1000 in bonuses. 

I would love to negotiate with them up to around $50,000 (which I think is doable, but you all would know better than me). The problem is I still have one more interview left so I'm unsure of how to go about this. 

I'm not exactly scrambling to find a job because I have no debt and live at my parents house. They are both in upper income brackets so I am fully supported. But it seems like a great fit and it would be a relief to finally find work after months of applying and interviewing. Any advice for me in my current situation?

personalfinance,Cancelling a refinance before closing - closing costs?,"Hello!

I've been dealing with the worst refinance process over the past 3 months, and today I got fed up and got a new quote from a different lender that was much better than my current rate.

For background - I signed my rate lock-in agreement on April 4th. It expired on June 4th (no fault of my own) and the company auto extended it to July 4th without telling me. They never reach out to me and just kept saying ""things are taking longer"" and that I'll hear back whenever I hear back.

Anyway I've decided I wanted to cancel and go with the new company. So far I've only paid $100 during the whole process for the application fee (I got an appraisal waiver).

Today they just requested additional bank statements from me to prove I have cash for closing costs because they want to close on July 8th, but they don't answer the phone when I try to call. It sounds like everything is now complete for closing if they are trying to set the date.

My question is: if they've already completed most of their process, can they then try to charge me for some of the closing costs associated if I cancel? I've re-read all the paperwork and there doesn't seem to be any info on it other than the application fee being non-refundable.

personalfinance,Now I see how people get into trouble with loans...,"I just bought my parents a new refrigerator and the GEStore offers a loan with no interest as long as it's paid off in the first 12 months. I went with that because why not? Why pay $1700 out of pocket now when I can just pay $144-ish per month for 12 months?

Anyway, I looked at the terms of the loan and the details. It seems like they split your total purchase into 48 monthly payments. Weird. Ok who cares, I'll just do the math myself and make sure it gets paid off within 12 months. Then I saw the interest rate. 29.99%!!! Holy shit!!

I know that won't matter to me because I'll have this thing paid off in 12 months, even sooner if I want to. Really I could pay it off right now if I wanted to, but no reason to while it's interest-free. But that's insane! Someone who is less conscious of these kinds of things or less educated in finance would probably get screwed over by this thing.

Be careful with this kind of stuff!! By default, you often will **NOT**  get the benefit of interest-free.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Alright, you've all convinced me. I'm going to just pay this off completely once it appears on the loan so I don't have to think about it anymore. I think I have to wait for my first statement. Now I'm regretting not using my credit card for the rewards :(

Edit2: I changed my mind again. I might call and see if I can switch payment methods. If so, I’ll switch to my credit card to get the rewards and then pay off the credit card right away. If they can’t switch it then I’ll just pay the loan in 10–11 months like I originally planned. 

I’ve read a lot of your comments, many which say to just pay the loan in 10 months or so and others say to pay the loan immediately. I think there is merit to both approaches and functionally for me it’s not going to make much of a difference",finance

The emergency fund is topped off, full contributions to retirement plus other things so no worries there.  I'm fortunate enough to not have any work shortage right now or the foreseeable future.

My bank has home equity lines of credit for fairly simple terms - 4% annually, no actual principal payments for 10 years, and as long as the account is open (no balance necessary) for 3+ years we do not have to pay appraisal or closing costs.

We will likely pay it off in under 3 years and the interest rate seems reasonable to me.  It's higher than some places but lower than others out there and since it's at our bank it simplifies things.

That said - I have never done a HELOC before.  Is there something to watch out for?  The expenses will likely be staggered - down payment this summer, final payment in the spring, installation costs a while after that - figure 10% in unforeseen extras.

gaming,A real pocket dungeon master.,"A long path of my reasoning awaits you ahead.  If you want to get right to the point, start reading from the end.

"" Hi everyone.
Here is a ""little"" background: I was born in 1992 and all my life, since I first got access to a gaming device, I played (video)games.  Tetris, Tamagotchi, Dandy, Sega, Sony Playstation, then my first computer and so on 27 years in a row, interrupted only for reading fiction.  I represent a whole generation of you, maybe even a few.  Thus, until recently, I considered myself an avid player on the verge of addiction.

I discovered MMORPG quite early on, and invested a very large chunk of my life there.  I loved and hated this experience, not realizing the exact reasons for this. The presence of other people added liveliness, uniqueness, and surprise to the limited design of the computer game.  At the same time, I always understood that it was the conceptual limitations of a computer game that gives me the motivation to continue playing and develop my skills in it.

Unlike life, in the game you can really understand the rules and become an absolute master.  But, as many of you know, even the best of modern online games do not leave room for imagination and going into detail - you just eat what they give and do not dare to ask for more.  This went on until I was fortunate enough to have the experience of a true D&amp;D board game.  Once upon a time I read a couple of Salvatore's books, once I played in Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter, even played in Demon Stone - but only here, with all the confusing rules, with dice rolls and the freedom to improvise within an entire fantasy setting, I felt myself closer to the perfect balance of the game scope.

Needless to say, even here, significant shortcomings of the Tabletop playing method did not escape my view. The most basic of these shortcomings are 1) the time spent on the session 2) that implies the impossibility for each of the players, especially for serious ones like me, to play the game at a qualitative level of immersion;  in addition, there is the famous problem of ""plot rails vs. sandbox"" - few human dungeon masters can properly conduct a sandbox game.

Therefore, immediately after I found the roll20 service, which greatly improved my D&amp;D experience thanks to the digitization of the character sheet and the game chat, I found AI Dungeon and exclaimed: “WOW!”

After several days of continuous testing of the subject, I, like you, found many cons and shortcomings, like AI losing the boundaries of the setting and the coherence of the narrative, despite the driven scripts. And here lies the first dividing line between those for whom this is just a fun application for creating memes, and those for whom artificial intelligence promises an unprecedented level of freedom for the player.

You have long begun to catch my idea, right?  A pocket dungeon master fed with all the existing sourcebooks, literature, comics and other art on D&amp;D settings.  A master who will allow you to live at your own pace a unique, but at the same time challenging game, which is unalienable from the global context. Maybe this is followed by a multiplayer online platform with generated locations and content?
I learned about a phenomenon like MUD (multi-user-dungeon) a couple of days ago and it became clear to me that it needed to be hybridized and animated with AI.  MUDs (e. g. TorilMUD) are huge, and it is the most open yet widely unknown type of MMORPG. 

Let us behold the greatness of what MUAID can turn into!

So, for those who have read it, I’m conducting this survey: would you like to make such a role-playing game, the idea of ​​which you caught in the text, part of a new reality?  Just show with your voices that you are here to challenge the developers.  I would like as many people as possible to vote, maybe I will spread the idea to some other subreddits.  What do you think?""

I keep seeing alot of conflicting information from other customers experience. Some keep getting the run around from the company, others are told to contact their state A.G. and when they do, they just tell them they'll be in touch, etc.
So before I contact the company itself or my State A.G., I would like to know my best course of action.

The lawsuit states that any customers who got a loan from January 2010 up until May 2020, are applicable for reimbursement/get out of their contract. Also if you've had a repo, then you can have that fixed as well. They're also offering to pay off the full amount that's owed on your car as well (if you qualify). The only issue for me is that I haven't missed a payment, so no repo, but I do fall within the time frame that the lawsuit states. They also state in the lawsuit that you're eligible for reimbursement if you feel you were pressured or forced into the contract, which I'm not sure how broad of a statement that is. I did feel pressure as it was my first time buying a car on my own but I didn't particularly feel forced.

After looking over my contract, I do agree that I'm paying a high interest rate and I'm not happy with how it worked out now.

personalfinance,Should I buy this car?,"I am a 22M, just graduated with 100k in student loans, starting work in mid-September for just under $80k/year in the DC area.  Live in NJ currently.

I test drove a 2017 Civic Hatchback Sport Touring and fell in love.  It has 25k miles and is $23,000 all said and done. I will be selling my current car in the next few weeks that I think I can get around $8,000 for.  Ideally, I'd like to wait until my current car is sold so that I can put that money down on the Civic.  However, the deposit I put down for this Civic only lasts 72 hours, so if I did wait until after the current car is sold I'd have to find another Sport Touring, which has proven pretty difficult. Quick question here... is it typically possible to refinance these car loan deals if I wanted to put a big lump sum from the current car sale into the loan in order to lower my monthly payment? 

As of right now (w/o selling my current car), I can realistically put $5k down on the Civic which would bring me to a monthly payment of about $350.  With a 6% interest rate over 60 months, I'll end up paying about $4000 for the loan, making the total cost of the new car around $27k.  I last checked my credit about a year ago and it was 730 I think. Should I negotiate for a better rate? I think it's high because of my age. 

Now, the first large goal of mine in life is to save enough money ($100k, realistically I think) to purchase a beater of a home in the north New Jersey area, renovate it, flip it, and repeat.  My father is a carpenter by trade (and I know a fair bit as well), and so most of the labor costs for the flip would be nil.  I'm hoping I can put $50k down on the house and use another $50k for materials.  

This brings me to my question.  I've never had a credit card, so the only thing affecting my credit score right now is utility payments (gas and electric) and 2 years of rent payments (I think that applies?).  In order to get a better deal on a mortgage for that first flip, would having a financed car over the next few years be helpful?  I'm trying to think of more pros to financing this vehicle aside from having a fun, enjoyable, comfortable, and reliable ride.  I think what I'm really doing is trying to justify this $27k purchase by thinking that it will help make that first goal of flipping a house easier.  Maybe it will require me to put less money down on the house, ultimately allowing me to start the flipping process sooner since I don't have to save up as much money for the down payment? 

After taxes, I'll be making about $4500/month.  Including rent, utilities, food, entertainment, commuting, $645 (twice minimum payment) to student loans, $350 to car loan, and $100 to car insurance, my monthly expenses will amount to about $2800.  That leaves about $1700/month into Savings.  After 60 months of these numbers, I would have $100,000 saved to purchase that house and the materials required to renovate it.  Without this car &amp; subsequent insurance payment, the monthly savings would rise to $2,050, which would bring me to $100k savings after 48 months.  

So without financing this Civic, I'd reach my goal of purchasing a flippable property in 4 years instead of 5, 1 year earlier.  Assuming of course, I can find a property and loan which would allow $50k down.  

Now, if I did finance this Civic, would the amount my credit score increases (I plan on being very very reliable with this loan to boost my credit) allow me to put, say, $20k (= 1 year savings = $1700/month \* 12) less down on a home?  If this was the case, then I'd still be able to purcahse a flippable property in 4 years instead of 5.  I'd hope to put down $30k instead of $50k, and still have $50k for materials.  With this route, I'd also have a much higher quality of life considering I'd be able to drive this car that I really enjoy.  I'd also potentially save on gas throughout the years.  

All in all, I'd like you very intelligent people to comment on my situation, my thinking and reasoning, and my general plan moving forward.  Is there anything that sounds way too far out to be realistic? I may be a bit optimistic with my reasoning behind flipping, but my pops and I are fairly confident we could renovate a property for $50k in materials, assuming the house isn't too far gone. 

For more specific questions:  should I buy this car? should I wait until I sell my current car? should I wait until I know if I even need a car considering I'll be in the metropolitan area of DC? 

I'd like to mention I'm a fairly frugal person, which is why purchasing a car right out of college has boosted my skepticism and caution.  Also, after my current car gets repaired, I *could* keep using it, it just really sucks to drive and I'm getting a little tired of it.  Terrible on gas too.  

Looking for advice!

Thanks guys!  Cheers",finance
personalfinance,Buying a Point for Refi?,"Hello all - engaging with my current mortgage servicer WellsFargo (I know the horror stories, but they have been VERY good to me in my relationship with them thus far) to refinance.  My current state:

* Interest = 4%
* Term = 30 Years
* Original Principle = $368,000
* Current Balance = $350,126.31
* Monthly Payment = $3,010 (includes $13,600 annual NJ taxes + Insurance)
* Monthly Payment Breakdown = $580 Principal, $1,176.82 interest, $1,253.98 escrow 

In speaking with my contact at WF, the offer is a 20 yr/2.75% fixed rate provided I ""buy a point"" which means they roll standard closing fees PLUS 1% of my current mortgage balance into my next loan.  So the new loan is:

* Original Principle = $359,000 (estimating closing fees + 1% of my existing balance)
* Monthly Payment = $3,204 (including taxes and insurance)
* Interest Rate = 2.75%
* Term = 20 years

By my math, it works out. Over the life of the loan I'll be saving somewhere in the neighborhood of $100k in interest, but I, admittedly, am not awesome at math.  Can someone check my numbers, and/or tell me how ""normal"" it is to have to buy a point in order to get a decent refinance?

For what it's worth, my current mortgage payment is about 30% of my NET monthly take home after retirement, and my wife also works full-time and pays nothing against the mortgage so the extra $200 per month is easily doable (then again, maintaining the current state is as well).

investing,Fed official warns COVID-19 bankruptcies could trigger a financial crisis,"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/business/economy/article-fed-official-warns-covid-19-bankruptcies-could-trigger-a-financial/

St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard has warned that a growing number of bankruptcies due to the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a financial crisis, the Financial Times reported.

“Without more granular risk management on the part of the health policy, we could get a wave of substantial bankruptcies and [that] could feed into a financial crisis,” Mr. Bullard said in an interview with the newspaper on Wednesday.

He warned of “twists and turns” in the health crisis and said “it’s probably prudent to keep our lending facilities in place for now, even though it’s true that liquidity has improved dramatically in financial markets.”

New U.S. COVID-19 cases rose by nearly 50,000 on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic. The surge in cases across the country, including the populous states of California, Florida and Texas, threaten the budding recovery.

Mr. Bullard said that it is possible that the country could “take a turn for the worse at some point in the future,” but added that it was not his base case, according to the report.

The Fed moved aggressively in March to support the U.S. economy by cutting rates to near zero, buying up trillions of dollars in bonds and launching a slate of emergency lending tools to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.

The last of those programs was launched on Monday, which the Fed can use to buy newly minted corporate bonds.

“With all these programs, the idea is to make sure the markets don’t freeze up entirely, because that’s what gets you into a financial crisis, when traders won’t trade the asset at any price,” Mr. Bullard added.",finance

I was offered a lump sum severance payout that amounted to just over $20,000, which I accepted.

personalfinance,"Refinanced auto, original lender is saying I have a balance due still","So here’s the story and I hope I can get some advice on how to handle the situation:

I bought a 2015 Subaru WRX in September of last year, from a private sale thru CarGurus. I used the CarGurus system to complete the transaction and secure the loan, which ended up be a loan thru Westlake Financial (heavily suggest not doing this - CarGurus partners with AutoPay to do everything and it took me over 5 months to even get the car properly registered because of them). The interest rate was 11% and I wanted to refi using Chase to consolidate my accounts into one ‘place’ (my checking &amp; credit card are both chase accounts) and lower my interest rate, so I started the refi at the end of March. 

The Westlake app told me I had a payoff quote of $9,500 or around that - Chase of course called them to get the payoff quote directly from them and sent in the payoff of ~$9,507, I did all the paperwork with Chase and I assumed I was all set. Come the April statement from Westlake it says I have a balance due of $0, with a payoff of $0 - sounds good to me, maybe the account just hadn’t been closed yet but didn’t have a balance because it was paid off. But then come May’s statement and it says I have a balance due on June 1st for $76, with a payoff quote of $0 still. This clearly wasn’t right, so I called in to Westlake, and they said they were not sure why it was saying I had a balance due but also that my payoff was $0, and they would look into it, but that on their end it did show I had $2,400 amount left on the account. On my end in the Westlake portal/app, it still said $0 payoff also. They let me know they would have a supervisor look into it and call me back. 

Now for the fun: the only person to ever call me back from Westlake is collectors - I explain to each of them and they all say “I see your insurance paid off part but not all of the account so you still owe $76 today” but I correct each one that it was a refinance, not an insurance payout, and that it was for the exact amount my payoff quote was for, and explain that it still says $0 payoff.. I’ve gotten a wide range of reactions from them on that, with a few trying to help or saying I need to call into Westlake Customer support directly, a few saying “okay so how will you pay today? Card?”, and one even hanging up on me. The ones that try to help, and every time I’ve called into Westlake tell me they will have a supervisor check in on it and call me back, or for me to call back in 5 business days to check. 

Each time I call the agents have no idea and see nothing on the account about it and just say the same thing, and none will actually transfer me to a supervisor, they say they will call me back or that no supervisor is available for calling atm. Finally two weeks ago I got transferred to a “supervisor”. She said she wasn’t sure why it showed like that but that she would look into it and again call me back - I made sure to ask for her name and extension just incase. She gave them and now, two weeks later, I haven’t gotten a call back. I tried calling in and her extension is “invalid” and the agent I spoke with this time just said “looks like insurance didn’t pay off the full amount” AGAIN. I explained once more it was a refinance and he said “oh okay so your refinance didn’t pay off the full amount, call them.” And let me go, but did email me a new “payoff quote” that lists the $2,400 now. My app also now suddenly shows that balance listed. 

At this point I have already submitted a complaint with the CFPB and have talked to Chase and they are looking into it, but they did pay what was listed as the payoff so I’m not sure how they will handle it. Is there any other steps I should be taking to pressure Westlake into actually solving the issue since they have only replied “still investigating” on the CFPB complaint, or any other steps to protect myself as I don’t want it to impact my good credit score (730)? I have the money to pay that $2400 off from Westlake but I also don’t think I should until they prove that I owe it or there’s a resolution that they actually contact me with. 

Any help or advice is appreciated, thank you",finance

CryptoCurrency,Are there any Lebanese or Argentinian crypto users here who could comment on how cryptocurrency is performing in situations of inflationary collapse?,"I was wondering if we have any users on this subreddit who either live in countries where the currency is collapsing due to inflation or who have friends/family on the ground and are familiar with the situation. My interest was piqued because I read that BTC and other cryptos are trading at a premium in Argentina as people seek to secure their savings as their fiat currency is being devalued by runaway inflation. 

I recall a similar situation when the Russian ruble was devalued by sanctions during the Obama era- my friends from Cyprus said there were long lines at BTC ATMs, and I was living in a sort of Russian beach colony in Vietnam at the time (Mui Ne, if you're familiar) and all of the sudden BTC atms popped up- it was the first time I had seen them.   


I am especially interested in this question because I foresee a coming central bank collapse/inflationary event occurring all over the world quite soon due to the policies of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, combined with the various debt bubbles (housing, student loan, leveraged debt, and so forth) which aren't getting any better during the age of Coronavirus. So perhaps if we get some insight into how crypto is performing in countries where this is already happening, it could give us a better idea of what the future might look like.

personalfinance,Conservative investments on short &lt;3 year timeline? (CAN),"Hey folks,

I am curious what recommendations could be made for conservative investments during the current market volatility. I've not invested too much before besides a few stocks but have gathered quite a bit of savings over the last years and want to safely maximize returns.

Current situation:

* Mid/late 30s
* Income: 100k net
* 230k savings in liquid cash (savings account)
* 3 years left on mortgage (10 year plan dumping 35k/year extra + 80k on last year to pay of house)
* Saving ~33k/year
* No credit card debt, loans or credit line. Only mortgage

The main targets I am aiming for is having 18 months emergency cash (~80k) and not having too much money tied up in investments when I make the last lump sum payment on the house in 3 years.

This basically means I have about 100k to invest into a larger portfolio than the 5k of stocks I am holding currently. In general I consider the stock money cash I am comfortable losing. Doing research, diversifying and not going to expensive stocks I have made a pretty decent return on my investment choices. I'm not super active, maybe about a dozen or so trades/year.

Our goal is once the house is paid we can spend the next 15-20 years dumping &gt;65k/year into retirement investments and retire mid-50s. It's a long way off planning wise and lots can change, but I've always found having a target is a good plan.

With that in mind I started looking at various other investments and nothing really seems worth it right now:

* Term deposits have interest rates almost no different than my savings account
* Market linked guaranteed investments have barely any return even for variable return options where 0% return is possible
* Most of the funds I've looked at are down like 4-20% YTD (expected which covid) and maybe better to wait a little longer before diving in

With the above in mind I am looking at:

* 35k - guaranteed investment with min return (2 years)
* 50k - guaranteed investment with variable return (3 years)
* 15k - various stocks selected myself via online trading (mix of tech/gaming, healthcare, remote economy [zoom, wayfair] 2nd class stable [Adobe, etc] and some riskier bets [oil, airlines])

With the guaranteed investments I'll make perhaps 1-3k VS the few hundred I'd get with it sitting in savings. Stock wise 15k is certainly more than I am willing to entirely lose, but i see it as an opportunity for higher gains with a lower+liquid investment...even if the measured risk is higher.

Sound like a plan? Other considerations I should make? Any suggestions?

personalfinance,Switching from Full time W2 employee to a 1099 “independent contractor”,"Hello! TYIA for any advice on this!

Recently, I made the decision to move from MA to WA (where I’m from). I have been in MA for work, but with COVID19, my company is now allowing us to work from home indefinitely (we are a super super small company with like 3-4 FT employees). My boss was super supportive and told me that if wanted to move back to WA we would make it work, but that I may have to switch from W2 to a 1099 employee so that our business isn’t being taxed for operating in 2 states (since it really wouldn’t be operating in WA just because I work from a home office there).

Well, our accountant did ultimately determine I need to be 1099 and I have some questions that I need help posing to my boss. Another important note is that we used to be on a company health insurance plan, but effective July 1 we know have our own individual plans that we pay for monthly and which he said he will reimburse us for at the end of the year. 

Question:
I currently make 105,000 / year and have paid holidays/paid time off: what is a fair hourly wage that I should be receiving as an independent contractor that would work out to the same I’m receiving now? Assume that I will work a normal 40 hours per week. As I said, my Employer has been super helpful and supportive of me moving, so I don’t want to approach him with a number that would result in me making more after taxes than I currently get after taxes. My understanding is that I’ll have to pay an additional 7.5% federal income tax (correct me if I am wrong), as well as the cost of say 3-4 weeks PTO / vacations and potentially a b&amp;o tax from WA but I am not sure how much that is. I will also have health insurance which I’m not sure if he will still be reimbursing me for at end of year, or if he would rather bake that into my hourly cost as well?? The cost will be ~$6,000 per year so it would nice to have an hourly rate figured out with &amp; without accounting for health insurance so I can discuss that with him.",finance

As the title states we were able to lock in a 3.5% interest on our home loan (30 year fixed) 4 years ago. Due to the current economic climate, we were approached by the individual who helped us get the 3.5% stating that we could refinance at 3.0% for a 26 year period. He stated his company is willing to cover all closing and escrow costs in the amount of $3000ish.

It would seem like a no brainer to take it but the cynic in me thinks there might be some hidden fees or something that I am unaware of. Anybody that has knowledge on refinancing and home loans care to give me some pointers? I placed all the pertinent information in a loan calculator with how much we  owe on the current loan (and therefore how much the new refinance loan will be) and the calculator stated after the duration of 26 years (if we were to pay the minimum monthly mortgage) we would be saving somewhere around $35,000.

I asked the loan officer about the ""break even point"" and he stated since his company will be paying the closing costs and escrow fees (therefore it wont be rolled into the new loan and we won't have to pay it up front) that we will start saving right from the get go.

I asked if we had to reappraise our home since it's been 4 years and he stated we might have to. When we purchased, it was roughly $420,000. Rough estimated worth now on Zillow is $510,000. Will this effect the loan or interest rate or anything like that? Does that mean property insurance will increase?

personalfinance,Home Loan refinance currently on 30yr @ 3.5% .. 100% confused on refinancing . Break downs below. 4 years into my loan.,"Hi all, sorry for another one of these refinancing questions. I emailed my broker asking about refinance and this is what I got back. I've read it but I dont understand it and not sure which option is beneficial to me. I feel very stupid about asking her when she already laid it out in the email so I was hoping ya'll could give me some advice? on a throw away account because im embarrassed for asking lol

&amp;#x200B;

How do i figure out if I go with a new 30year I'm not losing money or will I because I'm 4 years into my loan and if I refinance the 30year starts over again? or should I go with a 20 because she says I will save 5year8months? How do I figure out the math -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_- haha

I plan to live here for at least 10+ years if that matters.

Response from my broker, the one I used when I first bought the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Your current principal is around $205K, interest rate is 3.500% and monthly payment is $1010.35 (current loan closed on March 2016).**Today interest rate for 30Y Fixed as follow :** \- 2.875% is no point with around $3500-$4000 closing cost, monthly payment is $805.53 (you will save $159.82 per month)- 3.250% to 3.375%, no point no fee, monthly payment for 3.375% is $906.30 (you will save $104.05)Or some Borrower will add the closing cost to Loan Amount. For your case, add $4000 into your current principal balance, new loan amount is $209K interest rate 2.875%, then your monthly payment is $867.13 (you will save $143.22 per month)

**Today interest rate for 20Y Fixed as follow :** \- 2.875% is no point with around $3500-$4000 closing cost, monthly payment is $1124.14 (you will pay $113.79 extra per month, but will save 5Y8M)- 3.250% to 3.375%, no point no fee, monthly payment for 3.375% is $1175.79

**Today interest rate for 15Y Fixed as follow :** \- 2.500% is no point with around $3500-$4000 closing cost, monthly payment is $1366.92 - 3.000% to 3.125% no point no fee, monthly payment for 3.125% is $1428.05

Like others, I’m looking to refinance and take advantage of the lower rates. However, I’m not sure whether to go for a 30yr or 15yr and how to calculate the best scenario for me. 

I closed just over 1.5 yrs ago at 4.5% 30yr. I’m looking at likely staying in this home for the next 2-3 years before selling and looking for something larger as we start a family. I could likely afford the higher payment that would come with the 15yr mortgage and lower interest rate, but I’m not sure if it would make more sense to finance at 30 with a slightly higher interest rate and put the extra money I would be putting towards this home towards saving for our next home (since the goal isn’t necessarily paying off the mortgage).

personalfinance,Facet Wealth - review,"Hi Folks,

Back a few months ago, I asked if anyone had any experience with Facet Wealth, here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/egflst/facet\_wealth\_anyone\_have\_any\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/egflst/facet_wealth_anyone_have_any_experience/)

I signed up back in January and I was delinquent in eating my own dog food in providing a review.  Thought this would benefit y'all.  Here goes.  I will update this based on questions I get... :-)

\------

I signed up back in January.  My advisor and I scheduled a series of zoom's with one another.  I'm a tech guy, so don't care about zoom vs. meeting in person - I will say given the pandemic, meeting my CFP in person isn't anywhere on the priority list, regardless :-)  

The first 2 calls with my Facet CFP were more ""getting to know you.""  Once we got beyond those calls however, there was QUITE practical advice that was provided.

Baseline: My wife and I are both employed full time.  We have a complex portfolio of 401(k), non-qualified 401(k)s, 457s, 403(b)s, multiple state 529s, rental properties, alternative investments (e.g. Fundrise), lots of eSavings accounts (interest rate hunting), plus brokerage accounts including roboadvising and standard accounts - e.g., not exactly the simplest for someone to grapple with.  Not at all consolidated.

Example advice provided by my Facet CFP:

\- Consolidate off higher fee 529s and onto NYS and Utah plans.

\- Begin WEEKLY investing with one of my roboadvisors (Wealthfront), given the pandemic we're dealing with with lotsa volatility, spread the risk of investing - WEEKLY.

\- Diversify further with more intermediate bonds (e.g. not straight US treasury, instead 5-8 year maturity hybrid treasury, corporate, municipal) - our portfolio was around 12% bonds (and given I'm 40, the wife is 45, she advised we go slightly higher - but as am not ultra conservative, not straight into US treasuries).

\- Pay off rental property mortgages at higher rates prior to primary residence mortgage (highest APR on rental prop - 4.25% 30-yr fixed, vs. 2.875% 30-yr fixed primary residence).

I used the Facet portal (not great candidly) - but my advisor got approval for me to give my ID/PW for Personal Capital - where I've got everything stored.  Quite, quite, a simplification that helped us both a great deal.

Unfortunately .. my advisor just left Facet, and now was given a new advisor.  She did not provide a notice so unfortunately no transition.  I'm not sure I can blame Facet for this, though - it's clearly unfortunate - as now I can foresee having to start somewhat over.  But new advisor .. and first conversation is due to happen in the next couple of weeks.

I am paying $250/mo, or $3K/year, for Facet.  Candidly I consider myself a level 7 out of 10 when it comes to personal investing - so I am relatively advanced, but not advanced advanced - no day trading for me for example.  I'm absolutely not interested in an AUM-based CFP relationship, but I am half/half at this point on whether the subscription-fee basis is right for me.  I may be better off paying an hourly rate for when I need advice.

personalfinance,26 living at home and have no idea how people can afford to move out.,"Just as the title says, I'm 26 living in the UK making around £30,000 a year but I'm struggling to see how I would be able to move out and buy my own place. I don't really want to rent because I don't like the idea of paying someone else's mortgage, but at the same time it's so expensive to buy where I live, I just can't see me moving out until I'm like 30...

I've got about 20k saved up, but as a single guy that would only be just about enough for a deposit, let alone all the fees, furniture etc. And if I bought a house, I would be left with 0 savings so if I lost my job, I would be screwed. I live very frugally and have tracked every single penny I've spent over the last 4 years and am incredibly fortunate to live with my parents as this allows me to save a lot. I want to have my own place and independence but I'm struggling to figure out how that's going to be possible. I'm not saying that I'm not fortunate to be where I am, I know there are millions of people in a worse situation that me, but trying to figure out how I'm going to be able to get my own place is leaving me feeling pretty sad.

Would it be worth it for me to rent a place out and put my money in some investments and wait to see if I can get some profit from this? Or should I be taking advantage of the low interest rates as currently the mortgage re-payments would be cheaper than renting. Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Do mortgages with increasing payment amounts exist?,"When renting, the cost of housing will typically increase with each annual renewal.  Is there a similar thing for mortgages where I can, for example, have my payment amount increase by 2% each year?  I just made a quick amortization calculator in Excel with the assumption of $500K initial 30 year mortgage, 6% annual nominal interest rate (compounded monthly), and an increase in payment each year and found my initial payment would start at just under $2,416 (and eventually jump to $4290 in year 30) compared to just under $3,000 for the fixed payment mortgages.

While I realize this is riskier from the bank's perspective and I will pay more total interest ($676K for the step-up vs. $579K for the traditional over the lifetime of the loan), this sort of mortgage would be attractive to me as a younger home buyer with still lots of time for my income to grow.

personalfinance,Should I use loans to pay off other loans?,"Hi personal finance! I’m in need of some advice on what would be the best option to maximize my long-term savings potential. I am currently a second-year medical student and my dilemma concerns my student loans (shocker). The interest rate for my Federal Unsubsidized loans just got dropped from 6.08% to 4.3%. I am approved for a $45k/year loan and also have a $5k/year scholarship. I live with my parents to save money and was able to minimize my loans to $35k during my first year with approximately $5k to spare ($2.7k in stimulus from Fed and school). This year I decided to take out the max $45k because I figured I could do several things with that extra $10k and if not I have until 9/2020 to pay it back before it starts accumulating interest thanks to the CARES act.

Before describing my options moving forward I think it would be beneficial to explain my long term plans post-graduation in 2023. Everything from this point forward is a hypothetical and best-case scenario. Match into a residency and take advantage of the income-based repayment program to better manage my monthly payments. After completing between 5-6 years of residency I would have a boatload of debt that I would then try to refinance at a much lower interest rate. I would then use my upwards of $350k/year income to aggressively pay down my debt over the next 5-10 years.

Options:

A) Use the extra $12k/year at the lower 4.3% rate to pay off the 6.08% $35k loan over the next 3 years.

B) Put $6k/year into a Roth IRA and put $6k towards the higher interest loan. (Once we are married my fiancee's income \[$50k/yr\] would allow me to make that contribution. She lives in a different city and is currently maxing out her own Roth IRA)

C) Don’t take out the extra money stupid because in the end this $36k you’re trying to play with is peanuts in the grand scheme of how much money you’re going to owe!

Thank you so much for reading my post and I appreciate any and all advice you have to share!

TLDR; Should I use a 4.3% interest loan to pay off a 6.03% interest loan, or should I use that 4.3% loan to start contributing to a Roth IRA before my salary increases and I’m no longer eligible to contribute (future back door Roth IRA maybe?).",finance

My Credit Karma app is suggesting some refinancing options that are pre-approved for 4-6%. Should I apply for the lowest one I'm pre-approved for? It seems like a no-brainer, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't screwing myself by jumping the gun. I don't know what things might be happening in the background, and I haven't seen auto refinancing pop up here in my lurking for the last couple months.

personalfinance,Cash-in refinance or invest?,"I've ran these numbers so many times my head is starting to hurt. Would appreciate your all's opinions.


I'm selling a different property that I've been renting out and will net about $60,000. I don't need that money for anything in the foreseeable future. I'm planning to either 1) do a cash-in refinance on my primary residence, putting in about $48,000 to remove PMI and drop the rate a bit, or 2) put that 48,000, and the rest of the proceeds, in VTSAX and let it gather dust.


All other savings milestones are already being met, max 401k, max spouse IRA, max Roth IRA, 12 month emergency fund, and a decent taxable account, so I just need to figure out the ideal place to drop this money.


**The Mortgage:**


Property value: $505,000 (appraised in January when I refinanced into this current mortgage)    
Current mortgage balance: $452,533    
Interest Rate: 3.875%    
P&amp;I: $2167.95    
PMI: $99.89    
Property type: Townhouse-style condo (apparently condos always have higher rates that SFH or townhomes)


**The Cash-In Refinance:**

Cash-in: ~$48000 to get to 80% LTV
Balance: $404,000    
Interest Rate: 3.25%    
P&amp;I: $1758


So, I can save about 2268-1758 per month (510/mo), or 6120/year, on mortgage payments by doing the cash-in refinance. When I put it this way, the refinance sounds like the obvious way to go. $6120/48000 is a 12.75% return and I keep ""earning"" that $6120 every year for the next 29-30 years. I would also be saving about ((452533*0.3875)-(404000*0.0325) = 4406 in interest in the first year and a little less each year after that. Sweet.


But I've also looked at it from the perspective of investing that 48,000 and earning 8%. 8% return is much more than a 3.875% or 3.25% interest rate, even if take into account the effective rate of an additional 1200/year in PMI. I've also read several articles talking about how paying down to remove PMI may not be the best investment long-term. In a vacuum, it seems that mathematically it is better to invest and earn 8% than it is to pay off or pay down a loan @ 3.875 or 3.25% interest.


I feel like I've thought about this too long and I'm just confusing myself or missing something, so I'd appreciate your all's perspective. Thanks!",finance
stocks,Why the market isn’t really overvalued or undervalued right now and what could be coming next,"It boils down to one factor.

America.

Why are stocks not overvalued?

To illustrate my thesis I will provide Amazon as an example. Amazon is a trillion and a half dollar company, which a massive market share of the e-commerce marketplace. Anyone who lives in America knows this and most people outside of America in the investing world understand this too. Their business model is seemingly indestructible because of how much revenue they bring in each year and their strong presence with AWS. To put it simply, they are corona-proof and economy-proof. 

Well u/racquet345, why the fuck should I care? I know what Amazon is. Amazon trades at a very high P/E, which is in part because of their crazy margins and massive growth in AWS among other categories of their business. What people miss is another factor being priced into a stock like Amazon right now.

Amazon was able to take out debt of $1B for two years at 0.4% interest. This is unbelievably low. The reason is they are an incredibly safe company that is seen as a borrower who will have no trouble paying off their debt. The same holds true on the equity side of things. The P/E doesn’t really matter anymore: Amazon is a safe haven where people can park their cash. 

It’s a matter of share price premium due to the fact that they are the best place to park assets in a time of crisis. People are paying absurd valuations for shares of Amazon because while industries like Airlines and Hospitality may be forever changed, Amazon will likely be able to continue to pay off and take out debt for extremely cheap and continue to grow their business. 

This is becoming repetitive so I’ll cut it short there, but P/E ratios are not important right now because people are trying to find safe companies to invest in. These companies are being blown up in share price because people are paying a premium to invest in them over the alternative (Real Estate, less stable equities, Precious Metals, etc.). We will get to a point (or maybe are at that point), when the premium to buy a share of Amazon is no longer worth the asset protection it provides, and people will look for other equities to do the same asset preservation. 

To conclude: 
Investors are parking cash in safe assets, causing them to trade at a premium. This coupled with asset inflation due to cash injections from the fed has led to insane P/E multiples and valuation numbers. This doesn’t mean they are incorrect or overvalued, however, and they still could have room to grow if shit becomes worse and they are still the “safest” asset class to invest in. 

Shit hits the fan if the Fed can’t provide enough support to main street and CPI goes negative, indicating deflationary period incoming. If we can’t create inflation shit will get ugly fast. That’s when we see market downturns and zombie companies who only exist to service debt.",finance

investing,"""Beautiful Deleveraging"" -Trying to understand this dynamic","I been researching Ray Dalio's work and have a trouble understanding the concept of ""Beautiful Deleveraging"". To me, it is just matching the movements of deflation with inflation. 

Reading about this concept of ""Beautiful Deleveraging"" gave me the feeling that the Federal Reserve can go beyond the laws of nature and stabilize the economy when companies have to face the issues with having too much debt and bad business models/direction. Let them fail so new companies can take its place. 

Well..the market is going up- so the Fed can effectively cancel a recession? Keep asset prices stable via QE when values should go down due to economic reality? I don't think the printing of money would go directly to the places where deflation is occurring...wouldn't the mismatch cause more wealth inequality? Those who get the benefits of money printing versus those suffering from the effects of deflation may not be the same?

It feels that we don't have a free markets because the Fed keeps escalating their actions. The Fed buying bonds feel disconcerting as they are acting more like a market participant.

economy,"Where does commerce stand today? How does it perform in our digitalised, hyper capitalist system? Some thoughts...","Imagine a traditional market square. A centre of exchange, and a community in action. It is a timeless scene replicated throughout the world, regardless of creed, colour or culture. We have a space dedicated to transaction and valuation, interaction and negotiation. It is a society at its best, underpinned and guided by the power of commerce. The original product-market fit.

In essence, we are talking about an organic, natural force. It caters to a desire to connect, create and provide. It can be the source of our best relationships, our pride and our education. It supports the fortune, and facilitates the demise, of many an independent trader and small business. Commerce is the great leveller, binding us together through the process of production, the act of buying and the art of selling. Discrimination and conflict are bad for business, after all.

In its purest form, commerce acts as the great motivator, the ultimate mentor. We conduct our commercial affairs against a backdrop of economic and trading uncertainty. Our decisions and behaviour are constantly pitted against known unknowns and unknown unknowns. We are drawn to ingenuity and innovation through the actions and presence of our competitors. We observe, learn from, and adapt to ever shifting risks and opportunities.

&gt;You keep the upside, and you own the downside. [You have skin in the game.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase))

Perhaps I paint an intolerably cheery landscape? Or present a heady combination of naivety and rose tinted spectacles? Using our imaginary market square, we could easily point out the potential flaws; it is undirected and loosely regulated, for sure. It most likely attracts petty criminality, and crude attempts at tax avoidance. Independent traders are not always bastions of sound finance and clean conduct. Yet by and large, this scene, and countless others across the world, have sustained themselves through thick and thin, peace and war, feast and famine.

Commerce is a dynamic creature. It responds to the innovation and ideologies of each era. We try to throttle, tame and subdue with numerous attempts at holding back the tide. Think five year plans, industrial quotas, price controls, restrictive labour laws, and collective farming. The list is endless.

On the other hand, we are at times **in thrall to its power**. We stray from the ancient ideals, and request too little skin in the game. Too big to fail comes to mind. We let it run wild, with the inevitable hangover that follows; ask Lehman Brothers or Royal Bank of Scotland how that feels. Yet we can never, ever truly humble or fatally discredit commerce, no matter how hard we try. Why? Because it accords with and complements the core of human nature. Commerce, as a way of life, will always attract followers.

So where does commerce stand today, at this digitalised, hyper capitalist juncture? The fuel that powers our modern economy, the internet itself, is ironically not a product of our beloved commerce. We have the Cold War and the [United States Department of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) to thank for that. [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), as the father of our World Wide Web, was motivated by neither vast fortune or great fame. Yet, without commercial endeavour, his creation may well have remained a narrow, academic pursuit; a provincial experience cherished by science, mathematics and engineering, but of limited interest elsewhere.

Instead, our online world has reached out and touched nearly all aspects of our daily lives. It has eclipsed and displaced such large areas of physical transaction, in such a short time, that it is easy to forget or truly appreciate the scale of change. Software, as predicted, [has eaten the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). We have shifted our expectations, and no longer take much notice of the revolution.

&gt;🚿 The internet is now a public utility, like fresh water, electricity and public transport. In theory, we have the perfect platform for thriving independent commerce.

**Something is amiss, however.** The barriers to entry for potential traders have collapsed, permitting anyone with a screen, and a Wi-Fi connection, to access and ply their wares in the greatest market square ever built. In practice, we are still dominated by just a handful of big names from Silicon Valley. This in part reflects the quality of their service offering. You cannot deny that, for all their many faults, Google, Amazon and Facebook, amongst other big beasts have provided compelling value. Yet we must not cede complete control of our greatest liberating force to their private interests.

It reflects a wider malaise. Free market capitalism, as espoused by the west, has been limping along in recent years. It is suffering from a tough ten year bout of indigestion, following an overindulgence beyond anything we have attempted at Christmas. Take a look at the menu.

We start with a plate of deindustrialisation, Gordon Gekko and labour offshoring. Then it is a meaty main consisting of financialisation, credit binges, an epic asset bubble and a side dish of digital disruption. To finish, we have an extra sticky and sugary dessert topped with quantitative easing, negative interest rates and corporate bailouts. No wonder it needs to lie down and take a nap.

There is a serious point to all of this. The distortions, inequalities and monopolies introduced and sustained by such indigestion carry very real, existential threats. Life has been pretty damn good for the globalised, metropolitan classes of Manhattan and the City of London. It has been very generous to unprofitable ‘tech’ darlings and zombie companies. High on the hog of ultra-loose liquidity, sovereign wealth funds and unicorn valuations, it is rather easy to dominate markets and avoid commercial reality. It is also very easy to ignore the fragile, crumbling foundations of globalised capitalism. It is the epitome of our modern [gilded age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age).

Outside of these lucky circles, our disenfranchised communities, stripped of their industrial pride, and told to get on their bikes, are beginning to take action. [Make America Great Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again) is not so deplorable when viewed from the Rust Belt. [Take Back Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_Leave) is not quite the xenophobic rallying cry so often portrayed in prosperous Islington, or educated Edinburgh.

&gt;We are witnessing the emergence of a new cultural, political and economic framework, the outcome of which is very much up for grabs.

**The scenario outlined above just so happens to coincide with Act III of the internet's story.**

* 🏗 Act I was about creation and emergence.
* 📈 Act II was about revolution and dominance.
* 🔑 Act III must be about ownership, if nothing else.

Commerce, as it has done so throughout history, will play a pivotal role. As things stand, we are so familiar with the current online landscape that it feels permanent; yet change is afoot.

The direction of travel is clear. The online experience is becoming more granular and less generic. Small business, representing the backbone of commerce, can and should take full advantage of the supply chains, logistical networks, cloud computing, service expectations and technical skillsets forged in the FAANG era. Those legacies, coupled with low coding trends, challenger banks and new payment solutions, provide commercial activity an opportunity, at all levels, to truly flourish in this next phase of our digital age.

It is this, rather than any government intervention, that will promote the re-invigoration of our neglected regions, depressed market towns and the gradual reorientation of the wider economy. Commerce can bring back a sense of pride, connection and institutional knowledge cast aside and lost to these areas for many years.

We should help nurture a new generation of local, browser based businesses. This will in turn support healthier, confident, and secure communities. It will represent the final rejection of an economic framework that is long past its use-by date.

personalfinance,Where to put available funds next?,"So hubby and I are in our mid 40s.  How that happened, I have no idea, but here we are.

We live in an area where wages are low, but cost of living has also been low (although it is rising quickly) and we have no kids and live frugally in a DINK lifestyle.  We've reached the point we have some extra money each month I'm looking to put somewhere and I'm looking for advice and feedback.

Current situation:

We own a house that will be paid off in about 5 years.  No plans to ever move.  We built the house, so it is relatively new and in excellent condition still.  We'll probably need to do some larger maintenance items like flooring and A/C in the next 5 years, but are prepared for that.

We own 2 old, but low mileage cars in excellent condition.  I'm hoping we don't have to replace either for a few more years, but have $20k saved in CDs as a car fund earning about 3%.

We max our 2 Roth IRAs each year, and neither of us currently have access to a 401k at our jobs, unfortunately.

Our emergency savings account is fully funded for 10-12 month's expenses.

We currently have about $200k+ saved for retirement.  We currently spend only about $25k/year and once our house is paid off, that will drop to about $15k (not including medical insurance or expenses, so there's that variable), in both cases, that is estimating high.  Actual average expenses for the last 5 years have been between $20-22k, and the mortgage will knock off $9k when the P&amp;I is paid off.    

We average about $55-60k gross a year total household income, so ballpark $45k take home.

So at this point, we generally have about $20k left over each year after hard costs.  $12k of that goes into the Roth IRAs.  I don't really want to pay down the house early, as my interest rate is low.  We have no other remaining debt.

I don't want to invest in real estate, for multiple reasons, primary of which is that any inheritance I may receive will be in that form, and I'd like to diversify.  Secondarily, I've worked in that industry for 20 years, and while I know it can be profitable, because it's been my career, it will feel like I'm still working and is a headache I don't want.

Right now, I have about $10k to put somewhere and will have say $5k-10k a year additional to put somewhere, more after the house is paid off.  I'm assuming at this point, my best option is going to be non-tax advantaged stock market of some kind, but at this point, I'm entering into the region of not knowing enough to make intelligent choices, or honestly even ask intelligent questions.  And I'm definitely not a gambler or day trader.  I don't want to pick individual stocks.  I'm ok with moderate risk, but I'd like something I can just dollar cost average my money into, check on once a year, and otherwise ignore.  

Alternately, my biggest question mark about retiring early is unforeseeable medical expenses.  Are there any long term tax advantaged accounts to save for future years medical expenses? Not necessarily just retirement age, as we're looking at retiring early.  My only experience with HSA type accounts have all been ""use it or lose it"" type.

I guess my question is, what sort of accounts should I be looking into at this point?  Like, I don't even know what terms to start googling to educate myself.  Someone please point me in some research directions.",finance

personalfinance,Need Advice on Possible Forced Refinance,"Purchased new home in July 2018 with HomeStyle renovation loan. Home purchase price was $265k, 30yr conventional fixed rate loan at 5.125%, loan amount $307k with $74/month PMI. Appraised value after renovations was $325k. Current loan balance is $299k.

Original mortgage lender sold loan immediately after closing and have been with same mortgage servicer since July 2018. Account current, no missed or late payments.

Three weeks ago, received call from original mortgage lender advising that they were being forced to buy back loan from current mortgage lender due to fraudulent appraisal. Per copy of letter provided, current mortgage company indicates appraiser used properties outside of boundary (5+ miles away) and properties not comparable to home looking to purchase (larger lots, more SF, on basement, etc.). Therefore, feel our home was over valued. Gave original mortgage lender 60 days to appeal which they lost.

Original mortgage company is indicating that our loan can no longer be backed by Fannie Mae and is not sellable as is. Therefore, they want us to refinance so they can resell loan as they are not setup to service the loan. They advised that they would cover all costs associated with refinance due to this situation being their fault.

Prior to ordering new appraisal, they ran credit and offered a 30yr conventional loan with lender paid PMI at interest rate of 3.75%. However, the loan amount was $308,500 due to closing costs and escrow being added. We questioned why any closing costs such as origination fee, title fee, appraisal fee, etc. were included as these should be covered by them but were advised that they could not legally cover these expenses.

First appraisal completed and we were advised appraisal came in below our current loan balance of $299k (no copy provided to review). They indicated that they reached out to the appraisal company who advised a second appraisal was warranted so another one was ordered.

The second appraiser came to our home three days later and it was the same appraiser who completed the original appraisal in 2018. She said she remembered the house and asked what we were doing, selling or refinancing. We explained what was going on and everything that had transpired to that point. She indicated, “Ok, I know what I need to do now”.

The original mortgage company rep advised that the new appraisal has come back at $308k which is the same as the loan amount for the 30yr conventional lender paid PMI loan they originally offered. He said that since they can only lend up to 95% value of the home, we would no longer qualify for the conventional loan and instead, they want us to refinance under an FHA loan. They’ve now offered a 30yr FHA loan at 2.5% with PMI of $211/month with a loan amount totaling $306,338. This loan estimate includes approximately $5,200 for mortgage insurance premium (2 years), about $2,479 in closing costs and $2,052 for escrow.

Before we move forward, we have several questions/concerns:

1.) Can we be forced to refinance if we don’t want to or if the terms are not favorable?

2.) What costs can/should the lender cover, considering this would be a refinance and it’s a situation of their own making due to issue with appraisal they ordered on original loan?

3.) We’re concerned that the same appraiser from 2018 is the one who completed current appraisal being used for refinance. Still think they may be over valuing property and don’t want to be in same situation again in 2 months or 2 years if mortgage is sold.",finance

personalfinance,I have a very specific situation and would love adxive for my best course of action.,"To start, i understand budgeting and saving money and investing and such. I am an intelligent and receptive individual. I have made mistakes that are costing me financially and have set me back quite a bit. I want to move forward and get debt free as fast as possible. So here we go.

I currently work as a casino card dealer. Working full tim i make roughly 60 thousand dollars every year (america) before tax. I live in Washington state so i only pay federal taxes. After taxes that breaks down to around 4000$/month.

My current debt is as follows: 3 credit cards. #1 is 6500$ (200$/month) #2 is 5800$ (175$/month) #3 is 3800$ ( i pay 200$/month because my phone automatically charges to that card.
One personal loan: 245$/month
Car and insurance: 500$/month

My other monthly expenses are 650$ rebt (i have a roomate)
100$/month for dog food
80$/ month for internet
100$&gt; for electric
100$&gt; for gas
250$&gt; for food
100$&gt; personal hygiene, toilet paper, etc.

This breaks down to around 2700$/ month.

Now i understand that leaves ample room to make extra payments, which i have been doing. The reason im posting is because i made a very foolish mistake, which i do not remember doing. I got a dui/hit and run on a fence. The lawyer fee is going to be 6000$. Deoending on the outcome i could be paying anywhere from 2500$ to 5000$ in fines. 

What i need advice on is how do get out of debt as fast as humanly possible. I want to buy a house as soon as my debt is eliminated so bankruptcy is not something i truly want to entertain, nor anything else that will damage my credit score. Speaking of which, my credit score is currently in the low 600's due to credit utilization. I have never had a late payment. 

I know the basics, dont spend anything i dont need to, pay off higher interest debt as a priority to limit new debt being accrued. What i need to know is everything else i can do to pay this all of as fast as i can without harming my future home buying potential. 

Bonus points if anyone has any advice concerning DUI's as i have not been to trial yet. I work night shifts so puboic transportation is not an option and an uber to and from work is an additional 40$/ day or 800$/ month.

Sorry for the long ass post. I am very focused on my goals and see no point in beating my head against the wall over my past mistakes. I can only move forward and i greatly appreciate all the help i can get. Thank you.",finance

My current plan is to pay the minimum payments until I have a bit of a rainy day fund (small 2-3 month living expenses) set up which should only take another month or two, and then I will be throwing all my money at my credit card debt to pay that off because the interest rate is ridiculous. I'm asking currently about the mattress because there is no interest rate on it, and the minimum monthly payment is $90 in 6 years. Is it wiser to pay that off as quickly as my income would allow? Or should I pay the credit card debt, and then save more in my rainy day fund, and eventually invest all while just making minimum payments on the mattress, because regardless of how long it will take to pay it off, It will still only be the initial $6000.

personalfinance,Opening another fixed deposit with the previous interest included,"Hello! This might come off as a stupid question. I am sorry if it is, I am not particularly well-educated in financial matters.

Say my bank offers 1-month fixed deposits with an interest rate of 0.5%. So after one month of not touching, say, my 100 dollars invested in that deposit, I will have $100.5.

What stops me from opening another 1-month fixed deposit with those $100.5, so that, after the 2nd month, I will possess $101.0025 - instead if $100.1 if I had simply extended my initial deposit (the interest I earn is redirected to my current account, and not the deposit). Thus, after one year and 12 consecutive deposits opened, I would possess 106.16 dollars instead of 106. Is there anything illegal about this? If not, why don't people do this more often - virtually signing up for a compound interest instead of a fixed one?

investing,[Real Estate] Is it irresponsible to not lever up in such a low interest rate environment?,"Hello bears of /r/investing,

We're looking to buy our first home and were debating how much we should spend on it. I wanted to ask /r/investing to put on their macro hats and predict RE prices for us.

Current rates for a 30y fixed mortgage:

High balance mortgages: 2.875% (up to ~850k in home price w/ 20% down)

Jumbo: 3.25% (850k+)

Given inflation at 2% and is probably going to continue at about that rate or go higher, is levering up the responsible thing to do? Interest rates are a mere 0.8% over inflation so it's basically free money.

The fed / govt seem intent on keeping the economy going and ideas like MP3 (Monetary policy 3) are being bandied about. Absent structural change to the world order itself, it seems like the US can basically print trillions of dollars without much consequence and they *will* print + spend to get out of this recession.

So if we're not predicting a great depression esque doom and gloom scenario, what's going to happen to asset prices specifically RE?

ASSETS

Salary: $90k + $5-10k annual bonus

Interest Rate: 3.1%

Mortgage Payment including property Tax, Interest, Insurance: $1500


Down payment is comprised of $130k from condo sale + $95k cash = $225k



Add in $15k for furniture and projects, I would end up with:

$65k in cash savings/emergency fund 

$1500 monthly payment on a $7500-$8000 monthly gross income

$3200 total expenses per month including mortgage, health insurance, utilities, car insurance, car maintenance, cell phones, groceries etc

No car payments, no CC debt

I feel like this checks the boxes for DTI, income:mortgage and other rules of thumb, mostly due to the 50% down payment 

I plan to continue aggressively saving for retirement with remaining monthly funds.

There are a few folks suggesting to pay smaller down payment to keep more cash — one other thing to note for my assets is that I own about $25,000 worth of guitars and collectibles, all of which are in high demand and fairly quick to move. This was part of my rationale around such a large down payment. I would still have $65k+ in cash, $25k in collectibles, and another $40k in Roth IRA money that could be accessed in cash without penalty.

I plan to put a total of $65k towards Loan #1 within the next month. This money is coming from my father's gift and my current savings. The reason why I want to pay off loan #1 first is because it is private and doesn't have as good benefits like forbearance like the federal loans do. Currently, I'm extremely determined to save as much money as I can and live as frugally as possible so that I can pay off these loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement

\- $11k in ROTH 401k contributing 5% of every paycheck.

\- $12K in Traditional 401k that is the 5% employer match (this is the max my employer will match)

I'm contributing just enough to get the employer match and no more because I want to put my money towards paying off my loans. I haven't done much research on what would be the best way to save for retirement. Should I maximize my ROTH 401k contribution? Should I start a ROTH IRA as well? I remember hearing something along the lines of the IRS allows you to contribute up to $19,500 for the 401k and $6,000 for the IRA per year. Should I save a good chunk of money, put it into an index fund and let it sit? The pros of having more money in an index fund would be that I would be able to withdraw it whenever I want unlike the 401k/IRA.

I'm relocating to my home town (5 hrs away) for a job and to be closer to family.  My wife and I are familiar with the town and are wanting to buy a house.  We have enough for a down payment and getting a new house is not contingent on selling our current house.

investing,It is a Crowded Market,"Investors love index funds, yet they have no idea how over-concentrated the major equity indices are in a handful of stocks. When major equity indices are overweight a small number of stocks, it usually signals the end of a Bull market. Today, the major equity indices are more concentrated in a small number of stocks than they have at prior Bull market peaks.

Take the largest S&amp;P 500 ETF, symbol SPY, an investible index that matches the S&amp;P 500. The top ten holdings of SPY make up more than 27% of the ETF, while the top six holdings, which comprises of five companies, is nearly 22% of the index. It is even worse for the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100.

Take the largest Nasdaq-100 ETF, symbol QQQ, an investible index that matches the Nasdaq-100. The top ten holdings of QQQ make up more than 54% of the ETF, while the top six holdings, which comprise of five companies, is more than 46% of the index.

To make matters worse, the top six holdings, which comprises of five companies, in both indices, are the same companies: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (or Google). The combined market cap of Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon is equal to twenty percent of the U.S. GDP.

Ninety percent of all stocks are owned by fifty percent of all households, meaning the wealth of half of U.S. households is concentrated in five companies. Fifty percent of all stocks are owned by ten percent of all households, meaning the wealth of the wealthiest U.S. households is concentrated in five companies. The future of our country is tied to five companies. Five companies.

While investors are starry-eyed and see a major Fed-supported Bull market in their futures, no Bull market in history has occurred with a high concentration in the major equity indices to such a small number of companies. When the inevitable Bear market strikes and investors finally decide to sell their index funds, everyone will be selling the same five stocks.

The attacks on Chinese stocks listed on US markets have accomplished what 10 years of growth after the financial collapse have failed to: China is decoupling from US markets and starting to drive world growth on its own.

Analysts are beginning to acknowledge that driving China stocks from US markets can't stop China's growth.

Our current market in the US is clearly one that is based on unlimited federal debt and equity bubbles, as the US hasn't managed its COVID-19 epidemic issues effectively, and global investors are now shifting focus to China and Europe. The threats against US-listed Chinese stocks opened my eyes, and probably also focused other people's attention, on the fact that it's not that hard for global small investors, including those in the U.S., to find other ways to invest in Chinese stocks than the handful of Chinese stocks listed on US exchanges. By opening the doors to global investors for investing in Chinese stocks without the US-listed China ADRs, some of the money lifting US stock markets that was actually being invested in Chinese stocks is now going directly to Chinese stock exchanges.

I don't think it's possible for the US to reverse the Pandora's box that it has opened, pushing investors to buy directly on Chinese exchanges at a time when the growth story for investors in 2020 and for the next few years that is actually based on real market fundamentals, is China and those countries that maintain strong business ties with China.

Starting today, I'm going to be calling my broker and buying China and Euro stocks directly on foreign exchanges, as I feel US stocks are being inflated and they are topped out for now until some actual growth takes hold to support their valuations and there's a limit as to how much the fed can do to simulate stability. I am going with a gut feeling that any further growth in US stocks from here on out are simply unsustainable bubble territory so long as the US can't demonstrate any ability to reverse the contraction of its GDP due to COVID-19.

personalfinance,What's the catch? - My mortgage lender is offering a refinance offer to cut off 7 years and an interest rate cut.,"Hello,

My mortgage company recently reached out to me and said they were wondering if I was interested in refinancing.  Clearly, the first thing that comes to mind is that they are looking to make money, so I am cautious.  They said if I refinanced from my current 30yr to a 20yr loan (so cutting 7 years off my current loan) and dropping my interest rate from 4.125% to 2.875%.  It would result in my total monthly expenses going up by $16, but I'd be saving 7 years of payments.

I mentioned this to a coworker and that while I can easily afford the closing costs I didn't wanna go spending that much now since I'm hoarding money a bit atm.  He said that he found that many lenders are also offering ""lender credits"" to make closing costs basically $0 or very low.  

My current LTV is (79%), and after refinancing it would go to 81%.  Based on my after-tax income, my housing cost is only about 19% of my monthly take home pay, so I do have room.

Another problem is that my wife and I are considering moving to another state next year (assuming pandemic goes away or as soon as it ends whenever that is) and it almost seems like wasted effort to refinance so soon.

My last question is... there has to be a catch somewhere here?  This is sounding awfully close to the ""too good to be true"" adage here to me.  The lenders have to be making money somewhere here (especially if they offer 0 or near 0 closing costs)",finance

Some details for my situation, I live in the northeast United States and my home has gone up in value about 50k since I purchased it 3 years ago and I also believe interest rates are about 1% lower right now than my current rate. We have a good emergency fund and have some money in savings that we usually use for vacations and since that is not happening this year we thought improving our home with a deck would be nice. That obviously costs much more than a standard vacation. Ideally I want to try and get the deck started this fall, I've heard you can sometimes get good deals if you can get the holes dug and concrete poured before the ground freezes and then they can do the work over the winter which is a much less busy time for construction here.

because they would always waive the $5000 limit on mobile deposits whenever I needed them to. Lately, they have been saying they aren’t allowed to raise the limit because of federal law (as opposed to corporate policy).

Before I flat out threaten to open a local account at PenFed and close my account of almost two decades unless they raise my limit, I’d like to make sure there aren’t, in fact, any laws restricting mobile deposit size or any reason why Cap1 would have stricter rules about mobile deposits than random credit union.",finance

personalfinance,"Bought house in March, realized we can't affordably save and live modestly while living here – what do we do?","**Context**: My wife and I bought a house in March, 2020 with a VA Loan \[30 years\] for approximately $390,000.00 at an interest rate of 2.875%. Our mortgage payment is $1975.00 per month and currently we have no issues making this payment.

**Our Dilemma:** Due to a number of circumstances including my wife's high-paying but incredibly stressful job basically killing her day in and day out, our long term plans for savings, us trying to have children, etc. we've realized we've bit off more than we can chew. We've realized to assuage a lot of these things, we need to live in a more modest home with a cheaper mortgage.

**What now?:** Our house has risen in value to roughly 5k more than what we owe. We were considering try to sell it as soon as possible while the market is still great in this area \[who knows what will happen with the economy and market at this point\] – but after considering we'd have to pay 6% for the realtor feeds we would end up coming out pretty signficantly behind which would eat heavily into our savings.

**Advice?:** I guess my question is: what should we do? Currently we've settled on trying to make this work as long as we financially can. If we can make it 3-5 years into the house, we will have paid off enough of the mortgage to recoup our closing costs and still walk away with some profit, but this is assuming the market doesn't fall apart. Is the smart thing to do to try and sell, wait, and if wait – how long should we wait?

**TL:DR:** We bit off more than we can chew with our mortgage, we can afford it – but it's not working how we'd like. If we sell now, due to realtor fees, we would come out behind, but are also putting less into savings and not living the best way we possibly can. What's best course of action?

$1;010 with conventional.  Interest rate should be 2.9%

Welp looking through my paperwork again, settlement is next week.  I originally thought that was fine because even when PMI would come off then the conventional would be like 950...

But they on the estimates did not include mortgage insurance on USDA but did for conventional.  So really USDA will be like 1010-1015 always (1% fee for life of loan).  So now not sure if that's even worth doing USDA.  And closing is supposed to be next week but probably is going to be pushed back. 

Extremely irritated right now as we talked about the differences multiple times and how USDA would be lower.  Wondering if that .2% would make it worth it.",finance

personalfinance,Checking my math on a sell vs rent decision,"A number of years ago I bought a condo as my primary residence.  Rentals for similar condos were ~2400 a month, so I wanted to a similar mortgage payment so if I ever decided to rent it out I would break even.

2 years ago, I had gotten a number of raises and the interest rates had dropped.  I decided to drop the loan down to 20 years and pay a bit of principal so it would be paid off sooner, though my mortgage amount raised to 2,800.  This was well within my means so it didn't bother me paying an extra 400/month.

Shortly after my refinance, I went to a full time remote position, so decided to move to a much lower cost of living area.  I now have a 15yr loan on my new primary residence.  I decided to rent out the old place at the expected 2,400 a month.  Even though I was taking a ~400 a month hit, I was rapidly paying down the the principal.  As a current 32 yr old, the condo would of been paid of by 50 and started generating ~1600 a month in income (rent minus HOA/taxes/insurance/buffer for repairs).  I was fine with that 400 hit over the next 18 yrs as it is not a significant portion of my income.

With the market today, I currently do not have a tenant and as I speak with realtors and managers in the area the rental market is extremely cold and likely would have to drop the rent to 2,000 a month for at least the next year.  I have no issue floating the mortgage, but wanted to explore other ideas.

Speaking with the realtors, while the market for renting is cold the rental for selling is still competitive due to lack of inventory in the zip code.

Based on comps in the area, the expected home price is now 430-450k.  Even at the lowest end, I'd take home 410k (minus 4.5 realtor fees, the standard for the area (I assumed 6, but had multiple sources tell me 4.5 due to redfin competition and also a break as the selling realtor is a friend)).  Still owed is 299k, so I'm looking at 111k take home.  Since I lived there 2/5 years I would not pay taxes on the profit (cost basis around 350k).

So lets assume 100k (maybe some closing cost help, plus I like round numbers).

My math looks like:
Rent:
2000 rent, 800 mortgage difference for next 18 years - 1600 income after the 18 yrs (""forever"") plus a ~450k asset (that I would have to pay taxes on if I go to sell).

Sell:
100k+9,000 a yr invested - 433k (avg 4% return), 493k (5%), 563k (6%), 643k (7%).

4% return would give me 22 yrs of 1600 a month, 7% would give me 33 years.

My plan is to retire at 50 (401k, Roth IRA and additional taxable investment account not shown here).

So while taking the hit now seems to be a good long term move it is also far riskier (vacancies and repairs throw a bit into the numbers).

I'm leaning towards selling, any opinions on convincing me otherwise?",finance

Just not sure how to calculate this, to see the different effects on the loan.

personalfinance,Selling long position early to avoid capital gains tax,"I currently have a long term stock investment that has risen in value by just under $40k.  I'm a full time student, so I'm not expecting to have any other income for the rest of the year.  I have read that the 0% capital gains tax bracket is 0-40K.  Its possible that my position might rise above $40k before the end of the year. 

 Is it possible/advisable to sell my positions and then buy them back the next day to lock in the profit under $40k so I only pay 0% federal capital gains tax?  This would also mean that if my position goes down after this, I might be able to use the losses against possible future income from other sources.  It feels slightly amoral.

Also, I'm a US citizen living outside the US, so I assume I would file in the state I was last a resident in, so there would also be some state state tax involved.  I'm also wondering if I would be liable for taxes in the country I'm currently living in (Germany), even though the position is held in a US bank on a US stock exchange.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing advice?,"OK I am looking for advice on understanding some of this information.  I first went to my original lender for a possible refinance.  Here is what I am working with.


Original loan - $127,153.00 - 30 years FHA

Current balance - $116,574.62 - 4 years into loan

Current annual interest rate - 3.750 %

Yearly taxes - $2,977.58

Yearly homeowner's insurance - 	$1,247.00


Total monthly payment of $1,130.88 (recently changed home insurance last month dropping $1000.00 a year so expecting a change soon?)


Back to the meat of my question.  Moving to conventional (estimated home value of $145,000.00) and dropping PMI ($82.62 monthly), rep told me my ""real"" interest rate as of today is actually 4.6% as PMI is technically part of it at 0.85% of loan.   So they would refinance me to a ""real"" 3.75% with an APR of 4.153% (what does this mean?).  30 year would take total payment down to $999 monthly from $1130.00.  Principle would increase to $125,000.00 which equates to roughly $9k in closing costs of which he states includes taxes, insurance and prepaid interest?



Can someone break this down how that is a good deal for me?  I am simply looking to take advantage of the rates now as our credit has improved along with our financial goals.  Not where I want but we are getting there.  Sorry for the confusion in all this just trying to get a better grasp on things.

&gt;A rally in the shares of Square Inc. over the past few months has pushed the market valuation of the digital-payment company into the ranks of some of the biggest U.S. banks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square has a market capitalization of about $55 billion after doubling since May, making it worth more than Truist Financial Corp. and all but four banks in the KBW Bank Index. While it’s still dwarfed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp., Square is less than $20 billion shy of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s market valuation, which stands at $74 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square is now worth more than Truist Financial after doubling since May  
&gt;  
&gt;Square shares have continued to set records in recent weeks as optimism swells over the growth of digital payments, and as the coronavirus pandemic changes consumer and corporate spending behavior.The San Francisco-based company has benefited in particular from positive sentiment about its popular cash app, its handling of pandemic-related government stimulus payments and its ability to garner deposits from traditional banks with fewer digital offerings.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Technology stocks have soared this year, while banks have sunk.** The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has gained 21% and the KBW Bank Index has fallen 35%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square rallied as much as 13% on Monday after an analyst suggested it could eventually win as much as 20% of U.S. direct deposit accounts.

I mean, in almost every single factsheet of any investment fund you can read the phrase ""past performance is not indicative of future results"", which is a warning for investors to not simply extrapolate past performance (too far) into the future without any further thought or without properly analyzing what you are investing in. But this standard warning is taken completely out of context all the time on investment forums such as this one.

In fact, the past is the single most important source of information that we could possibly use to analyze investments, because the past is all we have information about.

personalfinance,"I was deceived about my financial situation, now I have $80k in student loans","So all of my life my parents raised me with the expectation that they would pay for my college (which was an opportunity I recognized I was very lucky to have). This was something I kept in mind when applying for colleges. I ended up settling on KU, which was out of state for me but had great opportunities for pre-med students (I wanted to be a doctor at the time). 

During my first semester of college, my parents paid out of pocket as expected. Things changed the following semester, however. They told me that they would be taking out a loan so that instead of paying the tuition all at once like the school required, they could pay off the loan over the course of the semester instead. They explained to me that the loan would also be in my name, as well as my Dad's, but it would just be a way for me to build some credit along the way (keep in mind, at the time I knew practically nothing about loans, and didn't really know what questions to ask). 

Fast-forward to the end of junior year, I find out that they have been taking out a loan in my name every semester with my dad as the cosigner, and they had not made *any* payments toward the loans this entire time. I then find out it's because my dad took a 50% pay cut when he had to switch jobs. My parents are very tight-lipped about their finances, so this was the first time I had learned of this. Anyways, this shift in our financial situation was never explained to me, which frustrated me because it was a change that impacted me as well. To make matters worse, I never got a say/asked about my preferences for what kind of loans were being taken out. My parents never wanted to fill out a FAFSA because they thought ""we made too much to be given anything,"" so they went the route of private loans instead. They went through Sallie Mae and took out their ""smart loans,"" which have a 12% interest rate. I wanted to see what my situation was, so after getting the login for Sallie Mae from my parents, I was alarmed to see I had already accrued $80K of debt in total. 

For my senior year, I am handling all of the loans, and I made my parents fill out the FAFSA with me. My only issue is, I don't know what life looks like for me after I have to start making payments. I recently decided that I want to teach instead of going to medical school, which means I'll now be making significantly less than I was planning on. To make matters worse, I still have to get certified as a teacher before I can start my career, which will take an additional 2 years after I graduate with a BS in Biochemistry.

This entire situation has really frustrated me and left me feeling hopeless. I don't even know how to begin chipping away at all of this debt. My question to you all is: what can I be doing to make this debt more manageable?

Edit: just wanted to add, I'm not trying to mention my parents not telling me this stuff simply as an excuse. It's 100% my problem. Just thought that the added context may help.",finance

personalfinance,what to do in these current economic times when it comes to a house. Help an accountant out please,"Alright, it's oddly apropos and true. I am in fact an Accountant, and I really have no idea what to do with my money...

This is my Quandary :

I currently have a mortgage on my property for just a spit over 102K, and outside of that only about 17K in Auto/Student Loan Debt. I am currently sitting on about 25K savings in the bank - give or take.

Current interest rates are pretty great right now for Refi's, so naturally I want to jump on the band wagon here and save some money, but my current rate was fixed at 4.5% only 5 years ago, so I might be able to save about $50 a month with a Refinance...Finding a lender that wants to bother with a loan as small as mine without a significant term change (Drop to 15 Year) or with a cash out option hasn't been easy. Quicken Loans only seemed interested in actually increasing my payments by $250 to go to a 15 year term...Definitely worth it, but man does that tap into our weekly savings currently and who knows if i could afford that in the future.

So assuming I find a Lender that wants to entertain the idea of doing a Refi on such a small loan...What should I do with my Debt/Savings?

\- Current Mortgage Payment - $550

\- Auto Payment - $250

\- Student Loans - $360

1.) Do I pay off my Debt using my savings and say to heck with the Refi and just enjoy the Extra $610 a month?

2.) Do I Refi my mortgage and do a Cash Out Option for the amount of my debt and walk away with a higher Mortgage Payment for a 30 Year Term but hold onto my savings? What about a Cash Out Option with a 15 Year Term, again still holding onto my savings?

3.) Do I pay off my Debt with cash and Refi to save $50 or Refi to 15 Years and use the extra 610 in monthly savings to offset the cost of a higher mortgage payment? I feel like knocking down the overall length of the loan sounds really smart, but I worry my financial stability might change - Living through a recession and Job Loss has definitely made me uneasy over the thought of higher monthly liabilities - still an option if the reward offsets the risk.

Decisions...Decisions...Help me reddit, I need some ""This is what I did"" kind of advice. Something that makes one of these options make the most sense for what I can afford now and in the future. I think at the end of the day, no matter what, I want the Debt gone - 600 bucks a month is a total waste to pay monthly when I could easily just pay it off and be done with it.",finance
personalfinance,I Broke the Student Loan Repayment Calculator,"\*ALSO POSTED IN /r/StudentLoans\*

Looking for advice... I don't know who else may be in the same boat, but I have over $100k in student debt and have been paying nelnet on an income-based repayment plan for the last 5 years since I've been out of school. Since that time (and making the minimum payment on my IBR plan each month), my total student loan balance has only increased to the tune of around $20k. I am motivated to pay back the loans sooner rather than later and am ready to get more aggressive with my repayment. I have seen refinancing options lately with interest rates \~2% and I'm tempted to refinance my loans, however, I fear losing out on the benefits of the IBR plan:

(1) Having the remaining balance of my loans forgiven after another 15-20 years (which I would have to pay taxes on the amount forgiven).

(2) Keeping my required monthly payment low / manageable in case of unprecedented situations where I might not be able to afford a higher monthly payment amount during certain times(COVID-19 anyone?)

(3) Taking advantage of any bones the government decides to throw to student borrowers as a result of situations like COVID-19 or in the wake of the next election.

I have tried to figure out the best options for paying down my debt faster using several online loan repayment calculators, but I have so many loans (13+) that none of the calculators can handle that much information, leaving me frustrated and in need of advice elsewhere. I have thought about consolidating through nelnet, however, it seems that I would lose the progress I have made in the last 5 years toward my IBR plan. So if anyone is in a similar situation / has any advice on the matter, I would love to hear about it! TIA!",finance
stocks,Can someone convince me of why I should bother to learn fundamental analysis?,"I don't really see the point. Suppose you're an aggressive investor who's trying to make a lot of money quickly. You can use fundamentals to determine which companies are undervalued, buy them, and then wait for them to reach their full potential. But even if you've identified a stock that's undervalued, you don't know when it will actually start to rise by looking at fundamentals alone. Technical analysis determines when a stock will rise or fall. The purpose of technical analysis is pretty clear: to identify signals that a stock will go up before it actually does, and to identify when a stock has reached its peak so you can sell and maximize your gains.

But suppose you're a different type of investor. Instead of aggressively chasing gains, you want to make safe investments, hold them for long periods of time, and grow your money that way. But if that's your approach, I don't know why you would bother spending time researching fundamentals when you can just buy broad ETFs that will be safer than any one company, and are as close to a guarantee of long-run gains as you'll find.

All that I've said so far doesn't even address the current climate. We're in the middle of a deep recession that's only going to get worse as unemployment benefits run out and landlords are allowed to evict residents again. But in the middle of all this, the market is challenging all-time highs! It's pretty clear that we're in the middle of an asset bubble that's being inflated by the Federal Reserve's willingness to continue printing money without end. The upshot of this is that the market is completely divorced from fundamentals. In my research, I've come across rules like ""don't buy if the P/E ratio is above 20 because that means the stock is inflated."" But all the big stocks, AMZN, TSLA, and NFLX to name a few, have P/E ratios so high, they make a ratio of 20 look downright conservative. And they keep growing with no signs of slowing down.

To recap, fundamental analysis doesn't help you if you're looking to aggressively make money because it doesn't tell you when to buy. It doesn't help if you're trying to make safe investments and hold them, because broad ETFs are safer. And right now, stock prices have nothing to do with fundamentals. I don't get it. I know Warren Buffett and plenty of other millionaires made their money using fundamentals, so I'm more than willing to admit that they're right and I'm wrong if someone can make the case. But right now, I don't see why anyone should bother learning fundamentals.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Cashout Refi - Student Loan Payoff,"I am thinking about doing a cash-out refi on my current home in order to pay down student loan debt. Prior to pulling the trigger I wanted to get some general advice on my specific situation and would appreciate anyone's thoughts on the matter.

As a bit of background, my wife and I bought a house in an up and coming midwestern area about 4 years ago for 200k (180k mortgage with 3.75% interest rate). Since that time local property values have increased to the point our house is now conservatively worth 250k. I (unfortunately) also have over 100k in student loans at 6.5% interest that I am looking to pay off sooner rather than later. 

After discussing with a number of lenders, it looks as though we can refinance our current mortgage with the following general material terms:

1. Maintain 20% equity in home (so no PMI)
2. Interest rate of 3.375% (could buy down with points, but I do not want to do that)
3. Mortgage payment only increases $45/month due to lower interest rate and PMI falling off
4. $28,000 cash-out to pay down student loans (after rolling closing costs). This includes the escrow refund from my prior mortgage.

The goal (post-refi) would be to throw money at my loans with the goal of paying them off in the next 4-5 years.

Additional pertinent facts include the following:

1. My wife and I have a 6-month cash emergency fund already saved up. 
2. Gross household income is $150k+. Both our jobs (fortunately) look relatively stable at this point.
3. Student loans are all federal on a 25 year repayment plan. I am currently 14 months ahead on payments, and would be 3-4 years ahead after the above. If it was every really necessary / there was an emergency, I could stop paying my loans for a few months to increase cash flow. This is a big mental safety net for me, and as such I am not willing to lose it by refinancing my loans with a private lender.
4.  While I am no Dave Ramsey, I am relatively debt averse (exception being conservative mortgages). Having a plan to feasibly tackle my loans ASAP will do wonders for my mental state.

I understand that the ""con"" to the above is that I am turning non-secured debt into secured debt. If for some reason die my wife would be left with the increased mortgage whereas my student loans would be discharged in that instance. We are already evaluating life insurance options so hopefully that would mitigate any fallout in that instance (frankly I prefer not to think about that situation, because if I'm dead shit has really hit the fan anyway).

I think the above makes sense given my current situation, but would greatly appreciate any counter points.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to fix my credit. Student loans and collection.,"Hey everyone needed some guidance. So I’m trying to get approved for an auto loan and buy my first car as soon as possible. My first issue is a collection account for rent that I didn’t pay. I owed rent for Jan 2019 but I was due to leave for basic training March 2019 and used my orders to cut the lease before February. I couldn’t afford to pay the rent and was set on using my first check from the AF to pay it. Before I could it went into collections. I managed to set up a payment for a setter amount of $780 out of the $986. It’s due to be taken out of my account on the 8th, is this a good idea or should I go about it a different way? 

The next thing is my students loans. So I took out a loan for around $5,500 in 2014/2015 with FASFA. I ended up dropping after a year due to some legal issues that forced me to focus on paying legal fees and discouraged me from returning to school due to the circumstances surrounding my arrest. I ended up becoming homeless and my only focus was staying out of jail and eating. The loans went into collections of course and I did start a repayment plan with the company in 2018 when I got on my feet but I fell back into hard times when my roommate left me with the rent. It’s being reported that I have 4 accounts. Two with US Dept of Edu and FedLoan Services. My last two tax refunds were garnished. Do I get back in contact with the collection company and start paying monthly or save up for a pay to delete? 

I have a military star card that’s current on payments and it’s currently at 50% utilization but I’m going to drop it down to 30%.

So what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?

In my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.

But that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.

Companies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",finance

Bitcoin,The COVID19 / Bond Impact on Stocks and Crypto,"**Alex Wason and John Barry** | Mon Jul 06 2020

## The Federal Reserve Stimulus Leads to 0% Bonds

            On March 15th, the Federal Reserve started the first round of its stimulus plan to stabilize the tumultuous economic conditions caused by the country-wide shut down due to COVID19.  Significant was a $700 billion round of Quantitative Easing (QE) and the cutting of interest rates effectively to zero percent.  The reaction of the stock market and most asset classes was to continue its downward trend that had started in late February.  The Federal Reserve continued to make smaller policy changes during the next 8 days until March 23rd when it announced its “extensive new measures to support the economy”.  In short, the Fed is expanding its QE program announced on March 15th and will be making additional expansions in the future as needed.  This time Wall Street reacts positively, as March 23rd was the starting point of a historic bull run.

# The Breaking of the 60/40 Model

            The 60/40 model of portfolio allocation has been a traditional portfolio management strategy used for over 30 years.  The strategy states to put 60% of your funds into stocks and the remaining 40% into high quality bonds.  The philosophy behind this investment strategy is that by having your portfolio diversified this way, you won’t take a huge hit if your stocks go down because you’ll have returns from bonds to make up for it.  This is a strategy generally used by people with low risk tolerances, or people who don’t want to constantly keep their eyes on the markets.  Over the past few decades, the 60/40 model has demonstrated a good amount of success; however, there are many who believe the chances of this strategy continuing to function successfully into the future are very low.

            Both JP Morgan and Bank of America have released statements on the decline of the 60/40 portfolio.  JP Morgan strategists have stated “In the zero-yield world, which we think will be with us for years, bonds offer neither much return nor protection against equity falls,” referencing the fact that the majority of government bonds are trading at yields below 1%.  In a research note titled “The Death of 60/40” Bank of America strategists had this to say, “The challenge for investors today is that both of those benefits from bonds, diversification and risk reduction, seem to be weakening, and this is happening at a time when positioning in many fixed-income sectors is incredibly crowded, making bonds more vulnerable to sharp, sudden selloffs when active managers rebalance.”

            So, with diminishing trust and poor returns from bonds, many investors are looking for other assets to replace the 40% hole in their portfolios.  Many are increasing their percentage allocated to stocks in addition to investing in Gold and other metals as a protection against inflation.  Many investors are also looking to Bitcoin.

### Asset Reallocation Flowing from Bonds to Stocks

            The historical runup in stock prices, specifically for the tech heavy Nasdaq, started on March 23rd.  With the NAS100 index up close to 60% (from $6,584 to $10,616) in less than 3 months.  It's not showing any signs of slowing down.  In the opinion of QuantifyCrypto, the major reason for this is the flow of capital that would normally be going into bonds is now going into stocks.  Yes the Fed stimulus is positive, but can you say the market conditions are actually better for stocks when there is still uncertainty in the future?  While some stocks are fundamentally better due to COVID19, this is not true for most stocks.  The next chart shows the price movement of the NASDAQ 100 Index for 2020.

## Asset Reallocation to Cryptocurrency – When?

            When asked about the current demise of the 60/40 portfolio model, veteran investor Dan Tapiero stated there could be “nothing more bullish for gold and bitcoin,” and that we are in the midst of the “beginning of the end for \[government\] bonds as a functioning productive asset class. Traditional 60/40 portfolios will need to find a new defensive asset to replace a portion of the 40%.”  It seems that other players in the world of finance are saying similar things, hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC in May that Bitcoin is a “great speculation” and that he has one to two percent of his assets in Bitcoin.

            Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to have higher volatility than stocks.  Three days before the Federal Reserve started making its announcements, Bitcoin went down over 50% in a single day.  High volatility and a full price recovery continued in April and May, with Bitcoin closing on May 30th at \~$10,440.  Until this point, there had been a high correlation between the NASDAQ 100 and Bitcoin as shown in the chart below.

Since June 1st, Bitcoin has clearly lagged while stocks have continued their upward climb.  While Crypto has been stagnant and down since May, the fundamental picture has never been better:

* The Central Bank stimulus response is inflationary to Fiat currencies, this is positive for non-inflationary assets like gold and cryptocurrency.
* The lack of new funds moving into bonds is flowing into stocks. When the stock market advance slows or starts to decline, the flow into other assets classes will start to increase.
* The full deflationary impact of the Bitcoin halving still has not kicked in.
* Corporate adoption and use cases for cryptocurrency is accelerating (Future article).
* Before COVID occurred, 2020 was looking like a very strong year for Bitcoin and Altcoins. This price strength is likely to return.  

            As government bonds continue to trade with yields below 1%, it is safe to say that more and more people will be abandoning the traditional 60/40 strategy.  While it’s too early to determine what the new percent strategy will become, with Bitcoin presenting a clear solution to the problems with bonds and the diminishing value of cash, portfolio managers may very well be using cryptocurrency to solve their diversification requirement.

personalfinance,Mortgage qualification with mixed income (W2 and 1099-G),"I'm curious if anyone on here has gone through the mortgage approval process with mixed income types. My husband has a normal job with W2 income but I have somewhat unusual income in that I am a federally funded fellow and get paid a taxable stipend (1099-G income). We would like to buy while the rates are good and before our daughter starts public school so that we don't have to move her twice in 2-3 years. We might qualify for a very modest home (condo or townhouse) in our area on my husband's income alone but we live in a really expensive market and my income is substantial enough to make a big difference in our monthly income (about a 60% increase in income), which would allow us to purchase a long-term home. I am asking about this because I know some federally backed loans only allow W2 income despite the IRS saying I have a lot of taxable income. I was denied a car loan because I didn't have W2 income despite having a substantial stipend and a 5 year contract (something W2 employees basically never have).",finance

I'm planning on attending college this upcoming fall. Currently, my dad makes 51k a year but isn't willing to help me with school at all. As a student with a GED, I'm ineligible for most financial aid options my school offers and pretty much the majority of outside scholarships as well. Because of this, I've been trying to get loans. I finally got my dad to co-sign for me, but his credit is ruined from debts he incurred while married to my mother who is no longer in the picture at all, and he's been denied for basically every loan he's applied for. I just wanted to ask if anyone knows what other options I have. I don't really have any adults I could ask to co-sign or anything, so I don't know what else to do. If anyone has any advice on how to work out paying for school or how I can maybe find a loan I could apply for without my dad, I would really appreciate it.

personalfinance,How long into a mortgage does it not make sense to refinance? (Longer question below),"I understand that the goal of refinancing is to reduce the interest rate (to reduce total interest paid) and reduce the total monthly payment (to increase available cash), but this is often at the expense of increasing the duration of the loan. 

One thing I am not getting is regarding the ratio of interest to principle per payment. I understand that this ratio is pretty heavily weighted towards interest in the beginning of the loan and gradually shifts more towards principle as the years go on. So if you refinance you kind of go back to square one: paying more interest than principle per each payment than you were in your prior loan. 

So at some point wouldn't it be better for me to keep my existing partially completed loan than start a new one with a lower interest rate?

personalfinance,Where to invest extra mortgage payment,"We just refinanced to a 2.875% interest rate and to me it doesn't make sense to make extra payments at that rate. I have a 457b through Vanguard and was wondering if there is a way to make a couple lump sum extra payments annually or if there's a better way to invest that payment. The reason I ask is I pay half my mortgage every other week, so for the two times a year where I have an ""extra"" half a mortgage payment I would like to invest that (instead of diving the extra payment into 26 payments and investing that). Is it possible to dump an extra half mortgage payment into my 457b twice a year? Also, if I'm correct, I should make sure it ends up being half a mortgage payment after taxes, so it really should be a little more than half a mortgage payment since my 457b is pre-tax money.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully those questions make sense. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Why would my refinanced mortgage have a higher monthly payment?,"I'm looking at refinancing my mortgage to lower my monthly payment. I'm not taking out any equity in the home. I've made above the asked payment nearly every month for the past 2.5 years.  Interest rate is dropping from 3.85% to 2.99%.  They are tacking on Mortgage Insurance again, and asking for a higher escrow payment each month than they are under my current loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Loan: 149,000

Interest rate: 3.85%

Monthly Payment: 915

Term: 30 years (2.5 years into it today)

&amp;#x200B;

New Loan: 149,000

Interest rate: 2.99%

Estimated Monthly Payment: 968

Term: 30 years (will start back at 30 again).

&amp;#x200B;

All the people I talked to said I should expect a lower monthly payment by dropping nearly a full percentage point in interest rate, and going back to full 30 years, instead of down to 25. That did not happen. They are asking for a full $70 more per month for escrow, which I suppose would be adjusted again once they realize they don't need that much (though, they are the same people servicing my loan now, so they should know that already), but even then it would only bring my Monthly payment down to around $900. On top of that, they want to start charging me mortgage insurance again ($55) for the first 10 years. I did not have that under my original mortgage. If that's removed, then at least i'm around 855 (if they lower the escrow amount too).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this worth it? I was expecting hundreds of dollars to come off, not to potentially pay more.   The representative from the bank says I would save at least $11,000 grand in interest over the life of the loan, but if i'm extending the time it takes to pay it back, along with higher payments, is it worth not doing anything and just be out the $500 for an appraisal? I don't think i'll be in this house forever, and I only wanted to lower the monthly payments because I'm going back to school this fall, so more money to go to that than to the mortgage would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Some other information that's been requested. 

Closing Costs: 9,000 (including escrow)

But, general consensus is to not do this refinance. Thanks for everyone's quick responses!

personalfinance,Paying off car loan under my name vs my fathers,"My father took out a car loan for a vehicle in 2015. The car is registered under his name, but I (23M)  have been the primary driver.

personalfinance,Pay off or Pay Minimum and Invest?,"I have $213,000 in student loans. I am on a pay as you earn plan and currently make approximately $180,000 annually.

I am trying to figure out whether it would be better to pay down my loan balance to something like $130,000 and then refinance (I can get about 3.19% fixed) and try to pay off the loans in 5 to 10 years, or if it is better to continue investing and making minimum payments then taking the tax hit in the year when the loans are forgiven.

My parent's are pushing me (23F) to move out because my sister (28F) does not want to be a responsible adult.

personalfinance,Putting &lt;20% down on a home purchase,"I'm curious about others' opinions on this. I know that conventional wisdom is to *always* put 20% down, to avoid PMI. However, right now, the cost of money is so absurdly cheap that it seems more sensible to put less down.

My wife and I are looking at buying a second home; we *can* put down 20% plus closing costs, but when we're looking at an interest rate of 2.75% and a PMI rate of 0.26%, I'm having a hard time justifying locking up that money in equity when we could hold it in cash and use it for upgrades to the home (if we wind up finding and buying one). 

Even a modest investment should be able to return better than 3%, so the value of ""guaranteed returns"" seems lower than in another scenario, when we'd be looking at 5+% mortgage interest an 1% PMI.

Also, is anyone concerned about deflation becoming a reality despite all the stimulus and FED intervention?

When the UE bonus bubble (potentially) pops at the end of this month, there could be a dash of entry level workers to jobs that simply don't exist, lowering wages/value of output from those individuals as they are willing to take less pay for jobs that paid up to 20% more 6 months ago...

Bitcoin,Bitcoin for NOOBs looking for feedback,"I get a lot of questions about bitcoin from friends and family members.  I wrote this up and to the best of my knowledge covers everything a NOOB should know about bitcoin.  That being said I probably made some mistakes and welcome any feedback from the community I could get on cleaning up the verbiage.  Thanks in advance!

Bitcoin For NOOBS
Peer to peer digital currency that is scares.  It is digitally secure through cryptography and decentralized through open protocol mining principals.

Peer to peer:
USD:  paper dollars can be exchanged peer to peer but any other form of USD exchange requires your banks permission to use your own money.  In fact if you try to pull out too much paper USD your bank may question you.

BTC:  Can be exchanged with no middle man.  No bank or government permissions needed for any amount and can be exchanged across the global at any time.

Scarsity
USD:  Print more money just write an IOU to the banks no big deal.  Inflationary.

BTC:  The number of BTCs that will ever exists is a fixed number it will never change.  Deflationary.

Cryptography:
USD:  With USD the “keys” to your wallet lie with your identity.  If I can gain access to your identity I can gain access to your funds.
BTC:  Your identity does not travel with the coin ledger.  Stealing your identity does not mean your funds can be accessed.

Decentralization
USD: The federal reserve banks are owned by unknown individuals.  Make no mistake the illuminate exists.  When the fed prints money the write those unknown individuals and IOU.  Out of thin air wealth is created to individuals not the government.  You don’t know who they are and never will.
BTC:  Anyone can mine bitcoin.  You dedicate your hardware to mining aka processing transactions.  It costs you money to run that hardware.  Your reward for your hardware costs is bitcoin.  The mathematical principals behind bitcoin do a check for how many mining machines decided if a transaction is real or not.  51% wins.  The more bitcoin is used and the more people that dedicate hardware to mining the more digitally secure it becomes.

Bitcoins case for calling it gold 2.0:
Currently bitcoin is not acting like the USD but instead acting more like gold a store of value.  Long ago before the dollar gold was the standard.  The government attempted to issue greenbacks however no one wanted them since gold was the tradition and was scares in supply.  The government decided to back the dollar with federal gold reserves.  Federal reserves no longer exist as they once have in fact if you invest in gold via the stock market there is a slim chance it is backed by any type of gold reserve it’s really just all digital money for the most part now a days.  While bitcoin is truly limited in supply and scares not only is it a great store of value but it has even more use than gold.  It can be exchanged electronically peer to peer across the globe and used via smart contracts etc.  A quick google search say that the total value of gold in the world is at roughly 7.5trillon dollars.  Gold does has more use than just a store of value via jewlery electronics etc but let’s compare the numbers side by side.

Gold 7.5 trillion
BTC market cap 170.5 billion

If you agree BTC is a better store of value or at least a decent store of value since it’s truly limited in supply with more usability then it’s easy to see how much upside potential is left on the table.  As the fed continues to put out more money during these economic hard times they are causing inflation while BTC has just undergone a halving aka it’s harder for miners to produce a bitcoin reward meaning deflation.  Bitcoin is the perfect place for you to store that big fat government stimulus check if you don’t need the money for awhile.


Edit:  added these sections based on feedback from friends.

Dollars and cents:
USD:  One dollar can be broken down into .01 dollars or 1 cent.  This is the smallest unit of measure in USD.
BTC:  1 Bitcoin can be broken down into .00000001 bitcoins or 1 sats which is short for Satoshi’s.  1 sat is the smallest unit of measure in terms of BTC.

Owning Bitcoin:
You can own bitcoin a few different ways but we will talk about two methods in general.  Owning coins through a 3rd party such as Coinbase or Robinhood vs owning your coins via your own hardware wallet.
3rd Party:  The platform you use can hold some control over you and limit your funds etc just like a bank.  They will take additional fees for each transaction you place etc.  This really isn’t what bitcoin was intended for but it’s how most people use it currently.
Hardware wallet:  You own the currency on a hardware wallet like a Ledger wallet etc.  there is no middle man.  You own the coin and the “keys”",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Advice 26 year old,"Hi guys. I am looking for financial advice. I am 26 years old. I graduated from college (two bachelors degrees) in December 2017 with $75,00 of student loans. I only had $2,000 in my savings at the time. I started a job in February 2018 making around $50,000ish/year (although I do work occasionally overtime), moved in with my parents to avoid rent costs, and started working on my financial goals. I paid off thousands of dollars of student loans. I now have $30,000 left of loans right now. About six months ago I switched from paying everything to my loans, to instead building up my savings. Right now I have about $27,000 in my savings account. 

I really busted my butt for the past two-ish years to pay off a lot of my loans and build my savings account. Now I don’t know whats next. I’m still young and single with no kids. I have the opportunity with my job to make almost double my salary and travel (about 3 months in each place) that was my plan but now with corona virus that got out on hold. I’m hoping to do that later this year if the world permits. 

Should I take my saving and pay off the rest of my loans? One of my goals is to eventually buy my first house but I don’t know what city I want to live I yet (the traveling was supposed to also be an opportunity for me to try different cities and decide where I want to settle down). Should I continue to build my savings for a down payment eventually? I’m not that educated on investment stuff but know a friend who lost $30,000 day trading so I steer away from stocks (maybe irrationally lol). Any advice on good options for next steps when it comes to where my finances are now? 

My long term financial  goals are to buy a house and have enough money for a family and babies and live a humble but comfortable life with vacations and fun activities for my kids. I would appreciate hearing your opinions on options from here! Thank you so much I’m advance!

Edit: spelling
Edit #2- the loans are government loans with interest rates of 3% to 4% depending on the specific loan. I also have a 401k thru work but I’m not sure of the total. I have $5,000 of the above stated savings money in a CD for a higher interest rate, the CD ends in September.",finance

personalfinance,credit card interest rate,"I applied for a Verizon/synchrony credit card recently mainly to get a discount on my monthly bill. I received a letter from synchrony stating that they approved the card but at a higher rate after checking my credit report.

Reasons: too few accounts are current, credit limits are too low, number of mortgage accounts is too low

I got a credit report from transunion - the agency they used. There is absolutely nothing negative on my report. I have never had a late payment. I currently have credit limits available of $40,000+. I only have one mortgage but I thought that was normal.

My credit score has been consistently over 820.

I don't really need a low interest rate. I plan to use the card just for my verizon bill and pay it off every month. But it really annoys me that Synchrony considers me to not qualify for their lowest interest rate. Do I not accept their card, question their rating, or just ignore it.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"My Experience with Crypto Lending: BlockFi, Celsius, Crypto.com, Nexo, Cred, &amp; Bitrue","In the last year, I've made a decent amount in passive income thanks to these lending platforms and couldn't be happier. I'm hoping others who have used these services can chime in on their own experience. I tried to cover relevant topics but feel like I may have missed something and may update again at a later time.

Anyways, I put together a list of crypto lending platforms in an attempt to find the best platforms to use. I've been a long time fan of BlockFi and Celsius Network. CDC has also made it into the top 3. But platforms I hadn't really looked at in-depth were Nexo, Cred, and Bitrue. I thought this was a good opportunity to put them together and see which ones came out on top. There's a lot more detail in the article breaking down the numbers and going into base rates vs premium rates. I've chosen to skip over most of that in the interest of keeping this short.

For the Full Article go [**HERE**](https://medium.com/@cryptobuffett/pros-cons-my-experience-with-blockfi-celsius-crypto-com-nexo-bitrue-cred-7e321a3584f1?source=friends_link&amp;sk=01a33114ec3da2291d439bad02df71e7)

Here's the table below to compare the platforms at a glance and if I'm being honest, probably the most helpful part of the entire article, until the figures in the table become outdated in the span of a week ;(

[Rates as of August 29th, 2020. Rates may change.](https://preview.redd.it/9zjp1ajq27k51.jpg?width=7746&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=040b80d5e092bdf86d9a6f9ada992c163b142e1c)

The gist of it basically boils down to this:

# BlockFi

Pros

* Fully Regulated in the US
* Backed by Major VC firms like Coinbase, Sofi, Fidelity among others
* Compound &amp; In-Kind Interest
* No Platform Tokens Required
* No Minimum Balance Required
* Phone Support

Cons

* Limited Number of Free Withdrawals
* Limited Number of Supported Coins
* Interest Paid Monthly
* 1 Business Day to Process Withdrawals

I've been with them for over a year and their services are the only one I recommend to users unfamiliar to the crypto landscape. That being said, my biggest issue is their 1 Business Day withdrawal process. It's another layer of security in case your account is compromised, but it can feel like a lifetime when you're used to the immediate withdrawals on most other platforms.

\----

# Celsius Network

Pros

* Compound &amp; In-Kind Interest
* Wide-Range of Supported Coins
* Free Withdrawal/Zero Fees
* Interest Paid Weekly
* No Minimum Balance Required
* Instant Withdrawals up to $25k/Day

Cons

* Must Earn &amp; Hold CEL for Higher Rates (Unavailable to US users)
* Interest Rates Adjusted Weekly

I've been with them for the longest and I remain a loyal fan. But I did initially join them for the bonus rates they promoted which US users are still unable to access. Aside from that, if you see a rate for an asset that's agreeable, they are a solid option.

\----

# Crypto.com (CDC)

Pros

* Great App with 24/7 Support Live Chat
* Extensive Security Certification and Protocols
* Lockup Not Required
* In-Kind Interest
* Wide Selection of Supported Coins
* Interest Paid Weekly

Cons

* Withdrawal Fees
* Must Lockup (3 Months) and/or Stake MCO for Best Rates
* No Compound Interest — Unless Manually Redeposited into New Earn Contract
* Minimum Deposit Required to Earn Interest (approx. $250)

I find a lot of value in their suite of products, but for people looking strictly for the most flexible lending experience, CDC may feel more restrictive compared to the rest. I will say, they offer some of the most attractive interest rates but you generally have to either stake MCO and/or lockup your funds for 3 months to take advantage.

\----

# Nexo

Pros

* Compound Interest
* No Minimum Balance Required
* No Lockup Required
* No Withdraw Fees/Zero Fees
* In-Kind Interest
* Interest Paid Daily

Cons

* Must Hold Nexo Tokens for Best Rates

One of the simplest platforms from a design and use prospective, with their recent addition of new supported major coins, this may quickly become an additional platform I use on a regular basis.

\----

# Cred

Pros

* No Minimum Deposit Required
* Wide Selection of Supported Coins
* US-Based and Regulated, Reputable Partners &amp; Public Facing Execs

Cons

* 6 Month Lockup Required (3 Month Renewal)
* Interest Paid in LBA or USD Only
* Program Entry Restricted to the 1st and 15th of Every Month
* Must Hold LBA Token for Best Rates

These guys have missed the mark on many fronts. I hope they re-examine their product in the near future since, in its current state, it's a bit of a double whammy - users must lock up their funds for 6 months and can only earn interest in USD or LBA. Might be a quadruple whammy actually since the price of the asset is locked in at contract start  (good in a bearish market, not good in a bull run) and you can only start a credearn term on the 1st and 15th of every month....just so many hurdles for users' to overcome...unless you're interested in rarer coins like iota or nano I can't recommend it.

\----

Bitrue

**Pros**

* Lockup Not Required
* Interest Paid Daily
* In-Kind Interest
* Offers Highest Interest Rates

**Cons**

* **Questionable Trustworthiness — Limited Public-Facing Figures &amp; Company Background**
* Power Piggy has Daily Caps — Must Deposit Funds before Cap Depletion
* Minimum Deposit Required to Earn Interest
* Withdraw Fees
* No Compound Interest — Unless Manually Redeposited to New Power Piggy Contract

I had briefly looked into Bitrue last year after they made a splash with their 7.3% interest rates. They've lowered their rates for non-BTR holders in late-2019, but it still remains that we don't know who the co-founder outside of Curis is or key members of their team that supposedly includes ""senior management team from Capital One and website security experts"" - what legitimate outfit chooses not to release this sort of basic information?

So I really can't recommend them at this stage, but if it weren't for this issue I would definitely be using their program ;)

\----

# Wrap It Up

It's tough to narrow it to just one, the best, but BlockFi is close to the top as it's the one I recommend to friends and family. But due to their small range of supported coins, second place would go to crypto.com (CDC) for me, since I don't personally mind their longer terms and prefer their higher rates. For ultimate flexibility though, Celsius is the best no-frills option.

So again, the 3 platforms I have in heavy rotation are BlockFi, Celsius Network, and CDC. I find that this combination allows me to keep assets accessible in Celsius up to their $25k limit with zero fees; BlockFi as a backup for delayed access due to their 1 business day withdrawal policy and using their 2 free withdrawals/month; and finally taking advantage of CDC's high-interest rates with 3-month lockup for anything that remains.

What do you think? What's your favorite platform and strategy? Any features I forgot to mention? Am I wrong about Bitrue?

Bitcoin,Why Our Money Is Broken,"I’m writing this because I wish to explain in layman terms why the global economy is broken. Most people intuitively feel that the economy is a mess and bad things are happening. Words like corruption, crony capitalism, money printing and bailouts are being tossed about as explanations why the economy is in trouble. While all these things are problems our economy is facing and deserve attention, they are all consequences of a fundamental problem that needs to be understood first and foremost. That is, money itself is broken.  

To understand how fiat money we use is broken, one should view money as a commodity just as you would any other good. Any economist would agree that setting a price for a good or service is a bad idea, but for whatever reason, mainstream economists (Keynesians) believe that money is exempt from the disastrous effects of price fixing. As a quick refresher why price fixing is never a desirable policy let’s take a look at the classic example of rent control. Let’s say the average cost of an apartment in your city/town is $1000. Your politicians say that this is outrageous and make a sweeping policy saying that no apartment can be priced above $100. Suddenly the supply for housing cannot come close to matching the demand at this price. Landlords no longer care about the upkeep of the apartment because even if the apartment turns into a shithole, someone will still take it for $100. People no longer have incentives to build new housing or renovate existing housing because they can no longer charge a market rate. The end result is a city in ruins. Try your logic at why price fixing doesn’t work with any good. The market is distorted. Supply and demand are unable to reach equilibrium and everybody loses. 

The price of money is the interest rate. When the Federal Reserve engages in interest rate targeting, this is price setting. The Fed will say that the cost of money is too high! We need to get more money into the hands of more people to stimulate the economy, so let’s set the price of money to zero. Take a minute to think about what this means. In a free market the interest rate is established by the supply of money (savings) and the demand for money (borrowing). The interest rate can never be zero. It can only approach zero if the supply (savings) is reaching infinity and/or the demand (borrowers) for money is reaching zero. When the Fed fixes the price of money, it is sending a false market signal across the whole economy about how much money is saved to properly be used for investment. This is where irrational economic behavior occurs on a macroeconomic scale. Strictly speaking, individuals are operating rationally. If the price of money is zero, it is only rational to borrow money and not save your money. The problem is not the individual but rather the Central Bank has distorted the reality of the most important commodity of them all, money itself. 

What are the consequences of setting the price of money so low? Think about how this affects borrowers. The economy is operating under the assumption that there are more savings available for investment then there actually are. This leads to malinvestments. Imagine your buddy says he has a million dollars saved and would be happy to lend you this money free of interest. Maybe you’d build a fancy new house or put down a lot of capital to start a business. Then halfway through building your house, your buddy says, sorry, I only had $100,000, not a million. You began building something you should never have started building had you previously known how much money was actually available. You have to scrap your project and you end up with a worthless half built project.  

How does this affect savers? Imagine if I had a million dollars in my savings account. With the interest rate so low, I’m being given very strong signals to not keep that money in the bank to be loaned out. If the price of money is zero, why in the world would I want to sell (loan) my money for no profit? You wouldn’t. Your money is losing value everyday it sits in the bank account because the Fed is pumping out more money and giving it to banks to keep the interest rate at zero. You need to buy something with that money. You end up buying a house, stocks or whatever commodity you think will increase in price because you don’t want to see the value of your cash inflated away. 

As investments are undertaken that should never have been started and commodities are purchased that should never have been purchased, asset prices rise and we see bubbles forming all over the economic landscape. By messing with price of money the whole economy has become infected. And unfortunately at this stage, there is no cure. We are in too deep. The financial system will implode and the dollar will collapse. Please protect yourself and buy bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Saving for financial independence without owning property,"I'm looking at becoming financially independent in the next 20 years. 

I'm currently saving 60-70% of my pre-tax income (I live in a very low tax country, and I'm both young and child free) and am investing in an ETF portfolio evenly covering the S&amp;P 500, ASX, emerging markets and REITs. 

One thing that concerns me is that it's not easy for me to own property. I've moved cities frequently over the last few years and don't see myself moving back to a local jurisdiction (where I wouldn't have to pay tax for being a foreigner) anytime in the forseeable future. I know I could buy a property back home and rent it out, but I don't really like the idea of the hassle of being a landlord (let alone having to deal with property taxes, maintenance and all that other BS). 

What concerns me is I feel like I'm missing the boat. Levering up and buying a home has been a pretty much surefire way for people who aren't even the least bit frugal to build large amounts of wealth for retirement. Especially in this ultra low interest rate environment, it just seems like a huge gift that I'm snubbing for the sake of an easier life. Plus, even though I'm already slightly hedged through my REIT investing, property ownership would more or less fully hedge me against rising house prices.

personalfinance,What’s the best way to structure a personal loan?,"My wife and I just recently purchased a home from a family member, qualified for a mortgage and all that. Essentially the sale price was much lower than market value and our family was extremely generous to us in this transaction. 

Part of the purchase involves a side agreement that we will pay a certain amount of money to the family member over time to somewhat offset the discount on the purchase price. In addition, we have agreed to pay a small interest rate on the outstanding balance until it is paid off. My question is, what’s the best way to structure this payment plan?

I want it to be easy for both parties to track.  Should we set it up like a car loan with fixed payments but can be paid off early? Or is there an easy way to calculate it like a mortgage where we could make extra payments against the principle?

personalfinance,401k loan for investment purposes?,"I find myself relatively educated regarding PF, but wanted to get insight from the community regarding my thoughts. My employer's 401k loan policy is unlike mainstream. Normal 401k loans require you to pay off your loan balance (with interest) with after tax deductions from your paycheck back to your 401k account, over a period of max 5 years, max principal 50k or 50% of account balance (whichever is lower). Post-CARES act, the max you can withdraw is 100% or 100k (whichever is lower). With interest rates also low currently, it's more advantageous than before to take loans, and so long as you pay back in the allotted time you don't have to pay the early withdrawal penalty. The drawback would be that especially for larger loans, you lose the time in market that those funds would have compounded on since you've removed the money as cash. 

My employer does something different - they essentially write you a check for the balance you want to take out (subject to the restrictions above), and you're paying them back the principal and interest, while they use your 401k effectively as collateral. The bigger perk is by doing that, you don't have to worry about the opportunity cost of not having your money invested, since your funds stay in your account and the company is just cutting you a check - much like a bank. The interest rate I was given is also pretty low (3.75%). But otherwise, here's some things I have to think about: 

-I have some big expenses coming up (i.e. wedding) and want to help my parents pay for it. The wedding would take place next year, so the cash isn't needed right away but will be needed for prep &amp; venue deposits. 

-There's a chance I leave my job before I pay back my loan (rumors of layoffs, I'm not real happy here anyway). However, it looks from the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act that the time to pay back your 401k loan if your employment has terminated increased from 60 days to the October of your tax year, so Oct 2021 if I did it now. This lessens the risk of having to come up with the money in case I lose my job or want to leave the company. 

-There's always risk in what the market will do, but I feel relatively confident that I can beat the 3.75% interest on my loan via investing. If I'm able to, this would be a win for me, correct? Is there anything I need to take into account because I'm paying after tax dollars (and 401k's are tax protected?). 

Appreciate the help in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Need help determining what to pay off first,"Hello r/personalfinance!

First time posting here. I recently just graduated and have a job with steady income. Although it’s a good starting salary, majority of my income will be tied while I pay off debt (private student loans, federal loans, car, etc)

My goal is to minimize my debt as quickly as possible. I am trying to determine whether it makes most sense to pay off a private student loan first (because it has the lower balance) or put more towards my car (because it has the higher interest rate). 

Car: I owe $9,780 with a 13.45% interest rate. Minimum payment is $363.94

Student loan: I owe 3,836.04 with a 7.93% interest rate. Minimum payment is $79.55. I was paying more toward this for a while but my minimum payment due each month started decreasing so I’m guessing that’s a sign that the additional $ wasn’t being applied to principal?

I only have an additional $50 monthly to apply to either of these debts. I know it’s not much but I figured it’s better than nothing.

Was just talking to a friend yesterday who is in consulting, he said that some of their clients such as car dealerships pulled out of their consulting deals when COVID started, but some (including homebuilders) are doing better now than prior to the crisis.

I've also seen this narrative discussed recently in financial media (COVID driving people out of cities). Low interest rates will help housing and lending standards were tight already even before the crisis.

At a glance, NVR does not look bad, high ROC, no debt. TTM P/E is not super attractive and forward P/E even less, but most good, high ROC mid caps are more expensive than that right now.

Would be interested in hearing from people who have more experience investing in homebuilders...",finance

stocks,The FED may be implementing measures not seen since WW2 - Lyn Alden,[removed],finance
stocks,The FED may be implementing measures not seen since WW2,"I found this information VERY helpful, it is a very interesting look at some of the measures the FED has in their back pocket. I suggest everyone looks into Yield Curve Control, They are essentially thinking about reducing the debt bubble via inflation instead of paying it off. Japan and Australia are currently doing this. It will mean cash value down, stock value up.

*Lyn Alden is a value investor with a background in finance and engineering who focuses on long term fundamental investing on a global macro level. In the 1930s the United States had a deflationary crush because of a high private debt bubble that had built up in the 1920s - with major bank failures the economy lost around a 3rd of the broad money supply. Then the US devalued the dollar from the gold peg from 1/20 to 1/35 of an ounce of Gold per dollar. In the 1940s the United States had a federal debt bubble. 100% federal debt to GDP running at 20 -30% deficits to GDP to finance the war. The Fed locked treasury yields at 2.5% and bought dollars to maintain that peg. From there, the US saw double digit inflation in 1942 and 1947 as a result of this rapid increase in the money supply. Treasury yields then lost money on a real basis, and the debt was inflated away by devaluing the dollar relative to the fixed debt that existed. Currently, the Federal Debt bubble is at 120% deficit as a percentage of GDP. This is all time high levels. The US has increased the money supply and increased the debt to money supply ratio. This is going to hit hard in terms of inflation. The Fed can’t impact GDP but they control the money supply. By using practices like commercial lending the Fed can do extended unemployment, helicopter checks, infrastructure bills, and tax cuts to gives more money back to the public that isn’t funded by taxes or lending. In 2008, the capital created went to recapitalize banks. Now QE is spilling over into the broader market as the damage is much worse than ever before. If this continues over several more years, with tax decreases, extended spending levels, expect a faster money supply increase. With will lead to massive inflation. The increase in domestic debt has gone from $15 trillion to $18 trillion year to date. With supply disruptions and de-globalization along with fiscal spending we could be up for a massive deflationary period in the coming decade. Using Yield curve control the US will try and deflate away most of the debt. Yield curve control is a way to manage debt. The money supply is a denominator for the velocity calculation when comparing GDP to money supply if the money supply is increased quickly but the GDP doesn’t increase as fast, then the velocity will be lower as the money supply doesn’t mean core growth. The silver lining is the US dollar purchasing power has increased even with the additional printing of money. But will the dollar remain strong relative to other currencies? Some variable to watch: \*Fed tapering treasury support \*Slowing the rate of balance sheet increases What the Fed does with monetizing spending packages will make a big impact on the strength of the dollar. Liquidity Swaps and International Repo are two programs by the Fed that protects the world treasury market. In order to maintain global reserve status swap lines has doubled in emerging markets and major countries to keep the dollar supply going. The US is growing its money supply faster than any other country in the history of the world.*

personalfinance,How aggressive should I be in paying high interest private student loans?,"I have 84.5K left in student loans (paid 16K so far this year). 38.1K of that is private student loans with interest rates between 6-10%.

I make a little over 5K a month after taxes.

I live at home with my parents so no rent expense. My dad is telling me to just pay the minimum but it feels like I’m gridlocked when it comes to future planning. Only paying the min means that putting money in a 401K and other investment vehicles will be greatly outpaced by the amount of debt I’ll be accumulating in student loan interest. 

I’m saving 12k (6 months of mortgage payments) in case my dad died, but I don’t pay rent or anything.

TLDR: Should I save 12 months of mortgage payments? Or How much should I put into paying off my student loans monthly? (I’m thinking of dumping my entire 5k check into them each money and keeping the remaining $600 for misc.)",finance
solar,Quick solar math check and thoughts on going in now vs 2021?,"I last explored Solar in Sept 2019 when I received a quote from a local installer and received a quote for a 5 or 6kW system. Our local municipal light department has a really nice rebate  of up to 6k but, even with that, the time to payback was 9-11 years so I held off. I happened to check on Tesla as well (I have a model 3 so was curious) and they were quoting a 'medium' 7.6kW system at $21,546.

Fast forward to today and I decided to revisit by looking up Tesla solar having seen a few posts here commenting on their prices being much more aggressive. Lo and behold, I was now priced a 8.16kW system to meet 89% of our needs for a price of $16,000 which seem s crazy. I did the math and between the local, state and fed credits, I am now looking at a 3.5 year payback time using the calculator from [pvwats.nrel.gov](https://pvwats.nrel.gov) to quote production for MA of 10,868 kWh/year. Our annual use averages to 1,059 kWh/month.

So, questions:

1. Is my math right?
2. The local rebate seems to be the key to a great cost. I wonder if 2021 might see more 'green' incentives depending on political changes. Anyone holding off til then for solar hoping for better incentives?

personalfinance,Should I save for retirement and go for loan forgiveness or should I try to pay off my student loan asap?,"I am SO confused. I hope I am doing my math right.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to turn 27. I have about 120k in student loans at 6.3% interest rate. I'm making 85k so my minimum payment is around $550 for 10% of my income on REPAYE. I have about 25k saved currently and I'm thinking of putting 10k into retirement now.

&amp;#x200B;

If I go for loan forgiveness and just pay the minimum payment I will pay 190k over 20 years. If I pay an additional \~15% ($670) of my income on student loans (with nothing going into retirement), I can pay it off in 11 years for a total of 163k.

&amp;#x200B;

If I invest 10k into retirement now, pay my minimum payment, and invest the \~15% into retirement, I will have 1.5M in 40 years (I think?? - having paid 320k over 40yrs with an extra 10% per month or 132k over 20 years to spend on having a high QOL). If I start saving for retirement after paying off my loans but do the whole 25% ($1220/mo) starting in 10 years then I will have 1.4M (having paid 440k over 30 years).

&amp;#x200B;

So if I pay the minimum payment on my student loans and save for retirement @ 15% then I will have paid 512k for 1.5M over 40 years with an extra 132k for fun the last 20 years since I'm only paying 15% at that point (so 380k essentially??). If I pay off my loans first and THEN start saving for retirement, I will have paid 603k for 1.4M over 40 years with a constant 25%. I know this doesn't include a lot of things but it's a place to start.

&amp;#x200B;

So if I want to save the most money, I should go for student loan forgiveness and focus on saving for retirement, right? I know there are a million options in between these two extremes and I have no idea where to start to find out if there is a sweet spot between the two. And IF student loan forgiveness isn't a thing anymore, then I am screwed... I just don't know what to do!!! I don't even know if my math is right. Does anyone have any insight?",finance
personalfinance,"New job and sanity, or old job and money?","I am currently at a crossroads in my career, which is causing a dilemma and me questioning my finances. 

I’ve been with my current company for 13 years, full time almost 10 years, and I’m not liking the direction the company is currently on so I began looking for another job. 

I had been interviewing at a new place this last week for a similar job to what I have now. My issue is they only want to pay me $14 an hour starting, whereas at my current job I’m making $19.75 per hour.

I am absolutely miserable at my current job. We are severely short staffed, lost someone in my office and there hasn’t been a replacement for over 2 months now. 

I am wanting to just take this other job and take the pay it for my sanity. 

Here’s my financial question- to take the new job I’d have to withdraw my entire 401k ($35,000 before taxes), pay off all of my debt (about $10,000 or so which includes credit cards and paying off my car) and start fresh to make the new pay per hour work. This way I’d have some to fall back on in case something happens, and I also planned to pull a small amount to begin with to cover my wedding that was postponed. 

Is this a wise decision or no? 

The new job offers 401k. They do not match but that’s because they have an Employee Stock Option which is vested after 3 years so if something happens it’s all mine. I can do both 401k and ESOP. Their insurance is cheaper and they offer a great HSA program as well as an in house gym that I can use. My health insurance would go down, I wouldn’t have a monthly gym fee, and my car insurance would go down once my car loan is paid off. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,HELP! Wife ‘quit’ to be independent contractor for same company. How to file taxes and financially protect ourselves?,"Hello,

In February, my wife ‘quit’ her job to be an independent contractor for her company. She is doing the same work, but from home so she could take up another part time job and spend time with the kids when they got home from school. When COVID hit, her part time job was not closing their public office or taking any precautions so she quit and now only has her independent contractor position from the original employer.

Her work didn’t really give her much info when she switched, but had her fill out a 1099 and submit it. Didn’t think much more of it until recently when we found out that she should be submitting tax returns quarterly! We tried filling out the 1040-ES but got a little confused. We estimate for 2020 she will be making about $25k, so we tried using TurboTax Freedom edition but it acts like we’re trying to file our 2019 taxes which I don’t think is correct. We’re back to trying the 1040-ES, now.

Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed? We’ve always filed jointly early in the year - would she be considered filing ‘separately’ for these quarterly and then we file jointly again in early 2021 for 2020? Does she have to pay State AND Federal taxes quarterly?

Also, is there anything else we should be aware of? She’s using an old laptop almost 100% for work so I would think she should get a new one but not sure how or if we could ‘claim’ it, or software like Adobe CC she uses for her work. We’re relying on health care from my job and contributing to my 401k for retirement but she does have an old 401k from her job rolling around we should probably do something with. She has been saving some of her wages to pay for taxes in just our checking account. Any advice on any of these topics would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Plan Check? Married Couple Setting Up Accounts For Increased Retirement Investing,"My wife(34) and I(28) have been fortunate to not (so far) have our income be affected by the current pandemic, which has had me thinking more about our future and taking some steps to improve our retirement planning. Hoping the gurus of /r/personalfinance can check my planning.

We make a combined \~95k/year and we follow the Prime Directive to a T:

**Step 1:** Healthy Emergency Fund. Approximately $25,000 in a savings account. This represents 6+ months of living expenses if we had no income whatsoever. This is far closer to 8-12 months for most plausible scenarios (single job loss, unemployment benefits, reduced expenses).

**Step 2:** My employer offers a 401k with Empower and a flat $500/year match. I contribute 2% currently, but receive a no-strings-attached 5% employer contribution yearly as part of a profit sharing plan. This account is fully vested.

My wife works two part-time jobs and does not have any employer retirement options or matching.

**Step 3:** No high-interest debt. No credit card balances, no car notes etc. We have approximately $10,000 of debt on 0% promos that is being paid off monthly within our existing budget. All expected to be paid off within 2 years. Otherwise only Mortgage and Student Loans (\~$4,000) at less than 4% interest rates.

**Step 4:**

Current Retirement Assets:

* My 401k - Empower Retirement - $26,500 - 100% American Funds TDF 2055
* Wife's IRA - Millennium Trust - $4500 - Cash Equivalents

Our current budget has us pushing approximately $200/week into our savings account. I would like to start allocating that to tax-advantaged retirement accounts. My preference is to use TDFs, but because the expense ratio from my Empower 401k is poor (0.4%), I'm looking at the following:

* Reduce my 401k contribution to $500/year. This gets me the maximum ""free"" money from my match and employer profit-sharing contributions but keeps the minimum possible in funds with a poor expense ratio.
* Open two individual IRAs with VanGuard. Rollover my wife's existing IRA and start from $0 with my own, investing in appropriate TDFs with low expense ratios.
* Contribute up to $5500/year to my IRA, so as not to pass the $6000 individual tax-deduction limit. Contribute any additional $$ to my wife's IRA up to the combined $12,000 limit.

Do these steps make sense? Would you make any changes if the goal is a relatively stable, safe investment intended for retirement in 30+ years?",finance

personalfinance,Best option for financial windfall - Pay off mortgage or down payment on new house,"Some background: 

 * Prior to receiving any money we were already planning on purchasing a home in a better school district (we have a 2 year old son)
 * We received a financial windfall of $X 
 * The balance on our current home is about $X
 * The down payment on the home we're looking at is also $X
 * Our current interest rate is about 4%
 * We also have about $X in a liquid savings account
 * We're not planning to sell our current home
 * We're in a position where we could afford both mortgages if needed
 * Our annual income is about 2.5 - 3 times X

My question is, is it better to: 

1. Pay off our current home and spend the bulk of our liquid savings on the down payment for the new home
2. Pay off our current home and use a HELOC to pay the down payment of our new home (and keep the liquid savings as a rainy day fund)
2. Keep paying off our house as planned (paying $N in additional principle each month) and use the windfall to pay the down payment of our new home (and keep the liquid savings as a rainy day fund)
3. Pay of a $ X/2 of our current home using savings, use the windfall to pay the down payment on the new home and still keep $ X/2 as a rainy day fund

Ask any questions that would help with advise. Looking to understand any other options/risks I may have missed and understand what the best option is. 


Thanks in advance!

Edits: 

 * My reason for keeping the current house are (either): 
* We plan on renting the house
* We'd like to sell it at a later point in time and use the proceeds to purchase a more desirable rental property
 * If we go for the later option above, I don't want to get locked into purchasing the new home and trying to time the sale of our current one together
* I see a ripple effect of rising unemployment (especially after Sept CARES act restrictions lifted) on the housing market so I think home prices will drop
* Don't want to sell during a slump, but if it happens, would like to take advantage of the timing to purchase the new property
* I don't want to be rushed into accepting a subpar offer just because the timing worked out with our purchase - ideally i'd like these two to be independent transactions so we maintain control",finance

investing,"[NYTimes] Sources describe horror stories of young and inexperienced investors on Robinhood, many engaging in riskier trades at far higher volumes than at other firms","https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html
&gt; 
&gt; Richard Dobatse, a Navy medic in San Diego, dabbled infrequently in stock trading. But his behavior changed in 2017 when he signed up for Robinhood, a trading app that made buying and selling stocks simple and seemingly free.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Dobatse, now 32, said he had been charmed by Robinhood’s one-click trading, easy access to complex investment products, and features like falling confetti and emoji-filled phone notifications that made it feel like a game. After funding his account with $15,000 in credit card advances, he began spending more time on the app.
&gt; 
&gt; As he repeatedly lost money, Mr. Dobatse took out two $30,000 home equity loans so he could buy and sell more speculative stocks and options, hoping to pay off his debts. His account value shot above $1 million this year — but almost all of that recently disappeared. This week, his balance was $6,956.
&gt; 
&gt; “When he is doing his trading, he won’t want to eat,” said his wife, Tashika Dobatse, with whom he has three children. “He would have nightmares.”
&gt; 
&gt; Millions of young Americans have begun investing in recent years through Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 with a sales pitch of no trading fees or account minimums. The ease of trading has turned it into a cultural phenomenon and a Silicon Valley darling, with the start-up climbing to an $8.3 billion valuation. It has been one of the tech industry’s biggest growth stories in the recent market turmoil.
&gt; 
&gt; But at least part of Robinhood’s success appears to have been built on a Silicon Valley playbook of behavioral nudges and push notifications, which has drawn inexperienced investors into the riskiest trading, according to an analysis of industry data and legal filings, as well as interviews with nine current and former Robinhood employees and more than a dozen customers. And the more that customers engaged in such behavior, the better it was for the company, the data shows.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading The Times.
&gt; Subscribe to The Times
&gt; More than at any other retail brokerage firm, Robinhood’s users trade the riskiest products and at the fastest pace, according to an analysis of new filings from nine brokerage firms by the research firm Alphacution for The New York Times.
&gt; 
&gt; In the first three months of 2020, Robinhood users traded nine times as many shares as E-Trade customers, and 40 times as many shares as Charles Schwab customers, per dollar in the average customer account in the most recent quarter. They also bought and sold 88 times as many risky options contracts as Schwab customers, relative to the average account size, according to the analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The more often small investors trade stocks, the worse their returns are likely to be, studies have shown. The returns are even worse when they get involved with options, research has found.
&gt; 
&gt; This kind of trading, where a few minutes can mean the difference between winning and losing, was particularly hazardous on Robinhood because the firm has experienced an unusual number of technology issues, public records show. Some Robinhood employees, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said the company failed to provide adequate guardrails and technology to support its customers.
&gt; 
&gt; Those dangers came into focus last month when Alex Kearns, 20, a college student in Nebraska, killed himself after he logged into the app and saw that his balance had dropped to negative $730,000. The figure was high partly because of some incomplete trades.
&gt; 
&gt; “There was no intention to be assigned this much and take this much risk,” Mr. Kearns wrote in his suicide note, which a family member posted on Twitter.
&gt; 
&gt; Like Mr. Kearns, Robinhood’s average customer is young and lacks investing know-how. The average age is 31, the company said, and half of its customers had never invested before.
&gt; 
&gt; Some have visited Robinhood’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., in recent years to confront the staff about their losses, said four employees who witnessed the incidents. This year, they said, the start-up installed bulletproof glass at the front entrance.
&gt; 
&gt; “They encourage people to go from training wheels to driving motorcycles,” Scott Smith, who tracks brokerage firms at the financial consulting firm Cerulli, said of Robinhood. “Over the long term, it’s like trying to beat the casino.”
&gt; 
&gt; At the core of Robinhood’s business is an incentive to encourage more trading. It does not charge fees for trading, but it is still paid more if its customers trade more.
&gt; 
&gt; That’s because it makes money through a complex practice known as “payment for order flow.” Each time a Robinhood customer trades, Wall Street firms actually buy or sell the shares and determine what price the customer gets. These firms pay Robinhood for the right to do this, because they then engage in a form of arbitrage by trying to buy or sell the stock for a profit over what they give the Robinhood customer.
&gt; 
&gt; This practice is not new, and retail brokers such as E-Trade and Schwab also do it. But Robinhood makes significantly more than they do for each stock share and options contract sent to the professional trading firms, the filings show.
&gt; 
&gt; For each share of stock traded, Robinhood made four to 15 times more than Schwab in the most recent quarter, according to the filings. In total, Robinhood got $18,955 from the trading firms for every dollar in the average customer account, while Schwab made $195, the Alphacution analysis shows. Industry experts said this was most likely because the trading firms believed they could score the easiest profits from Robinhood customers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Vlad Tenev, a founder and co-chief executive of Robinhood, said in an interview that even with some of its customers losing money, young Americans risked greater losses by not investing in stocks at all. Not participating in the markets “ultimately contributed to the sort of the massive inequalities that we’re seeing in society,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Tenev said only 12 percent of the traders active on Robinhood each month used options, which allow people to bet on where the price of a specific stock will be on a specific day and multiply that by 100. He said the company had added educational content on how to invest safely.
&gt; 
&gt; He declined to comment on why Robinhood makes more than its competitors from the Wall Street firms. The company also declined to comment on Mr. Dobatse or provide data on its customers’ performance.
&gt; 
&gt; Robinhood does not force people to trade, of course. But its success at getting them do so has been highlighted internally. In June, the actor Ashton Kutcher, who has invested in Robinhood, attended one of the company’s weekly staff meetings on Zoom and celebrated its success by comparing it to gambling websites, said three people who were on the call.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Kutcher said in a statement that his comment “was not intended to be a comparison of business models nor the experience Robinhood provides its customers” and that it referred “to the current growth metrics.” He added that he was “absolutely not insinuating that Robinhood was a gambling platform.”

&gt; Robinhood was founded by Mr. Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, two children of immigrants who met at Stanford University in 2005. After teaming up on several ventures, including a high-speed trading firm, they were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement to create a company that would make finance more accessible, they said. They named the start-up Robinhood after the English outlaw who stole from the rich and gave to the poor.
&gt; 
&gt; Robinhood eliminated trading fees while most brokerage firms charged $10 or more for a trade. It also added features to make investing more like a game. New members were given a free share of stock, but only after they scratched off images that looked like a lottery ticket.
&gt; 
&gt; The app is simple to use. The home screen has a list of trendy stocks. If a customer touches one of them, a green button pops up with the word “trade,” skipping many of the steps that other firms require.
&gt; 
&gt; Robinhood initially offered only stock trading. Over time, it added options trading and margin loans, which make it possible to turbocharge investment gains — and to supersize losses.
&gt; 
&gt; The app advertises options with the tagline “quick, straightforward &amp; free.” Customers who want to trade options answer just a few multiple-choice questions. Beginners are legally barred from trading options, but those who click that they have no investing experience are coached by the app on how to change the answer to “not much” experience. Then people can immediately begin trading.
&gt; 
&gt; Before Robinhood added options trading in 2017, Mr. Bhatt scoffed at the idea that the company was letting investors take uninformed risks.
&gt; 
&gt; “The best thing we can say to those people is ‘Just do it,’” he told Business Insider at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; In May, Robinhood said it had 13 million accounts, up from 10 million at the end of 2019. Schwab said it had 12.7 million brokerage accounts in its latest filings; E-Trade reported 5.5 million.
&gt; 
&gt; That growth has kept the money flowing in from venture capitalists. Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates are among those that have poured $1.3 billion into Robinhood. In May, the company received a fresh $280 million.
&gt; 
&gt; “Robinhood has made the financial markets accessible to the masses and, in turn, revolutionized the decades-old brokerage industry,” Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia, said after last month’s fund-raising.

&gt; Robinhood shows users that its options trading is free of commissions. 
&gt; Mr. Tenev has said Robinhood has invested in the best technology in the industry. But the risks of trading through the app have been compounded by its tech glitches.

&gt; In 2018, Robinhood released software that accidentally reversed the direction of options trades, giving customers the opposite outcome from what they expected. Last year, it mistakenly allowed people to borrow infinite money to multiply their bets, leading to some enormous gains and losses.
&gt; 
&gt; Robinhood’s website has also gone down more often than those of its rivals — 47 times since March for Robinhood and 10 times for Schwab — according to a Times analysis of data from Downdetector.com, which tracks website reliability. In March, the site was down for almost two days, just as stock prices were gyrating because of the coronavirus pandemic. Robinhood’s customers were unable to make trades to blunt the damage to their accounts.
&gt; 
&gt; Four Robinhood employees, who declined to be identified, said the outage was rooted in issues with the company’s phone app and servers. They said the start-up had underinvested in technology and moved too quickly rather than carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Tenev said he could not talk about the outage beyond a company blog post that said it was “not acceptable.” Robinhood had recently made new technology investments, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Plaintiffs who have sued over the outage said Robinhood had done little to respond to their losses. Unlike other brokers, the company has no phone number for customers to call.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Dobatse suffered his biggest losses in the March outage — $860,000, his records show. Robinhood did not respond to his emails, he said, adding that he planned to take his case to financial regulators for arbitration.

personalfinance,220k in Student Loans: how to refinance/take advantage of interest rate landscape,[removed],finance
personalfinance,"Tons of student loans, how do I refinance in this environment?","The title gives you the gist of the idea, I have about 220k in private  student loans - cosigned with my parents from a private lender.   Obviously this is a lot of money, and the monthly payment is around  $2217, using the interest rates and an amortization calculator (where I  considered each loan separately).

I  also know that the interest rate landscape is great right now, and  wanted to ask what the best way to refinance to take advantage of the  low both fixed and variable rates? My parents, who have good credit,  would agree to cosign, but what should be my next steps here?

personalfinance,Refinance a VA Home Loan?,"Got a call from my current mortgage service place, offering me an opportunity to refinance.  Of course, I asked to see everything in writing so I could review rather than just trying to make sense of it over the phone.

We paid $170,000 for our home, approximately 6 years ago.  30 year fixed, VA Home loan, no money down, 3.75% rate.  I don't think this is relevant to the matter at hand, but just in case: Zillow claims the value of our house is now $270,000.  (Yes, I do understand Zillow is not the best way to appraise your current home value, just a reference point).

I make an excellent income and we have excellent credit, so getting the loan was easy thanks to my Veteran status, even with no money down.  We've never struggled to make a mortgage payment, and we plan to stay here long term.

They are now offering to drop my interest rate to 2.875%.  After factoring in all of the fees, etc, this would drop my monthly payment (including taxes and homeowners insurance) by $64 per month, or $768 per year.

The closing costs, which are already factored into the new monthly loan amount, is $1,595.  So if I'm saving $768 per year, I should pay off the $1,595 in slightly more than 2 years.  From that point on, I should be saving $768 per year for the remaining 20 years of the loan.  A savings of about $15,000 in the long run.

This is the first time I've considered a refinance, and my understanding of it comes only from basic google searches, so -- am I missing anything?  What am I not considering?

TL;DR:  My mortgage lender is offering me a refinance deal which will pay itself off in two years, and then seemingly save me ~750 per year for 20 years.  Too good to be true?",finance

investing,TWO Harbors Investments DD: Trading 30% below book value,"Investors:

I've been watching this stock since April. It's your typical REIT that took a bad beating back in March like everyone else.

**Company:** TWO makes money by purchasing, servicing, and selling Residential Mortgage Back Securities, which we know in the short term is going to depress their share price. However, these are residential securities, *not commercia*l - which because of WFH measures and city shutdowns, commercial prices are going to be depressed for A LOT longer - I'm guessing approximately 3+ years. 

Now, let's assume that you are looking for a place to park your IRA, savings, investment money in a long term hold position. You may be cautious and resist buying anything related to and correlating with unemployment/wages - i.e. mortgages. Totally fair. Unemployment is around 10%+ with not a so bright outlooks for the next 1-2 years. Totally logical, right?

But let's look at things without fear and without emotions.

TWO's business model relies on buying and selling of RMBS's. What are the variables that affect an increase in a number of RMBS's to trade, service, and hold? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Unemployment rates (Currently Negative influence)

The economic shock from covid is a large one. But the damage has been done, the uncertainty of it is contained (more or less). Unemployment isn't going higher - it's going to go lower in the long run. I was immediately laid off back in early March at the beginning of all of this, and I was just hired on with a bigger and better employer starting early August, for more money. People want to work, people want to prosper. Like JPow said, **don't bet against the American Economy**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Interest Rates (Positive Influence)

Interest rates are historically low. It's a fact that the lower the interest rates for mortgages, the greater demand will be for them. In fact, demand is +33% YoY  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/homebuyer-mortgage-demand-spikes-33percent-as-rates-set-another-record-low.html?\_\_source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/homebuyer-mortgage-demand-spikes-33percent-as-rates-set-another-record-low.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard) 

In addition, much of the demand for new mortgage applications is in refi-loans from previous good-standing borrowers. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Strong/Healthy Economy (Currently Negative Influence)

Don't confuse the market for the economy. The markets are up, up, up. But the actual economy isn't and doesn't reflect this same short term pattern. This ties with unemployment, trade wars with China, etc. This puts downward pressure on consumer confidence and overall willingness to take out a large mortgage on a home. However, like JPow said, **don't bet against the American Economy.** The Fed is going to do whatever it takes to get the economy back to target unemployment and target inflation. Covid isn't an internal systemic weakness - it's an exogenous variable that we had to react to which has caused economic volatility. Not only that, once a viable vaccine drops, the markets are going to go crazy again. It's a waiting game.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Home Prices (Positive Influence)

The lower the price of a home, the more demand there is for it. Prices are going to continue to drop, thus having a positive effect on demand for new mortgages.  [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/) 

But wait... prices decline because of a lack in demand, right? Yes, but that's not the only variable. Prices also decline with increased supply. Increased supply will come when those newly unemployed and financially over-extended will sell to lower their payments.  From the article - “The forecasted decline in home prices will largely be due to elevated unemployment rates,” CoreLogic said. “This prediction is exacerbated by the recent spike in COVID-19 cases across the country."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the stock - Per their last earnings calls, TWO's book value is $7, (**Book value** refers to the total amount a company would be worth if it liquidated its assets and paid back all its liabilities) with a price target of $6. That means that right now they are trading 30% below their book value (5/7) = 71%. I imagine this is because there hasn't been any positive news lately. IMF downgraded their world GDP growth forecast, covid cases are rising, states are stalling their re-openings. It seems like doom and gloom. But ultimately, it's not. It's a short term shock that everyone wants to move past as soon as possible.

Overall, I'm expecting a 20-25%+ increase in price in the next 4-8 weeks once we see some good news about vaccines and the record rates of covid decline. I also expect a price target of about $10 within the next 1-2 years.

personalfinance,"Maybe this is more of a legal than finance question, but it is about my current refi process and I'm fed up.","I have been trying to refinance for about 3 months now, as in I started the process three months ago. Last Monday (June 29) we finally signed closing docs. The loan was supposed to fund on this recent Monday (July 6) to pay off our existing mortgage. That funding has still not happened and they have now requested additional paystubs for this last month and they just discovered (after three months) that we have a small solar panel loan that they need to make sure is in second position.

I had canceled the autopay on my current mortgage, but am now looking at potentially having to pay this month's payment (wasn't supposed to have to). I've had it up to here with this whole process, which gets me to my question. You get 72-hours to back out of the mortgage after signing the docs. That 72-hours is past. However, since the paperwork said that that mortgage was supposed to fund on Monday and it still has not funded, do I have a legal ability to say that the lender has violated the agreement and back out of the refinance?

My existing mortgage company just reached out today with an offer to refinance quickly and at an even lower rate than the one I am locked at with the current refi. I'd like to bail on the slow moving train wreck that I am currently on and take that option.

personalfinance,"I want to refinance my home, have debt, some savings, a decent credit score, and a plan. Does it make sense or am I just overcomplicating things?","I've owned my home for roughly 5 years. As of now, between the estimate (zestimate) and what I owe, I have roughly 100k in equity. 

When I originally bought it, I used an FHA loan, so I have the primary mortgage and the second mortgage for the closing costs. The second mortgage has a much higher interest rate and I could save over 3.5% interest on that. Plus I would save the mortgage insurance as well since the loan-to-value is below the threshold. 

In any case, I'm sold on the idea of refinancing. 

What I'm thinking of doing is taking 10k cash out so that I can pay down my roughly $6k credit card debt. I also have about 8k in savings, which is where I would draw the closing costs from this time. (about 5k) Essentially, I would be using the cash out to pay closing and my debt, while retaining my savings and making room to ramp up my saving.

I've been told multiple times that I should pay off the credit card debt with my savings because it will boost my score (which is currently 720+), but if I do that, I won't have the closing funds.

The refinance would save me a few hundred a month, and the lack of credit card bills would save me another few hundred. I'd be looking at \~$800 extra per month to put back into savings without changing my lavish lifestyle. lol

I only have monthly expenses of $369 as I live at home (and I can for another 2-3 years). Out of my $369/month expenses I pay for TV/Internet \[1GB down/40 up so there is definitely room to downgrade to a lower priced option\]/Phone/Car insurance/Spotify Family Plan.

They are currently all still in the grace period and will be until November. Due to the coronavirus bills my federal loans are $0 @ 0.0% until September but also in grace once that ends until November.

I have $6,500 in cash ($500 checking/$6,000 savings) and $12,400 in my brokerage accounts (single stock investments diversified over 6 stocks + some cash) that could be liquidated tomorrow. I drive a 17 year old BMW that while I love driving is getting older and eventually will start racking up cost it's current value via private sale is $4,700.

personalfinance,Does this refinance sound okay?,"I've been trying to do research on refinancing and wanted to reach out to the community here to see if this deal sounded okay:

We bought our home almost 2 years ago, 30 year fixed conventional for $460k (with 20% put down, so the loan was $380kish). We bought the house with my dad as a co-signer so we could qualify for the loan, because we didn't make enough income at the time. My dad didn't have a great credit score, and our interest rate is 5.25%. 

The current loan is now $359k. Now we make enough income to qualify for a loan, and our credit scores have improved and are around 730ish. 

I went through the Costco ""mortgage program"" because we have a membership, and I'm currently talking to 4 online lenders. 

Consumer Direct is offering a 2.875% interest rate, and a $1500 credit towards closing costs, making them about $300 total. We would just have to cover escrow besides that. He said our home was valued at up to $600k in his system so he is able to waive the appraisal. 

Going to 2.875% would save us over $500 a month in payments. Is this too good to be true? When I spoke with our bank BOA a month ago, she had given us an offer of rolling the closing costs into the loan, changing it from $360k to $377k. In the Consumer Direct offer we're keeping the loan at $360k. How would BOA quote $17k in closing fees and the online lenders charge so much less?

I also have an offer of 2.875% from another online lender, and 3.125% from a different one. I haven't gone back and forth with them yet, and I haven't contacted our current lender, Wells Fargo, about refinancing yet. 

I feel rushed to lock in a rate because it sounds so good and I don't want to miss the opportunity, but I don't want to be tricked. They said once I lock in the rate, I have it for 60 days.

My personal accounts have $200K in 401K and $110K in individual stocks. Together we have about $60K in checkings/savings for emergency.

Her dental school loans are killing me and I'll feel freedom once we get out from under her loans. Given the high 6.8%, I think it makes sense to refinance with a private lender as much as possible although currently, she's under an income based plan which still doesn't require her to pay as much as  she is currently paying. Does it make sense to keep paying $5K towards this loan? By paying $5K, we'll be done in roughly 8-10 years. Obviously paying this much prevents her from investing into any retirement accounts which means missing out on potential gains.

That being said, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is necessarily right. Currently, I have my money located in 3 places. A high yield account with about $10k in it that makes 0.20% APY, my standard savings that holds $2k in it and has an interest rate of 0.10% APR, and my standard checking that I try to always keep about $300 in at all times for anything small that might come up.

I'm going to a local community college here in my area to get an associate in Business &amp; IT, which with FAFSA, will still cost me about $1.5k a year I believe.

Every paycheck I get, I have 20% go directly to savings which comes to right around $150 every 2 weeks, and then the rest goes to my checking to pay for my apartment and all the things that come with that.

But what on the Lord's green earth are you all doing to remain risk averse right now?  Or are you placing your chips on the market going in a certain direction?

I started investing shortly after the 2007-2008 crash and I've never seen anything like this and have ice cold hands.  I've been trying to read a lot of sentiment/ideas/etc. and mean to form my own opinion and plan, but I've never been so clueless in lost in my short 10+ years of investing.

As of now, there seem to be two entirely different (and reasonable) viewpoints and follow-up actions to take:

* The ""BRRRR"" money printer jokes become the norm.  The fed just keeps things propped up.  The tax decreases, extended spending levels, and faster money supply increase just keeps trucking on.  Of course this results in **massive** inflation and you need to buy and hold assets of some form.
   * I was actually thinking of hedging by holding far more cash than I'm used to, buying even more real estate (not stocks - *actual* real estate), and/or bonds... or something along those lines.
   * But if this money printing fiasco does not cease, then trying to hedge with cash looks to be even more risky and foolish that it would ordinarily be.  Real estate is probably a safe bet as long as the housing market doesn't crater, which seems unlikely... but I'm sure people said the same thing in 2006-2007.  And bonds are supposedly just dumb for anyone as young as I am, especially now that banks and whomever else gobbled them up already.
* This complete fairy tale bubble we're living in pops.  Take your pick for a catalyst - housing, the fed for whatever reason pulls back, the virus lasts longer or a vaccine is delayed, etc.  The first two should be avoidable given recent history, it's anyone's guess as to how stuff with the virus proceeds.
   * Doesn't matter whether you're in a MF or index fund, you are going to get absolutely torched as the market kerplunks.
   * Many wise investors preach to never time the market -- though with the current inexplicable market conditions and sentiment... this now feels less like like trying to outsmart the market and more akin to jumping off a bridge because it's worked well for people in the past.

Is staying 50% cash / 50% stocks dumb?  It's approximately where I'm at right now, mostly because I can't find anything I view as sensible/safe to invest in and have naturally have just accumulating cash -- not because I've been selling anything in great volume.

He has struggled with depression for his entire life and it's gotten significantly worse over the last 5 years. He also struggles with bipolar disorder, and has been unable to accept the position he's in until the last few weeks, although he still is unable to state this to anyone other than myself and his sister. He had been living with his parents for the last 4 years, but we moved them into an Alzheimer care facility in November 2019, and he was forced to leave their house 30 days later.

I have funded his rent and bills since then, including several hotel stays, apartments, etc. He drove for Uber for a few months, but was consistently unable to pay the rental fee of $212/week- and I covered this for 12/14 weeks. He lives in Southern CA. He applied for PUA and unemployment on 6/8 (we have not heard back), and has just been approved for Medical as of 2 weeks ago.

I have a consultant meeting with us next week who specializes in mental health and live-in care facilities that revolve around mental health care and vocational training for basic job educational programs. Unfortunately, I know very little about these as it relates to options, specializations, and cost. He is 56 years old, has a poor back and shoulder (worked construction for years), and his depression and lack of self-confidence has prevented him from holding a job for longer than a month for the last 2 years.

I'm looking for advice regarding options that are out there, including what should I expect cost-wise, in order to get him on the right track. All suggestions are appreciated, and I will provide any and all information that I can in order to find the best possible solution. If another sub is better suited for this, please let me know and I'll move it over.

personalfinance,Indexed Universal Life Insurance?,"Hi,
A friend is changing careers into insurance and is all excited about this retirement vehicle. He had me watch the following video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX89Rk5pr6A&amp;feature=youtu.be
I'm not sure what exactly to think about it.

Apparently you can invest in Indexed Universal Life Insurance instead of or in addition to a 401k. you can take the money out any time, it is supposed to be tax advantaged. 
It follows the S&amp;P index, but there is a 'cap' on the max % change you can make and also a floor on losses so you never go below 0% change.

I am guessing the insurance company takes anything over the cap.
also what are the fees? that has to reduce the interest rate you're getting.

personalfinance,Misconception? (Income vs. Savings) My mother is afraid of saving because she want to stay eligible for Medi-Cal (California Medicaid),"My mother makes regular withdrawals from her checking account because she thinks that if the government sees that it's too high, they're going to take away her Medi-Cal.

Full disclosure: My mom does keep the cash she withdraws and recently put most of it into gold around the time of the whole Coronavirus thing, but that's not something like a retirement fund where it's earning returns, and my personal opinion of gold as an investment isn't very high. I put ""afraid of saving"" in the title because trying to explain the nuances in the title would be a nightmare.

So basically, why would the government care about how much she has saved? Wouldn't they be looking at her income? Income-wise, she definitely qualifies for Medi-Cal, being under 138% of the federal poverty level for a family of three. (138% taken from Wikipedia because I couldn't find a number on the Medi-Cal website.)

But the same Wikipedia article mentions asset tests, which could have been why my mom thought that. But as per the cited pdf from the California Health and Human Services Agency:

&gt;Note: Medi-Cal disregards property for individuals whose eligibility is determined utilizing your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI).

The Wikipedia article itself specifies that it is

&gt;individuals who receive long-term supportive services or who enroll in Medi-Cal through certain disabilities \[who\] are subject to asset tests.

So seniors, the blind, and the disabled, not those under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

I'm pretty sure that my mom is just mistaken from having heard about asset tests at some point and wrong that the government is going to take away her Medi-Cal for having too much in the the bank, but I would like a confirmation. It kind of worries me that she could be getting returns on this money by putting it in a retirement fund instead, but she hasn't. Inflation is the savings killer after all, and if your money isn't making money, you're losing money.",finance

personalfinance,How Can I Improve my Financial Situation? 26 y/o in NYC,"\[Intro\] 

 Hi Reddit, I wanted to make a post to get some thoughts on my current financial situation and also advice on how to move forward in case there are better opportunities with what to do with my money that I may be missing out on. I'm going to be extremely transparent with my income, expenses, and savings allocation because I'm looking for specific thoughts on how to improve.   


\[Context\]  

I am 26 years old and have been living &amp; working full time in tech sales for exactly 3 years in NYC. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Income\] 

My first year salary was 44k + commissions, which totalled 49k pre-tax, 35k post-tax.   
My second year salary was 46k + commissions, which totalled 57k pre-tax, 41k post-tax.  
My third year salary was 48k + commissions, which totalled 90k pre-tax, 57k post-tax.  
This comes out to 196k pre-tax, 133k post-tax.  


\[Expenses\]

 I have kept track of every single penny I have spent in the past 3 years in my personal expenses spreadsheet. In total of those past 3 years, I have spent roughly $92k, details as follows:  


|CATEGORY|TOTAL SPENT ON CATEGORY|% OF POST-TAX INCOME (133k) SPENT ON CATEGORY|
|:-|:-|:-|
|APPAREL|5440.03|4.09%|
|DRINKS|2820.89|2.12%|
|EATING OUT|17252.07|12.97%|
|GIVING|9689.94|7.29%|
|GROCERIES|4682.57|3.52%|
|RENT/UTILITIES|25849.17|19.44%|
|EVENTS/ELECTRONICS/ENTERTAINMENT/HOME NECESSITIES|21341.91|16.05%|
|TRANSPORTATION|4524.12|3.40%|
||\~92k|68.87%|

&amp;#x200B;

\[Cash/Savings/Investments/Retirement Portfolio\]

Given my math, I have made \~$133k total post-tax, and spent \~92k in the past 3 years, which equates \~41k leftover, which I have allocated as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

||$|notes|% OF TOTAL ALLOCATION|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CHECKING ACCOUNTS|18,000||36%|
|HIGH-INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT|5700|ally, 1% interest rate, deposit $25/wk|12%|
|BETTERMENT AUTO INVESTING|5100|deposit $50/wk, up 2% all time (started 2 years ago)|10%|
|BETTERMENT ROTH IRA|2100|deposit $25/wk, up 2% all time (started 2 years ago)|4%|
|ROBINHOOD STOCKS|11100|spontaneous deposits, up 25% all time (started 2 years ago)|23%|
|BITCOIN|1800|$100/bi-weekly, break-even (started 1 year ago)|4%|
|401K|5500|$323/monthly, contribute max to get full employer match of 4%|11%|
|TOTAL|\~49.3k||100%|

Altogether, everything I have comes close to around 50k, but I guess the Roth IRA and 401k should not be included, which would be closer to 43k. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Conclusion\]

I hope this is not taken the wrong way or as if I am coming across as boastful. I share because I would love any thoughts from the PF community on how I can improve in any way when it comes to

\-  my income (making more), 

\- expenses (spending less), and 

\- current allocations (cash/checkings, investments, retirement funds). 

Totally open to any and all criticism and feedback!",finance

#Rise in margin lending stokes fears of China bubble

_Sharp rally in stock market draws comparisons with 2015 downfall_

**Thomas Hale** in Hong Kong and **Wang Xueqiao** in Shanghai

Margin loans to buy equities in China have risen to their highest level in five years, prompting fears that speculation on rising prices could lead to a rerun of a notorious stock market bubble that burst in 2015.

Total margin finance in China reached Rmb1.27tn ($184bn) on Tuesday after more than a week of consecutive daily increases, according to Wind, a data service. Separate figures show investors rushing to open new accounts that give them access to loans from brokers.

The CSI 300 index, a gauge of the country’s biggest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, leapt almost 6 per cent on Monday and continued to climb on the following days, after state media extolled the benefits of a “healthy” bull market at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hit economic activity.

But the rally has drawn comparisons with the events of 2015, when state media urged individual investors to pile in to stocks as the economic backdrop weakened. Sustained in part by a crescendo of margin lending, prices doubled over the course of a year before losing more than 40 per cent of their value in a matter of months.

“I think people are getting greedy, because liquidity is abundant and there is policy support from the top,” said Hao Hong, head of research and chief strategist at Bocom International. “You can sense the speculative atmosphere.”

Trading on margin can be risky, because if the value of collateral falls the borrower may have to deposit more cash or securities. Pledged assets can also be sold without a customer’s consent, perhaps at fire-sale prices.

Margin lending is still well below the peak it reached in 2015, when it rose above Rmb2.2tn in June after doubling from its levels in February, according to Wind. But analysts say the momentum resembles the early stages of the previous boom.

On Monday turnover in “A shares”, which trade on the two main exchanges, was Rmb1.57tn, according to Morgan Stanley. That marked the highest level since the 2015 correction, indicating “high participation from not only institutional but also retail investors”, the bank’s analysts said.

Mr Hong estimates that so far this month about 12 per cent of daily trading volumes are being completed through access to margin finance, compared with 8 per cent in late June. That kind of proportion “tends to raise eyebrows”, he said.

Data from the China Securities Finance Corporation, a state-owned company which provides the country’s brokers with funding, showed that over 85,000 new margin trading accounts were opened in June — more than a one-third increase on the average over the previous year.

One user on Weibo, a popular social media site, noted that securities companies “that had not been in contact in a long time” were again advertising services offering margin trading.

Late on Wednesday, China’s securities regulator published a list of 258 platforms that it said were illegally offering margin finance. Under Chinese law, only approved brokers can provide securities financing.

Support for the capital markets has come alongside measures from China’s central bank to reduce the cost of credit as the economy grapples with the consequences of the pandemic.

“The government has been gradually loosening its monetary policy, so some of this loosening will find its way into the stock market,” said Nicholas Yeo, head of China equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong.

Despite apparent cheerleading for the market across state media outlets, some suggest the government, wary of the events of 2015, will exercise caution when it comes to allowing investors to bet with borrowed money.

Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho, expects leverage will remain the main driver of the market in the “medium term”, but expects the government to keep it at a “more controllable rate”. He noted that state media “refrained from adding fuel to the fire” after Monday’s rapid move upwards.

Morgan Stanley analysts say that margin finance appears moderate for now, equivalent to about 4 per cent of the total capitalisation of the stock market, compared to about 10 per cent at the peak in 2015. New investor registrations, meanwhile, despite rising sharply month-on-month, are a long way from the 700,000 of December 2014.

That could indicate that the rally has further to run. Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank, says China’s market is just one example of a wider trend, also present in the US, where governments seek to boost sentiment while their economies are under heavy pressure.

“If you have a strategy of just pumping up asset prices, it’s going to end in tears,” he said. “We would all sleep much better if this was all fundamentals-driven, everywhere.”",finance
personalfinance,Streamline Refi After 10+ Years -- Current Rate 6%,"My mom is 10-15 years years into an 30 year fixed FHA mortgage with a very high interest rate (6%). I attempted to refinance for her (I was planning to take over the payment management). This ended up falling through and was a bit stressful

* I do not work in the state the house is currently located
* The house has not been updated, so I feared it would not appraise well

The Mortgage balance is between 150-200K. My mom will be retiring early and is currently in the process of filing for disability. She would not have enough income to support a conventional refinance, the lender adjustment process would require income verification, and I am thinking it would be best for me not to sign on to a loan for \~15 years.

Would it make sense to do a streamline refinance? From my understanding:

* It often does not require an appraisal
* It does not require income verification (she has stellar credit)

The negative though is that we would have to do another 30 year term, restarting the clock (to my knowledge you can not streamline into a smaller term). I think this could be worth it to escape the 6% and just pay extra each month toward the mortgage.

Any insights here will be greatly appreciated. For instance, am I overlooking something?",finance

Long story short, about 3 years ago I found out I was pregnant and gave birth the same day. Insurance is saying that only prenatal care is covered under my plan (at the time I was on my parent's insurance thanks to the ACA, and only the employee got the full maternal benefits not dependents.)

The hospital fought with them for about a year, and I was only notified that I actually owed when I checked my Credit Karma and it showed I had $33k from the hospital in collections. 

Recently, we have been really buckling down and trying to pay off all of our debt so that we have a little more room in our budget, but I feel like I will be paying on this the rest of my life. Our plan was to buy a house in about 3 years, and we are not willing to stop saving for that. 

Currently I make about 55k a year and my husband makes 60k (before tax). We borrowed against his 401k to pay off some credit cards with high interest rates, and paying that back is taking away most of his paycheck. We are also paying back some past due taxes and other smaller collection debts related to me being young and stupid with money. We should have the smaller things, student loans, and my car payed off  by next year. 

We currently have a $10k emergency/downpayment fund that I was only willing to touch if the collections agency would settle for $5k. No surprise, they were only able to reduce it to $23k. I'm working with the hospital to see what can be done, but am still waiting a response. My husband is wanting to consider bankruptcy and then wait until it falls off our reports to buy a house, but I feel like that is a little extreme. We are planning a move to southern CA for my job next year, and I don't want that to ruin our chances to get an apartment or lose our cars and credit cards that we currently have.

When I input the carryover for the federal return everything picks up properly, however Credit Karma is trying to claim the remaining 11K on the state return that was already claimed in 2017.

personalfinance,I agreed to put in my two weeks notice from a verbal offer for a new job? What's the best next move?,"I've been in a pretty unhappy with my current employer for awhile, and found a job at a medical clinic I thought I'd do well with. When I got a call for the offer a couple days ago, I agreed to put in my two weeks before signing anything?  

For my other jobs, it was standard practice to fill out employment forms the first day of the job. I off handedly stumbled on an article saying it was the worst thing I could have done, because I'd be out two jobs if they took back the offer and I put in my notice already. I've been worried sick to put in my notice, even though I'm supposed to do it in two days. 

The HR lady seemed to really like me at the interview, and we've remained in contact since. She's emailed an informal confirmation of the start date, pay, and enthusiastically called to say I passed their background check on me. She told me I should put my notice in ASAP as they were already short-staffed and need me quickly.

It feels like I have two options: either risk raising red flags for my new employer by demanding to sign documents before my start date in 2.5 weeks/ hounding them for an official offer letter from HR. Or I could not give my employer notice, leave on my start date, and burn a lot of bridges I spent years building up. 

Second, I also didn't discuss any of the extra benefits posted on the job listing (medical, dental, paid time off) because I was too focused on getting the job. It's clear I need to work on advocating for myself, and making sure I get things signed first. The HR person did seem a little more casual, but others have told me she might be doing this to take advantage.

I was thinking of sending an email that goes ""thank you again for the role, I was wondering if your HR team would be able to send me an official offer letter, going over things like vacation and paid time off for this role"". I already sent them a ""thank you"" email after the verbal offer before the background check confirmation, so I feel like this may raise red flags or at the very least make me look stupid.

personalfinance,Pay off 0% Federal Student Loans or invest?,"Hey /r,

Planning on moving out in September.. Wanted to originally free myself of student debt before moving out. Ever since the Coronavirus, interest rates on the loans have been 0%.

Im 27 y/o.

Here is how I stand (approx) and had a couple of questions:

Company stock: $5,500

Own brokerage: $x,xxx

Savings: 10K (Will save another 6k by September)

Fed Loan @ 0% Interest: 11k

Instead of using company stock to pay loans, I thought about reinvesting that money since the loans are at 0%. Even though I've been really excited about being debt free just because of the psychological factor debt has on one's mind.

Wanted to see what some of you guys would do.

Banking,Can I get backpay on interest?,"Hello r/banking, I’m a 20F from the US. Around late January of this year I decided to move my emergency fund out of Wells Fargo to another bank since I was making only 0.01% at Wells Fargo (ugh).  I found a credit union that would give me 1.75% APY in a fed up money market.  I moved about 10k into the credit union to meet their deposit minimum and didn’t really check up on it since it’s just my emergency fund.  Fast forward to last week when I decided to check and see what rate I was getting because I knew it had likely gone down.  I called and they told me I was getting 0.25%.  I questioned about how it has gone down so far from the 1.75% and they said I was never getting that.  
Yesterday I went in to question them again and they looked at me like I was crazy for thinking I was getting 1.75% but once I said close the account and give my cash they looked into it further.  It turns out they put it in a personal money market with a 0.25% apy instead of the fed up mm I signed for.  I called today and they said they switched the accounts over but they didn’t back pay me for the lost interest.  Am I entitled to that?

personalfinance,"First time homeowner: 401K Loan, Less than 20% down, or both?","My wife and I just signed the contract on our new home.  I'm looking for some guidance on the best means for financing this purchase.  

The home is in Westchester, NY, and will require some work over time.  We would like to do some minor renovations (replace carpet on first floor with flooring, and replace carpet in bedrooms) before we move in, and the more significant projects down the road (kitchen, and bathrooms).  

We've factored in a $20K emergency fund on top of projecting out closing costs and down payment.  In order to do this work, I have 2 options (as we need a little more money than what we have currently).  

1. 401K Loan (no penalty, repayment is done directly out of each paycheck and paid back with 3.25% interest for a term up to 15 years)
2. Less than 20% down with PMI.  PMI's are around $85 for 15% Down, and interest rates are super low.  Rates of around 3%

Which is the better option of the two, or should I do some combination of both?  I could put less than 15% as well and have a ""jump start"" on the cash I need for the larger renovations.  With rates this low, is there any benefit to doing that if the cash will most likely be sitting in an online savings account yielding a little over 1%?  The alternative option for the surplus cash from less down is to save the cash in full for the renovation, or take out a Home Equity loan.  The time horizon on that renovation would ideally be within the next 5 years (or hopefully 3).",finance

personalfinance,How can I identify the best private loan to help me pay for medical school?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get a student loan to pay for medical school (MD, matriculating in August). The estimated COA is between $83,000 and $92,000 a year (it varies by year) and I plan on taking out \~$50,000 in loans a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am incredibly grateful to be able to pay for the remainder of the cost from personal savings, financial aid, scholarships, grants, and some help from parents. The $50,000/year estimate already takes into account money set aside for an emergency fund. I also do not have any remaining debt (credit card or student loans from undergraduate studies).

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get quotes for student loans for the fall. I already have some highly subsidized loans from my institution and plan on taking out some federal loans in the case that there are chances for federal loan forgiveness in the future (namely through the [PSLF](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) since I intend to work for a non-profit University after I finish my training. There is little data as to how often this gets granted and I do not intend on pursuing other primary-care-focused student loan relief programs so I want to hedge my risk on this front). I, however, have the understanding that private loans tend to be lower in cost after you factor in the high origination fees for the federal loans.

&amp;#x200B;

For further context, I have excellent credit (score &gt;800) and will be cosigning with a parent who also has excellent credit (score &gt;820). I also have enough cash in reserves that I would make payments on the loans during school in an attempt to mitigate the amount I pay down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I have the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there any way I can get multiple quotes for potential student loans without having multiple 'checks' on my credit history? I recently got a quote from Discover but was also notified by Mint that it counted as a check on my credit. I do not want to 'shop around' and have multiple hits on my credit score since that may hurt my interest rates.
2. Should I consider looking at loans from other sources, namely credit unions? I do not belong to a credit union but do not know if that is an avenue worth exploring if I would be a new member. I imagine there may be credit unions for healthcare workers that I could join.
3. Is there a general 'rule' to see whether a fixed or a variable loan would be 'better' in the long term? I am inclined to pursue the 'fixed' route since the 'variable' route seems riskier but 'variable' yielded lower costs according to Discover. I am not sure if that is just the case since interest rates are especially low right now.
4. Are there any private institutions that are known to offer generous interest rates to medical students? A bit of a stretch, but something I figured I would ask about.

personalfinance,Universal life insurance...looking for advice,"24M and I have a universal life insurance with index-linked interest. My premium is $200/month. And I have paid $1600 until now.

My agent (who is my friends dad) signed me up about 8 months ago. I told him that I wanted to cancel my policy after doing some research and reading that pretty much nobody should have this kind of life insurance and that my money would be better placed elsewhere. I was able to maximize my ROTH IRA for 2019 and plan on doing that moving forward. My agent swears to me that this insurance policy is a great place to invest my money in for the future. He says that putting in stocks, Roth IRA are risky because you can lose out on $ opposed to the insurance policy that cannot go down when the market goes down. The drawback is that there is a cap on the interest rate. I am ok with losing out on the $1600 if I cancel my policy if this doesnt seem like a good place to put my money. I just wanted to hear peoples thoughts and experiences they had with universal life insurance.

First, it asks your city, your credit score (To calculate interest rate), your pre-tax income, and any monthly debt you have. 

Based on my city and my credit score, it estimates my interest rate to be 3.2%. That's fine, doesn't matter. What confuses me is that if my annual income is $62.7k and I have no monthly debt and could afford a $20k down payment (Far less than 20% of any house I'd buy), it says I could afford a 310k house, with a monthly payment of $1,877.

The $1,877 part confuses me. I am paid biweekly - on average I make a little about $3.2k a month after taxes (Except those unicorn months where I get paid 3x a month, then it's about $4.8k). Mousing over the little scrubber it creates, it says the ideal debt-to-income ratio is 36%, and my monthly income is $5.2k. I get where they got the $5.2k: 62.7/12. But it's like the calculator doesn't take into account the taxes/health care/savings plans that get taken out of the paycheck automatically. If I calculate those pieces myself, it's about $1500/mo. If I put those in my ""monthly debts"" column, suddenly I can only afford a $64k house with a monthly payment of less than $400/mo. 

It feels like two opposite ends of the spectrum. I feel like $1900/mo is way out of my price range, but I'd never find a any house at $400/mo. Am I misunderstanding something? Is the calculator just not very good? Is there a different site I should use? I've played with the scrubber and set my monthly payment to what I'd be willing to spend on rent in an apartment (My max is about $1k-$1.1k), but now I don't trust the calculator at all because I don't understand it.

* Leave WA to move closer to family in 3-4 years
* Spend time working abroad for a few years in the future
* Not be financially dependent on staying in one place (as I've heard is the case for many teachers' pensions)

# Current Retirement Accounts/Situation

* **Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)** 
   * About $5,000 in a 2050 Lifecycle Fund
   * All in the Traditional TSP -- no Roth
* **Washington Teachers' Retirement System (TRS)** 
   * About $10,000 in a 401(a) 2055 Retirement Strategy Fund
   * Contributing 15% monthly with no employer match -- cannot change contribution unless/until I change employers
   * *(There is an employer contributed defined benefit portion that I will not get because I will not stay in Washington long enough to get vested.)*
* **Fiance's situation:** My fiance is 30 with no retirement savings, but we expect that to change this year.

# Some Questions

* Is there any reason I shouldn't start an IRA now? I realized I skipped that step in the flowchart.
* Once I leave employment in Washington, should I roll my TRS contributions into my TSP?
* Are the 2050 and 2055 funds ""bad"" places to keep my money in any way? The PF Wiki had good things to say about the TSP Lifecycle Funds, but I remember my coworkers had really strong opinions about ""good"" and ""bad"" funds.
* As my student loan payments are based on my AGI, are there any other ways I might want to look out for to lower my AGI more as I plan for retirement? (This is why I was contributing to the Traditional TSP.)
* Is there anything else I should plan for or avoid if I want to stay flexible on where I live and work in the future?

personalfinance,Thinking about refinancing the mortgage,"Hello! I enjoy all the wonderful responses this group offers and would appreciate your thoughts on this situation.

My fiance (getting married early 2021) is 8 years into a 30 year FHA loan for a duplex, with a rate of 3.5%. Original loan amount was $159,900, current balance is about $129,000. Value of the home has increased, and we believe is at least around $230,000 (could be $250,000). PMI is still on the loan and will be until we have 78% of the original loan amount paid. He also has a HELOC loan with a balance of $30,000 that he has been working on paying off for about the last year. Interest rate is variable, currently 4.49%, and originally was a 10 year loan. 

Monthly required payments for these loans are \~$363 for the HELOC and \~$870 for the mortgage principle, interest and PMI (not including taxes and property insurance which will not change with refinance).

He/we want to refinance with the primary goal of saving overall on interest. We are also looking to buy a single-family home in the next 1-2 years (hopefully), with the goal of keeping this property as a rental. We currently live in one side of the duplex and rent out the other. Fiancé is handy, can fix most things, feels comfortable with being a landlord and wants to continue.

We were given the following options from a local credit union to refinance and combine the mortgage and HELOC balances:

1. 15 year rapid refi option at 2.75% ($1,087 monthly for principle and interest), only $149 closing costs, no points required and no appraisal needed or other fees (need to clarify this but that is what the website says)
2. 30 year rapid refi option at 3.25% ($696 monthly for principle and interest), $149 closing cost
3. 30 year traditional refi with monthly payment of $694
4. 20 year traditional refi with monthly payment of $903
5. 15 year traditional refi with monthly payment of $1096 

The traditional refis would also require closing costs of $1700 and paying points equal to \~$1700 for the 30 and 20 year, and possibly less for the 15 year option. 

Currently, he/we are leaning towards the rapid refi 30 year option. Our plan would be to put $500 extra towards the balance each month so the loan is paid off in closer to 15 years rather than 30 (we plan to inquire to make sure early payoff is allowed before proceeding). I realize we would save more on interest with the 15-year rapid refi offer. However, given the unprecedented world circumstances, we find the lower required payment attractive in-case we were to end up without a tenant in one of the duplex units for a short time (he has had zero issues keeping tenants, however I realize renting two units increases the risk and also renters may experience financial difficulties given COVID). I am confident in our commitment to pay the extra $500 as it is equal to what we are paying now for the HELOC and mortgage combined. We are living below our means, saving money every paycheck (for retirement, emergency fund, and a down payment for the next house) and I am confident in our budgeting skills. 

Questions:

When would our break-even point be with the 30-year rapid refi? I am having trouble calculating this given the HELOC being included but it seems like it would happen rather quickly..

Rapid refi options seem significantly better than traditional thus I haven’t done the math with the traditional offers. The only restriction for rapid refi is you need 30% equity based on an AVM appraisal, which we are confident we will likely meet (waiting for mortgage officer to contact us again to confirm). Is there another possible catch we should investigate? If for some reason we don’t have 30% equity, we can make a lump sum payment to get there if needed. 

We have not inquired with other lenders because we trust this credit union and already had to wait 2 weeks to hear from them after applying. Also, the interest rates seem on par with other advertised rates I’ve seen. Do we need to consider other lenders?",finance

...Rates being quoted are as of 6/10/2020 and at an interest rate of 2.750% (2.788% APR) on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a total of 360 payments.

Rates may change or not be available at the time of commitment, lock-in, or closing. 

...Your APR may be higher if mortgage insurance and/or a funding fee is required. 

...The monthly cash out payments was calculated in two parts: The original mount borrowed on the existing mortgage plus $5500 for closing costs at an interest rate quoted above.""

I am interested in the lower rate, not the cash out. Current mortgage is about $348k on the home and I can't be certain of the exact current market value of our home but I would guess it's anywhere around $480k-570k. 

Our current rate is 3.5%. Credit score is good.

Our house needs to appraise for at least $500k to hit the loan to value amount of 70%. 

But if it does, we could remove PMI and have a lower rate, which will reduce our monthly payment by quite a bit around $300-400.

A YouTube channel called ""Etherium Blockchain"" with 65.5k subscribers appeared in my recommended feed with a live stream featuring Vitalik Buterin speaking about Etherium at a conference.  Supposedly 62k viewers were tuning in (likely bots inflating numbers).  The video was embedded with a still describing a ""50,000 ETH Giveaway"" where you could send a minimum of 3ETH to an address and get back double the amount.  Chat was disabled, so you could not discuss the legitimacy of the ""giveaway"".

In the video there was a link to a website linked called ""[event-eth.info](https://event-eth.info),"" a domain registered by ""Afilias Limited"" of Dublin, Ireland.  The tidy website explains the giveaway and presents a time-imperative: ""45,678 ETH of 50,000"" already have been given away!  It is complete with a spoofed listing of purported transactions showing wallets getting their double ETH rewards immediately after sending their ETH to the address.

While the concept of sending crypto somewhere and trusting the sender will send more back your way seems ludicrous, the ability to launch the scam video under the brand of a seemingly legitimate Etherium YouTube channel featuring a a large number of subscribers and viewers with a ""live stream"" of Vitalik was enough to catch people out.

Before the video could be reported and taken down, two members of the community sent 3TH each, netting the scammer(s) approximately $1,500.

Get ready because unprecedented wealth destruction is coming.

July 9 (King World News) – Alasdair Macleod:  So far, the current economic situation, together with the response by major governments, compares with the run-in to the depression of the 1930s. Yet to come in the repetitious credit cycle is the collapse in financial asset values and a banking crisis.

When the scale of the banking crisis is known the scale of monetary inflation involved will become more obvious. But in the politics of it, Trump is being set up as the equivalent of Herbert Hoover, and presumably Joe Biden, if he is well advised, will soon campaign as a latter-day Roosevelt. In Britain, Boris Johnson has already called for a modern “new deal”, and in his “Hundred Days” his Chancellor is delivering it.

In the thirties, prices fell, only offset by the dollar’s devaluation in January 1934. This time, monetary inflation knows no limit. The wealth destruction through monetary inflation will be an added burden to contend with compared with the situation ninety years ago.

Introduction
Boris Johnson recently compared his reconstruction plan with Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. Such is the myth of FDR and his new deal that even libertarian Boris now invokes them. Unless he is just being political, he shows he knows little about the economic situation that led to the depression.

It would not be unusual, even for a libertarian politician. FDR is immensely popular with the inflationists who overwhelmingly wrote the economic history of the depression era. In fact, FDR was not the first “something must be done” American president, a policy which started with his predecessor, Herbert Hoover. But the story told is that FDR took over from heartless Hoover who had failed to step in and rescue the economy from a free-market catastrophe, by standing back and letting events take their course instead. Nothing is further from the truth: Hoover was an interventionist to his fingertips. The last of the laissez-faire presidents was Calvin Coolidge, Hoover’s predecessor. 

A few years ago, the BBC broadcast a programme extolling the virtues of FDR and his new deal. Stephanie Flanders, at that time the BBC’s economics correspondent, reiterated the myth about Hoover being a non-interventionist and FDR having all the correct reflationary policies. In a piece to camera at the Hoover Dam, no less, she recounted how it was an example of FDR’s new deal stimulus. While it wasn’t completed until 1936, building started in 1931 as a project by the eponymous Hoover, pursuing the same interventionist policies as FDR before FDR’s landslide election. It was never FDR’s project, the clue being in the dam’s name. Research by Flanders and the BBC was either biased, deficient, blind or all three.

The myth that has even drawn in Boris is so powerful it has intelligent people swearing the earth is flat. The FDR fairy-story is fundamental to the modern state’s interventionist stance; the very reason for its existence and its welfare commitments to the electorate. Wishful thinking about FDR’s pioneering role is now the pervasive theology. But the way the world is viewed cannot change the facts, and to quote FDR and his new deal as the template for economic policy is to repeat the errors that led to the longest and deepest depression in American history.

If in a few words one was to sum up why the state fails in its interventionist quest, it would be its inability to understand change. Free markets change all the time. Businesses and whole industries evolve and disappear in a natural process of selection driven by the consumer. The state’s response to a crisis is always aimed at a return to normality; normality being an unchanged state from before the crisis. The state protects yesterday’s jobs and yesterday’s businesses. Worse, by preventing evolutionary change at the heart of a dynamic economy it deprives it of the resources required to evolve. And that’s why the depression lasted into the Second World War.

The back-story to the depression

Before Hoover, US presidents understood a hands-off policy would let the economy rapidly fix itself. The post-war 1920—1921 depression in America was allowed to run its course. It lasted just eighteen months and was the prelude to a period of technological revolution that gave enormous benefits in the quality of life for all Americans. Following President Harding’s death in 1923, Coolidge was elected the new president. While Coolidge enforced a strict laissez-faire policy, he was either unaware of or ignored the monetary policies of Benjamin Strong at the Fed, which, to be fair to Coolidge, was only a decade old. The Fed’s monetary policy was the cause of an inflationary boom which ended in a stockmarket bubble in 1929.

In 1927, Coolidge announced he would not be standing for a second term, and Herbert Hoover was elected President in 1928 nearly a year before the  stock market crisis occurred.

Fuelled by a free market approach and the stimulus of unbacked credit, when Hoover took office in March 1929 the economy was, in the epithet of historians, roaring. We can now begin our comparison with the present day. Boris Johnson became Prime Minister after a similar inflation-fuelled period; but the more important correlation is with Republican Donald Trump, whose interventionist policies imitate Hoover’s from his time as Secretary of Commerce in Harding’s administration onwards. Hoover deported immigrants and Trump builds a wall, both reasoning they take American jobs. And like Hoover, Trump uses tariffs to protect farmers and businesses from foreign competition deemed unfair.

The combination of a massive credit expansion in the 1920s and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed by congress in October 1929 — the month of the Wall Street Crash — serves as a template for the condition of America’s economy today. Apart from some differences in timing, the most significant difference is in the money. Before April 1933 the dollar was freely exchangeable by the public for gold at $20.67 to the ounce; today the dollar is unbacked. Prices were stable, today they rise.

By passing the Smoot-Hawley Act at the top of the credit cycle, Congress ensured a sharp downturn in the economic outlook, persuading bankers to call in their loans. The economy began to contract, and interventionist Hoover went to work. To quote from his memoires;

“…the primary question at once arose as to whether the President and the Federal government should undertake to investigate and remedy the evils… No President before had ever believed that there was a governmental responsibility in such cases. No matter what the urging on previous occasions, Presidents steadfastly had maintained that the Federal government was apart from such eruptions . . . therefore, we had to pioneer a new field.”

Hoover called a series of White House conferences with industry leaders and bankers to persuade them to invest and maintain wages in order to keep consumer spending going. Like the neo-Keynesians of today, Hoover believed consumer spending was vital for the economy, but failed to make the connection with production, which is always first in temporal order, and provides the product for consumption without which it cannot happen. Hoover’s view on maintaining wages is reflected today in minimum wage rates, which innocuous though they may seem render certain activities uneconomic.

As is the case today, the Fed was ready to inflate. According to Murray Rothbard, the Fed
“…was just as ready to try to cure the depression by inflating further. It stepped in immediately to expand credit and bolster shaky financial positions. In an act unprecedented in its history, the Federal Reserve moved in during the week of the crash—the final week of October—and in that brief period added almost $300 million to the reserves of the nation’s banks. During that week, the Federal Reserve doubled its holdings of government securities, adding over $150 million to reserves, and it discounted about $200 million more for member banks.”

Monetary policy was a doppelganger for the Fed’s policies today. In today’s money, $300 million is about $26bn, using gold as the conversion factor. Today’s stimulus is a thousand times greater in real terms — so far.

In 1932 Roosevelt won a landslide against Hoover, and as was the custom at the time he took office the following March. Only a week before, an assassination attempt on Roosevelt struck the wrong man who died shortly afterwards. Banks were failing. Farmers were in revolt. The numbers of unemployed were increasing alarmingly. Hoover’s reflationary policies had failed, and he was said to be the least popular man in America on inauguration day. Fast-forward eighty-eight years and we see President Trump following in Hoover’s footsteps in this election year; and we can be pretty sure Joe Biden — if he is not asleep at the wheel — will cast himself as the new FDR with his version of the new deal.

Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address, which included the famous line, “So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” His speech was followed by the Hundred Days, the first time a president had set such a schedule.
In Britain, Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, is now pursuing his version of a Hundred Days announcing subsidies and new support as the occasion demands, financed by monetary inflation.
 Admittedly Sunak remains a free marketeer but has yet to prove his measures are temporary. Meanwhile, President Trump is destroying his administration’s finances in an attempt to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus in his election year.

They say that repeating a failed action in search of a different outcome is a sign of madness. Hoover and Roosevelt were pioneers of today’s failed economic policies and it is their post-war successors who are arguably certifiable. But the problem is deeper than that, with the public voting for the same failed policies, so even an economically literate politician has to deliver solutions in that context. It is what makes history repetitious. Instead of economics, psychological factors drive politics, including the public desire for the state to provide easy solutions to economic and personal difficulties. But the lesson from the Hoover era is that we stand on the precipice of an economic collapse as a result of a combination of excessive credit creation in the years before and the introduction of trade tariffs. And that was before the coronavirus was added to this lethal mix.

The psychology suggests that this time the politicians and the monetary authorities will pursue much the same course as before, even more aggressively. So far, the evidence supports this thesis, and it allows us to anticipate mistakes yet to be made.

The credit cycle and the banks
A notable feature of the Wall Street crash and the onset of the depression were bank failures. Not only had the 24,000 American commercial banks extended unbacked credit throughout the 1920s, but their reserves were to an extent, fictitious. This arose from double counting cheques in the process of clearing, remaining in the cash reserves of the bank upon which it was drawn while being immediately credited to the receiving bank’s cash reserves.

But when the public began to withdraw cash in increasing amounts this false liquidity was exposed. The initial banking panic began in November 1930 in Tennessee when a correspondent network in Nashville collapsed after the Bank of Tennessee closed its doors, forcing over 100 institutions to suspend operations. And as the contraction in bank credit continued, additional correspondent systems imploded. That was only the start of it. The Bank of the United States in New York in December was followed by a new banking crisis in Chicago the following June, this time involving real estate. In 1932 over 2,000 banks closed, and in 1933 a further 4,000.[iii]

The banking scene is very different today. Instead of many thousands of small one and two-branch banks the system is dominated by large international behemoths, global systemically important banks — the G-SIBs. They operate under the rules and regulations of the Basel Committee, currently Basel III, administered by national regulators.

Aping the crookery of double-counting floating cheques, today’s banks game the system, this time aided and abetted by the regulators, who, so long as the forms are correctly filed, are happy to look the other way. Indeed, as their stress tests have shown they would rather gloss over the issue of inadequate capitalisation.
The full weakness of the global banking system is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the leverage between total assets on the G-SIB balance sheets and their market capitalisation. The regulators persist in using the relationship between total assets and balance sheet equity instead, despite the market valuing a typical bank’s equity at considerably less than book value.
￼

Bank equity valuations on 8 July have benefited from the liquidity-driven rally in global stock markets, with Deutsche Bank’s shares, for example, almost doubling from a low of €4.50 in mid-March. The recovery is not a sign of new-found strength but merely reflects the severe disconnection between rising financial asset values and a collapsing economy, which will almost certainly lead to a substantial adjustment to the detriment of financial asset values.

The full weaknesses of the current system are described in a paper on the big UK banks, jointly authored by Dean Buckner and Kevin Dowd. Figure 1 was constructed using the methodology in that paper. It is a strongly recommended read for anyone seeking to understand the severe risks associated with not just the UK banking system, but the G-SIBs in all jurisdictions plus other significant banks not on the G-SIB list.

With a fundamentally weak global banking system, over-leveraged and virtually guaranteed to collapse as current financial and economic conditions deteriorate, a new banking failure could make the first wave of bank failures in 1930 Nashville look like a vicar’s tea-party. The failure of just one major bank anywhere in the world is likely to degenerate into a widespread panic, because global regulation has ensured they all game the system similarly and they all share the same weaknesses to greater or lesser degree.
In another potentially fatal error, following the Lehman crisis the G-20 agreed new rules designed to ensure that the costs of future bank failures are to be carried by bond holders and large depositors as well as shareholders, and not governments. Fortunately, this bail-in route is intended to be optional, but there is a risk that in a widespread banking crisis one or more of the G-20 members will go down the bail-in route, probably for banks not on the G-SIB list but smaller and no less significant banks. With some bailing-out and some bailing-in, simple nationalisation and preservation of all customer deposits becomes less likely, prompting a collapse not just in the banks bailed in, but a panic in all bank bonds and major deposits which would otherwise be protected in a clean bail-out.
Putting the bail-in uncertainty to one side, instead of a series of bank failures between 1930-33 today’s global banking interdependence suggests one major crisis is more likely, which arguably has already started given the liquidity injections that have taken place since last September, commencing in the repo market.

A difference from the thirties is that cash money today is a lower proportion of overall money supply, payments being overwhelmingly electronic. Depositors queueing up to withdraw their funds in old fashioned bank runs cannot be ruled out, but today failing banks find funds transferred from them far more swiftly by electronic means, particularly from larger account balances lacking depositor protection.

One reason that central banks have encouraged the abandonment of cash is to lessen banks’ vulnerability to old fashioned bank runs. Instead, by acting as back-stop liquidity provider, even when other banks reduce credit lines to a stricken bank, the intention is that no bank need fail. By the creation of bank reserves through QE and using the repo facility to provide overnight liquidity, commercial banks are already drawing on this support, without which there would almost certainly have been a banking crisis already.
On this basis, bank failures are already here, only they are hidden from public view. All that’s needed is for bank bond holders and large depositors to wake up fully to the risks to their capital for the banking crisis to become public. And that’s why the values of financial assets cannot be permitted to slide, because if they were to do so the whole financial system would rapidly collapse.

Money differences
In the 1930s the dollar was exchangeable for gold until one month after Roosevelt’s inauguration, when he signed an executive order banning the ownership of gold and gold certificates. It was a prelude to the devaluation of the dollar to $35 to the ounce the following January, the rate at which US citizens were forbidden to own gold. Apart from that devaluation, and despite its demonetarisation from gold the dollar retained its objective exchange value, while the depression led to falling prices for traded goods and commodities.

Falling prices were the natural consequence of the contraction of bank credit, the imposition of trade tariffs and failing price support operations. Instead of inflationary unbacked bank credit contracting, it was sound money in the form of a gold-backed dollar that took the blame. The inflationists were in control in both fact and of the narrative, but they couldn’t quite discard gold altogether — that didn’t happen until 1971.

Today there is no backing for government currencies, being entirely fiat. There is therefore no restriction in the deployment of an inflationary tax to balance the government’s books. Measured in gold, the dollar has already lost 98% of its purchasing power since the late sixties, and now its supply is being increased at an unprecedented rate.

The mistake being made by central banks is to not understand that money is merely the mechanism for converting an individual’s labour into consumption. It is the means by which we compare one good against another. It is not, as modern economists seem to think, a means for individuals to evaluate the cheapness or dearness of a good in isolation. If that was the case, then current and prospective prices would broadly have the effect they expect.
The failure of monetary policy, therefore, is in large measure due to the error of not understanding the true role of money in the economy. It wasn’t the increased purchasing power of the dollar in the 1930s which contracted the economy, but the withdrawal of bank credit combined with trade tariffs. Similarly, the falling purchasing power of the dollar today will not, on its own, stimulate consumption. This is not to merely dismiss the distortions in the market from changes in the quantity of money, which are damaging in many other respects. But above all, the debasement of the currency impoverishes the creative economy, the exact opposite of the effect intended.

It remains to be seen how far the destruction of fiat money will go, but as Figure 2 shows, M1 money has already jumped sharply — by 104% annualised between 24 February to 22 June.
￼

Conclusion
Unfortunately, governments in the developed nations are making the same mistakes dealing with the current economic crisis as they made ninety years ago. As was the case between 1930—1933 we can be almost certain of a banking crisis. This time it will be global and almost certainly will require banks to be taken into public ownership. The cost will be immense, and it will be paid for by inflationary means.

The scale of it will mean an unprecedented destruction of wealth — hardly the basis for economic recovery. At the same time statist preservation of existing production for fear of unemployment will hamper, not help economic recovery; and, so long as fiat currencies retain any exchange value, there can be no economic revival.
Indeed, the most important difference from the 1930s is the money, which could well collapse entirely. Guided by the pre-Keynesian economic theory of the Austrian school, of the economic consequences we can be certain. The political consequences in the long run can only be guessed",cryptocurrency

The way that this loan works is that the monthly payment stays the same, but length of the payoff changes based upon the interest rate and stuff. Yes, I know this is odd, but it worked out great whenever I signed up for it. Right now, the pay off is just under 14 years.

I got a quote from Earnest this morning. For a 10 year fixed rate loan, the interest rate would be 3.66% and a monthly payment of $152. If the interest rate was around 3%, I would probably pull the trigger on it. However, with nearly a 1% difference in interest rates, I don't think this is a good idea. So, right now, I'm leaning towards just upping my monthly payment from $110 to $150 which will put the pay off at around 9.5 years considering the current interest rate.

Are there any other options for refinancing of private student loans? What are your thoughts? Should I keep me existing loan but pay more each month? Or go with the Earnest which at this point doesn't seem like a good idea? Any other options that I'm not considering at this point?",finance

investing,Canada Recovers 950K Jobs in June,"Total loss from the pandemic was around 3 million.

290K gained in May and 950K in June, so about 1.24M recovered. 1.76M remaining.

Most places in Canada entered second phase reopening in mid June. So this includes most accommodations, leisure and tourist businesses. 

This also comes off a deficit reveal by the federal government this week of close to $340B. Most of the deficit comes from the income supports the government has been providing since March.

The wage subsidy and employment insurance programs will receive massive boosts over the coming months which is costed into that deficit.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. Mortgage,"Hello! I finished paying off all non-student loan debt and am thinking about buying a home. I know there are mixed feelings about buying a home before loans are paid off but I feel with interest rates so low I should take advantage. I am also considering refinancing my loans- and am wondering if I should choose a more aggressive loan payment which will allow me to pay off student loans in 5 years but save much more slowly for a home, or do a 10 or 12-year option where I could save up faster.

Some details about me:

Annual yearly income before taxes: $105,000

Credit score: Excellent (around 780)

Loans: 60k of student loans. I pay $735 a month with a plan to have paid off in 2029. I want to refinance regardless of buying a home since I have found lower interest rates. I can go as low as $400-$500 a month, with a 12-year payout, or about 1100 a month for a 5-year payoff.

I graduated from grad school 2 years ago and have since paid off $18,000 of credit card and personal loans (which helped with living expenses on a very small stipend). I want to use the monthly payment I was devoting towards paying that amount down to save for a down payment. 

I have emergency savings and contribute 8% to my 401k with a 4% match.

Currently, I rent in an expensive city- my partner and I pay $2300+ utilities for a 2 bedroom apartment. I feel for approximately the same housing costs I can buy outside the city. 

Any and all advice appreciated- thank you so much!!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage- 60 day lock in rate bait n switch?,"Hi All, im buying a home. The mortgage is being processed. Their lock in rate procedure seems pretty sketchy to me. I want to lock in the current rate of 2.875 for 60 days. But the bank says if you want to lock in your rate for 60 days, youre interest rate will now be 3.125. Their 60 day lock rates are ""unpublished"" and the current rates are based on 30 day rates. Here in ny it takes 60 days to close btw.
The loan disclosure i signed says nothing about getting an increased rate if you lock in for 60 days. In fact in says the opposite, ""The loan rate may be locked within 60 days of your requested close date at no cost, provided that... Creditunion is in receipt of the signed disclosures package and appraisal fee deposit. ""
They have signed disclosures and appraisal $.
Locking for 60 days would result in me paying over 10G extra in the life of the loan. Hows that no cost? How did they decide to increase this much? Why not say new rate is 3.5? There no documentation of this and they want me to spend another 10G for it?
What do you think?

All I want to do is reduce the amount of withholding from my weekly check to the minimum amount allowed. I get paid $\~300 weekly before taxes, and $\~23 is withheld. I've read that to reduce withholding you use line 3 of the 2020 W4. Okay. Line 3 already says $6500 on it because of my dependents. Do I change that to $7700 ($6500 + $1200 \[$\~23 withheld x 52 weeks in a year\])? Or do I use the amount of weeks LEFT this year instead? If it is 7700, what if I put an even higher number like 9000? Is this against the law even though I still probably wouldn't owe taxes come February? Every refund season I get over 10,000 back which is way too much. I'd much rather be paid as much as possible in my weekly checks than give the government a 0% interest loan every week.

personalfinance,Should I consider refinancing Parent Plus loan?,"Hi guys, I've learned a lot from this community in the last year ($10,587 in debt paid off since July 2019, $29,203 left to go) and I could use some advice! I'm 26 and live in a medium-to-high COL city, credit score 715.

Current debts are as follows:

* Discover It CC: $2,270 balance (opened this card to transfer $4,500 of high interest CC debt in December), 0% APR expires March 2021 but I will have it paid off next month)
* Upstart personal loan: $2,916 balance, 12.07% APR (I know, I know - attacking this one as soon as I eradicate the Discover It balance)
* Direct Parent PLUS loan (in my mom's name): $7,616 balance, 6.59% APR (I'm responsible for paying this back per our agreement and have been making minimum payments since I graduated in 2016)
* Student loans with Nelnet (in my name): $16,401 balance spread across a few loans, APRs range from 3-4%

My salary is $47,500, take home pay is $2,797/month. Current monthly expenses are \~$1,950 including debt repayments and I'm currently throwing all excess income at my debt. My absolute minimum monthly expenses (i.e. if I canceled Netflix and Spotify and cut my grocery budget in half) is $1,700 and I currently have $1,750 in savings as my emergency fund (I plan to increase this as soon as I can, but lowering my debt is the current focus). I have $1,925 in a 403(b) that I opened in October (contributing 3% with a 3% employer match) and will increase this down the road as well as open and start maxing a Roth IRA, but again - priority #1 is debt repayment right now.

After I pay off Discover and Upstart, I plan to simultaneously save up another $2,750 (this will put my e-fund at 3 months) and an additional $3,000-$4,000 to buy a used car cash (upgrading the car can't be put off much longer - I've been driving the same car since I was 16, the A/C went out a few years ago which has been brutal as I live in the southeastern U.S., and the repair cost was quoted by multiple mechanics at about double the car's value). I will then move on to the last of my debt - my student loans.

Monthly budget breakdown:

$692 rent

$350 Discover It payment (paid off by mid-August)

$200 groceries

$142 Upstart min. payment

$140 water/electric

$133 Nelnet min. (no payment through September due to CARES Act forbearance)

$119 Direct Parent Plus Loan min. (no payment through September due to CARES Act forbearance)

$86 car insurance

$80 misc.

$85 dog food and flea medicine

$50 gas

$50 cell phone

$47 Subscriptions (Spotify, Netflix, and medication)

$25 Wifi

&amp;#x200B;

So, finally, this brings me to my question: Is it worth refinancing the Direct Parent Plus loan if it's not in my name but I'm responsible for paying it off? The interest rate (6.59%) seems high but not emergency-level high right now compared to my other debts, and it'll be another 10-12 months before I can start aggressively paying it down unless my e-fund and car goals (as outlined above) shift but I'd like to stay the current course unless I'd be better off making some changes, in which case I'm listening - criticize me, please!

I've been pre-approved for refinancing the loan for 5 years with a 4.8% fixed APR and no pre-payment penalties or origination fees, but refinancing would mean the loan becomes private and I'd lose the protections that come with a federal loan, and the refinanced APR doesn't seem that much better than the current APR. Is the interest savings worth it? My limited understanding is that the already minimal interest savings decreases even more if I plan to pay it off early, and I do, regardless of whether I refinance. I've done a few calculators but I'm not sure if I'm filling the information out correctly.",finance

The portal freely displays personal info and contact details, including the vehicle's VIN.

My existing loan is about 4.59%, I've only had 12 payments on it so far but the bank isn't winning any awards in my eyes. Base payment is just under $200, I've doubled it for the most part and I've got about $8500 remaining. My credit rating is ~800 and I have no other debts, delinquencies or credit issues. Plus I'm not sure I'm happy with the rate.

Any recommendation on banks? All the ones recommended by the likes of credit karma (Autopay, DCU) are getting pretty poor recommendations on Reddit and they seem sketchy. I'd rather keep a loan going but I'm at the point where I'd rather just take a chunk out my savings and wipe it out than keep the liability of owning an account with them.

* Interest rate reduction to make it worth it
* No early repayment fees

The fed withholding that is being taken out is $207 every pay period. I may be wrong but I feel like this may be too much? I am not claiming any allowances ( I don’t think I can anyways, I’m single with no kids. )

The new W4 form, the only part I filled out was step 4b on page 3.   I have 0 for line 1. $12,400 for line 2. -0- for line 3. And like 4 I put $300. Which brings line 5 to $300. 

I only think this federal withholding might be too much because before this job, I had a job paying $40,000 a year which was like 19.74 hourly. And I was claiming one allowance and the federal withholding that was being taken out was only about $117 each paycheck. For my old job, I filled out the W-4 electronically. For this new job I’m actually having to fill out the W-4 manually. And filling it out manually it seems as if I can’t claim any allowances.

 does this seem right? Are they just taking out $200 each paycheck because the amount earned is a little bit higher?",finance

Hope everyone is doing well. 
So I guess you get an idea what I want to ask about from the title! I came to US for my Masters and took an education loan of $35000 from a bank back in India at 12% APR. 
I graduated last year May and I have a steady job now with good pay and I build a credit score of 720. 
I was wondering if it is a good idea to get a personal loan from Chase (my current salary account) to pay off my education loan in India. 
This is all based on that the interest rate I would get here in US would be lower than 12% hopefully single digits. 
Some other details: My father who is the co-signer has been paying the interests regularly. Now starting August EMI payments are starting. 
The payment plan shows that I won’t be paying any interest payments anymore and it’s just EMI now. 
I hope this all makes sense. I don’t have a lot of understanding about this but i hope to get some good advice from you all and see if it’s a good idea to do this.

I would like to move out. Mainly because of my dad. I’ve reached a point where I’d rather keep my interactions with him relatively low - for the sake of my mental health. 

I know beggars can’t be choosers, but I’d rather not live in an apartment complex since I don’t really like being so close to people. Hearing them through walls would make me really uncomfortable. I’d also rather have my own driveway and/or garage. If its possible. 


My sister and her boyfriend are looking to buy a house since what they pay for rent is essentially the same as a mortgage according to them and my parents - 

I’m down to split mortgage and bills 3 ways , the only catch is I’m not confident in my sister’s boyfriend’s ability to keep a job, and if mortgages and bills will not be split 3 ways, I’d rather find something on my own. 

My parents , including my dad, say I can stay with them while I finish up college. Even after I graduate for a bit too to pay off some debts. 

This is what I want to do, but at the same I’m fed up with my dad’s negative moods and it how it affects me. Its reached a point where I’d rather him deal with his own problems instead of taking it out on me. 

Current bills is the main reason I’ve been considering just biding my time and dealing with my dad.

If coronavirus did not exist, and I was not working all these extra hours, here’s how my bills and monthly budget would look as a part time employee.  


Average weekly paycheck after taxes: $300
Monthly: $1200

Bills altogether: $867.93
The rest goes into my savings and/or weekly allowance. 


I’d rather not further break down my monthly expenses, but just know its a situation I wish I didn’t get in and don’t feel comfortable talking about.",finance
personalfinance,Breaking Risk Aversion,"Hey guys, this isn’t so much a post about budgeting as about mentality about investment.

I’m 25, and I have about $13k in savings. I will be getting $52.5k back at the end of the year in payment from a loan to a family member. I make $6,166 pre-tax per month, and have about $750/month left over after my expenses of rent/food/transit deduction/utilities/entertainment/401k/HDHP premiums. My issue is that as someone who very much would like to own property in a VHCOL area, I am extremely risk-adverse. I have spent the last few years ticking up a couple dozen to a few hundred dollars in my .3% interest rate credit union savings account instead of any kind of coherent investment strategy.

I have no idea when I will be ready to buy or when the market will be favorable, and so I’ve always favored having that money liquid “just in case.” What kind of low-risk strategies, or higher-risk but highly-liquid strategies could I exploit if I decide to make a move? I know realistically I probably won’t be ready to buy in the few years, but I still can’t break the “what-if.” If necessary I know I could draw on my parents and a very generous first time home buyer program in my locality (DC) that would help, if necessary.

Thanks.",finance
vet,Quality of life: lower jaw removal for cats?,"Hey r/vet

Some background; my cat is 20 years old. August last year she had a cancerous tumor under her tongue. We were very, very lucky and discovered it early. It was successfully removed, but she lost part of her tongue in the process. 

She’s tough, though! And after several months and a lot of help, she relearned how to eat and drink on her own (I still syringe fed her occasionally when I noticed her getting lazy). 

She’s been fighting some kidney disease lately, but after some rx food and supplements she’s been thriving. 

The last week a growth has developed under her jaw. We have not biopsied it because there’s a risk of putting her under, but I’m certain it’s cancer again... My vet is, frustratingly, apprehensive to give me anything but wishy-washy answers to my concerns— So o thought I’d ask here before finding a second opinion this weekend. 

If she has this tumor removed, her bottom jaw is most likely going with it. What is her quality of life going to be like? Can she eat without a lower jaw, and with a partial tongue? Even with me
Syringe feeding her? I feel like there’s some suction that’s required for her to swallow with just a partial tongue. 

Will she be miserable? Will she be in pain? Does she have a decent chance of recovery considering her age? 

She’s been by my side since I was in elementary school. I feel like I’m blind as to what’s best for her; making her comfortable; or keeping her next to me for as long as I can. I truly love her more than anything in thw world, and don’t want to cut her life short at the risk of her being uncomfortable, but I also don’t want to make her miserable just to selfishly extend her life. 

Any insight would be greatly appropriated.",cryptocurrency

The payment is $413 a month for a $22000 car on a 75 month loan, come to find out the interest rate is 11%(?!?!?!?) Right now the car loan has $13000 left on it. On top of this I have roughly $12000 in student loans (2 loans basically the same size) with a minimum payment of $88 each and maybe 5% interest. I bring home basically $400 a week and currently live at home (read:free housing and usually free food). My current plan is to attack the car loan first as it is burning $100 in interest a month and get it paid off by December of next year and then to attack the student loans. I know the debt snowball says to hit the smallest loan first but isn't this a different story because of that absurd interest rate? I tried getting it refinanced down to a 3.5% loan at my local credit union but by the time I pay the $400 GAP insurance (can you imagine the loan is upside down), get title registered in my name (I'd be basically buying it from parents), and insurance on my own, I'd be in the same hole and I can have it paid off in 17 months. It also doesn't make sense to sell the car as it has very low miles, is very reliable, and gets great gas mileage. I plan on working side gigs to earn extra money to throw at it as well.

personalfinance,Wife and I are looking to buy a new house. Not sure how to navigate a new purchase while owning our current home. Looking for insight.,"The wife and I are in a position that either of us have ever been in before and through my research and conversations I have found a few options that could suit us but I’m curious if you could provide us with any other options or just some general input on what options might best fit this situation. 

We have had our current home in Florida for 4 years. It is the first house either of us have ever owned. We purchased it for 243k and currently owe 124k.  In the current market our realtor is confident that she can sell it for 350k and is trying to get us to list for 375k. that would mean if we sell it we would cash out at 250-275k minus closing costs. We have been looking for a new house and have never navigated purchasing of a house while owning another. We have about 20k in reserves, but it wouldn’t be enough to put a 20% down payment on the next house. So far, we have researched contingent offers, which seems like it makes for a very weak offer as a potential buyer. Equity loans on our current house that would be paid off at closing. And a cash-out refinance that would allow us to keep the current home and still put down the appropriate down payment on the new home.

I’m curious what might be the ideal way to do this. I know that every situation might be different but because this is new territory for both of us we don’t really know all the pros and cons to each option. I will also add that we are not opposed to keeping our current house and renting it out. It appears that if we cash out enough equity for a down payment we can reduce our interest rate and refinance for another 30 years. The new monthly payment would be lower than our current minimum payment, allowing us to rent it out for roughly $700/month more than our mortgage.

Just looking for input from anyone who has had experience. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Diving Deeper on Financial Planning,"Hi All!

I have been interested in investing (pun intended) more thought into my financial plan. After doing a bunch of researching and looking around this subreddit, I thought I would create a post to have a deeper discussion regarding my situation.

Background: young lawyer maxing a little more than six figures; $140,000 law school debt, mortgage soon, with about $50,000 in savings. 

Questions:

1. **Loans:** I have heard mixed reviews about how to pay off student loans. The loans are two federal accounts with several smaller loans, all with similar interests and amounts. (around 6-8%) I am also on income-based repayment. I met with a ""financial representative"" a few months ago that interestingly said to keep payments low and invest and use that investment to help offset the tax at the 20-/25-year forgiveness date. But, given the reputation of ""financial advisors"" around here, I am skeptical. I am currently contributing $2,000/month, which is no problem, but if it is better to pay $1,000-$1,500 and invest the rest, then I am okay with that. Also, should I refinance with a private provider for a lower interest?
2. **Investing:** I am going to continue to max my 401k, but have heard various people say I should start a Roth IRA and a mutual fund account for both short- and mid-term liquidity. Is that accurate? If so, am I assuming correctly that I can open both a Roth/mutual fund account at the same brokerage? Is opening both even a good idea given my loan and mortgage situation? Is there a consensus for good brokerage firms? (I know that Charles Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity are all highly rated, but open to anything.) Also, I know most brokerages allow you to pick you ""aggressiveness""--is it better to pick one side or the other? Should I open two accounts--one high risk and one low risk?
3. **Other:** Lastly, is there anything else I should be doing to maximize my savings in short-, mid-, and long-term? 

My apologies for the numerous questions--I just want to make sure I go about this correctly. If I missed anything that answers these questions (I have seen some that touch on it, but not my situation exactly), please let me know and I will continue researching.",finance

Investments: Federal Thrift Savings Fund: $19,000 (Was a federal employee for 4 years so didn't vest)

Mutual Funds: $11,000

Roth IRA - $2,000

Deferred Compensation: $8,250

personalfinance,Wife’s company has stopped 401k matching,"As the title says, my wife’s company has ceased their 401k matching program for the rest of the year due to covid-19. This has caused me to question whether she should stop contributing for the rest of the year in order to bolster up our e-fund and/or pay down some debt.

The main reason I’m on the fence is because our combined income is ~$300k/year, so the tax break is not insignificant (24% marginal tax bracket). She currently contributes 6% of her salary (the company then contributed 4.5%).

We’re currently working on our e-fund, which stands at about $9k right now, which realistically is only about 1 month’s worth of expenses. We live in a HCOL area so our rent is $3k, and our son’s in daycare which eats up another $1.4k.

Debt payments include:

Wife’s student loan 1 - $621/month (~$34k remaining @ 4.25%)

Wife’s student loan 2 - $705/month (~$75k remaining @ 4.5%)

Car payment 1 - $375/month ($12k remaining @ 3%)

Car payment 2 - $820/month ($45k remaining @ 2%)

Credit card - $550/month ($5k remaining @ 0% until June 2021)

My 401k loan - $290/month ($7.1k remaining @ 5.25%)

We obviously have a lot of debt, yet it’s all at fairly low interest rates so I’m not sure if it’s worth it for my wife to pause 401k contributions given the tax benefits.

personalfinance,"What are the smartest budget items to cut (going from 2 salaries to 1): 401k investments, student loan payments, down-payment contributions, or even dip into savings?","So, just like many others in this economy, my husband is looking at losing his job in September (not due to covid reasons) and we are concerned that covid will likely mean finding another job will be difficult, so we may need to live off of my salary for several months.

We've looked at ways to cut our budget, and will be minimizing spending. The goal is to not dip into our savings/down-payment fund ($14k, earning 1.1% interest, not much, but we want to keep some cash on hand for emergencies). He brings home about $2k a month, and I'm wondering what the best items to cut are, out of these options:

Savings/down-payment contributions: we put $1000 into savings every month. I think its smartest to cut this for a short period of time.

Student loans: We have about $12k left in student loans with an interest rate of 3.25%, and will not be penalized if we skip payments for some time, other than accrued interest. We pay $500/month currently. 

401k contributions: I contribute $1500/month (~$750/paycheck) to my 401k to max out my contributions (its really slightly more), in a Roth fund.

Savings: Alternatively, we can also pull money from our savings/down-payment fund.

First goal is to minimize spending of course. But what is the best order of cutting things to meet that $2k income loss (approximately, some expenses will increase, like health insurance, that isn't included in that take home). I think it makes the most sense to cut out our savings/down-payment contributions first, and student loan contributions next. If we still need an extra boost, I plan is to switch the 401k contributions from Roth to traditional. Lastly, if were still struggling, another option is to cut the 401k contributions to 2%, which is the minimum to get my company 5% match.

Is this the smartest hierarchy? We could also continue to pay student loans if our budget wasn't able to be cut enough if we pulled from savings, but frankly, I don't want to jeopardize having a down-payment in the future.

Some other relevant information. We also have $150k in investments (started by my parents when I was young), my 401k is at about $110k while my husband's is around $30k, and we have two IRAs at about $25-30k. This is relevant because we do have more ""emergency"" money if absolutely needed, and there are first time homebuyer allowances to loan yourself money from your 401k or pull out money from an IRA without penalty in order to buy a house.

personalfinance,My mother wants me to co-sign her mortgage refi,"My mother asked me to co-sign her a mortgage refi for the amount of $330k. From what I understand the outstanding balance on her current mortgage is $292k. The property is worth $800k-900k.

 The main reason for the mortgage would be cash out the net difference to pay down credit card bills in the amount of $20k with the final remainder going to HVAC and plumbing repairs needed by the house. The credit card debt is currently being floated at 0% APR promotion but that promotion is set to end this fall. Lastly, her rate would drop from 3.875% to 3.375% and monthly payments down from $2,518 to $2,384 per month.

I am not sure the exact reason why she does not qualify for the rate she is applying for. I assume it's because of one of the following 1) her credit, 2) income level or 3) debt to income level. When she was denied on the refi application the mortgage officer floated the idea of having me co-sign to therefore qualify. I make $160k~ a year with a stable job and FICO of 750+. I'm in my early 30s. She is 75 and has an income of $50k-$60k per year. 

I worry that co-signing could impact my borrowing opportunities in the near future. I am considering either going back to get my masters (which would require a student loan) or purchasing property with my partner. I have considered lending her the cash she needs directly but she borrowed smaller amounts from me and did not pay me back.  

- Is this a bad idea? Could this be a good idea if i am placed on the title of the house? Essentially I'm helping my mom get cash and I am able to secure an asset of roughly $1mm. 
- Should I be worried about being able to qualify for a student loan or mortgage of my own in a year or two?
- Are there any other creative options to secure 20k of cash to avoid potentially high interest rate charges on her credit cards and thereby avoiding to refi at all?
- Is it possible that she is getting denied on her own because of her current debt to income ratio? Assuming she does have $20k in credit card debt with that is a significant percentage of income.

In 2019, I finally started and finished paying back the signing bonus, but they made me pay back $6666.67, even though I had only received $5000. I believe this is because they did a tax gross up, since the 2017 W2 showed $6666.67 in “Wages” and $1666.67 in “Federal income tax withheld”.

They sent me a W2-C for that 2017 W2 and they told me I could try getting the $1666.67 as a tax refund. But the W2-C says $0 for corrected “Wages” and $0 for “Federal income tax.” I don’t really understand if I’ll be able to get back the $1666.67 I overpaid or not.

personalfinance,Best high yield savings account,"Let’s be honest I (22F) got super lucky when I landed my first full time job at age 18 that provided me with enough money to pay all my bills and pay my way through college (100% debt free). For the first 2 years I was very frivolous and had next to no money saved. However, these last 2 years I got ahold of my spending and was able to save up a good chunk of change (~$27,000). It is currently sitting in a “savings” account but with a extremely low interest rate (around 0.001%, it’s a savings account attached to my checking account through a small local bank). I don’t know if I am ready to start investing as I am very new to having any type of significant pocket money so I wanted to just stow it away in a high yield savings account and let it sit there for a few years. Are there any recommendations for high yield savings accounts for steady growth until I am ready to invest or would it truly be in my best interest to learn aggressive investing strategies to start my portfolio for retirement?",finance

solar,"Early still but Tesla Solar impressing so far (quote, speed of providing layout and now scheduled site visit) - will update as process continues","I'm early in this so don't want to jinx anything and I realize this may be an unpopular opinion but I have been very impressed by Tesla Solar so far.

I visited the Tesla website last week and was confused about the process and if there was a time period between placing the $100 non-refundable deposit and giving the go-ahead so that I could obtain a municipal incentive. I went on the website's chat function and, after a few minutes, was told I would be contacted by phone which I was.

The person answered all of my questions and, at 2pm on July 8, I put in my order for a Medium system (8.16kW size) - cost $16k (minus local municipal incentive, Fed and State rebates, my out of pocket cost is $6k with payback of 3-4 years). Pre-incentive/rebate cost is $1.96/W

7/8 10pm - received layout specifying how many panels (24), inverters (SolarEdge single phase with HD-Wave) and panel names (Q.Peak duo blk-G6+ 340W).

7/9 - after reading posts here, decided to go on EnergySage and received 3 quotes for systems that were 10.9-12.2 kW in size with upfront cost of $30-35k (pre-incentive/rebate). Cost $2.80 - 2.88/W. Payback 8-9 years.

Saturday, 7/11 6pm - ignored call from Las Vegas. Checked voicemail an hour later and realized it was Tesla wanting to schedule a site visit. Called back and got someone in 1 ring. Answered a few questions about the visit and scheduled for Wednesday, 7/15 at 9am.

I've read posts here about Tesla Solar that point to the BBB but I followed that link and it's a mix of people complaining about Solar vs Cars. Also some are literally complaining that one of the dealerships (they're not but can't think of a better name than store) didn't offer them a test ride fast enough...

I get that Tesla Solar is not spending money on pulling leads but they are literally half the cost of the other three quotes which some may point to as a red flag but, at least so far, everything checks out. Yes I will get SolarEdge instead of Enphase but I have a great roof without shade/tree cover so don't see that as an issue. And if the system is slightly undermatched for my use, I'm okay with that. I don't need to be 'off the grid' but just want to not fork over $200 a month for electricity when I can spend 6k out of pocket and be even in under 4 years and ahead every year after.

Long post (sorry) but would love to hear from others about their positive and/or negative direct experiences with Tesla Solar. Also, is there anything I should ask about or watch for at the site visit?

My only concern is we did put in closed cell spray foam in the walk-up attic after a recent renovation that included a new roof. Any concern with that and solar installations?

Thanks!

8/8/2020 Update: Had the site visit on July 15th but that was really just an 'observe and verify' type visit. Whatever satellite pix they had suggested a skylight (there isn't one) and the guy basically checked on basement, attic, etc.  Called the Tesla Solar number a couple of times after that to check status and had a person pick up within 2 rings each time - always friendly and knowledgeable. Advised the application was waiting on the team that deals with utilities.   
8/5/2020 - Email received with Electrical Interconnection agreement for me to physically sign and FedEx (paid) back to them. Replied with few questions on forms, spray foam in our attic, and if could pull references for install team. Will update when have more to report...",energy
personalfinance,Questions about paying quarterly taxes on short-term net capital gains,"Hi everyone,

For context, I made about 8k in short-term capital gains this year (except for SPY which I understand has a long-term component to it); my income last year was 13k, which I already filed a tax return for; and my projected income this year is 60k.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For the gains that I made, is the tax rate based on my income last year or my projected income this year? I'm still a bit confused on how to apply the tax rate to my gains.

2. After some googling, it looks like I need to make quarterly taxes on my net capital gains, which I’ll pay online for federal taxes and California state taxes. Do all quarterly taxes HAVE TO BE equal (despite my net gains fluctuating each quarter) or can I just pay the taxes on all the gains I made for that quarter, each quarter. 

3. Following on Question 2: is it best to wait until almost the end of the first quarter to pay so that I have a better idea of what my net gains are and can avoid penalties?

4. If I don’t pay enough taxes in my first quarter, can I pay whatever I owed from my first quarter in the second quarter?

personalfinance,Budgeting for a first home with $80k single income,"Hi all,

I'm in the process of buying a 5/3 house (2,200 sq ft) for $498k as the sole owner. I'm 26 and got pre-approved up to $500k (purchase price) and I'm worried that I might be stretching myself thin. I don't normally take this kind of financial risk but I fell in love with the house.

I wanted to get your guys' opinion on whether this is feasible and NOT be house poor. I have a stable job making about $80k/yr and would be sharing the house with my girlfriend and taking on 2 or 3 roommates. I understand I should be able to afford the house without roommates which would be the worst-case scenario.

House is near the college I attended making it easier to find tenants and has upside potential. My job will be paying for my master's in return for 2 years of service after completion i.e. won't have any major career changes in the foreseeable future. I plan on staying in the area after that which is why I wanted to buy a house instead of keeping on paying rent and have roommates supplement my mortgage while building equity. Also, the record low interest rates are alluring.

&amp;#x200B;

Take-home pay per month: **$3900** (after 5% towards retirement and 5% employer match)

I save \~$2500 as cash with my budget portion sharing a 2/1.5 apartment with the gf.

Rent: $810

Utilities+internet: $85

Groceries: \~$150

Phone bill: $40

Gas: $50-$60

Eating out: $80

Misc.: $100

&amp;#x200B;

No debt. Bought my car with cash. Went to college for free thanks to scholarships, grants and part-time jobs.

$75k in a savings account (will be using this reserve for a down payment)

$20k in an investment account

\~$25k in 401k

Average tax refund every year: $5,500-$6,000

I plan on getting promoted next year which will bring my salary up to about $88k and will be increasing my 401k contributions to 7.5%. I will be eligible for a pension in the next 2.5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Home budget will be **$2,900** a month including P&amp;I, utilities (house has paid-off solar system so electric bill we low), internet, taxes, insurance and PMI. I plan on putting down 5% to have some cash as an emergency budget. I can do 10% down payment but agent advised against it.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on renting two rooms with private baths at $800/each with utilities included. This means between my girlfriend and me, we will still have 3 rooms (one master bed, one hobby room/office, one guest room) and end up paying about **$650 each**. My goal is to have my ""subsidized"" mortgage cheaper than the rent $650 vs $895 and save a similar amount of money as renting. If I rent out the guest room as well, I can get a cash influx of $2,200 (adjusting other rooms rents for shared bath) leaving me and my gf to split the rest ($350 each). Long term goal is to save enough cash again to put down payment on another house in 4-5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think this is a good idea? Will I be considered ""house poor""? I've discussed this with friends and they think this is manageable. I'm just a worrier by nature and conservative with my investments.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 26, tired of paying $900/month rent, buying a 5/3 home for $498k with 5-10% down and will have 2 roommates (plus my gf). ""Supplemented"" mortgage will be $650 while building equity. Good idea or not?",finance

GBP/USD has been rangebound since March, so I do not expect this to change in the near term. One or both of these might be actionable opportunities. For the hell of it, I'll act as if I expect both to happen.

**Short-Term:**

I think I see a bearish divergence at the 4-hour scale on GBP/USD.

[4-Hour Scale](https://preview.redd.it/yl24q0vdsca51.png?width=1229&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de20a6b6abf39a08a1344b22f8c7f817d93bd40d)

In context, this appears to be consistent with a small supply zone established approximately 16 July 04:00 CDT and re-tested the morning of 9-July.  The effect that the movement was very small before retracing makes me doubt if the supply zone explains the downward movement at all; I won't put too much weight on that zone holding.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4qlcyihm5da51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22c700a586a1c6fc7c896559341d8a694b9676b5

Fundamentals I'm tracking as significant in this time frame:

* US budget deficit forecast at $863B
* UK GDP Y/Y expected to shrink 20.9% and 17.5% 3M/3M.
* US CPI expected to increase 0.1%, compared to 0.1% decrease last time.

My expectation: there could be a pullback when the US federal budget deficit is released, but I think a significant shrinkage of the UK economy will drive (possibly accelerate) downward momentum. If I were to enter a short position, I would enter at something like: 1.26555, SL 1.2714, TP 1.24620. 

**Mid-Term (2-4 Weeks):**

At the weekly time scale, there appears to be a local uptrend; this seems to be supported at the hourly time scales. The long hypothesis is that the price keeps with a local uptrend and breaks through the smaller supply zone until it reaches the big supply zone identified at the weekly scale. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly Scale](https://preview.redd.it/1xsz04lg6da51.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d513b10ae909f64f268d5bbb6f32d72676790b2a)

My expectation is this could take up to 3 weeks to unfold. I probably wouldn't take a long position if it was going to take so long to move a measly 165 pips, but I might strongly consider a short position later, if this happens:

Fast forward to now, when I'm actually doing my taxes, I notice that I need to pay taxes on the $7,500 from relocation. My guess is because I checked the box that made it so I wouldn't have any withholdings, my employer did not gross up the $7,500 high enough.

Income 4.2K/month post tax now and same in retirement. Expected living expenses 2.5K/month includes property tax/Health insurance/Utilities/Food and 700 for Misc

I would like to buy my sibling out of the inherited paid off 800K house so 400K owed. I have 200K in non 401K savings so I would need to get a estate loan, mortgage loan(?), or personal loan of 200K to pay the balance. 

1) An estate loan is the usual suggestion from what I have read and I think the interest rate is \~7% right now but guessing.

2) Mortgage loan would be good but I believe it would require only my name on the deed so I guess we would need to get a lawyer to draw up a document to draw up some sort of transfer and loan agreement for his protection.

3) Personal loan. I like this option the best since I would pay the sibling interest instead of the bank. The only savings I would have in retirement other than the 4.2k/month is 350K in my 401K. I could withdraw 100K per year (76K post 24% tax bracket withdrawal fee) to pay sibling off in 3 years

What would be a fair interest to suggest on a 3 year payout to my sibling?

What would you do if the sibling would rather have the money all at once?

Can you point me in the direction to understand the difference between panel brands and their performance, especially in south Florida weather and wind conditions (pronounced hurricane).

Eventually (as in, when im retired) i also hope to have finished paying my mortgage, and so the money we'll need to live will be greatly reduced (and between tax sheltered retirement funds and reduced spending, my taxes won't be 30% between state/federal/SS/Medicare too).

However, there are some things, like inflation, that could offset this, and make us need more in retirement. 

Between my husband and I, we have almost 2x our gross salary, at 32, in investments and retirement accounts, whereas estimators recommend 1x by 30 and 3x by 40, so i think we're on track (we started late due to grad school until we were 28). However, our investments aren't quite as ""untouchable"" as retirement, and we absolutely will use some of it if needed for a car or a down-payment on a house.

I guess I'm asking this question because we have a decent amount stored away after only 4 years of ""real"" work, and I knew we had to play catch-up. But our financial situation will change in the future - my husband will be looking for a new job/may face unemployment soon, and once you add a house and kids into the equation, we may need to adjust our budget and not put the absolute max into retirement any more.

So how do you plan for what you'll need for 2 people in retirement? (Especially with our income levels changing each year due to raises, job changes, and employment status, and our income needs changing with a future family, changes in where your money goes when you're young v retired, and inflation)",finance
personalfinance,18 year old here and I need some advice,"Hey everyone this is my first post here but I'm in need of advice. As stated in the title I am 18 years old and I have about 600 USD in total savings. I am about to enter university but directly after I come out of university I'd like to go into the business of real estate. Specifically, I'd like to get into the business of rental properties. In my country university is free but I have 0 financial literacy except for the few logical things like saving money and understanding the concept of I could have 1 of this today or two of it tomorrow if I invest what I have today for tomorrow. I looked at many, many articles online and youtube videos such as Graham Stephan but I still don't know what I'd need to do to even begin this journey. So far my plan is as follows:

-Work part time on evenings and weekends at a grocery to generate income

-Invest close to 100% of my income (I am open to suggestions here, I'd prefer something with high interest rates and moderate risk if such a thing even exists)

-after getting my degree I should have a sizable investment portfolio( in 6 years and wildly guessing I'd estimate I may have 10,000 USD total but this may be conservative or very inaccurate, again I don't know)

-use this portfolio to secure a credit union loan up to 2x my investment and work a few months to secure the downpayment on this apartment( the intent of this is to minimize the amount of time i spend between having the apartment and when i get out of school) 

-Get a few tenants to assist in paying down the loan and I plan to work as well to make up the money to the mortgage 

-eventually own the place and receive passive income( I know I will have to maintain the place and possibly deal with bad tenants)

I have a few questions as well about loans that I am still confused about

-Which is better? Should I take a 5 year loan or a 30 year loan? I am still confused about this. The 30 year seems to have no benefit but i am unsure

-Is my plan the best? What would you guys suggest?

personalfinance,Should I pay my car off early?,"I am 20 years old and I work full time at a school district. It was only until February of this year that I decided I wanted to start teaching myself how to budget better, and I always said I wanted to pay my vehicle loan off early but now I'm serious and able to do it as of right now. A little bit of credit background:

My dad refinanced my car in February of 2019 so that I could be on the loan as a cosigner. The loan amount was for about $9200 at a 4-year term. This account is 1 year and 4 months old. I have about $6700 left on this loan. Interest was around 11%.

I recently acquired a $5000 loan with a 5-year term for a motorcycle in April 2020 with plans to pay that off this year as well as my vehicle loan. I was approved for this loan myself, so I didn't have to cosign. I have $4800 left on this loan. Interest was around 11%.

My oldest age of credit is my Capital One credit card, which I opened up to start building credit. This credit card is 2.5 years old. My credit limit is $500 (I am not a student, never was) and I never am worried about the high interest rates on this because any purchases I make are very small and I immediately pay off in full.

All of my payments have been on time and I haven't had any issues with that. My credit stands currently at 713. It dropped to the mid-high 600's for a few months when I got my motorcycle loan, but it jumped back up and is now a few points higher than it ever was for me.

I guess my questions are: Will my score be negatively affected if I paid off my vehicle loan right now? And is paying my motorcycle loan off this year (thinking September/October) a good idea or should I hold onto that?

Thanks for the help, and if you guys need any more information let me know. I'm new to this and wasn't exactly sure how much to include.",finance
financialindependence,Reconsidering bond allocation in the FIRE portfolio in light of sustained zero interest rates.,"Virtually all retirement studies use a portfolio composition that allocates significant portion of capital to bonds. This includes the famous Trinity study - probably the most widely cited retirement study in the FIRE community, and the basis for the 4% rule.

These studies are based on backtesting against historical data, which means they are backwards looking. Allocating a significant portion of the portfolio to bonds made sense in the past, since [historical interest rates](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) were relatively high: between 1963 and 2001 they stayed above 3.5% with just one short exception (1992-1993), and for most of that period they were substantially higher that that, rising above 10% for much of the 1980s.

Bond performance as an investment vehicle is substantially correlated with interest rates. Thus, for almost four decades until 2001, bonds were an excellent vehicle, particularly for retirement: offering good returns with very low depreciation risk.

Unfortunately, conditions have since changed. As you can see in the graph, the Fed dropped its interest rates in response to the three major market crises we've had since 2001: the 2001 tech bubble, 2008 financial meltdown, and most recently the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.

The 2001 drop brought interest rates down to a bottom of about 1%, and then recovered to a peak of 5.23% (not particularly high relative to the 4 decades before) after 5 years. The 2008 drop sank interest rates to historically low and nearly unprecedented levels around 0.10%. Interest rates then stayed between 0.10-0.20% for 7 years, then very slowly recovered to about 2.40% - a historically low figure - during the 3 years after that. Rates remained at that level or lower until February 2020, when the Fed's COVID-19 response brought them to all-time-lows of 0.05-0.09%.

With current interest rates so low, returns on bond investments are effectively the same as cash, while carrying substantially more risk. The monetary policies we've had since 2001 are likely to hold, which means even if interest rates eventually recover (and that will take a while), we will see the same pattern of interest rates dropping sharply in response to financial crises, persisting poor returns on bonds and making bonds unsuitable for a retirement portfolio.

In simple terms, the classic 60/40 won't tide you over like it did in Trinity and similar studies, with 40% of your portfolio yielding near 0% returns and failing to beat inflation.

I believe this means retirement portfolios should include drastically lower allocation to bonds. Think 10% or lower.",finance

personalfinance,Question about Schooling and Loans in late 30's,"Hey everyone,

Maybe some of you financial gurus can help me out. I am trying to sort out what the best course of action will be for me. Because of COVID19 I am changing careers, something I should have done awhile ago anyways. I am in my late 30's and starting school in fall. I will be going for IT/Cybersecurity and probably am going to transfer to a bachelors program so all together 4-5 years of schooling.

My thought is that its more important for me to get school done fast at my age so I can begin getting experience in this field ASAP. Also my current salary is about 35k (was service industry), so even entry level positions in this field are going to pay 20-30k more per year than I am currently making. My rationale is that due to the higher paying nature of this field and my age, I will be going to school full time and working 2-3 days a week part time just to get a little supplemental income. The way I see it if I went part time and lost 2 years of work, thats 40-60k earning plus two years experience I will not have in my career, which considering I am halfway through my working career seems like a lot. That two years experience could easily mean the difference between landing a great job or not in the next decade.

Thus, I am planning on living primarily off student loans. I have a few questions and concerns about this I am hoping people here can help me sort out.

1) I am single so have nobody else to support me but me, I am highly concerned that at some point Ill be denied student loans even though I've never had them before and never defaulted. If I get denied at some point it will be extremely difficult to continue school and basically will be a giant setback at my age. Do I need to worry about this, or will I keep getting federal aid so long as I do well and stay in school?

2) How often can I get federal aid? I currently have the federal $9500 loan that seems to go through spring of 2021, will I be eligible for another loan after that?

3) Should I consider private loans such as through my community credit union, or loans through services like Sallie Mae? And if so how much should I be taking out at a time? Should I try to take out enough for my needs for 4 years, or should I just take a bit at a time as I need it?

4) I want to focus on school and thus am working part time. My secondary reasoning aside from everything I mentioned such as my age and the increase in income I can expect is if I can do well on my AS degree and get some certifications, I may be able to begin some part time work in my field while I finish my bachelors AND hopefully even qualify for some scholarships. Thus, I dont want to bog myself down with work and want to just focus on school.

5) Lastly I am making payments on a vehicle I dont want to get rid of for a number of reasons. The cost of this is high though, like $500 a month between payments and insurance. I am considering my options here, but can I use student loans for car payments if I decide to keep this vehicle? Working part time might cover this, but thats going to be nearly all the money Ill be bringing in for a month with part time minimum wage work. Thats fine too as long as I can use my loans to pay for my housing/bills.

personalfinance,Rent or sell my current house when moving,"Hi! I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to rent out my current 4th floor apartment near the city center, instead of selling it, when I move to a larger place, with my (international) girlfriend. Fwiw, we're situated in the Netherlands, but I don't think my question is very 'local', so I chose this subreddit. I figured out a few things by myself, but I'm not sure if my conclusion makes sense (not renting) and where to go from there. 

Here goes! 
I bought my appartment at the end of 2011, 8.5 years ago, for 130k and included my costs (taxes, etc) in the mortgage for a total of 137k. The market value was stable or lower, for a while, but has really gone up in the past 3 years or so. This trend is still going strong. Very strong. House prices went up by 9% in q1 and 8% in q2 of this year. I estimate I should now be able to sell the house for 180k now. 

If I rent out the house, i should be able to get up to about 1000 per month in rent. (same as a similar apartment down the street). This year, my city will have less students and expats due to corona, which causes and caused the price to come down from a record of 1200, for apartments like mine,to this price.

If I rent it out, I need a mortgage for the remainder of the mortgage (i paid ~32k into it) . It's currently a 'savings mortgage' that maximizes the loan, to also get maximum tax reduction. It consists of a savings part that I pay in to and a loan part, that stays the same. The interest rate for both of those is the same, 4.5%.Due to lower interest rates, I expect I need to renegotiate that into a more regular form. (more like 1.5%, if I would also live in it.)

Also, my current bank does not allow renting, so I need another mortgage supplier in any case. I understand that banks that allow renting will also increase the mortgage's onterestfor it, and I should expect at least 3.5%. For a 100k mortgage that would come down to 700 or so per month, of which 275 goes towards paying the principal. 

Additional costs when renting it out: national taxes, local taxes, waterboard, garbage disposal, sewers. These come down to 300 or so per month. It's probably smart to add another 100 for repairs.

If I rent, I also can't apply for tax reduction (which has been 160/month, so far) and I get my new house's tax reduction reduced, for the money I paid down on the initial mortgage (32k)

I tried calculating the difference between selling and renting it out. If I consider the price increase of the house and the money I paid into the mortgage, it seems that initially, renting is about 1700 euros per month more expensive than selling, if its not rented. So 700/month if there's a renter.

Additional savings :
I'm buying the new house with my girlfriend. Together, we've got about 40k saved, but we need to keep a buffer, we're expecting to do a wedding and we need to pay 15k or so for the 'buying costs' for the new house (which are 'out of pocket' , in the current market) . So we cant realisticly lower those costs by a lot.

Even though we expect prices to rise like this for at least 2 more years, this would make us 'house poor' for quite a while. And dependent on finding renters. (depending on the price of the new house I guess.) 

Financially, we are able to save at least a thousand euros per month together, that now go into saving, but! She only has a contract for 2 more years and there's a more than 50% chance she'll have to move to another city for another job. If that's the case, I go too. Also, things are not going that well in her home country and she wants to be able to support her family when they need it. 

So, my preliminary conclusion is that renting is not a good choice. Did I miss anything?",finance

personalfinance,Road Tripping -- Personal Vehicle or Rental?,"The current federal guidelines for automobile mileage reimbursement is $0.575/mile. Let's say I need to drive 2000 miles roundtrip to visit a family member. According to the reimbursement rate, I should expect to incur roughly $1,150 worth of wear and tear on my automobile. Now let's say I estimate the trip will take around 10 days including the visit. By my math, if I can find a car rental for less than $115/day, with either no mileage limit or a mileage limit of ~200 mi/day, then the rental car will always be the better option because the estimated expense will be roughly the same but the wear and tear will be made on the rental rather than my car. Is that right?

I'm just having a really difficult time grappling with the idea of spending $1,150 to rent a car when have a perfectly serviceable vehicle sitting in my garage. I should note that it is an older car (2001)  with about 130k miles on it, but its in great shape and has new tires, new brakes, new timing belt, etc.

Thanks for you input.

EDIT: I see I forgot to account for the fact that the federal reimbursement rate includes the cost of gas. According to gasbuddy.com I'm looking at ~$300 in gas. So that would bring the equivalent rental price down to $85/day rather than $115. Question still stands.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking Guidance: Pay off my student loan by the end of October 2020 or keep cash on hand?,"Hello all,

I have been conflicted between paying off all my student loans in a large lump sum by the end of October or keeping the cash and slowly paying down the loan because I want to save for a home. My job is stable and getting 38 hours on average per week. Post tax, I am taking home about 85k-90k a year with a maxed 401k. What concerns me is, although my job is stable, I speculate wages will decrease over the next 3-6 years because of the flood of new graduates in my field who are taking jobs at $10-$20 less than I am getting paid now. The only thing that may keep my wages competitive is my work union.


One side of me wants to pay off my loan of $82,000 (2.9% fixed, paying ~$1200 a month and ~$200 of that being interest) because the terms of the loan say if I pay back the whole loan within 3 years of the original lending date, I will get back a percentage of the total interest paid, roughly ~$800 - $900 if my math serves me right. I will then be debt free. I have no car payments. I do not have any outstanding credit card payments and I live at home. My emergency fund is currently the difference between debt and on hand cash (~$40k) though I have some money in stocks/ETFs (~4k) but don't plan to add for a while because the markets are too volatile right now. Additionally my HYSA have dropped now to 1.0%, making it harder for me to justify keeping so much cash on hand when my interest rate is almost 3%.


The other half of me wants to keep cash on hand because of the COVID climate and the prospects of putting a down payment on a home by 2022 or 2023. I plan to have anywhere between a 250k-300k downpayment by then. However my outlook may change if home prices drop because of the current economic climate.


I am having trouble weighing my pros and cons at this moment. I bounce back and forth every other day. PF, what other things, if any, should I consider before paying my debt off completely or paying my debt off slowly.",finance

I am disabled and have a carer provided by the council (UK). They give me the funding (£20k a year) and I employ someone of my choosing to provide in home personal care. 

My husband works full time and we save 45% of our income into an investment ISA (index fund). We have no debt, several months of expenses saved and are hoping to become financially independent in about 15 years. This would also mean he could mostly care for me instead of having a third party. We are still youngish and have almost adult kids. We do not make much but are very frugal in order to save. 

So my dilemma is that once I have £23k in savings, the council will expect us to pay our own care. We are approaching that amount in our ISA. The amount care costs would wipe out the 23k in just over a year and we'd be back where we started, asking the council for care

I've been trying to do the calculations but would like some input. 

I could either carry on adding 45% of our income to an ISA and try to reduce my care by half and pay it myself (I honestly don't think I'd cope, but I could try). This would reduce how much I'm saving too, meaning it will take longer to FI, but we'd still be making progress. 

Or I could pay that 45% into our mortgage (which the council don't count), which would be paid off in 8 years instead of 25, but my mortgage interest rate is at 1.5% so technically I'll be making far less than I would in an index on average. By the end of the 8 years I would have only about half as much needed to retire early, but on the flip side I would have received a carer every year for free. I could keep the 20k in my ISA and take any gains off and add them to the mortgage. 

This is where my brain gets foggy and I can't decide what to do. Is there some kind of middle ground here? Am I missing something? Is the early mortgage payoff really the best plan here?

I feel terribly guilty trying to maximise the situation but in the long run I will do better having my husband working only part time or not at all, with him providing my care, instead of taking a carer from the council for the rest of my life more years. 

Thanks in advance for any help!",finance

personalfinance,"20 y/o £36k salary, no rent/food/car to pay. £30k savings (no inheritance), unsure how not to waste it!","Hi, all!

The title sums it up- I'm 20, earn £36k yr increasing annually and have no financial responsibilities! I'm concious that I earn a good salary for my age but do not give my savings or income much attention. My life is engulfed by my job and as such, my wage is paid and I just leave most of it in my current account paying 0.45% interest... Very lazy, I know! 
I always put £4,000 into the LISA at the beginning of the financial year to take advantage of that, and dabble in the stock-market with a couple of grand in a Hargreaves Lansdown stocks and shares ISA (unsuccessfully of course!).

My job means I'll be in such a position of financial freedom for at least the next 5 years, most likely up to even 10 years (when I might grow up eventually and take on the responsibilities involved with, you know, having a family?!).
I don't want to waste the fortunate position I am in now and regret not making the most of it 20 years down the line. 
I have been thinking about buying a flat (~£200k) seen as I may as well start paying off a mortgage now. Is that silly? Should I, instead, save for a further 10ish years and buy it outright? I most likely wouldn't live in the flat seen as my work means I'm not on land for long, so could potentially rent it out; although this seems like quite some hassle.

Basically, if you were in my position, what would you do? I'm very aware that I'm oblivious to investing and don't want to rush into buying a property etc. Of course, I may seek proffessional advice but it's super interesting to chat informally about this kind of thing on such a diverse platform!

personalfinance,"(US) student loan refi, 780 FICO, what should I expect for rates?","I have been paying my student loans for 3 years now. I have around $45,000 left on private loans, split into 4 loans, ranging from fixed 6-7%. I also have around $35,000 on FAFSA, which I believe is around 3-4%. 

Normally my minimum monthly payments are $560 for private and $320 for FAFSA, for a total of $880/month *minimum*. Because of COVID I've been able to not pay my FAFSA, which has been HUGE for my ability to save money. So I definitely don't want to refi my FAFSA. 

I'm looking to refi my private loans (Discover), because it seems that these rates are insane, and apparently interest rates are at all time lows, but idk if that applies to student loans/refi loans as well. With a FICO score of 780, and the current world condition, what kind of rate should I expect if I want to refi my $45,000 private loan?

I don't mind the $560 payments, I'd love to get rid of this loan asap, but I hate that so much of my payments are going towards interest. So I don't really want to take out a refi for a longer time interval to get lower payments, just to hopefully half my rate. I don't want to touch my FAFSA loan as these govt benefits are really a life saver right now.",finance

personalfinance,Help Thinking Through Cashing Out Investments for Downpayment on a Car,"My wife and I are about to enter the car market. We're looking to spend no more than maybe $25,000 on a car no newer than 2020.

We have plenty of money invested, all of it distributed across myriad ETFs managed with Personal Capital. Any amount of money toward the car will necessarily come from cashing out those investments. 

My question is: how do I go about thinking through how much  to put toward the downpayment and how much to keep invested? I could put down anywhere between 20% and the whole cost of the car. I've been weighing a car loan interest rate of ""very low"" (maybe as low as 1%? we haven't seriously researched this yet) against the unknown expected returns from the investments. This may not be the best way of approaching the decision since there are so many unknowns.",finance

Now I have checked my bank app and noticed few notifications, each notifying that my interest rates have changed. First to 6% then to 0.41% and then to 0.3%. My monthly repayments went from 820 USD per month to 590 USD. What should I do? Do I have a duty to notify the bank?",finance
personalfinance,Financial Advice Needed - Savings or Mortgage,"My wife (37f) and I (34m) are trying to decide how to proceed with our financial situation. Our financials look like this:

We both have 780-805 credit scores. No debt except for our car payments.

She has 300k in savings and a trust fund that will pay out 90k a year until 2027. She’s doesn’t work and is raising our &lt;1 yr old daughter.

I make 100k with a good company and will have consistent cost of living increases each year with at least one raise thrown in there. I have about 30k between my savings and retirement accounts. I would have more but the past few years have been expensive between an engagement ring, some high personal medical expenses, the expenses for the birth of of daughter, and the effects stocks have seen the past 6 months. I struggled a lot in my 20s and was not able to save until the last several years.

The goal is we save as much as possible until her trust runs out, and then I will become the sole provider of our family. If we keep our living expenses as they are now, we should be able to save about $3k a month until the trust stops. 

We live in Orange County California and I really want to purchase a long term family home for us. Home prices continue to rise year over year and interest rates are at an all time low. Would it make sense to purchase something over the next 6-12 months, or keep our expenses lower and save more? Perhaps there’s other options we haven’t considered.

personalfinance,Windfall of 10k. Get out of debt or refinance?,"Throwaway for this one. My parents approached me and said they'd like to gift me 10k dollars, with the stipulation that it has to be for a specific financial purpose of my choosing. They are wonderful people and I'm very grateful. I can't retire just yet, but it will expedite financial goals significantly. I also have 6k saved which factors into my decision as well.

**Context**(skip down if you don't care about this):My wife and I made poor financial decisions from 2014 to 2019 essentially. Racked up CC debt, lived above our means, etc. I got a better job and finally started making headway. We got our spending under control and stopped buying unless we had cash. Wife created a source of income that is unpredictable, but consistent. In the past 12 months we went from roughly 25k CC debt to 15k using the snowball technique. Before the impending windfall, we were on track to have no credit card debt by November 2021 or sooner (may or may not get EOY bonus, so just didn't factor it in). My job is very stable, it would be highly unlikely I get laid off. My wife's income is very sporadic, some months she makes more than I and others it's a drop in the bucket. 80% of her income gets saved/goes toward debt and 20% goes back into her work.

In 2018 we purchased a town home for 231k with an abysmal APR of 5.65%. I pay extra every month to work toward getting rid of PMI, but my main focus has bee eliminating CC debt. Current loan sits at 221k. Monthly payment is 1500. My take home is 5400 a month and adding on my wife's income, we are pretty comfortable with that payment. The interest rate eats away at me though.

We do plan on moving within the next 2 to 3 years as long as the sellers market we are in holds.

**The Decision**:To me it boils down to two choices:

1. Refinance my mortgage.  Since purchasing, housing has skyrocketed and my home is now worth \~280k conservatively. Probably close to 290k. I talked to my credit union and it would cost almost exactly 10k to refinance. Refinancing would get my an interest rate of \~3.4% even with my mediocre credit(670). My monthly payment would go from 1500 to 1200.
2. Eliminate CC debt. I have 3 credit cards. One with 3k, one with 4k one with 8k(kill me). 15k total. Can't remember the exact interest rates but they're all in the 24% to 27% range. Not good. I could take my dad's 10k and kill the 8k and part of one of the others. I could then potentially use 5k of my 6k I have saved and eliminate CC debt entirely. Or I could keep saving it and just be 10k closer to being CC debt free. Either way I think this is also a viable option.

I see merit in both options, but I feel like the emotion of eliminating CC debt is affecting my judgement so I would like outside input.",finance

personalfinance,Should I go ahead with this mortgage refinance option?,"Hi. I'm a newbie when it comes to mortgage refinancing. The main reason why I want to refinance is to have a lower rate. I have been with my current mortgage loan for a year and a couple of months now. I was offered an estimation of refinancing a loan from a mortgage broker. 

My current loan:

* Principle balance:  173,347.22 
* Interest rate: 4.75%
* 30 years fixed; no pmi
*  No Prepayment Penalty

New potential loan:

* 30 years fixed
* No Prepayment Penalty
* Interest rate: 3.000%
* Processing fee:  $695.00 
* Appraisal fee:  $425.00 
*  Credit Report/Flood Cert: $99
*  Title Attorney Fee: $500.00 
*  Lender's Title Insurance: $260.00 
*  Govt Recording Fee: $205.00 
*  Lender Credit: $695

In my opinion, I find that this new loan is good. I have some basic understanding of refinancing, but since I'm a newbie, there's probably something I'm overlooking. Should I bargain these prices? I'm interested in hearing your opinions. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"Bigger down payment for house, hold cash, or invest in index fund?","Given current interest rates, I'm debating what to do with cash I saved for a 20% down payment on a home purchase.

Some detail:

* 30 year fix-rate loan at 3.125%
* Monthly payment is split between principal, loan interest, PMI, and escrow (home insurance, property tax)
* PMI is 13.3% of the monthly payment, or 6.72%/yr of the remaining payment to 20% equity.
* 6 month e-cash set aside.

I hate the idea of paying the PMI, but I also wonder if I  might be better off taking that remaining of rest of the down payment and put it in an index fund (e.g. VTSAX). By doing that, I'm also paying 3.125% interest on the remaining down payment to 20% equity. Based on that, it seems to make more sense to put down a larger down payment if I'm only expecting \~7% annual growth from an index fund. That said, the market is all kinds of crazy, but seems like a lot of it still at a discount. If I DCA into the market, I may be able to take advantage of the discounts as well as maintain some cashflow for safety or invest in other opportunities.

As you can see, I'm a bit back-and-forth on this, if anyone has insights or opinions to share, I would greatly appreciate them. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Getting $10k Deposit. Broke/debt semi-stable situation. Can I make anything of it?,"EDIT: I don't know how to reddit. But I commented on this post with a layout of the planned order of operations to get my shit together. https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/hqe3uk/getting_10k_deposit_brokedebt_semistable/fxxwlw6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

So I've been lurking here for a while and seen so many inspirational stories. Decided to post for some advice from maybe people who've been in a similar situation. This is a maybe a throwaway account because I don't know what I'm doing and most people will probably find me to be an idiot for putting myself in this situation and I might just die of embarrassment if anyone I know sees this.

Current situation overview:

$0 Savings

$10k-15k Total Debt in Collections

&lt;$1000 monthly living cost

Horrible credit low to mid 500s (no credit/loan accounts open at the moment)

Income: Basically work the minimum amount required to meet my current monthly cost while avoiding paying off debt.

The interesting bit, I think, is that I'm expecting a deposit of $10k from a recent unemployment claim. 
I'm wondering if I can improve my situation and in what ways? I know I could probably just pay off the majority of the debt collectors with this but is there something I could do to grow this money short-term? Or a sure-fire long term plan that i can kickstart with $10k? 

Some ideas I had range from: putting it in savings and just living off the $10k for a while -to- starting a print/decal/sticker business.
There's also some things I want to get no matter what: Laser eyer surgery, maybe some pc upgrades for my 10 yr old rig, replacement for my 5 year old phone stuff like that but I've learned to fight impulse buys with various methods (i.e. posting here for advice)

Bonus info in spoiler: (maybe relevant? mostly just back story and my scatterbrain typing [venting])

&gt;!Due to the virus situation and actually being too scared to continue working, I have not been actively working since mid February 2020. I was living off savings and $1200 stimulus check and still have enough cash til the end of July. After I run out of cash I was planning on continuing work and risk getting sick as I would be traveling throughout probably one of the most virus affected counties in the US. I'm mid twenties so probably not high risk but still scared. As for the unemployment claim I wasn't planning on filing it because I could have easily just started working again (but also...virus) but I finally caved and claimed for the whole time I haven't been working (since mid-February.) I was surprised by the amount to be honest.

The reason I only work the minimum amount is because I'm lazy and privileged to be living with family and honestly abusing their generosity. I'm possibly suffering from depression in some way but have never sought help (It's never been as bad as self harm or suicidal thoughts but I do find myself in ruts sometimes but can usually come out of it pretty easily). 

Leading up to current situation:
I have work experience mainly in hospitality/service industry. Longest position was 6 years at a hotel front desk right out of high school while trying to do college. I never got anywhere there it was probably the definition of a dead end job. During my time there I dropped out of college after 2 years because I love learning but suck at school (you tell me how that works). I also started working a 2nd job in retail and that lasted for 1 yr of me working both jobs at this point I had been building my credit through a secured account and a couple of retail cards. So with two sources of income and some credit I decided to go for my first vehicle (this was ~2014). 

So I think this is where my early twenties self started to f*ck up. (probably don't read this now, I think I'm just venting. writing this stuff out is therapeutic)

I went around for test drives and decided I would get a motorcycle to get through commutes easier (you can probably start figuring where I'm from at this point). I was approved for $9k from a major bank towards a $10k bike with horrible interest rates probably I had no idea what I was doing and I was raised by a family that has always lived outside of their means and paycheck-2-paycheck. So with $9k cash in hand from the bank I went to the dealer and FINANCED THE REMAINING AMOUNT of about $2k again at horrible rates this one I remember being double digits. So I drive out of the dealer with my brand new bike and indebted to 2 financial institutions. The major bank (the $9k lender) never pressured for a lien? I honestly still don't know how that works. The dealers bank had the lien on the bike and was lending me $2k plus a credit line of I think $2k to use at their shop.

Mid 2014 Checkpoint:
$9k loan + $2k financed by dealer for motorcycle
some CC debt but at this point its reasonable
maybe average credit
horrible financial education (read: no financial education)
wireless carrier plan expensive phone

So after I'm comfortable with my new bike I decide that the reason I was doing horrible in school was the 2hr commute to school and 2hr commute home. I quit the retail job after being there for a year and stayed at the easier hotel job with less hours. I went back for a semester to the same school and riding through traffic cut my commute to 30m each way and I felt so much better. Academic drive renewed I ended up switching my major and started next semester at a community college instead because pricing and also an even shorter commute. I did great for the whole year in my academic, riding, and financial life for the most part.

When final exams came around I was ready to blast through all of them through the week. For the first exams day I was among first to finish early and be released. Some friends and I decided we'd go out for food after the day. I was freaking high on life.

And then a life changing moment. As I was riding home ready for the rest of the last week of my first year back in school (midish June 2015) a split second still ripples through my life. I'll spare you the details. I crashed (single vehicle, just me). Over the bars. Blacked out. Ambulance Ride. ER Visit. I woke up during the ambulance ride. I was lucky to come out with road rash and a broken clavicle (someone told me I should've been checked for a concussion since I lost consciousness for what seems like tens of minutes but I never did get checked). 

I had surgery the week after the crash to put my clavicle back together mostly covered by my insurance. Oh yeah I was unable to make it to the remaining finals and was unable to make them up even after filing appeals. So I was out of school again. I was also out of work for several weeks. I decided that I would not file a claim or even tell the bike insurer about the crash (I think I was scared they would say it was totaled when I could have it fixed for about $1k). Again no idea what I was doing and probably should've let the insurer know that I crashed the bike. 

While I was stuck at home recovering I think I became depressed, in my mind, having come close to death. My gear was mangled and I could not (still can't) recall the accident in my memory. I was out of school and I was upset that administrators/counselors seemed to care less and offered no help for me make up the exams. I was just done. It's June 2015.

I was able to pay my bills with what money I had and according to my credit reports I paid until Dec 2015 before stopping payments. On everything. Bank loan, dealer loan, credit cards, phone carrier, medical, everything. I remember I had been at this hotel over 5 years come December and I was not going to be getting holiday time off. I abandoned my position because I was going on a trip to see family no matter what. I hated my minimum wage dead end job I could just find a new one if I was let go. Of course there was no position waiting for me at the hotel come 2016.

The motorcycle lived on of course after repairs but would it still be with me was unknown. I did find another job (the first of many shorter job stints than the 5 year run at the hotel). I think I was beginning to realize just how much I was being f*cked in terms of interest rates and my credit cards had seen a lot of use during the tail end of 2015. It either seemed impossible and I gave up or I was giving the banks the finger at the expense of my own credit worthyness and financial life. Everything went to collections or got charged off and they haven't seen a dollar from me since. The bike was supposed to be repo at some point I said f*ck it and parked it out front but they never came for it. I guess the dealer didn't care about the $1k - $2k loss and I think the $9k loan was charged off.

I don't know where I was going with this but it's been 5 years since then and my credit is sh*t (low mid 500s). I actually got a second chance at the hotel in 2016 when they couldn't find someone to fill the position. I went back for the rest of 2016 with full control of my schedule before formally quitting before the end of year holidays. Since then I have vowed to myself to never continue working and getting comfortable at a job just because it's easy hence multiple short stints at various jobs (seasonal to 6 months). And now I would like to get my sh*t together financially before I die.

This is probably way too long but thanks if you read it I think it was just nice for me to type some of this stuff out.!&lt;",finance
personalfinance,Priorities - Student Loan V Investing 2 Scenarios,"Scenario 1

\-26 years old

\-48k gross

\-60,000 student loan w/4.52% interest rate (private loan so it's accruing)

\-I am currently paying $731/month, which will take me 10 years to pay off at this rate

\-I am doing the employers match for my 401k, while also contributing $200 to my Roth IRA

\-I have an emergency fund built up

\-My only other expenses right now are car repairs/oil changes, I have no rent

\-I plan to refinance in a year to see if I can lower my interest rate again, or should I do it sooner say 6 months?

Question

Should I be taking the $200 a month and putting it towards my student loan, rather than investing into my roth? 

Scenario 2

\-25 years old

\-Wife's gross is about 58k

\-Rent expenses $550 and food but minimal

\-Student loan not accruing because government has about 28k in debt highest loan is 4.5 average is about 3.8%

\-Contributing about 16% gross to employer plan, match is 5%.

Should I lower her contribution to the match and direct it to the loan?",finance
financialindependence,Oversaving in a 529 is a much smaller problem than you would think,"It's a discussion we have periodically - some people are paranoid about the penalties if you oversave in a 529 and then it turns out your kid doesn't go to college, or goes to a cheap college, or any other circumstance you don't need some or all of the money for education. So they advocate for saving in a taxable account instead. 

What are the differences? Well, there's two big ones. Some states offer a tax credit for 529s, though many don't. In addition, in a taxable account, you have tax drag on dividends, and in a 529 you don't. I wanted to see exactly how big the difference was between the final, post-tax amounts, for the two accounts in the scenarios when 0%, 33%, and 100% of the saved amount was qualified expenses. Math is run just for a few representative west coast states. NV/WA stand in for states without an income tax. AZ and OR have moderate and high state income tax respectively - with a small tax credit that somewhat makes up for it. CA has no tax credit, high income tax, and an extra penalty for non-qualified distributions.

Assumptions here:

1) We have a high-earning couple (I picked tax brackets for a couple earning ~$200k, as that's not *that* unusual on this sub) that maxes out all other tax-advantaged accounts, thus the only options for college savings are 529 or a taxable account

2) They save $10k/year at the beginning of the year from birth until age 18. For states that offer a tax break/tax credit, our enterprising couple puts the full amount of the tax credit into the 529 along with the $10k (that is, if given a $300 credit, they put $10,300 in each year). I picked this as a fairly large # so that differences would be easier to see - but proportionally the biggest benefit to the 529 is actually going to be just enough to max the state tax credit ($4000 for AZ, $6000 for OR). For states without a tax credit, it is identical proportional benefit no matter the contribution as long as the tax brackets don't change.

3) Growth is 7%/year of which 2% is dividends. In the taxable account, dividends are taxed at 15% plus their state tax bracket. In the 529, dividends are untaxed.

4) Penalties on non-qualified withdrawals are the income tax rate plus 10% in every state except CA - which adds an extra 2.5%.

5) It's assumed that tax brackets are unchanged in real terms moving forward. Obviously this likely won't be the case for the next 18 years - but how that affects capital gains vs income taxes on state and federal levels is anyones guess.

6) To make the math easier, I ignored the growth from age 18 till the end of withdrawal, with the assumption that all of balance would be withdrawn at the current marginal tax rate and given to the kid regardless during/after that period.

All numbers in thousands (except the tax break, which is really just $180 or $300)

||Tax savings up front from $10k/year contribution|Capital Gains Tax Rate (fed+state) for couple making $200k|Marginal Income Tax Rate|Balance in 529 after 18 years|Balance in taxable account after 18 years|Post-tax taxable amount|529 if everything is penalized|529 if a third is penalized|What % must be qualified for 529 to equal taxable account|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|NV/WA|$0|15%|24.00%|$363.79|$352.49|$334.85|$301.30|$342.96|54%|
|AZ|$180|19.24%|28.24%|$370.34|$349.36|$327.28|$298.79|$346.49|40%|
|OR|$300|24.90%|33.90%|$374.70|$345.24|$317.57|$291.60|$347.00|31%|
|CA|$0|24.30%|33.30%|$363.79|$345.67|$318.58|$279.61|$335.73|46%|

So to read the table, our couple saves $363-$375k in a 529 or $345-$352k in a taxable account, with the biggest difference being the tax drag in the taxable account. But post-tax, the taxable accounts only contain $317-$334k - due to capital gains taxes. The full 529 balance is available for education. But what about if it's withdrawn entirely for non-education reasons? Well, after taxes and penalties, it's only 
worth $279-301k. But even if only two thirds of the 529 money is used for educational expenses - in all cases, it's more final post-tax money than the taxable account. In fact, with some simple algebra, we can derive that as little of 31-54% of the pot of money being used for a qualified expense is enough for the 529 to beat the taxable account overall.

So is it better to not oversave in the 529? Absolutely. It's better to have the exact right amount in the 529, not have to pull any from taxable, and put all the extra in taxable. But if there's even a 50/50 chance that you're undersaving, the math works out that it's better to have that extra dollar for the kid in a 529 than a taxable account. The benefits of the loss of tax drag are just that important.

And yes, even if you *completely* oversave in this scenario and use *none* of the money for qualified expenses - you might lose ~10% of the overall balance (taking into account both benefits and penalties) - but I think the potential 10-15% benefit (if it's all qualified) outweigh that risk.

Note: I made a copy of the spreadsheet I used to generate the above [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10HRCc8Ggg1ai6gFtZiLCWeBC8WAz93svqW083LZDyoI/edit?usp=sharing). You're welcome to download it and use the generalizable calculator for your own scenarios, including lower tax rates and contribution #s. Outside of the tax credits, the 529 benefits tend to be much smaller for people who aren't fairly high earners, especially if your capital gains tax rate is 0. Honestly, if someone is in the 0% capital gains tax bracket, I don't think 529 contributions higher than enough to earn any applicable state credits would be worth it.

Edit: streamlined the table a bit to try to make it more likely to fit.

Edit 2: Major hat tip to /u/App1eEater who [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/hqexle/oversaving_in_a_529_is_a_much_smaller_problem/fxzuuvv/?context=3) that I over-estimated the penalties for the 529 if the distributions are paid directly to the beneficiary - the penalties in that scenario are assessed at *the childs* income tax rate, not the parents. That makes the 529 an even better deal! I'm not redoing the spreadsheet to take that into account now (too much work), but yeah... it basically means the taxable account almost always loses, and it loses badly.",finance

\-Debts: 10k student loan at 6% interest rate

\-Cash/assets:

stocks,$AGM AKA Farmer Mac Analysis,"**BACKGROUND**

**1) Who/What is Farmer Mac?**

Farmer Mac - hereon referred to as AGM for the sake of abbreviation - is to the agricultural industry what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are to the home mortgage industry. For those unfamiliar, all three are considered **GSE's** (**Government-Sponsored Enterprises)**.

2) **What does a GSE do?**

Basically GSE's act as secondary markets for mortgages and loans. In the primary market, a primary lender writes up a mortgage. This mortgage (or an asset of these mortgages) can then be sold to a secondary lender. The reason why these secondary lenders exist is because they are able to reduce the cost of capital on these mortgages/loans, making them more accessible to the general population.

In essence, a GSE like Farmer Mac improves access to credit.

3) **But wait, doesn't that mean GSE's take on toxic mortgage assets?**

In general, yes.

But there's a catch. Both the primary lenders that AGM purchases the bulk of these agriculture loans/assets from (the **Farm Credit System**) as well as AGM itself are both regulated by the **Farm Credit Association.**

The Farm Credit Association is an independent agency of the federal government which exists to regulate the financial institutions that provide credit to farmers.

In light of the Great Recession, the farm credit association has made tremendous leaps in ensuring only the most conservative underwriting measures to reduce the risk of default on these loans.

**FINANCIALS**

Now, here's the juicy part and why I think this is such a good investment. All this info is copy-pasted straight from their Q1 update:

* Provided $1.3 billion in liquidity and lending capacity in first quarter 2020, resulting in net outstanding business volume growth of $421.4 million;
* Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share;
* • Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure was $20.1 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share;
* • Net interest income grew $0.7 million year-over-year to $41.3 million;
* • Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, increased 14% from the prior-year period to $44.2 million;
* **• 90-day delinquencies were 0.37% of total outstanding business volume as of March 31, 2020**
* **First quarter provision for credit losses of $3.8 million, largely driven by expected COVID-19 impact.**

Look at that provision for credit loss. It's only $3.8 million.That's **0.09%** of their outstanding business volume. That's nothing at all. This means they don't expect to face significant losses on their assets.

**Dividend**

* AGM has a near 5% dividend yield with a payout ratio of \~35%
* AGM recently raised the dividend from 0.70 per quarter to 0.80 per quarter

**LONG TERM OUTLOOK**

* U.S. government won't allow farmers to suffer tremendous losses on their loans. Agriculture is a heavily subsidized industry and massive losses on agricultural mortgages and loans would be a huge detriment to the U.S.",finance

From reading through Mint's history, it looks like the part I was most interested in (the connectivity) came through a separate data aggregation company, Yodlee, until their acquisition in 2009. I also didn't make the connection that the API economy golden child Plaid was in this same space.

This sparked my interest to know more about the overall history and landscape of this vertical. I've taken some notes below. Curious for more thoughts/input from people who know more. I took a pass at detailing the front end of the developer experience by running through their docs, but would be interested about data quality and backend tech (is one doing more APIs and another more screenscraping?)

Yodlee

* General - Founded in 1999 and the OG of this space. Went public in 2014 and acquired by Envestnet in 2015.
   * Pros - Pretty strong support (the largest breadth?) across financial institutions
   * Cons - Seems like it was selling a lot of data without consent. Some articles mention it being more expensive. Seems like Envestnet doesn't know what to do with them as it's no longer the wild west and they can't monetize the data like they used to.
* Technical  (Developer Experience)
   * API documentation is nice enough, but a little confusing and cluttered
   * The flow for account linking is not API based anymore and requires their wizard
   * The authentication being JWT before but now auth token generated after auth call with client credentials and a user (sorta OAuth2 with different headers?)  is a weird switch (APIs seem to be heading in the opposite direction in general).
   * Seems like a pure REST API. Fine, but nothing special
   * They have Swagger and Postman package but only a Java SDK. Swagger is Swagger 2.0, so a little dated.
* Pricing
   * Four tiers in a freemium model with different features

&amp;#x200B;

Finicity

* General - Founded in 1999. Mastercard apparently acquired them just a month ago
   * Pros - They seem security focused with their messaging.
   * Cons - Dunno...a slight feeling of being a little less cutting edge?
* Technical  (Developer Experience)
   * Their API documentation is good, but a little disjointed in terms of how it looks/feels as you jump from Wordpress for the API quickstart/walkthrough over to their API calls on APImatic.
   * The flow for account linking is not API based and requires their wizard. I guess this is how these APIs work.
   * Client credentials in all API call headers, so sorta like Basic. Not sure that's the most secure, which is weird given their messaging.
   * RESTful, but not fully REST
   * API spec is available in every format known to mankind (all versions/formats of Swagger/OpenAPI, RAML API Blueprint, and WADL and WSDL). Comprehensive to say the least.
   * SDKs built right into docs (you can toggle from REST format to Java, Node.js, Ruby, etc). Lots of SDKs as a result (maybe autogenerated via APImatic?)
* Pricing
   * Pricing is the same on paper as Plaid. Either they copied Plaid or vice versa:

Plaid

* General - Founded in 2013 when the founders got fed up with existing offerings. Acquired competitor Quovo in 2019 to shore up access to investment accounts. Bought by Visa in January.
   * Pros - Really solid reputation (I've heard of them but didn't fully grok what they were doing) as developer-friendly/good support. More geared towards startups. It sounds like they somehow drastically [upgraded their coverage of institutions in 2019](https://tearsheet.co/data/plaid-can-now-authenticate-accounts-in-every-bank-and-credit-union-in-the-u-s/) (not clear how exactly - switch to Oauth only?)
   * Cons - Kinda curious about the cons
* Technical  (Developer Experience)
   * Their API documentation is great. Visually appealing. Quickstart leads you through their concepts and then their actual API has a ton to play with.
   * The flow for account linking is not API based and requires their wizard.
   * I was actually really confused by their API authentication process and generally their data structure (why call them Items?). client\_id, public\_key, public\_token, access\_token, asset\_report\_token... just a lot of unique concepts to grok. I did like their JWT webhook approach.
   * Not REST - all POSTS. Webhooks, which is awesome.
   * Official SDKs for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, and Go. Community SDKs for Python,Haskell, and .NET. A bunch of example apps. No Swagger/OpenAPI but that's not surprising given they're using webhooks (which OpenAPI only recently started to conceptualize)
* Pricing
   * Similar to others

MX

* General - Founded in 2010. Raised $100 million in 2019.
   * Pros - Seem to push a data quality / cleanliness angle and no outages. They are mentioned as using ""multiple sources"" and one article pointed to Finicity.
   * Cons - Seems like it could be a pricier option? Some article seem to suggest that
* Technical  (Developer Experience)
   * Their API documentation is straightforward. Quickstart/explanations are mixed in side-by-side with API calls, which is nice when reading through the first time, but hard to find what you're looking for laer. Can't tell what service they're using, so probably open source Swagger renderer or something like that.
   * The flow for account linking is either API or their MX Connect widget. Seemingly nice to have both options.
   * Authentication involves sending API key and client ID in every call, so sorta like a weird Basic. Seemingly not the most secure.
   * Mixture of GET and POST.
   * SDKs for C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby. No OpenAPI / Swagger specs I can find, but they do have  Postman package buried in their docs.
* Pricing
   * Different pricing than competition. Hard to tell which is better at different levels.

Other names in the space

Quovo - Competitor of Plaid that focused on investment accounts. Plaid bought them to round out their offering.

Intuit - Used to offer an open API until 2016. Finicity mostly took that market share.

Xignite - I see some older references to this company positioning itself as the ""cloud API"". This must have been an attempt in the heydey of ""what is cloud"" but they don't seem competitive now.

Kontomatik - Their name was on a few older posts. Their API isn't open (""contact us to learn more"") so I didn't explore a ton.

CashEdge - Founded in 1999, acquired by Fiserv in 2011. Don't seem to still be around.

Sila - I don't think they really play directly against the groups above, as they seem to be crypto, but they are SEOed to high hell around all the Google searches I was doing.

personalfinance,Clueless First Time Home Buyer,"Hello virtual friends.

I am posting this as my step dad is on the phone with another mortgage/lending company who wants him to re-finance his mortgage with a slightly lower interest rate going from 3.25% to 2.75%. My step dad also wants to put me, in my mid 20's, on the title of the home as well. Mainly because he is in his 70's and in poor health. 

Neither my step dad nor myself have any experience in finance or what to look for that would differentiate a good refinance from a predatory one.

&amp;#x200B;

In general I am clueless with money, and wanted to ask for any advice on this or red flags? Home is not nearly paid off and I am skeptical about the risk/reward of me putting my own name on a house I dont plan on living in.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.",finance

Yearly Bonus: $6,000-$10,000  
Student Loan Debt: $120,000  
Savings: $13,000  
 
My student loan debt is $38,000 in several low interest rate federal loans(3-4%) and $82,000 in several high interest private loans (6-8%).  

— 

The below is assuming no pay increases,windfalls, or changes in expenses.  
 
I plan to pay 2000 dollars a month towards my student loans.  
 
$1500 toward the low interest loans, plus my yearly bonus.  
$500 towards the high interest loans, to cover the monthly accrued interest.  
 
Once the low interest loans are all paid off I will put $2000 towards the high interest loans plus my yearly bonus until they are paid off.  
 
After all other monthly expenses I am able to put $200 away each month into savings, so by the time everything is paid off I should be more settled in my career and have enough saved up to put a down payment on a house.

investing,[Washington Post] The stock market and economy have parted ways. It’s a FOMO market now.,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-stock-market-and-economy-have-parted-ways-its-a-fomo-market-now/2020/07/12/c14246d8-c2bf-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html
&gt; 
&gt; It is impossible not to marvel at the apparently indestructible gap between the buoyant stock market and the less-than-buoyant real economy of workers, companies and jobs. One must say “apparently indestructible,” because maybe there is some simple and obvious explanation that eludes your correspondent. Otherwise, either the stock market is too high, or the economic outlook is too low. One or both must be wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Just last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) — a group of 36 countries — issued its forecast for the United States through 2021. It is unlikely to inspire much cheering. Acknowledging that much depends on the severity of the coronavirus, the OECD report constructs two scenarios: one that might be termed “pessimistic” and a second that is “more pessimistic.”
&gt; 
&gt; Under the “pessimistic” assumptions, the unemployment rate is projected at 11.3 percent at the end of 2020 and the economy (gross domestic product) falls 7.3 percent for the year. Both the unemployment rate and the GDP decline are larger than in any previous post-World War II recession. By way of comparison, the peak monthly jobless rate in the Great Recession of 2007-2009 was 10 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; The “more pessimistic” forecast assumes that there is a second wave of coronavirus cases. This delays the economy’s recovery and results in more deaths. In the “double-hit” scenario, the year-end unemployment rate is 12.9 percent, and the GDP drops by 8.5 percent. “The recession risks leaving behind a long-lasting negative economic impact,” the OECD warns. “Policies are needed . . . to help workers and businesses avoid scarring effects and fully recover from the crisis.”
&gt; 
&gt; Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the OECD could be too glum. A new report from the Congressional Budget Office foresees a slightly brighter future. It reckons the GDP decline for 2020 at 5.9 percent and year-end unemployment at 10.5 percent. Hardly a boom. The presidential campaign magnifies the uncertainty. President Trump or former vice president Joe Biden could easily say something that sharply moves the market.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, the stock market is clearly overpriced by standard measures. The workhorse of stock valuation is the price/earnings ratio, or PE. The stock’s price is a multiple of its earnings (profits). Suppose a stock sells for $10 a share with earnings of $1 a share. It has a PE of 10.
&gt; 
&gt; Historically, the PE for the entire U.S. stock market is about 15. But today’s market PE of roughly 23 is about 50 percent higher than the historic average. All sorts of theories have been advanced to explain these lofty prices. The most popular view involves the Federal Reserve’s policy of holding short-term interest rates near zero and flooding financial markets with money. The idea is that the low interest rates push investors into riskier financial assets, including stocks. Implied (but not yet said openly) is that the Fed might actually buy stocks to prevent a horrific crash.
&gt; 
&gt; William Silber, a retired financial historian at New York University, adds an interesting twist to this story. Investors and traders remember what happened in 2008 when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 stocks fell by 45 percent by mid-March 2009. “But by the end of 2009, the stock market had recovered almost all its losses,” says Silber. Many investors, he says, vowed not to miss that sort of profit-making opportunity again. When stocks tumble, these investors fortify their positions.
&gt; 
&gt; Writing for Project Syndicate, an opinion website, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller of Yale University argues that crowd psychology has driven prices up. He divides the current market move into three separate periods: a 3 percent increase from Jan. 30 to Feb. 19; a 34 percent decline from there to March 23; and about a 40 percent rise from the end of March until now.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the Fed made clear its determination to foster recovery, “FOMO” — fear of missing out — took over, says Shiller. What happens now is anyone’s guess.
&gt; 
&gt; “The stock market and the economy have parted ways,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “I’m not sure what will trigger a sustained sell-off in stocks, but surging [virus] infections and another round of more business closures will be difficult for investors to ignore much longer.”
&gt; 
&gt; There are other theories of the market’s disconnect from the real economy. One is the rise of computer-driven trading. Another is the role played by younger traders. Having less market experience than their elders, they may be less risk-averse.
&gt; 
&gt; Who knows? The stakes are huge, politically and economically. If the market keeps or increases its value, it could bolster the recovery and Trump’s prospects. And, of course, if the market loses value, it will almost certainly hurt the recovery and help Biden. As always, the market is caught between fear and greed.",finance

CryptoCurrency,JUST IN: Abra Crypto-Exchange App Charged by SEC for Selling Stock Derivatives,"The SEC [found](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-153) that popular crypto-app Abra violated federal securities laws for selling derivatives. Abra was offering Robinhood-like stock trading, except there were no actual stocks under the hood. The app didn't sufficiently screen users based on securities laws requirements.

Abra stopped offering these contracts in February in 2019 after conversations with the SEC, but then started up again in May by moving part of their operation overseas and restricting access to U.S. customers. Their firewall wasn't airtight and they still allowed a few US customers through.

End result? Cease-and-desist and a $150,000 penalty.

Banking,"After 17 years, I will finally admit Wells Fargo is the worst bank ever","I have been with Wells Fargo for 17 years.  I currently have $90,000 in a savings account with them.   A little over a year ago I was talking to my friend who has another bank.  We were discussing interest rates on our savings accounts.  I was at 0.02% with Wells Fargo and he looked at me like I was crazy.  Call me stupid, that's fine, but I never looked into what interest rates should be.  So I went to Wells Fargo the next day and the banking supervisor sat me down and moved me into a higher yield savings account.   Although he also told me I'd have to come back in a year because it will drop back down to 0.02%.  I noticed on my June 2020 statement that I was indeed back at 0.02%.  I went to the branch and had a sit-down meeting with a banker.  She told me there is absolutely nothing she can do and interest rates are very low.  The best they can do is 0.03%.  I walk across the street to another bank that was offering 0.25%, another 0.44%, and finally I found Capital One that offers a full 1.00%.  One percent!  We're talking 50x more than Wells Fargo is offering me, a 17 year loyal customer.   When I went to these banks and told them Wells Fargo offers me a max of 0.03% yield, they looked at me like my friend did a year ago -- astonished.  I also asked if after a year of  the interest rate they offer, if they'd drop me down to something like 0.02% -- like Wells Fargo does.  Again, they looked at me like I was crazy for even asking.

So apparently Wells Fargo screws over their customers to absolutely no end.  And you're an absolute sucker if you bank with them.  I know I was.

UPDATE: I have learned that Capital One can offer such rates because they have far less physical branches and mostly operate online with far less overhead.   Since I live minutes away from a Capital One physical branch, this has little bearing.  Good for Wells Fargo to be there for people in rural Idaho, but I don't need to be essentially paying for Wells Fargo's overhead because of this.",finance
personalfinance,(SLU) Coming off a gap year with a few options regarding education; Seeking advice on how to best use 21k USD in my current situation,"As it stands right now, I'm coming off a gap year and assessing my options regarding schooling as well as investment opportunities. 

In terms of schooling, I've received admission to an American university where I'd leave with 211k XCD (78k USD) worth of debt after completing an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering. Neither of my parents are keen on financing such a loan as well as putting up property as collateral, which is understandable. Internship opportunities as well as future potential for generating income is higher in this case but the amount of debt is staggering.

I also gained admission to a regional university where I would leave with about 75k XCD (28k USD) worth of debt after 3 years with a degree in CS or mathematical modelling &amp; processes. This would also require collateral as well as monthly interest payments whilst I study until 6 months after my bachelors at which point interest + principal would have to be paid. I have also applied for a full scholarship but the school has some time before they announce the recipients.

My third educational option is a scholarship I've earned to study medicine in a spanish country. My plane tickets, tuition, housing etc. is completely covered by this, however, I would definitely be limited to working in my home country in the Eastern Caribbean. As well as a more limited scope for generating income. I'd leave with no debt and would be guaranteed a job on my return home

The main issue arises where due to the current economic climate, my mother finds herself unemployed with mountains of debt to pay off herself and thus can't assist me financially. My father is reluctant to pay the interest on the loan himself and wouldn't want to be a guarantor.

I'm fortunate enough that my (divorced) parents saved a lump sum of money for me to the tune of 57k XCD (21k USD). I'm pondering how best to utilize it given my current circumstances. I've recently asked for control over the account (which my mother didn't take too well) so I now have full access to the money. The interest rate for the savings account is 2% per year which is quite poor so I've been wondering about putting the money in an index fund overseas or putting it towards my education.

I'm not the most financially informed and there aren't many consultants for this sort of thing locally so I've come to /r/personalfinance for assistance.",finance

stocks,It Has Become Too Easy To Make Money In The Stock Market And That Should Concern All Investors,"I think most people who visit /r/stocks are aware of this trend, but I think it bears repeating because I do not think this will continue past the presidential election. 
     So what is happening and why. Since the March 2020 lows, the market, especially the Nasdaq, has gone crazy to the upside. There are several reasons for the gains, the main one being the unprecedented actions of The Federal Reserve. I won't go into details on all The FED has done. I think that it important to remember that The FED has promised to continue what they are doing with no deadline to stop, plus they are ready and willing to do even more! 
     Some other reasons for why it has become too easy:

I have significant (like really significant - yay for professional school) student loans at a sub prime interest rate (yay for low interest rates for professional LOCs in Canada!). 

Due to the low interest rate, it makes sense to balance investing and debt repayment, rather than repaying the loan completely first. 

What I’m trying to visualize is, if I contribute x to my retirement savings monthly, and make a debt payment of y monthly, when will I “break even” so to speak. 

I’m not excel savvy enough to do it myself, but I think it’d be really helpful to visualize what happens if I change the value of x and y as described above.

economy,Law school loan forgiveness bubble?,"TL;DR: It seems that employment for new attorneys (both in the public and private sector) will be impacted by an economic downturn. A recession may also limit students ability to qualify for federal and school-based loan forgiveness programs, and may put constraints on law schools' budgets. Are current law school loan forgiveness programs more unstable than people think? And more broadly, is it likely that these loans themselves are risker than the government estimates?

Hi all,

I am about to take out some loans for law school. This is the first time I've ever made this type of long-term financial decision and investment. An interesting question arose as I have been jumping through all of the loops for paying tuition.

Does anyone have a sense of the overall risk in the law school student loan market, and specifically the long term viability for the existing loan-forgiveness programs? My sense is that loans for higher education are almost always seen as a ""good bet/investment,"" although I'm not sure if given the current climate this is still true. I should preface this by saying that I do not have an econ background, so please forgive me if any of these reflections seem naive or misguided. 

Just to provide some background, the federal government currently allows easy access to loans for incoming law students. On average, across the country there are currently around 30,000 students graduating with 150,000 in debt per year ([https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/](https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-law-school-debt/)). If those students go on after graduation to work in the public sector or meet certain income maximums, their loans are forgiven after 10 years. Many top schools also have their own loan forgiveness programs that work in tandem with the government's forgiveness program, where if similar criteria are met in terms of employment (public sector employment, and an income max), the students are not required to pay any interest after graduation. An additional (and important) requirement for both federal programs and schools is that students need to be employed in a job that is ""JD required"" - i.e. loans and interest will not be forgiven if you have low income and are working as a barista (I have nothing but love for all of the coffee mavens out there, and this is an unfortunate reality imposed by these lending and educational institutions). 

Again, my knowledge of econ is very limited, but there are a few issues that I noticed while filling out my loan applications:

1. There are minimal credit checks for taking out these loans. Students' income and ability to pay back the loans also varies significantly based on the quality of the school they go to, which is not taken into account when the loans are approved. 
2. Employment opportunities will likely change substantially based on an economic downturn from COVID. This article discusses financial instability in law school loan forgiveness after the 2007/08 recession ([https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the\_law\_school\_bubble\_how\_long\_will\_it\_last\_if\_law\_grads\_cant\_pay\_bills](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_law_school_bubble_how_long_will_it_last_if_law_grads_cant_pay_bills)). Given COVID, the impact on non-profit jobs will mostly likely be most strongly felt in 1.5-2 years, after current  grants to non-profit organizations expire and are not renewed. Right now most state, federal, and private grants to non-profits are ""locked-in"" through 2021, but after that, non-profits expect they will see cuts to their budget as grant money dries up (from lack of taxes for gov't grants, and lack of funds for private grants that depend on the market). This could limit students ability to qualify for loan repayment assistance through the type of employment, since most non-profits will not be hiring. Insofar as lawyering jobs at private are already competitive, and have already been limited by the COVID downturn, there will be restricted employment opportunities in these high income areas too. This restrains 1) graduates' ability to earn enough income to pay back their loans 2) their ability to be employed in a ""JD required"" non-profit lawyering position, since more students will not be able to qualify for the loan forgiveness programs if they have to get jobs outside the legal field.
3. The COVID downturn may also place strain on law schools' budgets, since application rates (and the resulting tuition) may decline. Even if admissions is still robust, schools may have less financial aid to offer, requiring more students to take out loans. This is perhaps the least easy aspect to predict. This article discusses how admissions initially rose during the 2007/08 recession before beginning a multi-year contraction ([https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/law-school-applications-are-down-will-covid-19-spur-a-late-comeback/?slreturn=20200613183326)).
4. There are multiple ""feedback loops"" between the federal government, loan servicers, and law schools. I've read that in financial networks these kinds of feedback loops can be a marker of overall instability, although truthfully I don't have any real understanding of why this is the case, or what level of complexity would signify risk ([https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-covid-19-coronavirus-violence-outbreaks-principles))

Anyone have any thoughts about this? Please feel free to provide any and all corrections on these points, additional links, or just some general reflections. Outside of its personal impact on me as an incoming student, it's sort of interesting to understand how all of these loan granting institutions spread their fingers through the economy.

This quote is taken from the link in the second point above, from the American Bar Association: ""The federal government’s gamble that higher education will continue to result in higher personal incomes eerily echoes Wall Street’s risky assumption that historical patterns in real estate values would carry forward forever and enable many sliced-and-diced mortgage-backed securities to attain AAA ratings.""",finance

personalfinance,New Credit Card?,"So right at a year ago, I posted for ideas on which CC to get for my first time. After some good advice and researching, I decided on Discover It student card, as they offered good cashback options to me, as well as a matching offer for the first year (which is just about to expire). 

Basically, for those of you that do not know, I get 1% cashback on all purchases, and 5% back on specific purchases that rotate quarterly (walmart and target, gas stations and amazon, things like that). For the first year those are doubles, so I was actually getting 2% and 10%, respectively. 

I was wondering if there are any better cashback cards out there that I might be able to look into? A little more i fo about me:

In my 20s, full time student, married
Household income is 30k, most of which is from my wife
FICO score as provided by Discover is 695-715 range
Student loans of $5500, all in my name
No missed payment
Never payed interest, as I always pay off the card weekly
This card was the first I had ever had. 

Again, interest rates do not bother me, as I use this only as revolving credit to give some gains on daily purchases. Seeing the amount I have saved in just this year, I am certainly going to keep doing this. 

Also, will applying for a new card negatively affect my credit score? Not that it is of concern at this moment, as I will not be looking for a new place to live for several years.

personalfinance,New car buying fear.,"Just got back from the dealership. Looking at 2020 Camry, don't remember model but it's the second tier sport model. 
We are trying to get out of a bad interest rate that we basically were self forced  into, (don't judge me), on a 2015 Kia Optima at a 21 percent interest rate. We've had it 2 years. We owe 11k on the Optima and they are going to give us 4k trade leaving 7k to roll into the Camry. They are talking about possibly getting us 2.9% rate on the Camry. Payment would be around 600 for 72 months.

The Optima is looking at repairs soon with currently unknown cost and more loss of value over time and milage added as per usual.

I feel like we are doing the somewhat smart thing just to get out of the high interest rate. We can afford the 600 comfortably and I'm not so sure  we want to keep sinking money into the Optima. The Optima payments are 375 so we could increase the payment to 600 on our own to pay it faster but don't really want to risk impending repair costs and depreciation much less the interest rate. 

Now it is up to Toyota to determine if they even want to deal with us and won't know till tomorrow because they were closed by the time we settled. 

Just curious if we are at least thinking somewhat correctly about this.

investing,Exclusive: Trump administration to soon end audit deal underpinning Chinese listings in U.S. - official,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-stocks-exclusive-idUSKCN24E2XW

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to soon scrap a 2013 agreement between U.S. and Chinese auditing authorities, a senior State Department official said, a move that could foreshadow a broader crackdown on U.S.-listed Chinese firms under fire for sidestepping American disclosure rules.

The deal, which set up a process for a U.S. auditing watchdog to seek documents in enforcement cases against Chinese auditors, was initially welcomed as a breakthrough in U.S. efforts to gain access to closely guarded Chinese financial information and bestowed a mark of legitimacy on Chinese regulators.

But the watchdog, known as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), has long complained of China's failure to grant requests, meaning scant insight into audits of Chinese firms that trade on U.S. exchanges.

ADVERTISEMENT

The lack of transparency has prompted administration officials to lay the groundwork to exit the deal soon, according to Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, in a sign the PCAOB will give up on efforts to secure information from the Chinese.

""The action is imminent,"" Krach said on Monday in an emailed response to questions. ""This is a National Security issue because we cannot continue to afford  to put American  shareholders  at  risk, to put  American  companies at a disadvantage and  allow our preeminence of being the gold standard for financial markets to erode.""

One other administration official and three former White House officials said terminating the memorandum of understanding was under consideration, adding that the White House was involved with the discussions.

The White House declined to comment, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the PCAOB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It is not clear when or how the administration would revoke the agreement, which requires 30-day notice by either party, and its termination would not directly threaten the listed status of Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Among some of the bigger Chinese companies trading in the United States are Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Baidu Inc. (BIDU.O).

But discussions about revoking it are a sign of growing frustration by U.S. authorities over a lack of disclosure by Chinese companies widely held by U.S. investors that could lead to a more direct crackdown. It also comes amid rising U.S.-China tensions over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus and its move to curb freedoms in Hong Kong.

ADVERTISEMENT

In May, the administration successfully pressured an independent board that oversees a $40 billion international pension fund for federal employees to halt plans to track an index that includes Chinese companies, citing “risks to investors resulting from inadequate investor disclosures and protections under Chinese law.”

In early June, President Donald Trump assigned a group of officials including Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the PCAOB, to recommend measures within 60 days to protect U.S investors ""from the failure of the Chinese government to allow PCAOB-registered audit firms to comply with United States securities laws.""

'LONG OVERDUE'

Last week, PCAOB Chairman William Duhnke said he saw ""no prospects"" of being able to properly do its job overseeing disclosures and preventing accounting fraud in China.

Pressure is also mounting from Congress, with the Republican-led Senate passing a bill that, if approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives and signed into law, would bar securities of any foreign company from being listed on any U.S. securities exchange if it has failed to comply with the PCAOB’s audits for three years in a row.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hardliner, said it was ""long overdue"" for the administration to take ""decisive action"" on the issue as the Senate has.

ADVERTISEMENT

""In addition to terminating this MOU, which allows Chinese companies to openly defy U.S. laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability, we must address the Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of U.S. capital markets, which is a clear and ongoing risk to U.S. economic and national security,"" he said in a statement to Reuters.

But some U.S. investors have raised concerns that such moves by Congress could shut them out of high-yield investment opportunities that would remain open to investors in other countries.

China itself may have helped prompt the latest campaign by Washington to flex its muscle on audits by amending a securities law in March to ban any Chinese person from sharing any securities-related document with regulators overseas without approval from the securities regulatory authority under the state council.

But the limits of the MOU were visible from long before, according to industry figures. The agreement, which is not legally binding, does not allow the PCAOB to conduct inspections of Chinese accounting firms and explicitly permits each side to deny document requests if they violate domestic law or the national interest.

""The MOU represents a gaping hole in U.S. investor protections, while providing the framework for systemic Chinese fraud,"" said Kyle Bass, a hedge fund manager and vocal critic of China. ""It's unconscionable that the United States continues to allow Chinese companies raising trillions of dollars from U.S. investors to avoid complying with basic U.S. securities and audit standards.”",finance

vet,Question about a recent rescue cat who was likely pregnant.,"In mid April a building was being emptied out at my job. The people who previously worked in the area fed and “kept” a good bit of stray cats. When the company decided to quit renting the building it had to be cleaned out. There were about 12 cats, and my family decided to take one of them. 

In very late April we noticed she started to gain weight. We had given given her flea medication and took her to a vet to get shots and to ensure she had no parasites. We thought she may have been pregnant. By early May she had gained a good bit of weight and her nipples had pinked and swollen. She ceased her constant door moaning, we assume she was in her first heat when we got her. 

It is now July and we had her a nest set up. I was looking for her a week or so ago and found her in the neat. Upon removing her there was some blood present. We called the vet and were told some spotting is normal. At this point she is still very large, her nipples are no longer swollen or pink, she does little but sleep or eat, and she is having frequent loose stool.

Am I right I’m assuming she likely lost the kittens and needs to go to the vet immediately?

MachineLearning,[D] Trying to increase the F1 score for an NLP data extraction problem,"We have a problem reaching a decent F1 score when tackling this NLP data extraction problem.

When given a group (i.e. Female dogs, male dogs) we want to extract relevant numerical data from a paragraph:

Female dogs often have 5 big spots, whereas male dogs have 2 small spots. Both dogs experience discrimination due to their spot count. However, while female dogs are discriminated against 60% of the time, they often receive 30% less harsh treatment, than male dogs. Male dogs are discriminated against only 20% of the time but will receive harsh treatment 70% of the time. 

The female dogs grouping would extract:

* 5 big spots
* Discriminated against 60%
* 30% less harsh treatment

Male dogs:

* 2 small spots
* Discriminate against \_\_\_  20%
* Harsh treatment 70%

**What we've tried:** 

Our current architecture embeds and vectorizes the words using BERT, while concurrently attaches POS and dependency tags as additional features for each token. We also attach the group words as additional tokens in front and at the end of the paragraph. The sequence of paragraph tokens is then fed through a bidirectional LSTM network, each token has a score (1 if it is relevant to the group, 0 if it is not relevant to the group) and we train the network to predict the relevant words in the paragraph. The training set is broken into 5 subsets for ensemble learning.

We have tried just the BERT embeddings without the POS and dependency tags and we lose \~2% in F1 score. 

We score correctly positive predictions at a 1:3 negative weight (our loss function increases the loss by three-fold on positive tokens to punish missing positive tokens, while this inflates false positives it greatly improved recall for positive tokens at the correct threshold, with an overall boost to F1) to best accommodate the imbalance of negative tokens and paragraphs with no positive tokens (data is imbalanced and sparse). 

We have approximately 2000 rows of data that we use (1000 rows of positive data and 1000 rows of negative data, at 95% negative tokens and 5% positive tokens), and 3000 rows of negative data we chose to exclude from the training We exclude a random 3000 rows each training iteration to swap the random samples to expose the models to as many negative cases as possible.

Our current F1 score is 45% at the optimal threshold.

stocks,Simple trading question,"Simple trading question (noob)

Hello everyone! 

So I recently got into trading stocks, the last couple months. It’s been a fun ride, and I have been enjoying my time. Although I still have yet to grasp, the whole day trading scenario..

I understand 25k = unlimited day trades..

Now what is a day trade? I don’t have the feds for that 25k minimum. Let alone, not looking to make any risky bets on a pump and dump. Any answers via google are generic. I don’t want my account to get locked for 90 days.

——-

This is how I have been trading:

-Buy stocks in “A”, on Monday. 
-Sell Stocks “C” from last week, on Tuesday.
-Buy Stocks in “B”, on Friday.

Is that 3 day trades? This is what I honestly think it is.. I have been strategically buying and selling, within those 3 days. Since 4 trades, surpass that 3 in 5 day rule. 

——-

From what I see online, it states a day trade is buying stock in “A”. Then selling that same stock later in the day, completes a single day trade. Which then creates “1 out of 3”, in a 5 day period. 

When I look into purchasing let’s say 1 stock in 5 companies, not much pops up. Can I buy 5 stocks from 5 different companies, in a single day? Or does that count as 5 day trades?

Better safe then sorry, and learn from the more experienced!! 

Have a great day, and happy trading!!

personalfinance,"(US) Filing taxes, married filing jointly. IRA question to reduce bill","Hi, 

I have a higher tax bill this year, and TurboTax offers me the option of reducing the total federal due if I open a Traditional IRA.

It splits the contributions between me and my spouse. In practice, all banking has been done under my name (out of habit, not intention). For example, they recommend 6k from me and 6k from my spouse.

If I open an IRA at a place I already have an account, it will be under my name. Will contributing the sum 12k under my name break things with the IRS over this? That is, does something need to be in my spouse's name? (Again, asking for speed of opening/contributing. There's a whole separate tangle about how the credit reporting agencies have started recording spouse's SSN wrong and I'm hesitant to open accounts while that's not corrected.)",finance

Student loan debt $28k - I did start a debt consolidation plan through FedLoan to help take care of this last year

Medical debt $30k - I had surgery last year with no health insurance. That bill has gone to collections.

Other small lines of credit - I'm pretty good with these. I don't miss payments and pay things off early if I can. However, I have not been paying off the balance at the end of the month. I just found out that this is the most beneficial way to handle these types of credit. 

I do have some debts that went to collections from when I was younger that I don't want to pay on because I've been told that it will stay on my report for the next 7 years after my last form of activity on that account. 

I hope this is enough information and that someone will be able to help me or get me pointed in the right direction. Thank you guys in advance for any help you're able to give.",finance

CryptoMarkets,CMV: Exchanges are just casinos in disguise.,"Here me out. Today's hottest platforms (e.g. Binance, BitMex, Robinhood...) are just casinos disguised as financial tools. 

Nowadays, the biggest casinos on the block don’t offer Blackjack or Dice. Instead, they offer a host of features like 100x margin, options trading, and now yield farming.

I don't want to criticize innovative platforms, but rather, draw parallels between them and gambling sites (like our own [EarnBet.io](https://EarnBet.io)). 

The average user understands the risks when they play a hand of Blackjack.The average user may not understand the risks when they open a 125x margin position on Binance (and most on this sub are probably more knowledgable than the *average* user I'm referring to).   


**Let's take a look at BitMex**

https://preview.redd.it/mceq1ae67ua51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c8b313c2fc50687995a4e152d277a464b41196

Arthur Hayes, a Citigroup and Deutsche Bank alumnus, has become a billionaire and one of the ultimate casino bosses by bringing BTC derivatives contracts and margin trading to the mainstream.

Woohoo, finally we can make massive bets with small amounts of collateral using 100x leverage. 

Like most unregulated crypto exchanges offering complex financial products, BitMex has faced accusations of trading against their customers, weaponising server crashes, and profiting heavily from liquidations—accusations Hayes has denied of course.

If the house always wins, BitMex has straight-up built itself a mansion.

**What about Binance Casino?**

https://preview.redd.it/53su128f7ua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adbb38beca84f47a3ded911147d98552c923e243

Not to be outdone, Binance recently began offering 125x leverage, graciously even explaining why this extremely high-risk position could be more profitable than a boring 20x trade:

[Don't you want an extra $1250, or nah?](https://preview.redd.it/l84yd74h7ua51.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a603ea67baf3890ed1578f7ee38e6458ff7889)

Binance recently delisted FTX tokens (leveraged bull/bear assets) explaining that they were too confusing for users. Two weeks later, Binance released their own arguably more complex leveraged tokens.

Even platforms with products outside of the cryptocurrency space, like Robinhood, have realized they can turn their stale retail investing apps into casinos, all without having to attain a gaming license. 

Robinhood, which offers cryptocurrency investing, is super aware of the crypto-trader mindset. With an average user age of 31, Robinhood offers tempting gains from penny stocks, margin trading, and options. 

*""The gambling casinos are closed and the \[Federal Reserve\] is promising you free money for the next two years, so let them speculate. Let them buy and trade. From my experience, this kind of stuff will end in tears."" - Leon Cooperman, billionaire investor* 

*""It’s almost like being in Las Vegas. They want to maximize the emotional impact of seeing that number” -* *Dan Egan**, MD of Behavioral Finance and Investing, Betterment*

Various message boards recruit members to run stocks up in thin after-hours sessions. Now companies advertise on r/WallStreetBets and /biz/ to pump their stocks and undereducated young investors are often left holding the bag. 

**Conclusion**

Most exchanges are basically just casinos, and the behavior of most retail investors is similar to gambling. Trading on margin against the massive institutions of the world (and front-running exchanges) probably gives you worse odds than playing Blackjack with us. Agree? Disagree?",cryptocurrency

I want to switch banks for my retirement fund and contribute more money to the accounts. I've tried researching different banks, but I get lost in all of the options.

TL;DR: Can anyone recommend a bank for retirement savings with a decent interest rate? I believe I want to continue with Money Market accounts, although I'm not completely stuck to that.",finance

personalfinance,Section 2202 questions on IRA loan eligibility,"First off, this is not the first place I've searched for an answer to my questions so this may be beyond the scope of Reddit, but before I go calling a tax expert, I figured I'd see if someone in a similar situation could weigh in here.

I'd like to take a distribution from my IRA to contribute to a down-payment I will make on a home within the next month. Section 2202 says that:

&gt;The CARES Act defines a qualified individual as, an individual, who themselves, or their spouse, or a dependent is diagnosed with COVID-19, or who experiences adverse financial consequences from COVID-19 due to:

&gt;Having a reduction in pay (or self-employment income) or work hours.

During the pandemic, I have in fact had a reduction in hours directly caused by the coronavirus and nothing related to job performance. I have also qualified for the federal unemployment payment through the Michigan Workshare program. The short version of this program is that businesses may cut back on employee's hours, then the employee will be eligible for state unemployment and by extention the weekly federal unemployment payment.

So for me, while I have had a reduction in work hours, which based on the quoted text follows an ""OR"", and my paycheck from my employer has been reduced, my overall weekly access to cash has increased for the duration of the CARES program. After this month, however, the CARES act will either cease or decrease payments to me and depending on how long my employer continues the workshare program, I may net less for the year than otherwise expected. However, as an essential business, we may also increase hours and need, resulting in my hours returning to normal and my yearly total income including unemployment may put me over that which I would have made normally.

I called my IRA provider and they were unable to determine my eligibility, and they said that if I wanted to take advantage of the program that I would simply take the funds from my IRA, then figure things out come tax time.

This uncertainty is a problem for me as it is a significant amount of money and paying a penalty or taxes on it is absolutely not something I would risk. The money I would take would be taken as a loan and repaid in full over 3 years per the Section 2202 guidelines. It would be used to put a downpayment of 25% instead of 15% on a house and lock in a slightly lower interest rate.

(A 20% down payment is a no go because it does not actually lower my interest rate relative to what I would have with a 15% down payment, I know that sounds backwards, but that's coming straight from the loan officer and he said that it was a very weird change within the last year).

So obviously I don't want to get to tax time and find out for whatever reason I am ineligible to have received the IRA distribution there's no way I'd be able to afford that come tax time if I had to pay fees and taxes on IRA money.

Does anyone have a good resource or person to call who would be able to answer this problem? Or am I just going to have to ask a tax professional?

personalfinance,Future Planning: Financial Advising?,"Hello all,

So I'm trying to start working toward gaining financial independence for myself. I'm a recent grad (25F) with a Master's, I work in my field but don't make a lot as I'm just starting out ($15.01/hr) and with COVID merit increases have been frozen for the time being for employees so I'm not expecting a pay increase for some time (live in CA). 

I have student debt ($70k total), but a good amount of savings ($30k). I know I'm going to refinance and consolidate my student loans for a lower interest rate through my current bank. I have also set up my own retirement as well and am contributing to it monthly. I have my car paid off and no significant credit card debt either. 

The thing is I'd really like to work towards buying a condo or townhouse in the next year. I'd like to improve my financial literacy and work towards that goal. My parents have recommended I look into a financial advisor to work towards achieving my goals and setting myself up for success with my finances. I'm just experiencing trouble even figuring out where to find a financial advisor. I know my bank (Navy Federal) provides some but they all seem to specialize in retirement and investments. I know that financial planning is more than just planning for one life event, but I just don't know where to start when trying to find a financial advisor or even if that's a good idea. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, I know I'm young and things are very unstable right now but I do work in healthcare so my job isn't something currently at risk for becoming non-essential. I just feel a little lost in the process and although my parents have been supportive and helpful, this isn't something they are very familiar with.

Edit to add: I currently live at home rent free and have no major expenses. I have a fairly good credit score as well, 747 but I don't know if that has any significant effect or merit given my situation.

Edit 2: please read the post, I'm not asking if I should buy a house right now. I'm asking if a financial advisor would be a good option for helping me to pursue a goal later on down the line. I am in no financial standing to buy a home right this second, trust me I'm aware of that I've done the financial breakdowns and I'm not going to set myself up to fail. I just need to know where I can seek guidance on financial planning or merit in this case.",finance
personalfinance,Paying my way through college,"I am an incoming freshman going to an OOS school and I have to pay for a decent amount of my tuition/housing costs. I am lucky enough that my parents can pay for about $3000 for each academic year, and I also have a scholarship that covers about half of my tuition (but it only applies for my freshman year because I have plans to gain residency for tuition purposes). The only loans I am taking out are the $5500 federal ones.


However, that still leaves me with a decent chunk I have to earn. I only have a few thousand in savings right now, all of which is going towards fall semester, and I’m currently applying to jobs in my college town and on my campus. I’m looking for guidance on what jobs are smart to have during college (i.e. jobs that have a lot of downtime so I can study) and if working 35 hrs/week is feasible. 


I also want to be able to pay for school by myself by the end of my sophomore year. With that decision there are many things I would have to give up like buying a car before I graduate or building up savings, but I really don’t want to mooch off my parents, especially if I have the means to pay for everything by myself.

I write a check maybe once or twice a year - it'd be nice to retain ability but not necessary.

personalfinance,Parents gifting a decent amount of Series EE bonds to help with a down payment,"My dad bought EE bonds in my name every year from 1990-98 with the intention of it going to a big purchase and that time has come: we're looking to buy a co-op in Brooklyn soon.  We're visiting them on the West coast and I'm not thrilled about traveling with this much physical currency. Not a huge deal but given that we'll likely be using the money within the next year, I was thinking about taking them to my bank here and cashing/depositing it now.

The value has tripled but only a of the bonds have reached full maturity (issue price $50 - current value $207.36).

Many of them look like they have a 4% interest rate and have twice the principle in interest, but the youngest ('96-98) have a 1.48-1.57% rate. These have ""only"" doubled (issue price $50 - current value $110).

We have been saving a lot of money in the past year+ but will likely need to use all the bonds and then still sell investments to get enough funds for the down payment. Am I making a terrible mistake by cashing them all out now? I think I can convert the paper bonds to an electronic account, which I may end up doing -- but there are a lot here, is it worth it if I'm going to cash them in in the near future?

Say I wanted to cash out only half, is there a smarter way to do it? Like sell the mature ones first, then the ones farthest from maturity? Or sell the oldest first no matter what? Likely this won't happen, but if someone says ""STOP! You'll miss out on $$$ if you sell RIGHT BEFORE the bonds mature"" I might rethink my strategy.

personalfinance,How to Compare 2 Mortgage Quotes,"I'm trying to compare two mortgage refinance offers but am having difficulty comparing apples to apples regarding costs. Obviously, both provide an APR, but that APR is based off wildly different assumptions for closing costs that should be pretty similar. What's the best way to try to get an even comparison?

For example, in the ""shoppable"" section, one lender has line items for ALTA 9, ALTA 8.1, survey endorsement, and notary fee, none of which are included in the other lender's estimate (or any other estimate I've seen). Does that mean these could possibly be removed, or is the first lender just more cautious and charging me for that?

The first lender has escrow amounts of $170 for home insurance and $4740 for taxes. The second has $915 and $3575 respectively. The second is far more accurate.

The first lender estimates prepaid interest of $362, the second $-34.

If I go strictly by the interest rate, points, origination charge, credit report, and appraisal, the first lender comes out ahead (granted it's close). If I throw in all the other stuff, the second lender comes out ahead even after setting all the escrow and tax stuff to the same values.

FWIW, here's the key factors in the 2 loans I'm looking at:

Lender 1:

no origination charge, $765 appraisal

solarenergy,Cutting ties with gas fired forced air. Electric heating options.,"We are in Edmonton, Alberta, and experience winter about 4-5 months of the year. The temperature can drop as cold as -35°C, although the wintertime average is more around -15°C. Our 8900W residential rooftop solar power system is producing about 7500 kWh/yr. After we put our house on a crash power diet last year, our annual consumption is around 4000 kWh. The house was built in the mid 60s, it has a typical forced air gas fired furnace, that is reaching the age of replacement. 

I would like to explore other options besides just a high-efficiency gas furnace. I am very interested in mini splits, or a replacement forced air furnace that is electric. It is my ultimate goal to completely eliminate our dependency on natural gas. Last year, we replaced our typical gas fired hot water tank, with a more modern one that is a hybrid heat pump/electric style. In the summertime it is consistently warm enough that we do not need our furnace at all for the months of June, July and August, and our gas consumption was 0.0 GJ, we still got about a $45 a month gas bill completely made up of administrative charges.

Our floating gas rate is very low, we pay on average, about $2.31/GJ. There is also a federal carbon tax. Over the last two years we have paid about $830 a year for gas, by tracking the bills I found that the actual gas only accounted for about 20% of those costs. Everyone I talk to about electric heating in Northern Canada complains about how power intensive it is. But if I take $830 at our current six cents per kilowatt hour rate, that gives me almost 14,000 kWh of electricity. Factor in our surplus production and the elimination of duplicate administrative charges, and it becomes more attractive.

I am looking for some advice from someone who utilizes either an electric furnace and or mini splits with some type of supplementary heating in a cold temperature zone such as Northern Alberta. I find the minisplits to be an exceptionally attractive option, but I recognize they are only efficient to about -28°C, so we would need a supplementary heating system when it is colder than that. Historically, it is colder than -28°C for about 15 days a year where we live.",energy
economy,Coming Back Better than Before,"&amp;#x200B;

The Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the countries that did not execute an aggressive and coordinated response. For the first time ever, the United States is one of those countries.

One major reason why the US has, by far, the most cases and deaths of any country is the clear lack of leadership at the national level. However, the pandemic has exposed many other systemic weaknesses in our country. The American political and economic structures that allowed us to be the world leader for the last century, appear to be working against us with this new killer disease.

To some extent, we have been the victims of our own success. The strength of business in the US allowed us to achieve a dominant economic position after World War II. This prosperity fueled an incredibly strong middle class along with enormous innovation and technological advancement.

Over the decades, companies have been pushing for continuous growth at aggressive rates to keep their investors satisfied. Corporations have evolved techniques to maximize revenues and minimize costs. After all this time, that approach has created enormous inequality and stress on our society. Those weaknesses have been exploited by this pandemic, which has left tens of millions of Americans exposed.

With this vicious pandemic, we were forced to essentially pause our economy. Millions of jobs have been lost and people have suffered greatly – both medically and economically. Businesses are going bankrupt and our global trade system will be changed forever. 

Our challenge is to use this time to correct our underlying economic problems and come back in a way that benefits all Americans. Either we will make the economic inequality greater, or we can generate a rising tide that lifts all boats. The rich are poised to buy up bankrupt businesses and assets and build the next generation of winning corporations. After all the suffering and sacrifice, do the people of this country want to benefit from the eventual economic renaissance, or be sidelined forever as a cheap temporary labor base competing for whatever jobs can no longer be automated.

When the next pandemic or other disaster hits, do you want to have economic security and medical coverage, or do you want to go through the type of stress and hardship that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing now. 

The United States is still, by far, the richest country in the world. Let’s come back in a way that preserves our freedom and way of life, but allows for more than 10% of us to prosper. 

Let’s examine some of the economic issues we were facing before COVID-19, as they have been exacerbated since.

&amp;#x200B;

**Troubling facts before COVID-19**

**Corporations over People**

· Corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes – Individuals paid Income tax of $1,700B in 2019, while Corporations only paid 230B (only 11% of Fed tax revenue in 2019). That 2019 ratio calculates out to individuals paying 7.4X more than corporations. In the 1950’s, it was &lt;2X.

· Corporations had been using the majority of their profits to buy back their own stock or pay dividends to shareholders – increasing Executive compensation instead of improving the company, compensating employees, or saving for a “rainy day”.

· Corporations use lobbying power and lax campaign financing rules to have an out-sized influence on our politicians, legislation, and policy.

· Corporations can shop which states to locate in, extracting incentives and low state and local taxes at the expense of the communities they leave as well as relocate to.

**Financial inequality**

· Income inequality - Over half of American workers make less than $30,000 per year. 40M American families need “food stamps” to get by.

· Wealth inequality - The median net worth was 65,000, and less than 15% of workers have a pension to fall back on – vs – 18.6 millionaires in the US (&gt; 40% of global). Three people (Bezos, Gates, Buffet) have more net worth than the bottom half of Americans (160M people)

· Billionaires and other Ultra High Net Worth Individuals control Political Action Committees (PAC’s) that influence elections and political behavior to the benefit of the top 1%

**State inequality**

· Small states have as much as 4x the per capita “voting power” for their residents than the largest states due to inequities in the electoral college system 

· All states have 2 US Senators, but California has 68x the population of Wyoming

· NY, NJ, MA, CT, CA, and IL paid 319B more in Federal taxes than they received back in Federal spending (2015-18). VA, MD, KT, AL, FL and NC received 1,010B more from the Federal government than they paid in. (note: that the Fed government runs nearly a $1T budget deficit so overall the paybacks to states are 1.2x+ what they paid in

The pandemic has exacerbated these issues and viciously exposed the weaknesses and unfairness in our economic and social systems.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Troubling economic effects from COVID-19**

**Corporations over People**

· The majority of Federal bail-out money went to Corporations and businesses, and not to help individuals. 

· Many corporations that spent the vast majority of their profits on stock buy-backs while the economy was strong, received Federal funding despite their bad business judgement. They reaped the reward, but didn’t take responsibility for the risk they took. If it is capitalism, there should be consequences, such as bankruptcy, for corporations who make bad decisions.

**Financial inequality**

· The vast majority of “essential workers” make less than $11/hour with little to no benefits. They are asked to take the risk of disease for the rest of us with very little financial benefit, and inadequate safety equipment and testing. \[Note: Minority populations are much more affected, but the subject of racial inequality is so huge and important that I will not attempt to go into that dimension here.\]

· Tens of millions of American workers are now unemployed, with very unknown prospects for getting back to work again. 

· With higher unemployment going forward, there will be downward pressure on wages for those who can keep their jobs.

· The wealthiest people who have cash to invest will buy up valuable assets and profit from this economic collapse. 

**State inequality**

· Weak Federal response to testing, tracing, and PPE not only created an environment where the United States has dramatically more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country in the world, but the State governments had to fend for themselves and pay inflated prices for whatever they could purchase.  In addition, unemployment and other benefits to individuals and families are paid by the State with little to minimal support from the Federal government.  With the concentration of cases in NY and NJ early on, those states had to absorb the most cost.

&amp;#x200B;

How can we use this painful and terrible disruption to change things for the better? Here are some principles and objectives that the majority of Americans can get behind and demand get done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Put People over Corporations** 

· Tax reform for Corporations – eliminate tax loopholes and reform the corporate tax structure so the Federal government takes in at least 1 corporate tax dollar for every $2 dollars paid in individual income tax. (Some areas of select focus should be eliminating overseas tax shelters and strictly limiting carry forward losses.)

· Eliminate stock buy backs – go back to the earlier rules where stock buy backs were not allowed and were treated as a form of insider trading. At a minimum, require all corporations to meet minimum pay and benefit requirements for their employees plus accumulate and hold enough cash to cover a year or two of operating costs before they can issue dividends or buy back any stock. 

· Eliminate tax breaks for stock options and awards. Strictly limit (or eliminate) the amount of executive pay that is tied solely to stock performance. 

· Campaign finance reform - Eliminate PAC’s and impose strict limits on donations plus maximum caps on election spending.

· Lobbying reform – put strict limits on corporate lobbying as well as strong oversight and governance on politicians getting any financial benefits from lobbyists or the businesses they represent (including jobs after their terms)

· Impose minimum corporate tax rates that all States must adhere to so companies can not drive down the state and local taxes they pay to rock bottom.

· For future emergencies, ensure that individual citizens are protected as a first step. No one should go hungry, lose their apartment/house, or need to worry about medical coverage. Those basic individual needs come first – before any discussions about business subsidies, bail-outs, or economic stimulus spending.

· When corporate bailouts are discussed, they must be in exchange for equity if the company has not saved enough cash to cover their costs for 1 year minimum. If the company paid dividends or did stock buy-backs, they would need to turn those shares over to the government before any government bailout money could be provided.  Bankruptcy will be more common when companies are not fiscally responsible, and the rights of workers will be protected above shareholders in bankruptcy settlements.

· Institute a single payer Government run Health care system that covers all Americans - removing corporate profit that Private Health Insurance companies currently extract to reduce overall per capita costs. 

· Reform Oil and Mining policies and legislation. The taxpayers need to get a much larger stake in resources that are extracted from American soil. The US should consider nationalizing the Oil industry, or, at least, setting up a sovereign fund similar to what Norway has. All other mining businesses need to be similarly treated.

· Basic utilities such as water and power should be nationalized. Utilities should be run for safety and efficiency and not a source of profit generation for corporations.

**Reduce financial inequality**

· All US citizens will get medical coverage as a basic right.

· The minimum wage will be raised to $15/hour and adjusted for inflation going forward.

· Estate Tax reform, including a requirement that all accrued investment capital gains are paid upon a person’s death before passing down as inheritance. 

· US corporations will bring manufacturing and outsourced jobs back to the US. This will be accomplished via tax penalties and incentives in additional to government oversight on the outsourcing of critical / essential / strategic industries. 

· The US government will shift domestic spending to programs and projects that increase jobs and improve people’s everyday lives. Focus will be on capital improvements and good paying jobs with benefits that bring value to our society.

· The US government will also focus on future job creating technologies by increasing investment in Research and Development and protecting the Intellectual Property (IP) that is created – including giving the government a financial stake in future profits for projects that have been invested in, as well as not allowing other countries to gain the IP without adequate financial compensation. Focus on innovation, which has traditionally been a powerful differentiator for the United States but is now languishing. Recognize that social media and similar technologies that focus on diverting attention to drive ad revenue are not actually advancing our society.

· Campaign finance reform. Eliminate PAC’s. Cap individual donations. Limit total spending allowed for campaigns. Elections should not have to be a multi-billion dollar media circus.

· For future emergencies, policies need to be in place to call out what jobs are considered essential and then pay those people a bonus in line with the risk they are being asked to take for the public benefit. This should be one small part of a pandemic plan that is well documented and ready to be executed instantly and without partisan bickering.

· As part of pandemic planning, the Federal government will need to be responsible for subsidizing the state unemployment pools to cover the increased costs due to government action.

**Fairness across the States of our Nation**

· The electoral college system must be eliminated. The US needs to enforce 1 person 1 vote.

· The role of the Senate needs to be reformed, with less power due to the inherent inequality of a system that gives low population States so much more per capita voting power.

· Every state should get back no more/less than 10% +/- back in Federal spending than they paid in through the Federal income tax of their residents. Any deficit spending by the Federal Government must also be allocated back to the states in proportion to the federal taxes paid by the people in that state.

· A pandemic plan (and other emergency plans) must be in place with funding to keep it current, actionable, and best of breed. Politics should be removed with quantifiable, fact-based rationale for when and where money is spent. State governments need to be compensated for their excess costs and individuals must be protected above businesses. The plan would define everything required to immediately execute testing, tracing, PPE manufacturing, etc. as appropriate, in a nationally coordinated manner. States should not have to compete for assistance.

These types of reforms will be hard to do in our current political climate, but we must demand bold change in order to fix the broken, corrupt, rigged system that has obviously failed us all. Corporations and Billionaires have gotten their way for many decades, but they got extremely greedy and took it too far. Now we need to try a different approach – a fair, balanced, humane, democratic approach that puts people’s quality of life ahead of the desires of a greedy few.",finance

If I put it all towards my car loan, I’ll pay it off more than 9 months early and will have another $260 a month to throw at the big loan. So that’s tempting to be closer to owning my car outright, even if I would technically be better off in the long run paying off the big one.

personalfinance,Help Managing debt/investing as a college student,"I (19M) am going to be a 2nd year college student in the fall, going to my states flagship state school. My family is fairly low income and can’t support me with college expenses, but fortunately I received a large scholarship from my school which covers all of my costs except about $4k/per semester. In my first year I took out a standard federal unsubsidized loan of $5,500 for the year and paid the rest of the costs out of pocket. 

Now going into my second year I am in the even more fortunate position of being an RA at my school which gives a room and board credit to my account without effecting my scholarships. This brings my bill for the fall semester to a $6,000 credit that is including another year of $5,500 in unsubsidized loans. 

I am having trouble deciding how to handle my student loan situation since I am very fortunate and with the credit on my account and have the possibility of cancelling the loan and paying down the $5,500 of debt I have. Despite this obvious opportunity I have also started investing in the past year and have been trying to build up a good amount of savings for when I graduate college as I am planning to move out/away from home due to the nature of my work. 

As I see it I have 3 obvious options to my loan situation:
1. Let the loans ride and take the money and moderately invest it. (The loans are on a 4.5% interest rate)
2. Pay down first years loan with 2nd year loan’s money to help build credit while still having some leftover to invest. 
3. Cancel the loan and pay down my debt. 

Other info that is related, I am going to school for a double major in Econ/Poli Sci and getting a masters in Poli Sci in my 4th year. My ability to find work after graduation is obviously harder than some majors, but many of the opportunities are potential government jobs that might pay for my loans if I keep them.

personalfinance,We get a higher % tax break from a bigger IRA contribution?!,"We have an income of just under $100K, about one third from Social Security (me), half from my wife's job. Since our income will drop substantially when she retires, we still do IRA contributions, and I've been playing with the numbers in TurboTax. What I found was that, for the first $7500 we put in, our tax bill goes down by $900 (i.e. 12%). But then if we put in another $5500 (the max we can do), it drops by another $1224 (or 22%).

In other words, we will come out about $450 ahead by putting $13,000 into IRAs this year and zero next, rather than about $6500 both years. Is this really true? I don't get why the feds would make tax brackets regressive like this.

ETA: Jmb3930 answered my question below. In effect, the government's formula for deciding when Social Security benefits are taxable does in fact give you a lower tax bracket with higher earnings, if you are a married couple where one partner is working and other is on SS.

My dad does not do computers beyond checking his bank balance to see what checks have cleared. He does not want to link their accounts between the two banks to do a transfer. I have come up with the following not ideal ideas:

1. Open up a new account at my bank with the POA for them and have dad write a check to deposit in the account. I would only leave a small amount in the account and would then feel better to report it on my financial disclosure.
2. Have dad write me a check for the $100,000. Deposit in my personal account and wire the funds out of that account. I am very hesitant to do this as I will likely get a SAR or CTR filed.

My fiancee and I are in need of some help--I think we need to speak with a financial advisor, but I have no idea where to start and suspect I need someone with certain specialties due to our particular situation. In short:

* Due to COVID-19, my fiancee is unemployed and is likely to have much lower earning potential than I do for the next few years
* My salary is over $100K so as long as my job remains stable, we are in good shape financially
* I have about $20K in student loan debt
* No other debt
* No kids and no plans to have any
* My fiancee is heading back to earn a degree, and as such will be applying for financial aid--she's hoping to fund the majority of her schooling between scholarships and grants
* We are relocating for her schooling, and will spend the next \~year establishing her as an ""in-state"" student
* Modest savings of \~6mo expenses that I hope to grow aggressively after we move
* My fiancee's credit score appx 625 while mine is appx 800
* Lastly, we anticipate buying a house sometime in the next couple of years

The issue we're stuck with is that we know we should talk to *someone* but we don't know where to start. We're not looking for investment advice for the time being. We're also wary of ""financial advisors"" who may not have our best interests at heart. Our questions are things like:

* Should we wait to get married?
   * We know we want to marry eventually
   * COVID-19 has made it clear that we shouldn't delay unnecessarily
   * We're left with questions like:
      * Will being married make my fiancee ineligible for most federal student aid?
      * Will being married make it harder to buy a house in a couple of years?
* Is the school's financial aid office likely equipped to answer these questions?
   * My fiancee is concerned that the school will not like hearing out our plans to first establish residency so she can qualify as an ""in-state"" student?
   * Even if they can help us with questions relating to the FAFSA, should we be talking to someone else regarding the other aspects of our financial plans?
* What are we not thinking about that we should be? We're coming up on a huge life change and I feel like we should have more questions.

Banking,"""Cashless Society"" Rant.","Banker at a small CU in the Northeast here. I had a family member share one of those memes on Facebook that essentially was saying ""Cashless Society would be terrible, no doing side jobs for cash, no birthday cards to kids, everything is traceable, banks can freeze your money at will"", you get the picture. So I, being the voice of reason that I like to think I am, put in my 2 cents. For the record, I believe that a cashless society would have some drawbacks and some benefits, but overall I think it would be a net gain for most people. Feel free to initiate a friendly debate on it, I like the idea but it's not necessarily a hill I want to die on. Here's what I said below, feel free to chime in with thoughts: 

&amp;#x200B;

"" As a banker, I have to step in and give my 2 cents (pun intended). First off, a cashless society would be almost impossible because of how divided our society is; if half the country is getting upset about wearing a face mask in public during a pandemic, there's definitely going to be those opposed to going cashless. Second, as far as transferring COVID via cash or card, cash is immensely more risky because of how many times it changes hands. A card comes out of your wallet, gets swiped at a machine, and goes back in your wallet. Not saying it's a foolproof way to not transfer COVID, but it is significantly better compared to dollar bills which can get downright filthy (I have seen this firsthand). Next, banks don't just block cards whenever they feel like it, we do it as a safety precaution if there is evidence that the card may be compromised. Trust me, we don't like people calling and yelling at us that their card was frozen any more than you like it, but it's a necessary evil to protect the money of those who bank with us. And it's a simple phone call to verify the identity of the cardholder so the bank can either A), unblock the card if there was no fraud, or B), order a new card if there was actually fraudulent activity. This saves the cardholder time and aggravation from having to go through the dispute process. Next, your money is infinitely safe in a bank than in a mattress, safe, or pocket. If your house burns down and/or you get robbed, you are SOL. If a bank gets robbed or burns down, everyone's funds are federally insured and protected by the same government that people are trying to say is after their money. Next, full disclaimer I am not a tax attorney, but it would be hard to argue that money in the bank = taxable income. As far as all actions being traceable, the banking industry has very strict privacy standards and it would require a legal subpoena before we could turn over any information to law enforcement or any other agency. Next, and this is the big one, a cashless society would still have multiple alternatives to exchange money. These include electronic transfers such as Venmo, CashApp, and Paypal, and also checks, whether they be personal checks or bank checks. There are also bank-to-bank transfers and wire transfers. While I believe that there are benefits to a cashless society, I believe that the majority of America would be too busy spouting conspiracy theories to focus on what those benefits actually were; less chance of losing money due to robbery/disaster, less time wasted counting/verifying money, no chance of losing it, etc. Instead of mailing Junior a birthday card with $20 in it, an electronic transfer could be done in a matter of seconds from the comfort of your couch and would accomplish the same end result. I would appreciate it if people would stop and think things through without jumping onboard with all these conspiracy theories. A quick conversation with an expert on any given topic could bring some well-needed perspective to some.""",finance
personalfinance,"I know nothing about finances and was just gifted 20k, what's the next step?","I've tried reading other threads and info on here but everything seems so situation specific.

So here's the details. Married couple, making less than 60k a year with a savings account nearing 10k, recently gifted 20k from a relative.

Right now it's in a (separate) savings account at my husband's credit union, with (I believe) a 0.75% interest rate.

We're trying to figure out what the best step is next. We (knock on wood, anyway) shouldn't need the money anytime real soon due to the other savings I mentioned. We're looking now at higher interest savings accounts and CDs of varying lengths. But I also wondered, would it be worthwhile to take advantage of some of the banks that have a ""bonus"" for opening a savings account and maintaining a certain balance for 90-days or similar? Looks like some of them have bonuses up to $500, which is obviously more than the 1.5% I've seen on high interest savings accounts and CDs. But I feel like I must be missing some kind of catch or that maybe I'm not understanding why it makes less sense in the long run.

personalfinance,Early 30s- Looking for a pulse check on my current financial situation and plan.,"Hi PF,

Long time reader, but created a burner to post. Looking for an objective pulse check and thoughts on where I am standing today. For background, I graduated college with massive amounts of student loan debt ($80k\~) in 2010 and managed to work my way up from making $20k\~ right out of school to $100k by age 27. I worked under some pretty toxic bosses, bad work environments, and put in some very long weeks to get to where I’m at today.

Financial goals include owning a house or condo in the next 5 years, but I live in a high property tax state that will most likely see increased property and income taxes. Would also like to increase my investing in long-term stock holds as well as start experimenting with short-medium holds.  My job is incredibly secure, financially stable and the company is growing.

My near-term plan is to aggressively pay off my student loans within the next year and then start down payment saving. I know my EFund is lower than most like, so I would like to boost that as well even though I have large credit card lines ($20k).

personalfinance,"International Student - I couldn't afford last semester's tuition and it ended up going to collections (Washington, D.C)","Throwaway Account

I didn't have the money to pay for my final semester at George Washington University.  The university assigned my debt to a debt collector. I never signed any documents and I don't have an SSN. I am a little confused about the statute of limitation laws regarding this type of debt. 

I understand that federal and private student loans never expire, but I did not take out any loans with the university. 

Does my debt expire after 3 years?  If not, does it ever expire? 

If I keep ignoring them, (I don't have the funds to make payments), will the debt go back to George Washington University?

Can the collections agency's efforts to collect the amount owed be detrimental to me if I don't have an SSN?

personalfinance,Need some direction on big purchases (house/car) plus retirement/investing.,"35m, wife is 30. Expecting our first child around March. 

We make around 150-160k a year, but have fairly high bills. We live in MA so not cheap, and probably been guilty of a bit of lifestyle creep. I have been learning more about finance, investing, etc and seeing the error of our way to some extent, but the pregnancy also has got me wanting to be a bit more responsible.

We pay 3200/mo in rent, and are here until June next year but feel like we are hopefully going to be ready to buy which should help reduce some of that monthly cost if we buy sensibly. 

Other expense is a $400/Mo car loan that has about $19k owed. 4.24%

We currently have about $85k in cash savings, but it is just in a saving account. This is a mix of emergency fund, house fund, and ideally want to set aside about $10k for another car as the second car needs replacing in the next year.

We have no retirement as yet really (i have 2 jobs, one of which gives me a 3% match so i take that but that probably only really equates to about 1.5%. 

So i guess the $85k is really:
$30k emergency fund
$55k house/car 

We are saving at a reasonable rate at the moment and covid has helped with that. $2-3k a month pretty consistently. So hope to add maybe another $20k or so to the $55k.

So I guess i am trying to figure out the best use of that $55-75k in the coming year.

Buying a house/lowering the monthly house payment is a priority. We are looking at southern NH for slightly lower cost of living and would be probably be looking i think at the 375-400 range. 

What sort of down payment should we be looking at? Seems interest rates are low so am i better putting down less and using the excess in some other way? Whether car debt, investing, etc. 

I know we need to get on the retirement stuff. The hope is with lower house payment and less need to save so aggressively for a down payment, we’ll have that excess to put more towards that (albeit with childcare costs to worry about too). 

Seems at the least maybe I’d be better paying the car over a larger house down payment assuming i can beat the 4.24% interest rate?.. but would i best trying to invest that instead if i can average 7% + with investments? Or best to have more put into the house?

It’s currently an upside down loan as I went with a 72-month term and put no money down. (Bad call, I know...)

Anyway, interest rates are way down right now and given my current credit score, I may be able to refinance and lower my rate to 2.29%. 

However, I’m considering purchasing a home in the near future. I know that refinancing will take a toll (slight, I hope) on my credit. I have enough credit history that closing the existing loan shouldn’t make too much of an impact, but the hard inquiry alone could cost me. 

Refinancing will only put $100 in my pocket each month and will reduce my back-end DTI from 46% to 44%; however in the long run I’ll be saving money (I mean it’s only $700 but f*ck the Man, right?). BTW, I’m looking at an FHA loan so my DTI should qualify. 

I guess the question is, how long will my overall home loan application suffer after a refinance? 3 months? 6 months? Is my credit in well enough standing that a refinance will make a negligible impact?

personalfinance,Savings/Investing Advice,"I've received a large promotion (35% wage increase) and I have not increased my standard of living. I very quickly paid off my car, my wife's car, and both of our student loans. Due to not having those payments, my rate of disposable income has grown even more. 

My question is, what do I do with the rest of it? I've been stashing it away in an online savings account for now until I can make a move. Is it better to invest this, or put it all towards my mortgage? If it's better to invest, what do you suggest? My mortgage interest rate is 4% and if I put all of this towards my mortgage, I'll have it paid off in about two years. Other than my mortgage, I have no debt. I started my mortgage in 2011, so I am kind of fearful that if I pay it off this early, it will hurt my credit score. It's one of my longest running accounts. When I paid off my student loans (my other longest running accounts) it hurt my credit score. Right now I'm sitting at about 815 and I'm hoping to not hurt it, although I'm not sure what I even need it for.

I do already have a large emergency fund.

I do have an employer managed retirement fund (it's complicated) and I can't increase or decrease the amount I put there. They're taking about 7% from my checks.

Is there anything I can do to either somehow temporarily take out a loan greater than 100k then pay back (cash out maybe?), or is there other ways to be able to obtain the lower rates? Had I know this prior, then I would've made a smaller payment before refinancing.

Any advice is appreciated!

personalfinance,Finding a mortgage lender,"Hi all,

The buyers finally agreed on the purchasing price for what may seem to be our dream house (1.5 years looking). Basically, I need your advice on mortgage lenders and trying to understand these points. I'm purchasing a home for $670k and putting 20% down payment. Our mortgage will be for 30 years and went to a few mortgage lenders.

Mortgage lender #1 (Rocket)
2.99% with 4,000 lender's credit

Mortgage lender #2 (loandepot)
2.99% with 6,000 lender credit
2.875% with 2,700 lender credit
2.75% with 0 lender credit 0 points

I understand that in the long run I will pay more interest if I take the higher interest rate. The 6k will definitely help since we're putting pretty much all of our savings toward the down payment and closing cost. Don't worry, our household debt to income ratio is less than 30% with the mortgage.

Question There is a chance that the mortgage rate will go down even further in the next 6 weeks. Am I locked in at those rates? If I can change the rate, will this affect the date of my closing?

Should I take the lower rate?

How many more lenders should I continue to search? Is there a one stop shop of lenders online? Should I go to a bank in person?

Will this affect my credit score because these are hard inquires (I’m at 804)?

EDIT: I forgot to ask, would it be crazy if I wanted the lenders to waiver the appraisal? The reason being is that this house was undervalued and had 10 offers. The initial winner backed out and I eventually won but at a bit of a higher price. I'm afraid that if the appraisal comes back, I've heard that lenders will not pay for the difference, which is why I may want an appraisal waiver.",finance

personalfinance,Dad laid off with mortgage payments and 6.25% rate,"Context: my dad just got news he's getting laid off at the end of the month (he's done janitorial work at the same building for 20+ years). My parents purchased a house during the housing recession and have 6.25% interest rate with 40K left on their mortgage and haven't been able to refinance it because of their DTI ratio. They're also immigrants that don't speak much English nor have the right access to resources to understand their own situation/options.

I'm trying to get an understanding of what to do next. Should we do forbearance until my dad can find work? Should we try to refinance (can we with only 40K left?)? Should I try to pay off the bulk of it myself (I could try to pay half of it in lump sum)? Would refinancing it in my name make any sense?

40K left with $1300/month payments

Any guidance would be appreciated. TIA!",finance
personalfinance,Bought a new car didn't read contracts and now paying $9500 in extended warranties and aftermarket packages. (LONG READ),"Just to preface this, I had been having car troubles for months and really needed a reliable vehicle for my job. I know how a lot of people feel about brand spanking new cars and how they're a mistake.

I've been saving some money for a few years. I had been researching cars for months and finally decided on a 2020 Honda Civic Sedan. I plan on keeping this thing for many many years. It's a Honda after all.

I made sure to email them and get a OTD offer before actually going to the dealership. The OTD offer that was given to me was $23,500. I was told that this included all fees and that this is what I'd have to pay towards my car.

I get to the dealership, this was June 30th (last day of the month), and we're working on financing the vehicle and my credit. I couldn't actually take the vehicle off the lot because I only had liability insurance on my current vehicle and was told I needed to be fully covered to drive it.

The saleswoman takes me outside to see the car. I get in and I like it. I've had my eye on this car for almost a month so I already know quite a bit about it. I ask her if I could see inside the trunk. She pops the trunk and what do I find? A gun magazine and a pack of cigars. YES! Not a magazine ABOUT guns, but a fully loaded gun clip. I WAS SHOCKED and didn't know what to say. She was shocked too but politely took it in her hands and tried to move on as if it didn't happen. I did the same. It was awkward. This is a legitimate Honda dealership.

Anyway, we go back inside and I finally get to talk to the Business Manager, Jeff Jones. He starts showing me all of this paperwork I have to sign. Again, I went to this place by myself and have never bought/financed a new car before.

Like an idiot, I PUT MY INITIALS AND SIGNATURE ON EVERYTHING smh. I asked about the OTD of $23,500 and he confirmed it, so I'm like ""Okay, as long as that's the final number.""

I go home, without the car because I couldn't get full coverage for insurance until the next day.  I'm looking over my paperwork and I don't like what I see:

The final price, including State Motion Vehicle Tax ($1,386.81), Registration fees ($193), and inspection fee ($7) totalled $23,775.80. That's not bad. I put $8,000 down. and that brought my total down to $15,775.80. That's not bad either. But then I see Vehicle Service Contracts ($4431) and Aftermarket Packages ($5075) bringing my total back to $25,478.84. Needless to say I WAS PISSED.

I go back the next day and ask to see the business manager to go over my paperwork again, step by step, WHICH IS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE TO BEGIN WITH. He tells me he added the extra contracts and aftermarket packages so that I could get approved for financing from the bank because my credit wasn't very good. I did try getting approval from BoA, a local credit union and Chase bank and got denied by all of them, which surprised me because my credit score is almost 700.

Anyway, he added something called Kahu ($1,495), something called CostGuard ($3,480), Safe Guard New Vehicle Precision Care ($1,585), Safe-Guard Premier Ultimate Vehicle Protection Plus ($1,995), and last but not least a Prepaid Maintenance Plan called The Next Mile ($951).

After reading the contracts, it appears I won't be able to cancel Kahu or Safe Guard Precision Care because I WAS COMMITED AS SOON AS I SIGNED FOR THEM. Two of the others I can cancel in 30 days (Premier Safe Guard and CostGuard) by writing in and I have 60 days to cancel The Next Mile.

My question is, can they do this? Is this normal? Stuffing all of this into my contract to qualify me for the loan? I know I fucked up by BLINDLY SIGNING FREAKING CONTRACTS THAT ARE LEGALLY BINDING WITHOUT READING THEM WHICH IS WHAT I READ REPEATEDLY THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER DO WHEN BUYING A NEW CAR, or anything for that matter.

Honestly, I just assumed they were factored into the final OTD price. That's an extra $9.500 worth of extended warranties and aftermarket packages. I could cancel 3 of these things and save $6,426 but I don't know if I should. It's a new car and I guess it would provide a piece of mind. I got two weeks to cancel two of them. I really don't know what to do.

BTW, my interest rate is 7.24% at $388/month for 84 months! On top of that I got talked into paying nearly $500 for protective floor mats and side door stripping for door dings. And when I actually picked up my car, there were traces of cigar/cigarette ash in the cup holder and middle console and a chocolate candy wrapper and candy stain on the side of driver seat. WTF?????

TL;DR: Bought a new 2020 Honda Civic. Signed contracts blindly. Now paying \~$9,500 extra in extended warranties and aftermarket packages. Did I fuck up?",finance
stocks,[Opinion post] Next corona-correction,"We all know that clearly stocks and the market are not tied to reality right now. My (serious) question is when you gang of merry investors think the market will again become coupled to the real world.

My point being, we can all agree that some, most, all, or more than these things will happen...but the real question is when, and how significant will it be when the liquidity finally runs out, and the reality hits the fan?

Long story short:

Daughter has had numerous medical visits, virtual and in office as well as a week long stay in a children's hospital since early June.

Starting to receive bills, matching them up with Insurance as I know I will hit our deductible and out of pocket max..

Been trying now for 3 days to get explanations of bills and payments not matching up with hospital/provider.

Even the billing rep gave incorrect info and realized it after our 2nd call.

For 2 days now and 3 calls/VMs the supervisor is supposed to call me to review and explain open items.

One of which is (2) pre-payments I was made to pay before one visit and turns out the visit was covered by our carrier, so I cant get an answer where my $$ is and why hasnt it been refunded to me.

I was finally given access to billing online, which for some reason isnt a default practice, and I have gone through all billings I can find and they seem to be all grouped together so very hard to distinguish to keep track individually.

What I find even stranger is that it seems like the hospital bills for the stay, but then all of the Drs during the stay bill out their time separately... So to mix it up more.

One Dr specifically on the 1st day of the visit stopped in to let us know she is off from that day on so wont really be getting involved.  Ok, then I see what she billed for that 2 min explanation.. Its really crazy.

Not sure who to go to if this supervisor never responds to me.

This hospital has been great in the past and may be understaffed or affected by covid (There werent many patients when we were there and (0) Covid related) but if I am late in paying them, Im sure they wont be patient with me as I have to be with them.",finance

personalfinance,"How to balance student loans, 401(k) contribution, and costs of first home?","My goal is to buy a house, retire at 60 if possible (35 now), and I have student loans. I'm renting now.  How much should I be allocating  towards my student loans, 401k, and home ownership costs?

**Assets:**

* 65k savings, 20k from family for a down payment, and 10k from family in a no-interest loan, for a total of 95k to put towards a house.
* 23k in a 401(k).

**Debts**

* 27k of student loans (20k at 5.4%, and 7k at 5.8%). I am 3.5 years into a 10 year graduated repayment plan. I pay $300 per month,  above the required minimum payment.

**Income/Spending**

* I take home $4,500 per month (after taxes and contributing 8% to a 401k). I spend $3900 per month, which includes $300 towards student loans, $1500 for rent + utilities, and $2100 for other expenses. I save  $700 per month.

**Emergency Fund**

* I want to keep 5 months of expenses (20k) in an emergency fund, which reduces my available cash for a downpayment + broker fees + other initial home costs to 75k.

**Potential Scenarios**

1. **Pay off loans, keep 401k the same, keep renting:** Pay off my student loans completely, reducing my savings to 38k, and work on rebuilding my savings. If I can save an extra $300 per month I will save  $12,00 per year, and it would take me 2.5 years to rebuild my savings to their current level, at which point I will buy a house. In the meantime I would continue to fund my 401(k) at 8% of my income.
2. **Pay off loans faster, save more for retirement, keep renting:** Increase my student loan payments from $300 to $800 per month), and also double my monthly 401k contribution from $500 to $1,000. If I can save $300 extra a month in other expenses I will break even. I'm not worried about not saving in this scenario because I have plenty of savings already.
3. **Buy house, keep student loans and 401k expenses the same:** 75k can go towards a downpayment + other intial home costs while keeping a 20k emergency fund, and I will keep my loan payments and 401k contribution the same. To calculate how much home I can afford, I will estimate my monthly homeownership costs (mortgage, utilities, insurance, repairs), and make sure I can afford this each month while saving at least $500 per month. I will keep my student loans and 401k expenses the same, and contribute more to these once I can afford it based off of future salary increases.

***What do you think of these options? Do you notice any holes in my thinking? Any advice? Thank you!***

**EDIT:** Update.

Thanks everyone for your advice! Here's a summary of what I heard.

**Budget:** I spend too much on discretionary expenses, and I need to cut back.

**Retirement:** Almost everyone said I need to save more for retirement. I can put more into retirement, especially if I cut my expenses. Also I could consider a Roth IRA in addition to my 401k.

**Student Loans**: One person said this should be my top priority, but others think saving for retirement is more important. I should consider consolidating my loans.

**Buying a House:** Mixed reviews on this too.Some said go for it, other's said I need to work on saving first, especially those who prioritize paying back the student loans.

**My plan:**

1. Set and stick to a budget.
2. Look into consolidating my student loans and do it if makes financial sense. Increase my student loan payment from $300 to $500.
3. Look into a Roth IRA, and either start contributing 5-7% to that, or increase my 401k contributions from 8% to 12-15%
4. Talk to a home mortage lender and see what I qualify for. This will give me more information about  home costs/interest rates.
5. Wait 3 months, and see how I do on my budget.
6. Once I have information about home costs/interest and my new monthly expenses (including paying more towards my loans and retirement, I can make an informed decision based on my goals of: paying off my loans faster, saving more for retirement, AND purchasing a house (if that's feasible)

I'm not sure if I am able to get my rate down since I have defaulted on my loans in the past and only in 2019 did I start really trying to tackle them and never have to owe these cock suckers another $1. That said, when getting the loan out of deferral (I believe its called) all of Q4 2019, By Jan 2020 is really when I started to pay down the note or so I thought, naively. Yes, I was paying down the accrued interest, I don't need a credit lesson. I'm just nieve..or stupid, fine line. However, I am fully aware that I put myself into this debacle and have no one to blame but myself. So my goal this next year is to really work on rebuilding my credit. So I have a few questions I would appreciate some clarity on.

1. Started in Jan 2020 @ $36k and am around $31k-30k in 6mo after aggressively trying to take advantage of this once in a lifetime gift of 0%. I'm anticipating to be at $30k or below by Aug 16% in 6mo. so I'm on the right track. I also have a separate savings fund that will be used to contribute a lump sum of a $2-$3k before October.
2. Would it be wise to consolidate and see if I can get a lower rate? Or after December can I just refinance it with Nelnet at a lower rate after December. (If that's possible) Has anyone has had success refinancing with their current servicer for a better rate? The other option would be to refinance into a private loan. My credit isn't great either so who knows how favorable rate I would get. For context, FICO: 615 (Started 543 in Oct 2019).
3. My anticipated target breakdown is as follows:

* Target Payoff: 5yrs
* Loan Balance: $30,000
* Interest Rate: 6.25%
* Mo. Payment: $500
* Additional One time annual Payment: $1,000

Howdy Folks - would greatly appreciate some feedback
Need to refi - been putting it off ( don't laugh at my current interest rate )

I am leaning more towards 30yr refi to maximize reduced monthly payments.
Once spending maybe 5yrs putting money towards credit cards and repairs,
I plan on putting extra towards the 30yr to pay it off quicker.

here are the bullet points &gt; 

Have paid 17yrs towards a 30yr loan. 
5.75% - fixed APR
Orig loan was for $175,000. 30yr Conventional + $80,000 down.
Current balance $115,000. 
Would also like to bundle in a Equity balance of $70,000. Variable rate.
By my calculations &gt; (house value) - (all debt) = $95,000 open equity

Main purpose is to have lower monthly payments. 
And to get rid of variable rate Equity loan.

No dependents or spouses.
No need to leave a nest egg ... but could use more retirement savings.

Lower rate savings used for:
paying down credit cards
house repairs
boosting 401k (employer does 100% match)

30yr = lower monthly payment, more interest over time of the loan.
15yr = higher payments, way less overall interest.

Banking,Ally Bank is the worst bank I've ever used.,"Hi all, I usually wouldn't take the time to write this and I feel like this has probably already been shared here before, but I just need to vent about how Ally is the worst bank I have ever used. 

I discovered Ally about 3 months ago and was immediately attracted to it because of the high interest rates on the savings accounts and CDs. I opened a savings account and the rate was 1.65. Over the next 2 months it steady dropped to 1.00% (which I know isn't their fault, just another reason to add to the list). My main bank is Chase and I also bank with Charles Schwab. Let me list in order all of the issues that I've had with ally alone.

1. I set up Zelle so I could quickly transfer money from Chase to Ally. Within 3 transfers, ally blocked my Zelle access for no reason. The app told me to call a number so I did. The girl on the phone was useless and gave me a different number to call. I think the number was for their loss prevention unit. I called the number and was on hold for 30ish minutes. This was on a Sunday- for the next week I called every single day and waited for over an hour and never got a human to answer the phone. I called 8am when the lines started ringing and called 15 mins before they closed at 8pm. No one ever answered the phone. I began to get frustrated so I called the normal customer service number and the girl told me there's nothing she could do, but she would put in a request and someone from loss prevention would contact me in 2-3 days. I'm still waiting for that call and that was a month ago.
2. I ordered debit cards for my checking account and it has my first, middle and last name. All of my legal documents have all 3 names for legal reasons. Out of nowhere, I receive an unsolicited new debit card in the mail from ally saying ""here's your new debit card"" so I immediately call and the person on the phone is clueless. They reorder me a new one and I told her it needs to have my middle name on it. Card comes and guess what, it doesn't have my middle name on it.
3. I tried setting up my card for apple pay and apple pay told me to contact my bank. I call ally, get passed around to 3 different people just for them to tell me that I'm probably typing in my address wrong and to double check my info. Dude, I have been doing this for the last 30 mins and have 100% typed my address in correctly. I told him that and he said he doesn't know why it's not working and to call apple. That's weird because apple told me to contact my bank. 
4. I requested an ACH transfer from my schwab checking account for $500 and it was supposed to pull from my ally savings account. I've never had a payment reverse in my entire life, yet this one did despite me having well over that amount. I called schwab and they told me the reversal came from ally. I called ally and they again were clueless. After a week of my funds being frozen, I had to go to an atm, withdraw $500, deposit it into my chase account and then reinitiate the transfer from there.
5. There is no physical bank if you need to withdraw large amounts of cash. I needed to withdraw a large amount of money the other day and the atm limited me to $200 per transaction. I was at the atm for 30 minutes pulling out money like an idiot. This happened after the reversal from my other account so I don't feel comfortable doing ach transfers with ally anymore because I don't want my funds tied up for a week. Also, something that attracted me to ally was zelle, and my account has been blocked for nearly 3 months with no help whatsoever. 

Call me crazy but I have never had this many issues with another bank EVER in my entire life. I think it's because it's online. Every single customer service rep I talked to was absolutely clueless and it's really not worth it for 1% interest. Thank you for listening to my rant.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off mortgage principal for a while, then stop?","My situation -

* Refinanced a $258,000 30-year loan in April 2020.
* Monthly payment of $1600 due (including escrow), but paying $2100, $500 extra towards the principle, effectively paying the same amount as before the refinance, but applying the savings to the principle.
* 3.5% interest
* Planning to FIRE in the next \~10 years

The question I have is surrounding the math of amortization.  Early in the loan, paying extra towards the principle has a HUGE effect on reducing the length of the loan term, but as time goes by, the same amount of extra money towards the principle has diminishing returns, and towards the end has a negligible effect on the remaining length.

My thought is that it is worth it to continue paying extra towards the mortgage principle in the beginning, even at a 3.5% interest rate, as it will save more money than the investment returns that I could get from average stock market returns in the same period.  At a certain point, though, when principle becomes a larger portion of the loan payment, this is no longer the case.

Where I'm lost is the actual math of this.  3.5% interest on a mortgage is incredibly low, but since the majority of that interest is paid early in the term of the mortgage, it seems that by paying extra towards the mortgage early, much of the interest/cost of the loan can be saved, resulting in the most net financial gain overall.

I'd love to know if my thinking is correct or flawed, and if correct, when the point would be that it would be better to switch to investing in taxable index funds/bonds instead (I currently max my Roth and 401(k)).

investing,The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases: From Supporting to Sustaining,"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/log200715

&gt;Today, I’d like to talk about the disruption we saw and the steps we took in response. I will focus on three broad questions. First, what is smooth market functioning and why does it matter? Second, how have our asset purchases supported smooth market functioning? And third, how will we structure purchases to sustain market functioning over coming months and remain vigilant against renewed deterioration? Let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

/

&gt;Liquidity comes in many forms. One form of liquidity is the availability of financing for existing or new positions. I think of this as funding liquidity. Another form of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be bought and sold, often called market liquidity. Although these concepts are distinct, they are related and reinforcing.6 When funding liquidity is abundant, market participants can finance the transactions that produce market liquidity. My comments today focus on how we have used asset purchases to support market liquidity, but I do want to note that the steps the Federal Reserve took at the same time to support funding markets almost certainly contributed to market liquidity. In fact, funding markets are now functioning quite well. As a result, as you can see in Figure 3, which is a close-up of my previous chart, our repo book has rolled off over recent months and is now down to zero, and usage of most other funding programs has also diminished.

&gt;Liquid markets allow participants to transact quickly and at low cost, so they can easily adjust their positions in response to their own changing circumstances or broader economic developments. In normal conditions, the markets for Treasury securities and MBS are highly liquid. Confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries persuades investors to accept lower yields on these securities,7 and because Treasury interest rates are a benchmark for many other rates, these lower yields ultimately reduce borrowing costs for families, businesses, and state and local governments. Similarly, the liquidity of agency MBS helps investors to transact quickly and efficiently in residential mortgage loans, which results in lower mortgage interest rates for households. Supporting the liquidity of these markets has been an important component of the Federal Reserve’s actions to bolster the flow of credit and the effective transmission of monetary policy during the pandemic.

&gt;Turning to efficient pricing, one can always debate whether any given asset price is right. However, we generally expect prices of instruments with identical or very similar cash flows to be closely connected, so opportunities for arbitrage are limited, and relative value spreads are small. In smoothly functioning markets, if prices of related instruments diverge, arbitrageurs sell the securities with high prices and buy those with low prices, profiting from the difference and pushing the prices back together. When arbitrage breaks down, the resulting mispricings make financial markets less useful for risk management and investment, which can ultimately restrict the flow of capital in the economy.

/

&gt;The extreme shock to the economy and financial markets as the pandemic spread in early March led to a swift and severe deterioration in the functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets. Pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy were shut down, combined with concerns about markets’ ability to keep functioning in a remote environment, resulted in a strong desire for cash. In addition, the extreme volatility and its effect on risk metrics and margins meant that some normally profitable trades were no longer viable.

&gt;Investors and asset managers responded by rebalancing their portfolios, deleveraging, and acquiring the most liquid short-dated assets. In this environment, we saw a historically large flow of investor sales of Treasuries, as shown in Figure 5, as well as MBS. There were also notable sales by foreign reserve managers, whose Treasury securities held in custody at the Fed, shown in Figure 6, fell sharply during March. The flow strained the capacity of dealers and other liquidity providers to intermediate on normal terms. The challenges were particularly notable in off-the-run Treasuries, a sector where some dealers at times were reportedly reluctant to make markets at all. As a result, market functioning indicators were quite poor, as illustrated in Figure 7. Bid-ask spreads for Treasuries, in the left panel, and for agency MBS, in the right panel, both showed extraordinary increases. Relative value measures also widened notably, with prices appearing to diverge from fundamentals in some cases, as demonstrated by the Treasury cash-futures basis in Figure 8.9

/

&gt;I’d emphasize in this regard that our assessment of market functioning is focused on indicators of market liquidity and efficient prices—not on the level of yields. It is certainly the case that the FOMC’s purchases have been absorbing duration and prepayment risk from the market. The total duration included in our Treasury purchases so far represents the equivalent of about $1 trillion in 10-year securities. Although term premiums do not appear to have come down significantly relative to just before the pandemic, our usual analysis indicates that our purchases have offset some upward pressure that could otherwise have occurred, for example as a result of the recent increases in Treasury debt issuance. I expect that the ongoing purchases will continue to absorb interest rate risk from the market, and that a wide range of factors other than our purchases will also continue to influence yields as our current purchases proceed.

/

&gt;Still, considering the crucial role of the Treasury and MBS markets in the financial system, and their growing size, it is important to ensure that these markets remain resilient to future shocks. What factors made these markets vulnerable to the abrupt deterioration in functioning that we saw in March? Could changes in regulations, data availability, or market infrastructure make market functioning more robust to future shocks? What role do funding markets play? These are challenging questions. They will require careful research and analysis, and they may not have simple answers. Still, the official and private sectors should be prepared to work together to assess them, and to do what it takes to ensure the continued strength and good functioning of these important markets.

personalfinance,Question about student loans,"Hello everyone!

I am in a bit of a bind, and I do not know what to do moving forward. Some background:

I am a 20 y/o college student who also works as a server. Outside of health insurance, I pay for all my own expenses— rent, phone bill, food, etc. I have taken an extended break from school for mental health reasons but need to go back this semester. 

I owe about $2000 to my college in order to register. I have applied for FAFSA and was only offered loans; no options for financial aid. 

I can pay for my school outright, but I am nervous to do so because of the uncertainty with the economy right now. My job relies almost solely on customers tipping and if another recession occurs, I don’t think many people are going to be out to eat. 

I have two options: I can pay for school out of my own pocket and put a significant dent in my savings or choose the student loans. Up to this point, I have not taken any loans out. I plan on going to law school, which I assume will be MUCH more expensive than getting my BA and I will definitely need to take loans out then. 

I don’t want to become a statistic for owing tens of thousands of dollars in student loans but I’m scared to pay out of my own pocket and hurt my savings in doing so. 

What are your suggestions? 

TIA!

Tldr; I can pay for school with my savings but am nervous to do so because it will take a significant portion out. I have been offered federal loans but I’m nervous to take them.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to make extra payments on a new car loan just to get above water on the loan?,"Hello there!

Current situation, after years of poor financial decisions and trading my car too frequently, I have a 2019 car worth roughly $16k, and still just under $20k on the loan.  For the sake of not being stuck into a bad situation if the car were to be totaled or any other scenario, I want to get my loan down to where there is some positive equity in the vehicle (is that the right term here?). The interest rate is 3.14%, current monthly payment is $382.96. 

I've been working the last few months on getting my personal finances into a healthier state, slowly building my savings up to have a 3-month emergency fund, and keeping my impulse spending in check. I moved to a smaller apartment with a roommate and cut my rent by $400/month. I'm not concerned with my retirement plans right now, I'm 28 and have $62k in my 401k. I've at least been wise enough to put in at least 10% since I started working at 19 years old haha.

So I suppose the basic question here is do I put more focus on getting my car loan cut down so that I'm not underwater, do I put more into my emergency fund, or is there something else I should be focused on?",finance
personalfinance,Help Evaluating Possible Refinance 3 Years into 30-Year Mortgage,"Hi all! We're feeling a little overwhelmed with being able to tell whether a refinance makes sense for us. The details that you need to know (let me know if I missed anything):

Home value: 170k

Original loan amount: 155k

Currently owe: 111k

Interest rate: 4.125, no PMI

30-year loan originated in Dec. 2017

Our primary goal is to get this house paid off as fast as possible so that my husband can retire sooner. Currently we pay $1226 per month, but $120 of that is extra that we wrap into the auto-pay. On top of that, we try to pay a minimum of $300 extra per month, though when we can, we put upwards of 1k extra on it. 

In doing some research, we could have something in this ballpark if we move to a 15-year 2.625% rate/3.046% APR refinance:

* **Guaranteed Lender Charges** **$2,630**
   * *Guaranteed Lender Fee* *$995*
   * *Guaranteed Points 1.466%* *$1,635*
* **3rd Party Services We Select** **$594**
   * *Guaranteed Appraisal Fee* *$478*
   * *Guaranteed Credit Report Fee* *$47*
   * *Guaranteed Flood Cert Fee* *$5*
   * *Guaranteed Tax Service Fee* *$64*
* **3rd Party Services You May Select** **$1,010**
   * *Title - Lender's Title Insurance* *$455*
   * *Title - Settlement Fee* *$555*
* **Recording Fees** **$60**
* **Total Lender &amp; 3rd** **Party Costs** **$4,294**

Things I don't understand:

1. I'm a bit confused about points. We can pay the cost for the points, but I don't know if it's a good idea.
2. Apparently it'll be a bit over 4k to refinance, and I don't know how doing this will impact our quick repayment.
3. My main concern is with resetting amortization. I don't know how to calculate whether that will slow us down or speed us up (by virtue of the lower rate).

Can someone help us figure this out? Are we better off just sticking to what we're doing, paying aggressively on a 4.125%? We pay biweekly but unfortunately because of the way they do biweekly setups, they simply hold the first payment, so it's not ""true"" biweekly and they won't change it. Aside from that, we do what we can!",finance

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin challenged my comprehension of money. and from that, governance too","Social Media hacking jokes aside for today, I thought to share a thought experiment I had on how bitcoin fundamentally challenged the way I view money forever. 

 I was always told throughout life and even in school that money distributed by the government, managed by the government, but used amount the populus. It wasn't until I was 17 in my senior year where I learned about the in-depth concepts of money with topics such as Federal Reserve Banking (How banks make money), taxes, debt,  and fiscal and monetary economy. What's funnier is that when I was 14 I heard about bitcoin, but I thought it was just an idea for some far off technology like Nuclear Fusion or Astro mining. So I'm happy to state I learned more about bitcoin before I learned about my own government monetary system. Unfortunately, It would not be for another 2 years before I learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain entirely and another few months before I can actually buy some. 

It was at the moment when I fully understood the concepts of bitcoin where I fell in love with it, the idea that NO government, company, or bank could just step in and take your money. No overdrafts, chargebacks, or no 3-5 days deposits. It is great. I get excited to the point I share all I can to people around me about the concept and yet they are confused like a child learning a new language because the concept of true financial responsibility and digital sovereignty can be complex to comprehend. Many of them refer to the same statements: ""Money should be protected and held by the bank so I trust that it will forever be there"". As I think of it more I start to think of ways how blockchain technology as a whole can be implemented into fintech (or even become the new fintech). Henry Ford once said that 

&gt;"" It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."" 

It is merely with the introduction of bitcoin and decentralized finance tools when this quote incubates into fruition. Cryptocurrency as a whole puts the individual in power with the same banking tools as the whole banking collective operates on. I agree that there are many people who are fed up with the banks, and their practices but at the same time those people are even more scared to assume their own financial control due to immense responsibilities the bitcoin introduces (private key, cognitive understanding of the industry and tech). Yes, banks are here to provide a service to the public ease and use, but therein lies the question of how much freedom do people really want when they realize that they are also baring even more responsibilities than they are used to. Great power comes with great responsibility. The more financial freedom (I'm not talking about in dollar amounts, but security and accessibility ) you have over your wealth the more responsibility is needed to maintain it. So then more so this brings furthermore changed my perception that I don't have to be so reliant on centralized parties with my money, but I can own my money on the blockchain and send it anywhere where in the world as I deem fit. 

So this brings to my thoughts of how would blockchain systems work in government and laws. The laws are barely adapted to handle the internet as is; now they are further behind to handle blockchain. With coronavirus going around this is a testament to show how we are becoming stronger digital society. I have not been out of my home in the past few days, and most of the older ways of doing things are becoming challenged with the introduction of new technologies. The only thing that defines our governments are the lands in which was founded, discovered, or concurred by winning factions and ideals that ultimately curated most of the cultures we see today. We can speak to anyone we can on the internet in a matter of seconds, make a full-time living, we can buy nearly anything and get it delivered on the same day or week, and be associated with communities that align with our interest all online. So when these apps have more data and international relations than the governments we reside, can governments be more than just ""land""?

Finally, this brings into question Facebook and Libra. Facebook is one of the largest public multi-national countries on this planet, and libra in eyes of many just a software update. However, Libra shined a light on so many things I've always wondered. With as powerful as Facebook is that probably knows more about you than your government, and has more international relationships with more countries than your government, if/whenever libra is released, this now puts a corporate entity in charge of your money. And As they say, libra existing on blockchains, really can't be stopped if ever it's released. Sure governments can be banned and sue Facebook all they want, but if there are people using it, the damage is done, they can't shut down Facebook without causing an economic collapse probably one worse than the great depression. Facebook is just too big to fail. Google, Amazon are other companies seeking to challenge governance by cities for their corporate entities and employees. They most likely won't be here in the USA too much regulation, but someone where like Africa or even [cities on water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EotHcLHsAXs) . 

All in all, as I leave, Everything I knew about finances such as mortgages, paychecks, loans, mediums of exchange, trade, and banking tools are all fundamentally challenged by the introduction of bitcoin. The power lies in those who own the system, and when no one owns the system, but everyone manages it, the real power becomes invested back into the people. With this knowledge, I know that I am truly more powerful than I thought I was, and you should feel empowered as well. Sure the infrastructure may take time before things become convenient enough for wide-scale adoption, but we are the founding fathers and mothers of the first generation in the true power of decentralized tech. We are the ones that decide on how the first implementation of this tech should be used, and that's all by experimentation. I agree that it will be a daunting task and scary for those who are not familiar with this. Like all things that exist it starts with experimentation.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Better to Pay Off Student Loans Faster or Save More?,"I'm 25 years old and make a little over $61,000 annually. I have just over $5,000 in savings (I know, not great).

I owe $24,621 in federal student loans, with an average interest rate of around 4.5% across 6 separate loans (too lazy to re-calculate, plus they've switched all my loan interest rates to 0% due to the pandemic forbearance). I've been paying $800 a month towards my loans in an effort to pay them off as quickly as possible (my required minimum payment for the 10-year standard repayment plan is \~$376 a month).

Lately, I've been reading that if interest rates are low enough, it might be better to keep more cash on hand or even to invest more, rather than to focus on paying student debt down faster. I've also never bought a car and am looking into getting a used one. I have good credit so I know I would be approved for a low-interest rate if I decide to get a loan. This could happen a lot faster if I save more of that student loan debt payment.

I got it down to $29,000 using balance transfer shenanigans to keep the interest rate at 0%.  However, recently some legal fees and other things hit and it's back up over $40k.

I was contacted by a company (Finance Solutions) initially about a consolidation loan but they couldn't approve me because my debt ratio was too high.  But they can apparently put me into one of these credit card modification programs.  Has anyone done this?  Is there any hidden downside I'm not seeing?

Here's some additional info:

Card 2: $3,241.59 (was planning to pay $586 this month then transfer the rest to Card 1 at 0%)

Reduced debt offer: $32,280.02  
New monthly payment: $672.50 (pay off in 4 years)  
Both cards will need to be closed.

I don't like the idea of losing both credit cards but that's not a deal breaker.  (I've had Card 1 since 1992, although the bank name has changed a dozen times since.)  I like the idea of the reduced debt amount and accelerated payoff.  I recently did some hard math and figured with the continued balance transfers I'd have to do as the offers come due it'll take me 8-9 years to pay off the full amount as it stands.  

My credit score is currently 770.  The rep said there'd be a small hit to that because of the restructuring, but the restructuring itself wouldn't show up on my credit report.  Honestly I'm not terribly concerned about my credit score at the moment since I have no plans to make any large purchases any time soon.

We also have a car payment ($299/mo, \~$5500 left) and braces for my kids ($275, not sure how much is left.)  My initial plan was to aggressively pay off the car to free up that $300 to put on the credit card each month.  No savings to speak of, but I try to keep a $1000 emergency fund on hand.

We make about $240k annually combined and own a home in the SF bay area currently worth about $1.2M (will be paid off by retirement, but not much sooner). 

We are currently not putting enough into retirement savings and we have no savings for our kids for college. Given that the kids have been out of childcare for 4 months now, we have saved $10,000 in those expenses (so far) and want to put some into an IRA but aren't sure how much to put. 

When I do online calculators it says we'll need at least $10,000 per month of income in retirement but even with inflation I don't understand where that number is coming from. Our house will presumably be paid off, the kids will be all the way through college and into adulthood and we will not be paying $2500 per month for childcare.

Is there a better way to gauge how much we'll need in retirement and therefore how much we should add to our savings now?

When the COVID relief check was announced we used the tool to input our direct deposit information. We didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend was going to file taxes this year because she has been working as a Home Health Aid.

personalfinance,"Mid-Year Check In: Retirement, FERS, and Roth IRA","Hey /r/personalfinance, I’m hoping for your help in navigating financial choices that have come about because I recently started a new, higher paying job in April and am looking to make sure that I’m being prudent about all of the things that accompany it, specifically since it pushes me over some thresholds. I'm single and I don't plan on getting married this year. 

January through March, I was working as a Federal employee with a salary of 110k. Along with that, I contributed 5% to my traditional TSP to receive a 5% match. In addition, I was contributing the mandatory post-tax 4.4% as part of the FERS-FRAE pension. I was using a health plan that used an HRA, not an HSA/FSA, so the money that was in that account disappeared when I left. 

In April, I started a new job in the private sector with a salary of 135k. I’m contributing 14% to my 401(k), my employer matches 8% of that. I also started a high deductible health plan with an HSA, I’ve been contributing $200 per paycheck. 

In January, I contributed $6,000 and fully funded my Roth IRA.

My 401(k), TSP, IRA, and HSA are all fully invested in whichever retirement target funds are available from their respective program administrator.  

Questions:

1. What happens if I exceed the $124k yearly earnings to qualify for the Roth IRA? Will I be able to “fix it” after December 31 and after I’ve had a chance to fully account for my 2020 earnings without penalty, or do I need to “fix it” now and potentially lose the tax-free benefits? 
2. What should I do with my FERS pension? There’s an option and a form to withdraw your contributions, as well as accrued interest, but neither my 401k administrator nor my Roth IRA administrator have much experience with doing it (or at least training the customer reps about it), and weren’t able to walk me through or verify that I can roll over the contributions to a Roth IRA and the accrued interest to a traditional (or cash out for a tax penalty). Has anyone done this before and does anyone have recommendations?
3. Starting in 2021, since I will definitely make more than the Roth threshold, what should I do differently with my IRA?
4. What happens if I overshoot the $3,550 HSA contribution limit? I should be just under since my employer didn’t kick in those benefits on the first paycheck or so, but what if I misjudged? Should I lower my final contribution just to make sure? What if I misjudge and go too low, is there a way to directly deposit money and “top off” an HSA?

personalfinance,What would cause an incorrect withholding number from paychecks over the course of the year?,"I've already done my taxes but still trying to figure this answer out.  Basically, my company uses ADP and I had instructed them to withhold federal and state taxes from my paycheck.  In 2018 I got a federal refund.  I thought it worked out and I simply had enough deductions that I ended up getting some cash back.  But in 2019 I ended up owing slightly more than I got back in 2018.

I guess I'm just trying to understand how it works.  Is ADP/my employer guessing the withholding amount from every paycheck?  Shouldn't it be automated because ADP is tracking my total income for the year so they know what the tax rate is for each paycheck based both on salary vs. commission and when I cross into new tax thresholds?",finance

No real issues other than Chase doesn't like me using my savings account like a savings account, meaning - I save money for things I want, then I move it to checking to spend because I can't literally do shit with my savings account other than put money in and take it out to another account - I can't pay a credit card, I can't quickpay, etc. Fine, it's for savings.. but what happens when I try to use my savings?

Chase tells me I am limited to 5 withdrawals from savings each month, then they charge me a $5 fee after that, send me semi-threatening emails and give me some legalese about money laundering or something and federal law. Is this normal? is Chase just bilking me?

For example, saved money for a home reno project, don't want to co-mingle funds with day-to-day checking, so I was moving money as I quickpay or debit card paid each trade for their work, but god forbid I use my money, Chase wants to charge me.

How is this legal? Why are they using money laundering law as a shield to charge me fees? Are other banks going to do this if I leave Chase? Functionally I enjoy the ease of banking but this is getting ridiculous.",finance

personalfinance,$12k in CC debt - not sure how to pay it back. 401k? 401k loan? Nothing?,"Hey r/personalfinance \-

I'll try to keep this concise as possible, but I think it's gonna end up lengthy.

**My information:** 

* I'm 28
* I make $80k a year for a 9 - 5, maybe another 400 - 1000 per month selling art as a side hobby. 
* I live in NYC paying $2000k a month (1,500 for apartment, 500 for an art studio).
* My monthly income after taxes is about $4200.  After groceries and living expenses, I probably have about $1200 to spend/save per month.
* I contribute my max to my 401k at my company, have just over $20,000k in there.

**My debt:**

I've had a few financial set backs this year.  On top of paying my $3000 a month in living expenses:

* I have really shitty teeth and genetic tartar build up that makes me have to get my teeth cleaned 4 times per year, on top of having 2 dental tooth implants that are failing because of said tartar build up.  This has cost me \~$5000 this year in out of pocket payments because uh apparently dental insurance doesn't cover implants nor implant maintenance.  Cool America.
* I busted my head pretty good skateboarding and had to pay about $1200 bucks for that
* If I'm honest with myself, I've spent at times when I just didn't need to or have the funds to.  I feel very stupid for this and realize it's a problem.
* Last 3 years I've gotten a $10k bonus from my company and been able to pay off CC debts but my company is down YoY quite due to COVID so I honestly don't think we're going to get anything this year, nor raises.
* **From all of this, my total CC debt is \~$12,000 with 22% APR.**

  
I really don't like having this much debt at this high of an interest rate, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what I should do.  I'm having a hard time chipping away at it after paying my living expenses.   
 Obviously, I probably should have no signed the lease on this expensive apartment and art studio, but nonetheless thats where I am.  I've done a lot of research and made a few calls and I've narrowed down my options to a few different routes:

1. Withdraw full $20k of 401k early, pay $8,000 in penalties in taxes, end up with 12 grand and pay everything off
2. Withdraw portion of 401k early (let's say $10,000), get $6k after penalties/taxes, pay half of debt now, work the rest down with regular payments
3. Take a ***loan*** out of my 401k. Voya has said I can take out a little over $10k at a 4.5% interest rate over 5 years.  Would be about $185 a month.  Said that if I leave my job for any reason that I will have to pay it back via automatic ACH payments from savings/debit.  Would consolidating debt at a much lower interest rate.
4. Take out some other type of personal loan at the lowest interest rate possible for the whole debt amount.
5. Just be super frugal for the next couple years, hope I get a raise or some other windfall and pay shit off.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything obvious I'm missing here?  I'm very tempted to take the 401k loan route, however longterm commitment scares me and 185 bucks a month for 5 years seems like a commitment, but then again, I'm paying myself back with interest.

So far I have submitted lots of documents (mortgage statements, bank account info, etc. ) but the LO said I need to finish submitting documents (fine), sign disclosures &amp; submit the application (fine), pay the application fee (not so fine), then wait 2-3 days for underwriting to get the final rate. 

I am waiting on a response from LO to see if I would get a refund on the application fee if I don't like the rate in 2-3 days but it seems a little crazy to properly shop lenders for a rate, you have to submit all your financial information, pay application fees, then wait 2-3 days to lock in a rate, with each lender.

personalfinance,Which of these loans should I pay off first?,"How should I tackle these loans?

How should I tackle these personal loans.

So currently I have 3 loans. 

10,500 at 17.6% interest with a little over 4 years left of payments at $287/month
25,000 at 17.1% interest with 3 years left of payments at $890/month
$6740 at 7% interest with a little over 2 years left of payments at $270/month


I have ~$6750 in cash currently. I’m trying to find out which one would be the best one to put the money towards. 

Option a)     I could completely pay off loan #3. Pros: I don’t have to worry about making payments toward that account anymore allowing me to put that $270 towards either one of the other loans. 
Cons: that’s the lowest interest account meaning I would pay more interest towards the other accounts. 

Option b) pay off the majority of loan #1. Doing this would cut out a huge chunk of the loan and I would probably be able to pay off the remaining amount by the end of the year.   I wouldn’t have the immediate relief of having one less account to worry about, but it would get rid of a lot of the higher interest debt. 

Option c)  put the money towards loan #2. Doing this would also cut away a lot of high interest debt, but wouldn’t get me anywhere close to finishing off any of the loans. This would lower my monthly payments and free up some cash for me in my monthly budget. But I don’t really think that’s the best option. 

There’s also the fourth option of just keeping the money in savings in case something happens. I currently only have ~$800 in savings so it would be nice to have that extra cushion but I don’t think that’s the smart thing to do currently

The only reason I'm really questioning my sanity here is because our expendable income is already pretty high, but I'm the type of person that wants my liabilities as low as possible and for my month to be as liquid as possible. Our current Emergency fund is approximately 8-10 months, with a baby on the way.

Current Situation: Wife and I make \~230k a year, combined. We purchased a house 1 year ago w/ a current balance of $425k at a 3.99% interest rate.

Currently, both of our credit scores are &gt;&gt;740 and we have an offer to refinance at 2.99% at a cost of \~$5,500. We can either roll the costs of the refinance into the mortgage or pay upfront.

My current thought process is that this is a decent deal. We are only 1 year into the mortgage (so everything is currently going towards interest, anyway) and we plan to live here for &gt;5-10 years.

By refinancing, we would be able to ""skip"" two mortgage payments, which I would just put as a lump sum towards my wife's student loans. I would love to be able to take the savings from refinancing (\~$300 per month) and put that money towards other debt that we have (70k in student loans, 15k in car note).

cardano,Let's Talk Monetary Policy,"Some of the most discussed topics in the cryptocurrency community are inflation, sound money, max supply, block rewards, transaction fees, the laws of math rather than the manipulation of people. These are all referencing the same thing, monetary policy. I have yet to see discussion on these are designed the way they are.

  
 Let’s start by defining a few terms. First this post will use “inflation” in the conventional sense. Meaning, the ability of a unit of currency to buy a basket of goods. Inflation = money supply X money velocity. Money supply will refer to the amount of a unit of currency in circulation.  
 What do we want to accomplish with monetary policy? Do we want to create an ecosystem that increases adoption? Do we want a return for stakers? Or do we want a return for all token holders even if they don’t stake? Do we want stable prices? We can decide this as a community with sound monetary policy.

  
 So let’s look at the mechanisms of monetary policy on a cryptocurrency. We have block rewards, (new units of ADA added to the system), transaction fees (cost of sending a transaction), and staking rewards (a function of the block reward and transaction fees).

   
Transaction fees are easy. This should be decided by a free market where transactions compete to be included in the next block. Total transaction fees is the true measure of a blockchain’s worth.  


Block rewards are the most talked about mechanism. Why do we want block rewards to be a certain amount. In my opinion, the block reward, or increase in money supply should promote stable prices. Yes, I’m saying a unit of ADA should decrease in value relative to a basket of goods by 1-2% each year. I won’t write a text book here, but this is a characteristic of a healthy economy. This can be achieved with the laws of math and without manipulation and corruption by humans. It’s not “stealing”. It’s just not rewarding people for doing nothing. If you don’t want to lose buying power, stake your coins, making investments, do something.

  
 Staking rewards is where this gets interesting. Why? Staking rewards are block reward plus transaction fees, but they don’t have to be.  The amount of the staking reward that is from transaction fees could be increased, to say 110% of transaction fees. Why might we do this? If transaction fees are increasing, demand for ADA is likely also increasing. By increasing the staking rewards (and money supply) more ADA will be in circulation to meet demand, keeping prices stable.  
 Or maybe the staking rewards earned from transaction fees should be less than the total fees, burning a portion of coins. Why? Inflations is money supply X velocity of money. As the velocity of money increases, so does inflation. Burning a portion of fees will prevent hyperinflation. 

  
 With all this said, why is there a max supply? How do we know the max supply will achieve what we want? Why are rigid rules like this so in favor? Do we even understand them? Have we thought about the consequences?  


In conclusion, I propose a dual mandate for monetary policy on Cardano. Stable prices and maximum nework usage. If we acheive this, the staking rewards will come.  
 

I obviously don't have all the answers so I hope this will spur some interesting discussions.",cryptocurrency

Forex,Macro Views: Repricing for Stocks and Other Risky Assets Is Around the Corner,"If you didn’t heed my warning last week, you’ll want to read today’s essay closely…

As I wrote then, it’s only a matter of time before a major bump in the road to recovery forces a reassessment and repricing of risky assets. 

Below, I’ll show you why that repricing is around the corner for stocks… along with the most worrying warning signs the bulls are missing.

## Heads I Win, Tails You Lose

I categorize stocks as risky assets. But judging from recent market behavior, they haven’t been behaving that way at all.

However, it’s not fair to assume that investors piling into the market are ill-informed or stupid. So let’s try to understand what their thought processes might be.

Plenty of thoughtful traders are trying to learn as much as possible about epidemiology. They are getting schooled on the fatality rates and hospitalization numbers. Both things could force governments to lock down again or otherwise sink the economic recovery.

Ultimately, though, their thoughts revolve around whether the case count translates into a higher trend in deaths. Mortality matters!

Even if I disagree with some of their assumptions, I can respect their professional approach and thoughtfulness.

Essentially, these people won’t change their modus operandi unless there are catastrophic developments. They’re happy to lean on the de facto “put option” issued by the Fed, and continue to discount a strong economic recovery.

But there are many retail traders who are less sophisticated in their approach. For them, the logic is simple…

If restaurants and retail shops open up, and spending picks up, then the economy will bounce back, company earnings will improve, and stocks will rally.

If things don’t open up, then the Treasury and the Fed will throw trillions more at our economic problems, so stocks will go up anyway.

Wow! Heads I win, tails you lose. They truly believe the market is rigged and there is only one way for stocks to go… UP!

From their perspective, we have no risk.

I suppose, no matter what, we should all just go and leverage up our assets as much as possible, and keep buying as many risky assets as possible.

It’s that kind of thinking that I find idiotic.

That aside, I believe the professional traders who are bullish are missing a few key points. Let me explain…

## Bulls Are Missing These Warning Signs

First, authorities don’t want the virus to spread. So they’ll almost certainly impose more and more restrictions.

As a result, the healthy rebound in consumer services since mid-April now appears likely to stall in July and August.

These restrictions may not come from the federal level. But if COVID-19 keeps spreading, we can be sure that the health and wellbeing of citizens will take priority over economic output at the state and local level.

If the death rate starts to climb again, measures will become far more draconian. The ongoing recovery in manufacturing and construction will be less affected, but that is not the main driver in our economy.

In states where COVID-19 infections are rising, we’ve already seen sharp declines in consumer and workplace activity over the past few weeks.

Those states are California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. Together, they make up about 30% of all U.S. economic output.

At a minimum, we need to anticipate at least a flattening of activity in many other states.

With that, the rebound will stall. And the Fed’s many warnings about enormous uncertainty clouding the picture of the economic recovery will become realized.

Meanwhile, the stock market has been pushing higher since March. That recovery is not unprecedented, but it is amazing. In fact, we need to go back to the 1930s to find comparable rallies.

Back then, the extremely sharp rallies preceded still sharper sell-offs. It took 26 years for the bear market – which started with the Crash of 1929 – to fully recover to new highs!

Do I expect a comparably bleak future? It’s unlikely, but not impossible.

It would require some very bad shocks… coupled with many more years of foolish, desperate policies from our government and central bankers. So I put it as a low probability.

That said, I do expect certain sectors to suffer for years.",finance

Forex,"I've been thinking a lot about my own trading and have come to some harsh conclusions. It's time we discuss some hard truths about technical analysis, mechanical trading, and psychology I think many of us don't want to accept.","I've had a rough week and it sounds like I'm not the only one. This week has wiped out my gains since July 1st, and I'm finding myself ever-so-slightly in the hole this month so far. I've made money every other month I've traded, so I'm not writing myself off as a failure, but nevertheless, I've done some digging to try and figure out what I'm struggling with. I hope the following observations about my own trading resonate with some of you and can help us all become better traders.

First off: **Fundamental/technical analysis**. Since I started with forex a few years ago, I've put 100% of my time and effort into studying technicals. I think many traders, myself included, are drawn to technical analysis because we fall into the trap of thinking ""If I just figure out what combination of indicators/chart patterns/algorithms work for *me*, trading will be smooth sailing."" Being able to take a formulaic approach is incredibly appealing because it's much easier to simply check off a list of criteria than it is to interpret more nuanced information. For me, I found success drawing supply and demand zones, using Bollinger Bands to visualize market structure, and confirming reversal patterns with stochastics to trade from one zone to the next. I even studied the math behind those indicators to make sure I fully understood how they worked so I could identify their limitations, and for the most part, the strategy made money. Nevertheless, if I had a dollar for every time I take what I think is a perfect setup, then the market takes me on a wacky-ass ride of unexpected ""crazy bullshit"" that stops me out, I wouldn't be trading for a living. After some introspection, my conclusion is that those moments are not ""crazy bullshit"", but rather are the results of factors that fall outside of the (actually very narrow) scope of technical analysis. This has been hard to accept, as I previously learned technical analysis was perfectly viable as a sole perspective. I was taught that the market can be predicted based on analyzing past behavior. It seems obvious now, but when I think about it, no combination of chart patterns or indicators can predict next week's unemployment figures, interest rates, or what announcements (or blunders) world leaders are going to make on the global stage. Technicals work, but they only work when the market is reacting to fundamental factors, and as soon as a new fundamental change comes along, every bit of technical analysis used until that point becomes obsolete. What I'm trying to say is, at the very least, I need to be able to understand when, why, and how the game is going to change if my technicals are going to serve me. As such, I need to stop shirking fundamental analysis. It's time I start paying attention to that economic calendar and put in the effort to learn what each event means and how to interpret the results to figure out how the market will react. It's simply not as easy as looking at the technicals. It should be obvious that there's no magic formula to trading, but many of us try hard to avoid coming to terms with the fact that there's a lot more to ""analysis"" than just price action, risk management, and indicators.

The problem is we as traders *want* trading to be easy. It's a career that society glorifies, and even if we tell ourselves we know it's not a get-rich-quick scheme, we still want to ""figure it out"" so we can spend a few hours a week scribbling on our charts and making simple black and white decisions while we kick back and ""live comfortably"". And so we try to trick ourselves into thinking it *is* easy by endlessly parroting mantras like ""Risk management is all that matters"" and ""Trading is 100% psychology"" and ""All you need to do is find the strategy that works for you and stick to it."" The first two are certainly pieces of the puzzle, but there's so much more to the big picture. 

The last mantra isn't even remotely true, and brings me to my second point, which thankfully is something I figured out early in my career, but it's too related to the previous topic to not mention: **Mechanical strategies**. The sentiment that you need to clearly define a precise, detailed strategy and always stick to it is another lie to make trading seem simpler than it really is. Even when I was just starting to demo trade, I was finding trades that would tick all the boxes outlined by my strategy, but my gut would hesitate. Long after I identified that problem, I also began to notice that I'd be forcing myself to hold onto trades, even if they were not moving as fast or far as I initially thought they would. Once I decided to leave room for my own instinct and discretion, I became much more successful. It's important to understand **your strategy is a set of rules you yourself made up.** If your strategy does not line up with your own professional opinion of the situation based on your personal experiences and observations, you need to find out why. Yes, you absolutely should draw on your past experiences and be consistent in *how* you examine the market, how much you risk, and what tools you use, but *give yourself enough credit to form your own opinions.* The market is not consistent. Do not expect to succeed by applying one cookie-cutter set of rules to different currencies, at different times, during different events. Long-term success in any other line of work is dependent on critical thinking and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing world, and forex is no different. It's not simple, it's not easy, and you *will* have to make difficult decisions.

personalfinance,Should I paused contributions to my 401(k) for student loan payments?,"Apologizes if this is a dumb question. Just had a baby so I'm having a hard time focusing and consuming information. 

Is it more beneficial for me to pause my contributions while paying off my student loan or will I have a greater return in the long run by continuing to contribute?

I have been contributing to my 401(k). Employer matches 75% of the first 6% I contribute per paycheck. My contribute per pay check is currently $200.43 per paycheck.

I have a student loan totaling $46,959.15 at 5.25%. I'm able to put $1,300 a month towards it so it'll take about 40 months to pay off, usually more but $1,300 is a guaranteed amount. The minimum payment is $280, if that matters, but I want it gone ASAP. 

I've read that if the interest rate of the debt is lower than the return on the investment to also invest...is it safe to assume 7% on return? Vanguard is saying 9.66% since inception?

And if I should continue my contributions should I increase it? I'm not sure if I'm matching 100%. I don't want to leave any free money on the table.

Just FYI: My student loan is currently at 0% interest thanks to the national forbearance so I'm throwing *everything* at it so I was thinking about pausing my 401(k) contributions until the interest rates starts again October 1st giving me about an additional $1,000 total, but now I'm thinking long term too.

personalfinance,"42k in student loans, how fast should I pay them off.","New college grad here (22), working full time and making approximately 4500 a month after taxes and giving 10% of my income to 401k. (Around 80k a year before taxes)

I have 42k in debt (it’s a lot but not terrible compared to my total college cost of 260k/the rest paid in cash).

Interest between two loans leaves an average of around 6.5% for the student loans.

How should I go about this?

Also, I live at home and I have no rent, WiFi, phone costs etc. most dinners are eaten at home as well.

One thing however, is that I want to give my parents 500 a month (it’s the least I can do), and perhaps increase it once I start to pay off more of my student loans. 

Would it be smart to pay 1500 a month for student loans and pay it off completely in 3 years? 

Other expenses I have would be gas (400 a month surprisingly), insurance costs (120 ish per month), and as a result left with 1500. 500 would be for personal spending, going out to eat, coffee, miscellaneous, etc. And the other 1000 towards savings/cds/maybe like 300 in stocks idk.

I was also planning to get a Tesla with a 20k loan in the future (I have cash saved up) in around 1-2 years. My yearly cost of owning my current car is around 6000 a year. The benefits of ev would surprisingly help me cut down on costs significantly in 3 years. However, this is low priority so can be ignored tbh.

Also, I’m planning on staying home for around 3-5 years.


All in all, do you guys think that I would benefit a lot by paying off my student loans extremely fast while cutting down on savings/ emergency money? Or do you think my savings plan is solid? Just looking for some advice to help a young person like me to not screw up his financial life.

EDIT: thank you for all the responses! I can’t readily respond because I’m at work, but all advice is seriously welcome. As some people have said, I don’t think I can throw away the 401k, at least not all of it. Especially because of company matching 100% of the first 3 percent and 50% of the next 2 percent (essentially 4% full matching). It’s free money at that point, but other than that yes I will definitely try to prioritize student loans. I doubt safe investments’ growth can offset a 6.5% interest rate. Also, my students loans don’t kick in for 6 months so that’s to consider. I can create a 10,000 dollar emergency fund in 3 months if I need to as well.




2nd EDIT: for those talking about the Tesla, these are my thoughts and numbers.

I own a 2012 Range Rover evoque coupe (parents handed it down). Which means expensive gas (mid grade to premium fuel), expensive oil changes and general maintenance, and extremely expensive repairs— blown clutch, that sort of thing. The door broke a couple years ago (not under my driving or ownership) and that cost 2000 out of pocket to repair along with a 2 month wait period to get parts shipped from England. I drive close to 20,000 miles a year. The car currently has 52,000 miles on it. Now that it’s under my ownership, I feel a bit uneasy about the fact that a rover will have 80k miles on it in 2 years... luxury cars aside from Lexus tends to go bad in terms of maintenance when it reaches the higher mileages.

I realize the Tesla is not a ‘cheap’ car, but I thought it wouldn’t be a dumb decision to get one later in the road (after loan payments), especially considering that maintenance costs are almost 0 and warranty covers everything for 100k miles (not to mention the electricity prices of 500 a year vs 4000-4500 for gas on my current car). Yes I can just buy a cheap corolla, and that would do fine, but I love cars so it’s just something that I wanted eventually! I understand it’s not for everyone, just like I won’t spend more than 80 on a pair of shoes. I would rather just drive the same car for a year or two and get the car I really want later down the road than getting a cheap beater that I’ll always be wanting to replace.

But like I said, low priority. It’s not a need— if I can afford it in a year or two, and makes financial sense, then I would like to have it!

Edit 3: I’m paying approximately 2800 a month towards student loans which means close to 34,000 in a year. I think I’ll be keeping the 10% because it doesn’t hurt me too much especially because it’s before taxes— I want to start pumping up my 401k early and not play catch up in the future! And Tesla is having a major battery update conference in September regardless so seems like I’ll buy a Tesla after fully paying off my loans in around 15 months! :)",finance

personalfinance,Do you invest savings in the stock market or saving accounts?,"Hi all!

I've been trying to research how to make my saving grow / compound over time and I'm feeling confused and frankly a bit demotivated by the results. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on the best way to manage my savings. 

I've been looking at savings accounts:

 [https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts/](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts/) 

I understand that I will only really get half of the advertised interest rate due to the max ""cash in"" per month allowed. So on the highest interest account available (2.75%) I'll only be making (1.37%). 

UK inflation went up by 1.79% in 2019. So even with the highest paying interest accounts by that logic I'll be loosing money. 

When reading articles on saving money, a lot of people suggest investing it in Stock Index funds. I'm not experienced on the stock market at all. I'm guessing there will be a huge collapse / correction coming soon due to the current corvid situation. Its seems risky, even long term. 

My questions are:

How am i supposed to make my savings work? Seems that I'll be loosing money either way. 

What % of my savings should be split between accessible, non accessible saving account and stocks?

Is there other options I'm missing or should be looking into?

I recently graduated college and I'm in a great field with a great career. I'm paid a salary from my main job and a retainer from my side job (I work from home for both jobs). In all I make roughly $90,000 per year. I have no student loans and a car payment of $400 a month. My credit score is 790 and I already qualified for a 2.99% interest rate on a $320,000 new construction town home. Where I live, renting a nice place would cost anywhere from $1,300-$1,600.

cybersecurity,Best practice for storing encryption keys?,"If this is considered an unallowed ""fundamental security question"" then please notify me and suggest other discussion venues.

We use SharePoint to manage project documents. We now have documents that are federal CUI and so must be encrypted. But we have no procedure set up for how to store those keys. Obviously we cannot just keep the keys in the folder with the encrypted files.

I have come up with a few ideas but I am wondering what industry best practices are for this.  


Two general categories are  
1. Store keys somewhere that requires a different set of credentials that those used to access SharePoint (but where?)  
2. Store keys somewhere on SharePoint with more restricted access using built-in SharePoint permission settings

Who should be allowed to access the keys? Should access be only by online credentials and access control, or should there be a human gatekeeper? I would also expect the keys be separated based on need-to-know, which is generally by project.

(Our SharePoint system is hosted by Microsoft. Microsoft encrypts everything but it's the type of encryption at the data center level and is transparent to users. It protects against someone hacking into the host's SharePoint servers and trying to read the database, but it doesn't protect against someone's credentials being compromised.)",technology

personalfinance,"Parents offered to buy out my mortgage, I'd pay them at a much lower interest rates. Should I accept?","I own a house worth about 80,000. The mortgage is currently *only* in my mom's name because I didn't have enough credit history to get a mortgage when I bought the house, but I paid for the down payment in cash and have been paying the mortgage using only my own money. There is 55,000 left on it and the interest rate is 4.875%. 

I've been considering refinancing it so it would be in my name, but recently my mom called me and told me that she was open to using an IRS-approved family loan to buy out the mortgage so I'd pay her directly at 1.5% interest. I'd end up saving around $120 a month, so probably 7-8k before I move and sell this house in 5 years. 

My parents both earn well over 6 figures and have saved heavily for retirement, so 55k isn't very much money for them, and I am on very good terms with them so I'm not worried about familial struggles. Also, the current mortgage is already in my mom’s name, this deal would just mean the loan is also money coming from my parents. I’m also not concerned about sibling drama, since my parents spent upwards of 50k more on my siblings than me for our college. My parents would also be willing to do this same mortgage deal for my siblings so I don’t think it’s unfair, and I also don’t think either of my siblings would care. 

My mom said that the 1.5% interest is a better return than their money market accounts because of the low interest rates atm, so they'd actually be making a slight profit on this loan in the near term. I also have enough in investments to buy my mortgage outright, if I really had to. 

My main concerns are the following: 

1)Credit score. I have a 725 credit score with 1 older credit card and one credit card from this year that I pay off diligently. A major benefit of refinancing in my mind was the ability to improve my credit score, how much would getting an actually refinance be worth for my credit score?

2)Ease of sale. For work, I'm almost guaranteed to move in 5 years. Will this arrangement make it harder to sell. 

3) Home insurance and property taxes. Right now the mortgaging servicing company deals with all that. What implications to home insurance and property taxes would I have if I got this arrangement. 

4)Independence. I'm not sure if I like it that my mom would be my personal bank. 

5)Inheritance. Heaven forbid, but if something happened to my mom, what would happen to my mortgage? Would me and my siblings all have to divvy it up and I’d be paying them?

6)Taxes? What tax implications would this have for me and my parents?

7) Is there anything I’m not thinking of? This is off the beaten path and I’m not sure if there is something I’m overlooking.

personalfinance,30 to 15 refinance or invest?,"With interest rates down I called my mortgage company to explore refinance options.

Our combined before tax income is about 145k

We don't have any other debt besides the mortgage. 

This would of course save us a ton of money on interest and build equity faster. We think we'll be here for another 5-7 years 

We have 6 months savings and are contributing 15% towards 401k and have recently opened roths.

I'm wondering if starting an index fund (was leaning towards VTSAX) would be better use of the extra $310 instead of the refinance. I understand there's a min. $3k on VTSAX. 

It would seem the safer bet would be to refinance since the savings on that is guaranteed while the return on the investment is not.

personalfinance,Purchasing a House: Have I Made a Mistake?,"Hi Reddit,

I'm currently in the process of buying a home and I think I've made a huge mistake and am seeking some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation:

I'm 26 and currently work as an an application developer for a large telecommunications company making $60k/year with no debts (self-taught, no college. I own my car.) I have $30k saved up in the bank and am renting a small 1450sqft home for $1350/mo (the cheaper end of rent around here).

My mom and my younger brother and sister (both 20) now live with me after dad passed away last summer (leaving us no life insurance or any kind of money to continue with). My brother is planning to go off to school this year, my sister works a part time job at $15/hr, and my mom works a full-time retail job making about $12/hr. They've all been paying utilities ($300/mo) while living here in addition to paying off two cars and insurances.

My lease on this place is up at the end of August, and have been planning to buy my first home. I was aiming to have more space for everyone as we're kind've cramped right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now (what I think is) my massive screw up:

The bank pre-approved me for up to $320k and I started shopping in the $250k range at the beginning of this month. Houses in my area are going extremely fast and are generally being sold for more than list price. As I was viewing homes, multiple ended up with contracts on them by the time we arrived at the next one.

I finally found a house that was half way decent, the perfect size, and not a 1hr drive to everyone's jobs. It was $284,700 for 2100sqft built in 2013 with an offer on it for less. The seller set an ultimatum for me to make decision on an offer for list price by 8 PM that same day. I jumped on it and made that offer.

Since then, I've gone through with the lender and got a loan ready for a 2.99% interest rate, I've set up insurance at $1003/yr, and have had all of the inspections done. Still pending appraisal.

My total final closing costs (including the 8.5k down payment) is around $15k and the monthly cost I'll be paying ends up at about $1750/mo. After calculating all of my monthly expenses (car insurance, phone, gasoline), I'll have at least $1200 left over for rainy day savings or spending. This is with my family paying utilities. I already don't do anything fancy such as vacations, eating out often, or buying premium items. I consider myself pretty frugal already. The only possible major incoming expense that I can think of is the potential for my 2003 car (in pretty good shape if I say so myself) to die.

I was banking on my promotion boosting me to around $75k/yr as a ""Big Data Solutions Engineer."" But that seems to be up in the air right now as the virus has put a pause on all hiring and promotions.

&amp;#x200B;

Have I made a total mistake? Do I even have a path out of this? Everyone I know around me is telling me that I'll be fine and shouldn't worry because I have that $1200 left monthly, my family's support, and no debts/kids/etc. I'm just a bit unsettled by all of these changes and commitments now that I've been reading about how much I should really be spending on housing at my current salary.

The reason I ask is because I have about 150K in cash I've been saving for the past 3 years to put as a down payment on a house . I plan to hopefully buy in a year or two. Seeing how much the markets may be up by then it seems like I'm missing out , especially as home prices have been and will be skyrocketing .

Should I just keep my money in a savings account for another two years for a home ?

cardano,"“Cardano &amp; Coffee” — a new 1-hr Livestream show for Youtube/Twitch/Twitter/Facebook Live will start next week (and NO, we don’t want any cFund monies...","We have been toying with the idea, for several weeks now, of launching a show that is specific to Cardano, IOHK, Staking, The greater markets—both financial and cryptocurrency based— and a variety of macro economic fundamentals that most people seem to neglect. We will cover derivatives, options, stimulus packages, fed intervention, money printing, true inflation, deflation, stagflation… We have a really smart community of about 3000 pro-Cardano subs...

When I originally floated the idea of doing the show, it was very clear that the Cardano Community was NOT interested in another ‘stupid YouTube show’— which is actually quite silly when you do the math, if you tease it out, it makes more than a lot of sense to have additional platforms that offer content based on Cardano that could increase adoption, use, and utility.

So, I welcome anyone to come and support us, or not... but it is happening. And the kind of commentary and content we provide is simply NOT happening on the existing streams and shows. 

We will also be following the development of a Stake Pool, in a segment featured on our normal show as well as the new spinoff. 

So, our show “Crypto &amp; Coffee Live” will be launching “Cardano &amp; Coffee Live” (1-2 episodes a week, starting next week.

Somebody, please help me get out of this mess :(","Hello first off, I want to say thank you guys for helping people like me who are struggling. I really appreciate it! I am really having trouble trying get this debt paid off. I am looking for someone who can help me come up with a solid plan to get all this debt paid down.

# Background:

I am going to be very honest with you guys about my situation, my background, and my finances. I haven't made the best choices with my money and credit but I have gotten alot better. When I started building credit I was in a really bad place in my life. I was living in bad household conditions and was using drugs regularly to numb myself from what I had to deal with. I am clean now! I grew up with a family of 10 and my mother passed away when I was very young and my sister passed away a few years ago. My dad had to raise 10 of us as a single dad with bad credit &amp; not the best income. We really struggled growing up. When I was 18 years old I hadn't been to the dentist since I was like 10 years old. My teeth were really bad and the only way I could afford the dental bills was with credit so I racked up ALOT of debt getting my health figured out. My first two cars went to shit in a matter of weeks. I lost alot of money on that. I also made some bad investments. I had a gambling &amp; drug problem for awhile but I am clean now and don't gamble nor do I have any desire to. Another bad habit is impulse buying. I sometimes buy unnecessary crap off Amazon and regret it later. I really want to get out of this miss. I will commit to a solid plan.

I am going to do my very best to give you as much info I can so you can see the full financial picture. I am 26 years old and living with my two brothers at the moment and splitting the bills three ways. We share an apartment and plan on buying a house soon.

I have been building credit for about 8 years now. I have a total of of 14 credit cards which I know is very excessive but I kept applying for new ones to get the 0% Promos so I could keep moving my debt around. My total credit limit is over $100k.

# Current Employment Situation &amp; Goals

I only work one job 40 hours a week. Sometimes I get overtime but not so much anymore. I have been looking into real estate investing for a few years as a way to make passive income and have multiple sources of income but I feel I need to get my debt paid off first. I also am considering applying for a management position at my work which pays over 100k a year. Only thing stopping me is I didn't finish high school due to family issues and not sure if they would ask for my diploma if I did apply. I told them I did graduate when I applied 5 years ago. I have been with this company for almost 6 years. Should I risk applying for management position? They want me to apply and I am more then qualified to do the job as I have a ton of experience there and am in a leadership role currently. Should I try to get my hs diploma online through pennfoster or just get my GED? Please advice me as I don't know what to do.

Update

After doing a bunch of calculation I have decided to go with a 30-year loan with 2.5% and 1.75 + 2400 origination cost. I think this loan gives me flexibility of a low EMI and if I want to pay off sooner I can pay monthly same amount as 15 year loan and still pay off loan in nearly 15 years.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance rate thoughts,"So with the historic low refinance rates I figured I'd get out of my terrible FHA loan (4.5% + $90/mo MIP)

I've shopped a little bit, but honestly I feel like I got a good offer the first go around and if I can avoid doing a ton of legwork I'd rather go for it, but I figured I'd get community opinion first.

The offer is 3% for a 30 year fixed.  $2600-3100 closing costs depending on if I get an appraisal waiver or not, which I can either pay up front or roll into the loan, which seems normal. It would be through a local credit union (Arizona Federal). I already have a HELOC through AZFed and they said since its through them they'd just buy out the loan from my current lender and move into first position and then leave my HELOC alone in 2nd position, which for me is ideal since I like having the heloc open as a safety net and for home remodeling costs etc....

To me all the numbers seem really good, I dont know if it's really worth searching further since I cant imagine I'd find anyone willing to go lower. I've already tried to contact my current lender (USBank) but they say they're so busy with refinances itd be a while before I even heard from them (been about a week since my first attempt with them) and I'd rather not miss the boat on these excellent rates.

So what do you all think? Keep searching? Wait it out a bit for my current lender to get in touch? Go for it?

If I do I'll probably end up moving all my finances to the credit union (or whatever institution I refi with) as this just makes sense and I'm so over banking with WF. (17 mostly mediocre years)


Some other details:

I'm currently at 25 years left on the loan, I dont mind taking on the additional 5 years as I'll be able to pay that chunk off in no time with the new rate if I maintain my current payment. I intend to stay in the home for a minimum 5 more years, no actual end in sight though.

personalfinance,Refinance after refinancing two months ago?,"Is it worth it to refinance a mortgage after refinancing two months ago? 

I was previously at a 30 year 4.25% in September 2018. 
Refinanced down to 30 year, 3% with roughly $3.6k closing costs back in May (first payment was July 1). 

Came across a lender who is offering 2.75% with no closing costs. I haven’t actually applied for the refi so no credit pull was done, and the interest may be different than what’s being advertised. 

This seems like a no brainer because:
1) no closing costs
2) the extra month or two in loan extension term isn’t really a big deal if I’ll be able to make additional principal payments down the line
3) current loan has no pre-pay penalties (not sure about the potential refi)

I might be thinking too much into it, but is it worth it to apply for this new refi?

EDIT: I looked into the respective lender and came across the details:

No Closing Costs

personalfinance,"Receiving a family loan of $23,000: best way to do so with the lowest tax ramifications","My father deceased last month from cancer, and my mother just received insurance money. One of the things she wants to do is use a portion of it to pay off my debts, and I then just pay her back slowly over the next 4-5 years. It is apparently something my father recommended to her.

After looking around about the tax/legal ramifications and concerns, it seems that any amount over $15,000 (for 2020 at least), simply given or loaned interest free, by one individual may be seen as a gift. Which is then subject to gift tax and the like. She most definitely  will not encounter the lifetime maximum. 

My questions:

1. Would it be best to set up a family loan at the lowest possible applicable federal rate? If so, how would the interest be paid? Monthly? Annually? And, while I am in danger of sounding stupid, I am confused with the calculations. If we went this route it would be a 4 year mid-rate term. I am very confused on how much interest would be paid monthly, or if it could just be paid at the end of the year.
2. I have also considered just having her give me 15,000 this year, I pay a reduced amount back for now, and then have the remainder given next year. Would this be best, meaning, avoiding all fees and taxes completely?
3. Furthermore, my father passed in 2020. Although the interest free loan is stemming from his insurance pay out, would he still count as a qualifying spouse for 2020? If the interest free loan (gift I guess) was given in the year of his death, but at a date after he passed? If he would qualify, there would be a $30,000 yearly cap.
4. If we just said screw it and accepted the possible gift tax, am I correct in that she would just be subject to the totals beyond the $15,000? In this case, gift tax on $23,000-$15,000 = gift tax on $8,000. What would be the possible totals for this? I looked up gift tax, but I didn't dedicate as much time on that due to my escalating frustration.

My mother is very resistant to going to a lawyer about this, and it took a lot of effort to even get her to go to a lawyer to create her will. She thinks she can just log into my credit accounts, pay them, and that would go around the restrictions. Very frustrating. She also thinks she can just  send me the money and no one would know, but I've been explaining to her that we have no control over what the IRS may eventually find out.

Dealing with this is terrible timing as we are still reeling from our loss, but we also want to move forward soon while I am still in town.

Just looking for some advice.

I'm a software development manager working in NYC, I'll be starting an EMBA program at Duke in August that runs until May 2022, I expect to be accruing 130k in federal student loans by the end of the program. I have accrued approximately 16k in student loans of that 130k for the first semester, and I have already started paying $500/month against the principle since they dont start accruing interest for another 120 days (according to the documentation that the servicer sent me)

&amp;#x200B;

My Annual income is 145k, In contract bonus of 10-20 percent (Though courtesy of corona I am not expecting anything next year), and RSUs.

My current savings is about 30k.

My Monthly take home pay is 6400k/month AFTER tax from my job + \~3k per month PRETAX from a consulting gig I do on the weekends. Due to coronavirus my job monthly take home pay has been reduced to 6000k/month after tax due to a 4 day work week.

I have $0 outstanding credit card debt or previous student loan debt.

My monthly obligations are:

2600 for rent (welcome to NYC....)

$300 for an exercise bike I got due to coronavirus, paid off by jan

$50 for cell phone

$75 to Con ed

$25 to RCN (Internet)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this, considering in NY buying a home is usually cheaper than renting, and that my financial situation at this time is relatively stable, would it be smart to plan to purchase a home next August? I was saving up on top of the 30k for a down payment ultimately to make that home purchase given what I expect to be a big hit to the housing market in the fall/winter timeframe which finally makes buying a house affordable.

personalfinance,401k to buy down my home,"Ok so I’m looking for some advice. I have a 20 year mortgage on my home, I have about 16 year’s left on the loan and my interest rate 3.25%. My work just sent out a 401k/Covid 19 plan navigation Q&amp;A. Apparently due to the CARES act you can withdraw up to $100,000 from your 401k without the 59 1/2 year old early withdrawal penalty. I would still be responsible for the tax implications but the IRS is allowing you to spread it out of the next 3 year. 
    So hear is my plan: I’m thinking of withdrawal $80,000 out of my 401k and using $75,000 to buy down my principal. My current mortgage balance is a bit under $112,000, bringing it down to around $37,000. I would then refinance the mortgage to either 10 or 15 year mortgage bringing my payment considerably lower. The extra $5000 would be used for the taxes on the withdrawal. I would then max out my 401k contribution from the 8% it’s been at for 20 years to the most I’m allowed to. My current 401k balance is $270,000. I am 43 and don’t plan to retire for at least 20 years or more and in addition will have a pension on top of the 401k when I do retire. So is this a good plan? Does anyone know what the tax implications will be? And am I forgetting anything that could come back to bite me? All advice and questions welcome! Thanks in advance.

Edit 1 Definitely glad I posted this. It’s not the first bad idea I’ve had. Thank you for helping me see that. I will look into possibly lower my interest rate with a 15 year loan and trying to buy it down faster with extra payments.",finance

Interest came back 15.24, which sucks. That can be lowered by up to 1% by participating in various parts of their buy down program. There are six options at. 25% each, using four gets you down the full point. Anyway, the approval email also includes this bizarre paragraph:

I have started a new job and will be getting around 15k after taxes as a signing bonus.

6 month emergency fund in place. Putting all excess cash towards student loans (1 year until these are done...)


**Question:**

I currently have a car with a 15k note, and I am thinking about getting another vehicle of similar cost (maybe up to 18k) because my wife does not want to learn to drive on a 6-speed and having more space/AWD would be helpful in winter. 

So my question: should I just sell the car (after paying off the note) and buy the new car in cash, or am I better off getting a loan on the car and investing the 15k in index funds/expediting debt payoff on student loans?

personalfinance,Use 401k to pay off student loan in uncertain market?,"I am 25 years old with a student loan balance of 100k at 6% interest rate from my masters degree (no student debt from B.S.). I live in a low cost of living state in the midwest and currently make $92,000/year. My base monthly expenses are as follows:

House + taxes + insurance: $1700  
Truck + insurance: $500  
Child support: $350  
Student loans: $900  
Utilities (electricity, gas, water, trash): $350  
TV: none  
Internet: none (paid for by employer)  
Phone: none (paid for by employer)

At this point, I am left with only $700/month for everything else. I am currently running a deficit as I have a 2 year old kid (50/50 custody so decent amount of expenses), food, and medical bills (I had cancer 3 years ago and medical problems now from treatment).

When I started my master's program (before kid and cancer), I did not understand the financial impact a 100k master's degree would have. My fault for not thinking it through. I kick myself every single night in bed for it and can't fall asleep because of the impact the loan is having on me.

I have a 401k with $120,000. After the 10% penalty and incomes taxes, I would walk away with about $72,000. Thankfully it came back up after COVID but, the market dropped by 7% in one day 2 times this year and that is obviously more than the 10% penalty.

I understand this money has earning potential and I will lose that, but this year and next year matter a lot more than 30 years from now when I retire. If I pay off $72,000 in student loans I can refinance that to less than 30k thereby dropping my payments to under $300 per month.

I read all over how this is a bad idea, but I just don't see how it is in this situation especially with the volatility in the market that experts are predicting.

I was in the process of building up my emergency fund and making good progress on my long term financial goals when I unexpectedly got fired two weeks ago, and due to some wild circumstances, I do not wish to work in the field again (at least not for a long time).

I was thinking of going back to school and getting my Master’s Degree in a Physician Assistant program. I did not take any of the prerequisites in undergrad, so I would need to knock those out at a community college. I also need to get 1000+ hours in patient care experience before I apply, so I was thinking of becoming certified and getting a job as an EMT.

I’d like to know if this plan seems completely insane and if I should consider a different path or a more immediate solution. If you think it can be done, I’d appreciate any guidance and tips.

investing,Former Fed Chairs Bernanke and Yellen testified on COVID-19 and response to economic crisis,"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/17/former-fed-chairs-bernanke-and-yellen-testified-on-covid-19-and-response-to-economic-crisis/

&gt;However, some programs authorized by the Congress are ending, and new actions are necessary. Our recommendations for further fiscal action are:


&gt;First, Congress should develop a comprehensive plan to support medical research; increase testing, contact tracing and hospital capacity; make available critical supplies; and support state and local efforts to safely open businesses, schools, and public transportation.


&gt;Nothing is more important for restoring economic growth than improving public health. Investments in this area are likely to pay off many times over.


&gt;Second, with unemployment still very high, enhanced unemployment insurance should be extended, and complementary programs like food stamps should be adequately funded. Unemployment insurance could be restructured to deal with the incentive problems that some have noted, for example, by capping total payments at a fixed percentage of regular income. Rather than making a one-time appropriation, the Congress should create an automatic stabilizer by tying supplementary unemployment insurance and other support programs to the national unemployment rate or state unemployment rates. Under this approach, supplementary support will flow if conditions worsen, without further congressional action, and will automatically decline as conditions improve. This approach would provide people with aid when they most need it and would also help stabilize the economy as a whole by supporting income and stimulating spending automatically when the unemployment rate is high.


&gt;Third, Congress should provide substantial support to state and local governments. These governments are on the front line in providing critical services, including first responders, public health, education, and public transportation. State and local governments have been leading the way in designing a safe re-opening of the economy. The enormous loss of revenue from the recession, together with the new responsibilities imposed by the pandemic, has put state and local budgets deeply in the red. With limited capacity to run deficits, these governments will have to lay off workers and limit essential services unless they get federal help. As we learned after the financial crisis, fiscal contraction at the state and local level slows the national economy and offsets the benefits of federal action. To allow state and local governments to continue to provide essential services, and to avoid the recessionary effects of major state and local spending cuts, federal support should be substantial and without overly restrictive conditions on the aid.


&gt;Following our advice would further increase the already record-level federal budget deficit. With interest rates extremely low and likely to remain so for some time, we do not believe that concerns about the deficit and debt should prevent the Congress from responding robustly to this emergency. It remains important to use national resources wisely, with well-designed and effective programs. And, at some point, we will have to think through how to ensure the long-run sustainability of federal finances. The top priorities now, however, should be protecting our citizens from the pandemic and pursuing a strong and equitable economic recovery.",finance

personalfinance,Moving from home with student debt,"Hi I'll keep this as short as possible.

I [22M] graduated college with around $23.5k in student loans last year. I was granted the opportunity to stay at home to pay debts rent-free, but I am absolutely fed up with being here due to differences in lifestyle. I am unemployed at the moment and studying to go to law school, but I would like to move. I have about $10k saved, and I would like to pay off my student loans as soon as possible (preferably before summer 2021).  I know I need to get a job soon, I've accepted that because I don't want to live off my savings. The hard part will be balancing time dedicated to studying after work. 

I want to move to another state. CoL there is much cheaper. If I wanted my own place here where I currently reside, I'd be shelling out $1300-$1500 / month, with very limited job prospects due to COVID-19. I would rather not pay $800+ for a place here in this city because I'd be paying to stay in the same situation I'm in now, if not worse. A small room in someone's house with roommates or an apartment with roommates. That doesn't make sense to me. 

In City B, my buddy has a place for me to stay for a month out in the city is like to move to. Ideally I'd like to go there and get a job and get a studio for less than $850/month within that month stay. I would say it's possible since that city is opening sooner and there's more jobs. Ideally, I'd like to be able to save, pay off student loan debt aggressively, study in my own place, and potentially go to a law school in that city as well. My dream schools are in the city I live in now, but that school's city is one that I wouldn't mind to live in, obviously. That school is my third choice and ranked similarly / slightly higher, whereas my top choices are in close proximity / driving distance to my house. 

My current expenses add up to around $870/month now. I used to make around $2500/monthly minimum at my old sales job, now with unemployment these past few months I've been at $2800/month. My card is paid off monthly. I use it strictly to pay my bills. My bills are car + insurance, $527 (getting fleeced, didn't realize how bad I fucked myself until I started watching Dave Ramsey a week and a half after I signed the dotted line. Nice car though.), phone + internet $125, food (groceries + eat out) ~$150-$200 max. The rest is going straight to savings, maybe $400 tops is used for incidentals (recently they've been study materials and medical bills). 

Should I move cities to appease my desire to live alone? Would I be fine? Should I stay here and suffer? What would be the best course of action to try to get out of debt, get rid of my fleece, and live comfortably? Should I keep the fleece and drive 1000 mi to move? (I have 23k mi allowed, 4k currently used. I don't leave my house often, only to grocery shop and go to work)

Low volatility, virtually no long-term risk, modest returns that were still likely to beat inflation most years, and the added bonus of inverse correlation to the market providing excellent liquidity options when the rest of your portfolio (stocks, naturally!) is down.

The perfect choice.

Unfortunately, this party recently ended, with government interest rates dropping to zero.

So what's the alternative?

I have one and a half answers to this question:

1. **TIPS:** I don't know too much about them, and would love to get more opinions, but on principle, if your only goal is to preserve the real value of your funds, then TIPS seem like they should do the job.
2. **Get a mortgage and buy a house:** this is just a half-answer, since a house isn't a security, and clearly YMMV. However, in this low-interest environment, buying a house on a mortgage seems like an obvious choice.

This is basically saying the FED will not do any sort of contraction monetary policy until inflation is **at** 2%. Instead of 2% being their target, they will look to overshoot due to policy lag time. Normally, they would need to start reducing the money supply well before we reach 2% so that can be the end target. Now, they are willing to go beyond that, and I feel this could lead to a massive overshoot and cause it to runaway into hyperinflation.

One thing to point out is that management team from the Executive Chairman down to Director all have extensive experience in the REIT industry. They know and understand the industry well.

3) Profitability. I talked about profits, so let’s look at the numbers. In the 1st quarter of 2020, IIPR generated $21.1 million in revenue, up 210% from the 1st quarter in 2019. In addition, the company generated a net income of $11.5 million on this revenue, an increase of 248% from net income of $3.3 million in the 1st quarter of 2019. IIPR has had tremendous growth as the cannabis industry has grown. Management attributes much of this growth to the continued acquisition of properties and increase in lease agreements.

4) Lastly for financials, and most important in this corona environment is balance sheets. For IIPR, their financial position is strong, and they have a great capital structure. Main points, capital structure is great, interest coverage is relatively high, which is good in this industry, debt is fairly low and their liquidity is more than adequate. They ended the 1st quarter with cash of $131 million, up 121% from $59 million in the 1st quarter of 2019. They have a low EV compared to their market cap, showing that the stock is potentially undervalued.

\*As of Market close 7/17/20

|Cash|$404.00||IC|4.17|||
|EV|$1,769.72||EBITDA/EV|1%|||

5) When calculating a discounted cash flow for this company, I calculated a discounted cash flow for IIPR and have a conservative price target based on NPV of $74 by the end of the year, $100 by 2021. This was a little disappointing. It seems based on future cashflows, this stock is slightly overvalued, but the long-term value appears good. My revenue assumptions were conservative. Of course, if IIPR can continue to post triple-digit revenue growth it can far surpass these targets.

6) Unlike other marijuana stocks, IIPR is not heavily reliant on marijuana legalization on Federal level to continue to growth rapidly and make profits. Since they operate as a REIT and are not a licensed distributor of marijuana, this business is completely legal and does not have to operate in a gray market. This is also why IIPR is listed on the NYSE and not on the OTC market. Also, due to the company being a REIT they have a healthy dividend of 4.51% which is a bonus and provides incentive to hold on to the stock long-term. 

Here’s my opinion. Due to the coronavirus, many companies especially in the REIT and real estate industry are struggling as consumers shift their trends. People are shopping online more, going to retail spaces less due to restrictions, colleges are not having students back, people are shifting to suburbs and away from apartments, and office spaces are downsizing as people work from home. This is all affecting the real estate space. However, because of the nature of IIPR’s business and marijuana being deemed “essential”, the industry is not scaling back it’s growing. Marijuana companies are growing and achieving record sales and requiring greater production capacity and facilities. All the above factors provide IIPR as a “safe haven” like asset since their real estate is not affected by the ongoing events and their business will continue to have consistent rental and lease revenues. Short-term, this stock may be overvalued. Long-term, however, this stock could be valuable for a reliable dividend and exposure to a non-cyclical industry with high growth potential.",finance

personalfinance,help my sister find a better finance deal,"okay here's the background: 

my sis agreed to a 3 year lease on a new 2017 nissan rogue. stats:

1. $2700 cash down out of $3500 was due at signing
2. car was agreed to $25375 (27070 gross cap)
3. residual value $12917
4. monthly payments $355 EEEEEK

now the update: her lease ends in september for the purchase value + $300 purchase option fee. she went to a different nissan stealership which offered her this seemingly outlandish proposal of financing the remaining value:

1. APR unknown
2. $2000, $3000, or $4000 cash down which changes her monthly payments to
3. $291, $274, and $257 respectively
4. BUT if you want to do the bi-weekly ""easy pay"" it's $147, which is \~$5 more than the lowest price
5. OAC and APR unknown.
6. this dealership valued the market selling price at $13538

i'm no finance guy outright but this seems like highway robbery. it feels that at the end of this entire term, she would have paid 9 years for a car at (27070 cap gross -12917 all monthly payments til 9/20) $14,153 + $2000 (least down payment) and $20952 (72 months at lowest payments)  = $35,107 total paid.

less actual interest rate on this second car loan, am i calculating this right? please lmk what she can do to finance the remainder \~$13k at a reasonable cost.

I waiting about 15-20 minutes to go outside since that's about how long it takes him to need to poop and pee but when we went outside he did niether and we stayed outside for about 15 minutes. We went back inside and he drank about a bowl and a half of water and as per usual I have him his favorite peanut butter chicken dog treat (Rawhide free of course) and he took it then laid down but didn't eat it which isn't normal for him. He typically has it eaten within 30 minutes of me giving it to him but it took him 2 hours to even think of touching it. We went out an hour after I last took him out but he still didn't use the bathroom. It took him 3 hours to pee (I made sure he had access to all the water he could ever want and I made sure it was really really cold) About an hour or two after he peed he finally pooped but it wasn't hard but it wasn't diarrhea either. He hasn't really moved off of the couch except to drink and has been laying directly in front of the AC like he does before he takes a dog nap. Except this time he just laid there staring and even when the cats came near him he didn't jump up and chase them around as he usually doea, he just laid there looking defeated and sick.

personalfinance,Question on how to approach high-interest savings accounts right now,"Salutations, fellow personal finance aficionados. Quick questions for your beautiful minds.

Quick about me: 22 years old, employed making approximately 35k a year. I have about $17,000 in a high-interest savings account, $3300 in a brokerage account (split 70% S&amp;P500 Index, 20% Int'l Index, 10% Bond Index), and $1200 in a Roth IRA (similar split). Although originally my savings account had an interest rate close to 2%, it is now under 1% and I feel like I can better use my money elsewhere. I have $30K in student loans that I'm steadily paying off. I would also say that I am not risk-averse, but I am not an extreme risk-taker. I have average risk tolerance.

Now, to my question. I watched a fascinating video by Dave Hanson ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQOgOtwZfgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQOgOtwZfgI) ) wherein he essentially advises that investing in short-term US Treasury bond ETFs is smarter and more lucrative than a high-interest savings account. Is it a good idea to take my money from my savings account and invest it in such ETFs to get more out of the money I save? Ideally, I would save 2-3x my monthly expenses (around 6-9k) in the savings account and put the rest into the ETFs for the long-term (20+ years). Thoughts?

Thanks ever so kindly!",finance

1) should I purchase at a specific Subaru dealership? Or could any used car dealership work? If I goto a Subaru dealership won’t I get the warranty and all that Jazz?

2) how much should I put down? I was thinking about $5000, but I know for active duty we get out interest rates capped at I think like 6%? Is 5K too much or too little?

3) and finally I’ve read about getting PPIs. Do I contact mechanics first and they come to the dealership? Or do I take the car after I’ve purchased it to the dealer?

Some argue that the model is too big, so it's not surprising that it gives very good results. I disagree because model size or parameters is relative. Human brain has close to 100 billion neurons. May be soon models with billions of parameters become common, just like when Deep learning started back in 2005 100k parameters is a big deal, but now neural net with 100k parameters is nothing.


What does this say about nature of human intelligence? Brute force approach is giving the best results never expected out of it.

tron,Just watched both movies in one go for the first time,"Disclaimer: I've watched TRON 2010 once before and thought it was cool. I hadn't watched the prequel, but I agreed with the overall feedback at the time that I had seen most. Great visuals, but low on story. The story itself was also really basic, predictable, but reasonably okay.

Fast forward roughly 10 years to today and I decided to watch the old 1982 movie (I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes, but kept on watching). The visuals, even though outdated, were actually crafted well and that's what I liked about it. This original actually had a soul, an identity, compared to all the trash you see nowadays with plot holes the size of a black hole and as obvious as the elephant in the room.

So, after watching the two movies almost back to back, I actually since it really helps rather than watching just the 2010 one.

I only have one question. Why didn't Clu disintegrate when TRON crashed into him? That's the only glaring ""because plot armour"" moment that I saw. Well, the other thing was if Clu disintegrated TRON, how did he repurpose him, because the movie showed us him being killed in the flashback. The 2010 movie was pretty clear on that, so I think it failed on that part, since they said Clu can't create, just destroy or convert.

deeplearning,What is Deep Learning? What are its applications?,"&amp;#x200B;

 Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep Learning concepts are used to teach machines what comes naturally to us humans. Using Deep Learning, a computer model can be taught to run classification acts taking image, text, or sound as an input.

  
Deep Learning is becoming popular as the models are capable of achieving state of the art accuracy. Large labelled data sets are used to train these models along with the neural network architectures.  
Simply put, Deep Learning is using brain simulations hoping to make learning algorithms efficient and simpler to use. Let us now see what is the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

 **How is Deep Learning Used: Applications**

[Deep Learning](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-artificial-intelligence-course) applications have started to surface but have a much greater scope for the future. Listed here are some of the deep learning applications that will rule the future.

* **Adding image and video elements** – Deep learning algorithms are being developed to add colour to the black and white images. Also, automatically adding sounds to movies and video clips. 
* **Automatic Machine Translations** – Automatically translating text into other languages or translating images to text. Though automatic machine translations have been around for some time, deep learning is achieving top results.
* **Object Classification and Detection** – This technology helps in applications like face detection for attendance systems in schools, or spotting criminals through surveillance cameras. Object classification and detection are achieved by using very large convolutional neural networks and have use-cases in many industries.
* **Automatic Text Generation** – A large corpus of text is learnt by the machine learning algorithm and this text is used to write new text. The model is highly productive in generating meaningful text and can even map the tonality of the corpus in the output text.
* **Self-Driving cars** – A lot has been said and heard about self-driving cars and is probably the most popular application of deep learning. Here the model needs to learn from a large set of data to understand all key parts of driving, hence deep learning algorithms are used to improve performance as more and more input data is fed.
* **Applications in Healthcare** – Deep Learning shows promising results in detecting chronic illnesses such as breast cancer and skin cancer. It also has a great scope in mobile and monitoring apps, and prediction and personalised medicine.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to save to pay off my car loan?,"Hi,

I was curious about an idea to pay off my car loan. Currently my car loan is sitting at about $12,000 remaining with about a 9.3% interest rate. I'm hoping I can refinance and get a lower rate, but until then, my current monthly payment is $250 a month required. I've been playing around with the idea of paying only the lowest required of $250 a month, and saving whatever else I would be putting towards my car loan in a High Interest Savings account. I would save until i have enough to pay off whatever the remainder of the loan is as one lump sum, rather than just putting the money towards the car payment each month on it's own. I figure not only would this allow me to get some small return on whatever I'm saving, but it would essentially act as a backup in case something dire would happen where I needed a large amount of money at once, as sort of an extreme safety net. Is this feasible? Or is there some benefit to continuously paying off the loan over time rather than all at once eventually?",finance
financialindependence,Military Couple: 4 years from FIRE Goal (Update),"Update to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/cirpbw/military_couple_5_years_from_fire_goal_update/).

It's been a year so I figured I should make another update post as the FIRE goal gets closer.  My goal remains to have $2m in net worth plus our military pensions and retire at age 43.  

**Current Ages:**

* Me: 39yrs
* Wife: 37yrs
* Kid 1: 7yrs
* Kid 2: 4yrs

**Income:**

* Me: $135k  (down slightly due to moving to a location with a slightly lower housing allowance)
* Wife: $123k (sadly no more annual $15k bonuses)
* Rental Income: $32k after expenses

**Rental Property 1:** $1850/mo rent, $185 management fee, $1367.68 mortgage, $90 HOA. This ends up being an extra $200 in cashflow with $850 of the mortgage payment going to principle or a net $1050/mo. We owe $31k (3.25%) on the 15 yr mortgage and the house is worth about $295k. (Purchase price: $215k + $20k repairs/improvements).  So about $264k in equity.  Continuing to pay the mortgage as scheduled results in paying off the mortgage when we retire.

**Rental Property 2:** $3200/mo rent, $320 management fee, $3236 mortgage, $56 HOA. Negative cashflow here, but I refinanced into a 15 yr loan to get a 3% interest rate because ultimately that was saving me $200/mo in lower interest payments.  $1650 goes to principal each month, so if you take out the $412 out of pocket expenses each month, it generates net income of $1238/mo.  I don't need the cashflow each month.  Purchase price on this was $497k, but then I put about $40k into it.  The online sites say it's worth about $550k now.  So about $200k in equity.  The house is in great shape now, so maintenance will likely be minimal the next few years.

**Savings:** Both wife and I max out our tax deferred savings options. We also put $28.8k/yr into the taxable brokerage account, Traditional TSP ($19k/yr each), college funds ($4k/yr), cash savings (12k/yr), and Roth IRA ($6k/yr each). Total annual savings is $94,800 when I add everything up. The vast majority of these investments are in low cost index funds (TSP C/S/I funds or Vanguard VOO/VXUS).  My emergency fund interest rate has gone from 2.1% to 1% over the last year.

**Current balances:**

* TSP (gov’t 401k): $753k  (69k increase, 32k gains, 37k contributions)
* Roth IRAs: $257k  (31k increase, 20k gains, 11k contributions)
* Taxable brokerage account: [$261k](https://i.imgur.com/Nha2WdV.jpg)  (67k increase, 30k gains, 27k contributions)
* Emergency fund: $15k
* Checking: $15k
* Kid 1 ESA: $25k (4k increase, 2k gains, 2k contributions)
* Kid 2 ESA: $13k (3k increase, 1k gains, 2k contributions)

I owe $20k on the new car I purchased last year @ 2.75%.  The wife may get a similar SUV in the near future (ballpark $50k price point) depending whether supply comes back the auto market.

**Life insurance:** No change in policies, $145/mo combined for both our policies.  We each have $1m which will drop in half to $500k/each when we retire and the work insurance goes away.  The $500k policies are 30 year term that take us to around age 63.  I figure with $1M insurance and $2M assets, the kids will be taken care of just fine.

We currently plan to opt out of the survivor benefit plan.  The simplified math of SBP would cost 6.5% of our pensions and would pay the spouse 55% of their pension if they died.   It's not a bad deal and it's inflation adjusted, but I think we have ample resources to take on the risk of not having SBP.

**Expenses:**

Expenses changed slightly due to moving and converting our home to a second rental property.  Honestly, I really don't track this nearly as much as I used to.

* Fixed expenses (mortgages, day care, insurance, utilities, etc): $13100/mo    Significant increase here, but that's mostly due to the new rent payment we added.  The new rental income from our old house offsets this increase.
* Fixed savings: $7900/mo

Extra unallocated money each month typically gets spent on other things we probably don't need, extra debt payments, or the taxable brokerage account.  I don't track this very closely anymore since the automatic investments are on autopilot.

**Historical Actual Net Worth (updated):**  [https://i.imgur.com/UPMk7cc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UPMk7cc.jpg)

* Note:  These are calendar years
* 2012: +$130k
* 2013: +$194k
* 2014: +$110k
* 2015: +$39k
* 2016: +$177k
* 2017: +$247k
* 2018: +$102k
* 2019: +$367k
* 2020: +$82k year to date. Back in March when I did my monthly calculations I was down $416k.  But since I didn't panic and sell everything, that ended up being no big deal.  At one point I was probably down over $500k, but I wasn't tracking it daily.

**Historical Actual Debt (updated):** [https://i.imgur.com/FdnDGYe.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FdnDGYe.jpg)

* House 1:  31k @ 3.25%  (Will be paid off before FIRE)
* House 2: 355k @ 3% (I refinanced this into a 15 year loan last winter before COVID started/interest rates plummeted.  I don't think I can get much lower now, so I'm happy.  It was a 30 yr @ 3.75% loan previously)
* Car: 20k @ 2.75% (Will be paid off before FIRE, although I'll probably get a new car for the spouse at some point)

**Retirement plan:**

Military pensions are equal to 2.5% \* yrs of service \* high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $55k each. That is in today’s money and since this is tied to inflation it’d be slightly higher and would continue to grow each year in retirement since it’s chained to the employment cost index and then in retirement it's tied to the CPI.

**Age 43:**

1. Buy a nice house somewhere after selling the rental houses.  We currently have about $464k in equity and should have closer to $550k by the time we retire although $50k of that will probably be eaten up in fees when we sell.   We really don’t know yet where this retirement house will be and how much we’d spend.  I've decided I don't want to keep the rentals if I'm not local to the area as I wouldn't want to keep paying property management fees after I retire.   Our house target price is $400k-600k.  My original plan was to just pay that outright or finance up to $200k.    I'm not going to worry about this too much until we decide on a location.  We may just rent for a year in that location before committing.
2. Stop TSP/Roth IRA contributions and most other savings.
3. Live off of $110k/yr in pensions and money generated from the taxable brokerage account.  My goal is to continue something close to our current lifestyle. Even though we’ll have half the income, it should be similar since we won’t have rent/mortgage or contributing to retirement accounts.  With $2m and a 4% SWR, I'm looking to augment the pensions with an extra $80k/yr for a total of $188k/yr.   When I project retirement expenses, I'm looking at around $105-140k/yr max.   So I think we have a pretty good cushion here.
4. Find an activity to stay occupied. We’ll be at peak earning potential and could probably get high paying jobs for a few years at this point which is my insurance plan if the market tanked/black swan event.  We could also stay in the military up to 8 more years which would increase my pension 2.5%/yr above the 50% base. But, I really want to quit working at this point and spend time with the kids who will be in elementary/jr high school.
5. Begin converting our traditional TSP to a Roth IRA ladder.   I think I'm stuck paying like 22% tax on that money because of our pensions.  But, might as well do it sooner rather than later so the money is available without penalties sooner.
6. Attend kids’ college graduations.  Note:  We transferred our post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to the kids, so they can both attend a university anywhere in the county and the gov't will pay a stipend plus tuition up to the highest state university tuition in that state.  I'm still contributing $2k/yr each to their college funds in a coverdell education savings account for the tax benefits.  I decided to keep doing that because the money could still be used for a master's degree.

**Age 62:**

1. Begin collecting social security. If we wait until age 67 it's an extra $18k/yr each for us.  By taking it at 62 it's more like 12.5k/yr each (today's dollars).   It'd take 11.5 years to break even if we waited until 67.   In reality it'd probably be even longer if we invested the money that we start receiving at 62.  I'll probably flip flop on this some more over the years, but it's not like I'm making that decision anytime soon.

**Major risks:**

1. ~~Wife and I getting stationed in geographically separated locations reducing our savings rate by having to maintain two households.~~  We're good for the next few years, this is a much lower risk at this point.
2. Minimal bond exposure, I’ve been adding some over the last couple years, but primarily am invested in low cost stock index funds (vanguard and TSP).  The COVID-19 crash definitely made me think, but I'm still focused on the long term vs short term market moves.
3. Congress making significant changes to military retirement benefits/healthcare.  The current deal is ridiculously good, I can insure my family after retiring for $580/yr with Tricare.  When we become eligible for medicare then we have to pay the medicare part b premiums and Tricare for Life kicks in automatically to cover the 20% Medicare doesn’t cover plus provides the same prescription drug coverage benefit we have now.  I think the main risk is they increase the annual premium, but even if they went from $580/yr to $580/mo I’d still be thrilled with it.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer!

personalfinance,Should I sell my car? Does it ever make financial sense to sell a working car?,"I'm in the military, and I learned that I'll be leaving for Korea by the beginning of next year for one year, maybe two. And after Korea, I don't know where I'll be stationed after; it could be back in the US, it could be somewhere else overseas. **But let's assume that I'll be back after just one year.** I believe it's obviously not worth keeping the car if I'm away for any amount of time thats greater than one year unless otherwise.

I wanted to know if I should keep my car while overseas, or sell it? I currently have a '18 VW Passat with the following figures on the loan as of the day that I'm posting this:

* Current Loan Balance: $10,409.98
* Interest Rate: 6.08%
* Term: 72 months
* Minimal Monthly Payment: $339.57 (I'm currently paying $650. The extra $310 was originally going to my student loan until the Federal Government put it in interest free forbearance for the next few months due to COVID-19. Will return to minimal payments once forbearance ends.)
* Total Payments so far: $12,227.14
* KBB values my car at $14,845
* Carmax offered me $15,000
* Carvana values my car at $16,169 at my current location, Missouri
* Carvana values my car at $15,775 at my parents location, Georgia

My only other loan is a student loan:

* Current Loan Balance: $5,900
* Interest Rate: 4.29%
* Minimal Monthly Payment: $82.47 ( As mentioned above, I was paying extra to this loan until it was placed in interest free forbearance. All payments have been stopped until forbearance ends.)

I was originally planning to keep on driving it for the next few months, take it back to my parents in Georgia in December, sell it to Carmax or Carvana, and then take off for Korea. But it was pointed out to me that instead of netting a profit of $5,366\~ from the sale, (Carvana's Georgia offer minus the Loan Balance), it was actually going to be a loss of $-6,861\~.

I forgot to take into account the $12,227.14 worth of payments that I've already made on the car. With all this being said:

* Again, lets assume that I'll be back in the US after one year; should I keep the car at my parents place until I get back or sell it?
* If I should sell it, should I pay the minimal per month until it comes time to sell?
* Should I refinance ASAP to lower the interest until I sell?
* Should I sell ASAP for the better price in Missouri and buy a cheapo to drive until I leave?

With all that I've learned in the past few hours, I'm curious, with factors such as interest on loans, and depreciation on vehicles, in general, does it *ever* make good financial sense to sell a perfectly working car?

personalfinance,Does my financial plan for attending college make sense?,"Hey guys! 
I just recently got my bill for college and I need some advice on if my financial plan makes sense. Essentially, I will be attending an east coast private college as an IDIP major to do International Relations and Human Rights. I have interests in working for the government, as a Foreign Service Officer or other positions related to the field of work. In May, I was able to appeal my original financial aid package and maxed out the school grant and work study while also obtaining a scholarship from them as well . But, it is still expensive for my family and I to afford. With everything combined, I would need to pull out about $13.5k of private student loans PER semester, combined with $5,500 of federal loans over the whole year, which totals to a 19k a semester.
     The reason why I need to pull out this much money is not from the tuition itself but rather from the room and board. Without room and board I would be able to afford my college off of the financial aid I’ve been given but dorming on campus is mandatory for 3 years. However, after talking to my admissions counselor, I learned that the required dorming can be easily appealed and waived. 
So here’s my plan. Because of the AP classes I took and the dual enrollment I did with my local cc in HS, my admissions counselor said I could skip about a semester to a year of college. In addition to this, I want to dual enroll in the community college local to the area where my college is located so I can save money on the Gen Ed classes. I also want to move off of campus after the first year with 2 of my friends that are also attending in the area. I plan to work at the Target or Chipotle near my school for the tuition reimbursement programs that they offer. In addition to that, I plan to apply for the honors program at my school (again) and apply for additional scholarships throughout Undergrad to try and secure extra financial assistance. 
So essentially, my plan is to pull out 13.5k per sem in private loans for the first year only. I’m going to on top of that dual enroll in CC, work during undergrad for a company that offers tuition reimbursement programs, and apply to various undergrad scholarships and the honors program offered by my school. I really want to make attending this college work on a financial level and I’m willing to put in the work to be able to attend this school so please let me know if this plan makes sense and if you have any additional advice and tips!

I have $13k worth of student loans to repay. Interest accruement is paused until October due to covid, and I am wondering if I should repay my loans as much as possible during this time?

I just looked at my payment history, and an average of $50–$70 out of my $150 monthly payment is going towards interest. So would it be a good idea to put like $4,000 into my loans right now, from my savings? That's not *all* of my savings, but definitely significant.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks :–)

\~ **edit** to include additional detail$

\~ **edit to respond to some common comments:**

1. I have no other debt. Only this $13k.
2. I have a good amount of trust in my job. I'm a designer and we're working remote, and if things did unexpectedly change for my company, I could continue to work freelance.
3. I agree it is definitely important to keep my savings in order — however I would be willing to sacrifice a bit of stability in order to get these loans out of my life.
4. The interest rates for my 4 loans are: %3.8  /  %3.9  /  %4.2  /  %3.8
5. I am leaning towards continuing to pay my standard monthly payment, then dropping a large payment at the end of September to get a good chunk out of the way.",finance
personalfinance,Cash out 401k or keep it,"I'm facing a decision if I should keep my 401k balance and let it grow for the next 30 years, or take it out and use it for example for a home purchase.

We're in the US on a working visa. Because of the business climate (Covid etc.) our employer is going through layoffs, and it looks like it'll impact me. That means my family and I will very likely have to leave the US and contributions to the 401k will stop in the next few months.

The current balance is around 120k. I ran this through a calculator and assuming 5% average growth, this could would result in 518k balance when we retire in 30 years. To compare with today's value, adjusted for standard inflation this would be about 247k worth today, which is still pre-tax before withdrawals.

In contrast to that, if we take out the money now, pay federal + state taxes plus the 10% penalty, online calculators are telling me we'd receive about 64k cash. Maybe there's a case to reduce the 10% penalty for the first 100k because of the CARE act rules, so potentially 74k post-tax.I'm not sure if there's further potential to optimize this, e.g. tax it over the next years when our other income is removed or so. Assuming the same interest for this money in the next 30 years, this would be 330k by 2050 which again adjusted for inflation is 157k in today's money.

Assuming the deductions at retirement would be neligible: 247k vs. 157k is still big difference in value. But there's also value in having the cash available now to contribute to other investments (e.g. property purchase).

Because of compounding interest it gets increasingly useful to keep the money in and growing till retirement, the bigger the balance left in the 401k account is. But I'm just not sure if at 120k over 30 years is already beyond a value where that makes sense to keep in.

Do you have any advice for this situation?

personalfinance,Financing a lucrative car with well done math is a good idea or not?,"I have always been an investor, but now I a plan to get a car with no investment or very little, It is a well calculated plan yet I am confused about being wise or not. Before giving the term details with banks, let me bring you in my situation to see if it makes sense or I calculated wrong (being 28) year old. Going to get married soon in coming months. My job is secured *(edit: full stack software engineer)* in a sense that with these skills I am stable in current company and  have similar offers. Only acts of God are the things which can alter the story below.

I earn about 0.25 million per month. That is 250K or 250,000 of my currency (PKR) *(edit) per month*. I may get raise after every 1 year of 10-15%. After provident fund and taxes I get 217K in my bank currently. I calculate my spending in detail for last 4 years using Mobills App. My average expense is about 50K per month. After marriage it could go up to 60-70K with car and wife  leaving me with 150K from pay check.  I plan to spend 60% of my savings to pay installments (90K) for car finance. Lets move on to car details.

It is a high end, value for money car. The cars price is 5 million. Financing terms are like this: a down payment of 1.5 million, and then monthly installment of 90.2K average over 5 years. I have researched all cars below this price and all of them or depreciating more faster than this car and lack the status I get with this. Most are old models soon going to get new shapes in this country market and some Hybrids or only available used with more workshop visits.

Now some people might say I am paying more in terms of interest for a depreciating asset. Yes It is, but that's the case any way in whatever car I own, and financing is the only option for me, I always invest and this is my first expense for this category. If it is new I can keep it carefully and plan my budget accordingly. I have about 3 million invested in a transport business and 2 million in real estate. ROI is not as high for moving assets of transport  due to Covid19, which in good case can give me 50K to 100K after 2 years, it was also financed but it is a business, but the asset value is do increasing for real estate. Currently I have 2 million cash and I plan to spend 1.5 million on car finance and 5 million emergency funds apart from provident fund. I also sometimes do consultant jobs, currently also doing but not included (\~50K) in income above.

**Now for the final calculations, if I get 90K installment +10K (car costs &amp; maintenance) from 150K saving after expenses from my full time job. I am left with about 50K for savings. Which I will further divide to investments or some long term goals. or may be use it to faster loan payments like 0.5 million bulk payment extra than monthly every year.**

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a wise decision to finance a car like this or I should think again and finance a 3 million car, which can also work but will depreciate faster and with little features. Remember I only have 1.5 million to spend on financing and financing is the only option for me. The decision is to finance 5 million car or 3 million car. Or buy a moving box with no features and safety for 1.5 million i.e. a very low end car, that can also work. *(edit: The question that makes my confused is ...... does that makes sense to pay interest rate of 14% say or 1.5 million PKR extra for 5 years, for safety and better happy life? Especially in my case when I can pay it easily.)*",finance

personalfinance,Lower Closing Costs or Higher Interest Rate?,"Hey! So we just got an accepted offer on a house and we're now negotiating our mortgage. The bank has offered us a couple options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pay nearly 5k in closing costs to get a 3% interest rate.
2. Get 2k off closing costs with a 3.125% rate (about $20 more a month)
3. Get 3.5k off closing costs with a 3.25% rate (about $40 more a month)  


I know that with a higher rate, more of our house payment goes toward interest and not principal, but the savings on closing costs is pretty high. It would take over 7 years for the extra monthly amount to exceed the savings. By that time, we could have refinanced or moved!   


Also, I was curious about what part of the closing costs I should negotiate? The internet seems to say that there is some wiggle room, but it seems like the bank has no reason to budge. If they say no, there goes my earnest money/inspection fees.",finance
personalfinance,Seeking advice on Student Loans,"I dont mind sharing my financial situation here, its not a big deal to me. I'm seeking some financial advice on what to do, and understanding government loans, etc and the financial aid office has yet to get back to me. I emailed two weeks ago, totally understand short staffing, so I'm not upset, I would just love to get some guidance from people here. This is the exact email I sent is as follows:

""I currently have a two loans through Sallie Mae, with an awfully high interest rate. One is for a UCF coding bootcamp, and the other is UCF tuition. The coding camp is currently at $9282 @ 7%, and my tuition that I took is at $14966 @ 8.5%. My first semester at UCF in 2019, Sallie Mae dispersed the total loan of the 8.5% one, which has been sitting in my savings account. Combined, its a total of $24248, and after my fall and spring semesters, I currently have $11264 in my account from that dispursement I set aside.

I applied for FAFSA, and was awarded for the 2021 school year the following:

FALL 2020:

Black and Gold Grant: $600

Direct Unsubsidized Loan $3500

Direct Unsubsidized Loan $2750

Total: $6850

SPRING 2020:

Black and Gold Grant: $600  
Direct Unsubsidized Loan $3500  
Direct Unsubsidized Loan $2750  
Total: $6850

I am planning on two classes in the fall, and two in the spring. It makes most sense for me to accept all three fall packages to cover those. My questions are, say for those four classes, my expenses are $4000 for example. Would the remaining $2850 be available for me to use for future semesters? Also, how would interest work on those? Would it be two loans, both gaining interest, or one loan of $6250? How would I make payments?

My plan was to turn around and pay as much of the remaining money I have to Sallie Mae, as my current rates are 8.5% and 7%. I was going to pay off the $9282 loan I have, and the remaining of the $11264 start dumping on the $14966 loan. This would eliminate the $9282 loan, and I would only be paying interest on one loan. I would work on paying those down, hopefully by March of next year. Just wondering when I would begin payments on these loans if I accept, and if that seems like a smart decision to make. I am very open to any opinions and help you can offer me, thanks!""

Sorry if this is a lot to take in, just seeking some advice! I currently work two jobs, averaging $800 a week. I'm finishing paying my last credit card by the end of the year, and come November, plan to dump all my extra cash onto my remaining Sallie Mae loan.

investing,Long GLD / Short TLT,"I've been thinking about how the market is euphorically rallying despite increasing odds of a dem sweep. The view could be that higher tax/regulation is worth a steadier hand. But this weekend it dawned on me that a dem sweep in this environment, has a good chance of spawning some sort of UBI. So maybe equities are rallying because more free money can keep the partyyy going.

I imagine it wouldn't be framed explicitly as MMT/UBI. Probably enacted as temporary, but once entitlements start getting doled out, it's basically impossible to roll them back. So my guess is that will be how we finally wake that inflationary bear we've been prodding for.

Rising inflation necessitates higher rates, correct? Particularly on the long end? Is the fed actually capable of holding down long term rates in the face of inflation? 

So go short TLT? I'm not high conviction on timing, we clearly have some counteractive disinflationary forces at the moment. However rates are really low now, yet treasuries aren't completely out of favor yet (obviously). And once a hint of inflation shows, it'll be too late to get short. So soon seems to be the time to initiate (maybe right after election if dems sweep).

And then in conjuction, go long gold (I already am). (And maybe some btc of you wanna gamble.) GLD/TLT been moving in tandem, but if inflation arises, they basically gotta diverge.

investing,[NYTimes] Businesses Are Supposed to Cut Debt in a Downturn. Why Not Now?,"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/business/corporate-debt-federal-reserve.html

&gt; Since the 2008 global financial crisis, American corporations have taken advantage of historically low interest rates to gorge themselves on debt. Then came the pandemic and the sharpest economic downturn in history, which resulted in an odd solution for the companies that did all that borrowing: more debt.
&gt; 
&gt; Through late June, giant U.S. companies had borrowed roughly $850 billion in the bond markets this year, double the pace from last year. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase anticipate that investment-grade companies will borrow roughly $1.6 trillion from investors by the time 2020 is over.
&gt; 
&gt; It has turned conventional wisdom on its head.
&gt; 
&gt; “During a standard recession, and that would include the global financial crisis as well, you would expect to see corporate debt as a percentage of G.D.P. begin to come down,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm.
&gt; 
&gt; The increased borrowing can be traced, in part, to the actions of the Federal Reserve. The central bank slashed interest rates back to rock-bottom levels, making it attractive for businesses to refinance and borrow more to build a cushion of cash. But an even bigger factor was the Fed’s announcement — in the heat of March’s market upheaval — that it would buy corporate bonds.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors have been so emboldened by the Fed’s actions that even companies viewed as especially risky are having no problem borrowing heavily despite a deeply uncertain economic recovery marked by spiking infections and rolled-back reopenings.
&gt; 
&gt; “Now they have, like, a second life,” said Steven Chylinski, head of fixed-income trading at Eagle Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Fla.
&gt; 
&gt; Heavily indebted companies — with below-investment-grade, or junk, credit ratings — issued a record $48 billion in new bonds in June alone. They included Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Sirius XM Radio.
&gt; 
&gt; Other companies that were shunned by investors a few months ago because of the threat of the virus are likewise finding no shortage of willing lenders. Hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton have borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars, the online travel company Expedia borrowed more than $2.5 billion, and the concert company Live Nation borrowed over $1 billion.
&gt; 
&gt; Long-term strategy has effectively gone out the window, on both sides: Some investors feel free to ignore the risks of lending to companies that are focused on surviving the crisis and figuring the rest out later.
&gt; 
&gt; “Do they have a viable business going forward? Maybe or maybe not,” Mr. Chylinski said. “But if they didn’t have this Fed facility and the confidence that the Fed gave the market, they wouldn’t have been able to come to the market and borrow.”
&gt; 
&gt; The borrowing has been a boon for Wall Street, providing a rare bright spot for banks that are setting aside billions of dollars in case consumers and corporations become unable to cover their debts. Banks collect hefty fees for squiring these bonds to market, and quarterly earnings reports last week showed remarkable increases in investment banking revenue over a year earlier, including 91 percent at JPMorgan Chase. Citigroup said its underwriting business for investment-grade bonds was up 131 percent from the same time last year. Goldman Sachs reported record numbers for debt underwriting, “reflecting a significant increase in industrywide volumes.”
&gt; 
&gt; Corporate debt has been growing steadily since the last financial crisis. Back then, the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero — and kept them there. For the next decade, there was little reason not to pile up debt: Stocks climbed ever higher, and corporate earnings more than made up for the borrowing, even as rates began to creep up. Since 2008, corporate debt held by nonfinancial companies has increased 92 percent, to nearly $6.8 trillion. (Financial firms aren’t considered because they typically borrow money to relend it, which could result in a kind of double counting.)
&gt; 
&gt; The pandemic’s blindside hit immediately changed the way investors looked at that pile of debt.
&gt; 
&gt; Bondholders sprinted to sell, fearing that even the most bulletproof companies wouldn’t be able to pay their debts. Benchmark corporate bond indexes plummeted about 5 percent in a matter of days in one of the sharpest drops in the market’s recent history.
&gt; 
&gt; It threatened to set off a full-blown crisis. Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, soared. Those yields are used to calculate the cost of new borrowing, such as the short-term loans that companies use to pay for basics like payroll and inventories. There was a danger that many companies — even those feeling no ill effects from the virus — wouldn’t be able to pay their bills.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed took drastic measures to break the doom loop. On March 15, in a highly unusual Sunday announcement, the central bank cut interest rates to near zero. After another terrible week — the worst for stocks since the 2008 financial crisis — the Fed said it would buy corporate bonds for the first time in its history.
&gt; 
&gt; That seemed to do the trick. Within days, the government’s unlimited buying power virtually eliminated the panic.
&gt; 
&gt; “There’s the feeling there that, even if we were to have another big sell-off, the Fed would step in and do more if they have to,” Mr. Chylinski said.
&gt; 
&gt; Surging bond prices have pushed yields down sharply. By some measures, they’re hovering at some of lowest levels on record, meaning it has never been cheaper for companies to borrow.
&gt; 
&gt; At first, only the bluest of blue-chip corporations were able to open investors’ wallets. Nike borrowed $6 billion. The energy subsidiary of Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway borrowed $2 billion. McDonald’s, Deere and Pfizer loaded up on billions more.
&gt; 
&gt; But the trickle became a flood, as investment-grade companies borrowed record amounts in March, April and May, when they issued more than $230 billion in debt, according to Dealogic.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon even the riskiest borrowers were again welcome in the market, which some critics argue might be a problem with the Fed’s approach.
&gt; 
&gt; The low costs of borrowing will inevitably keep some companies alive that would otherwise have gone bankrupt this year, creating a class of so-called zombie companies that stagger along but are too weak to invest and grow while sucking up cash that could be put to better use elsewhere. After Japan’s economic crash in the early 1990s, such companies were long seen as a contributor to the country’s economic stagnation.
&gt; 
&gt; But most market analysts say visions of American corporate zombies are far less frightening than the economic cataclysm the country was facing back in March.
&gt; 
&gt; And for now, the Fed’s actions have transformed the fear that racked investors into opportunity — perhaps bordering on greed — as they race to buy riskier bonds with higher payoffs.
&gt; 
&gt; Daniel Krieter of BMO Capital Markets called this a “yield grab” trading environment. Investors are clamoring for big returns, and the pieces are in place to support it.
&gt; 
&gt; “There’s demand for all this kind of debt out there,” he said.",finance

personalfinance,Getting a HELOC for a start-up,"Hi all,

Here's the deal: I'm looking at starting a home-remodeling business and am in need of a relatively small amount of start-up capital to get it rolling. I currently have a consulting job in the industry that pays well, but with COL expenses (I live in an expensive area) I don't have much in the way of savings or much left at the end of the month.

I'm finishing up a home re-financing to get a lower interest rate, and when this is completed as it is projected to be within the next ten days, I'm planning on getting a HELOC (if possible; I'm aware that many lenders have temporarily stopped providing them).

I will have approximately $200k in equity in the house, and I'm also aware that lenders only approve a percentage of the equity as a withdraw-able amount. I also have a fairly good credit score, 765.

The idea is to have relatively quick access to cash for business or personal emergencies (I know that in economic emergencies, lenders often severely curtail this amount) and to start-up my business. I've calculated that I will only need $1,500 - $2,000 over the first two months of business to get my first project, and then I will immediately begin paying this amount back and should be able to fund the company off of its own revenues. I'm lucky enough to have a home office, truck and everything else that I need already, so this amount is primarily for advertising (have worked in home remodeling &amp; construction for a decade already, so I can convert those leads), license application fees, a surety bond, a DIY website and some business cards.

Is this a good idea? I have heard that HELOCs generally carry lower interest than Credit Cards (another option) and business loans (which are notoriously hard to get when you actually need them). Is there anything wrong with this plan? Are there any recommendations you have for me?

Thanks in advance.",finance

I am potentially interested in using equity out of my current rental home to use as a downpayment for another rental home. From my initial understanding (internet/friends/without having talked to a banker yet), a cashout refinance would allow me to not only renegotiate the current loan that I have for a possible lower interest rate, but would also allow me to use up to 80% of the equity towards say a second rental property?

I do understand that there are variables such as my income, credit score, etc that come into the mix however given the extremely low interest rates being offered at this point, is this a good idea? Also, the difference between a cash out refinance vs a HELOC is simply that I wouldn't get to renegotiate my current loan, correct?

personalfinance,"Can I take out the equity in my home as a cash out refi, rent that house out, and use that money as a downpayment on a new construction build?","Hello!

I had some questions about what my options are for using the equity in my home. I’ll give a bit of a breakdown on the numbers as well as our goals.

Mortgage Balance: $94,340.00
Current Mortgage Payment: $750.03
Household monthly income: $4200.00

Back in February, my fiancé and I did a cash out refi for our home that was halfway finished. We took on a full gut job and after finishing a lot of things, we got an 80% LtV refi of $95,000 after our home appraised at $119,000.

Since then, we’ve finished quite a bit and have had 3 separate realtor comps/market analysis done and we’re looking at a value of our home around the $165,000-$175,000 range.

We’ve looked around at numerous credit unions and some offer a 100% LtV loan with interest rates ranging as low as 2.5% currently.

In the future, whether it’s near or far our goal is to start investing in properties as rentals and flips, and I’d like to start with my home I’m currently living in. 

With that being said, assuming we have renters, is it possible to take the equity out of my current home (assuming let’s say $50,000-$80,000 on the high end), use that money as a down payment on a lot for a new construction build, and then rent out my current home and have 2 mortgages? 

By my metrics and average rent for the specs on my home, I could get as high as $1500.00/month, which even if I did refi for $175,000 I’d be looking at a payment range of $950-$1200/month with taxes and insurance, which with rent of $1500.00 I’d be make a couple hundred extra a month on top of our regular income while still being able to afford the 2nd mortgage as our primary mortgage. 

Is it possible to do this?

My co-worker and I compared pay stubs today just because we were curious. We noticed he pays literally under half what I pay in taxes in a given bi-weekly pay period. We make roughly the same wage. He claims 1 on his W-4 and files married filing jointly, I claim 0 and file single.

Now, I get I would be taxed more due to claiming 0, and because I'm not married, but more than double what he pays in Federal and State tax??? I make around 5k a month gross, I'm taxed approximately $600 a month in federal taxes and $250 in state. Adding the $400 a month in FICA and Medicare I pay over $1200 a month in taxes, that's about 25% of my paycheck going to taxes. 

Now, he makes roughly the same ($3 an hour less), yet is taxed only about $300 a month in federal and $120 in state taxes. Adding in the $400 a month I saw on his stub for FICA and Medicare, that means he's only paying around 16% of his check in taxes. Seriously what gives? Do I seriously have that much more of a tax burden just because I'm single?

I also factor in tax returns but last year I made the same hourly wage and got around $2,500 back between Federal and State. That doesn't seem to make up the fact that a married person is paying like 9% less of their income than I did that year. Are single people really taxed that much more?",finance

personalfinance,Advice for taking a personal loan for CC debt vs keeping the cards,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I've read several posts addressing this question—stick with the CC debt focusing on the avalanche or snowball method vs taking out a personal loan to clear the CC debt at a lower interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

BoA card at 18.99% for $4,960.53

Chase card at 20.74% for $3,811.90

Chase card at 22.99% for $4,368.61

&amp;#x200B;

A year ago my credit was at 740, now it's at 708. The pandemic forced our company to lay off dozens and for me to take a roughly 35% pay cut, and while I have a handle on my budgeting now I'm wondering it is makes sense to take out a personal loan for the ease of one monthly payment (I work in the events industry and at the moment no one knows when live events will be back). It looks like I can get a $13,300 three year loan for around 10-12%.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the uncertainty of my industry's future, I'm wondering if it makes more sense to take out the loan for the ease of one monthly payment, vs paying the minimum on two of the cards and 200-250% of the minimum on the highest interest card. Obviously had my pay not been cut so drastically I wouldn't be in this position.

&amp;#x200B;

As things start to pick up again (whether that is a year from now or two), I would be able to pay more than the monthly payment on the loan and pay it off early provided there was no penalty (or avalanche that shit on the cards).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware of  balance transfer cards, but not sure I will be able to get one that is great with my 708 score.

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO curious how taking the loan will affect my credit score as I won't be using the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,VA loan program for civilians? (Vendee),"So I just found a house that I want to put an offer on, but I noticed on the house listing they say it is eligible for a Vendee loan.  After doing some digging it seems like its a program aimed at getting rid of foreclosed VA owned properties.  So they offer 0$ down and try to undercut the markets interest rates to get the property off of their books.  They do have additional closing fee's and application fee's that I am seeing (2.25% of loan amount goes to the VA and 350$)  Does anyone have experience with these?  I'm not sure if it is something geared at someone not able to make a down payment (I'm planning on doing 10%) or if it would just be a better overall deal for me and worth the extra hoops to jump through.

personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs. Debt Payoff,"I’m finally getting unemployment assistance and will have about $21,000 total to work with when combined with my current assets. $11,300 will go to pay off my car loan - this frees up $200 a month though it is not my highest interest loan. 

So I will have about $9,500 left. I want to keep some as an emergency fund, but I need to replace my phone and buy some technology for a new small business I am opening. I only expect all of this to cost around $2,500 total. 

So, $7,000 left.

The rest of my debt is all federal student loans and they total approximately $27,000 right now. I have a couple of $2,300-$3,000 loans in there with 6.55% interest rates - the highest rates but not highest total loans - that I could pay one of now, but everything is paused for Covid and once it all comes back online my monthly payments will probably be $0 on IDR (max $322/mo. without it) so they aren’t a huge priority - though I would kill to be completely debt free. 

Should I go ahead and pay off one of those loans and keep ~$4,000-$4,500 as an emergency fund? Or just hold onto that $7,000 as the emergency fund and let the loans sit there without accruing interest for a while?

personalfinance,Refinance federal loan for a state loan with lower interest rate?,"First time poster long time lurker. 

I have about $147,000 in student loans (thanks law school). The loan has a 6.3% interest rate and thanks to income based repayment, my minimum payment is $950 a month. Most goes to interest so I usually pay $1200 to cover some principal. I have 24 more years until everything is 'forgiven' - which might not be because the program might go away by then. 

My state is offering a refinancing loan with a 4% interest rate but the monthly payments are $1800. I can afford that and I would be paying off my loan in 15 years and have no other debt. 

Half of me just wants to refinance so I don't have to have this high interest rate and give the Federal government more of my money. The other half is hesitant - what if in 8 years a more progressive president gets elected and forgives all federal student loans and I'm the dummy who transfered her loan over? Also I looked into it and I can't refinance only a part of my loan, which I wanted to do to hedge my bets. Finally, a part of me had resigned to just dying with my loans as a final eff you.

economy,Implications of Infinite QE,"Hey guys, pretty new to this subreddit and just wanted to have a discussion of the Fed's current actions and what it all means in the short and long term.

I think we're pretty much all in agreement judging by the comments and articles posted here that the stock market is completely detached from the economy at this point. While the stock market =/= the economy I've always felt that in the long term there should be some convergence.

I've seen a lot of arguments presented here about how the market is due for a reckoning due to the poor Covid response by the US, potential future lockdowns and mass unemployment/evictions...but with respect to the market, could the Fed not just keep printing (insert money printer go brrr meme) and we just don't get a crash at all? 

It seems to me at least that as long as inflation remains low (and they've been able to keep inflation low since the money is going to the wealthy and not to people like us to actually spend back into the economy) they can just continue to print away. Which ultimately results in inflated stock/asset prices and a greater wealth gap.

I guess the bleak discussion/question I want to ask is...is there really a ""limit"" to what they can do before they have to stop or are we all pretty much helpless in this cycle? For those who believe a drop is still coming soon, why do you believe so and which of my points above do you disagree with? Just trying to wrap my head around what's happening and what's to come.

personalfinance,How Am I Doing? Moved to NYC exactly 2 years ago. Trying to figure out what to do with allocating my money,"I am currently 27, turning 28 in September, and had questions with how to allocate my money and see how I can do better in this pandemic. My salary has been cut by 20 percent since April until the end of the year due to covid. I thankfully still have a job.

Some background on me:

I moved to NYC in July 2018 when I was 25. I grew up lower/lower middle class so didn't have an education on personal finance. I went to a pretty good college, for which I had to, unfortunately, take out loans. After graduation, at age 23 I did a few internships and fellowships, and some random odd jobs, was unemployed for a few months while figuring things out.

By July 2018, I had about $1,200 in my checking account and decided to try my luck in NYC and moved on a whim. I eventually accrued $4.5k in credit card debt. I found my first 'real job' a couple months later month, which paid $52k/year. I was at this job for about 10 months, I then got an opportunity to work at a creative agency, which paid me $65k. The thing I didn't realize was that the agency was really small, so my health insurance was higher in cost and company doesn't have a 401k. To mitigate the high insurance, I am independently paying $195 for catastrophic insurance. I was supposed to get a raise this past June, but every salary in my company was cut 20% because of the pandemic until the end of the year. This has made me look and reassess my budget.

I didn't get serious about my finances until the beginning of this year. In less than two years I have gone from -$4.5k to $25k (not including a loaned $2k to someone). My net worth is still negative due to federal student loans of $40k.

I am a photographer, and one of the only ones I know that is still making an income, this makes me naturally paranoid. How I should allocate my money and how I should be spending towards student loans. How am I even doing financially considering everything. I've always felt like I am playing catch up to my peers as I got a late start to my career.

I currently have $25k cash (not including 2k I gave to someone as a loan), which I have allocated $12k into an investment account, (I moved my savings from HSY account to a fidelity brokerage account because the savings rates are currently at 1 percent and I'd rather put it in funds). I have $13.5k in my checking, $6k which I will move into a Roth IRA through Fidelity. In terms of my student loan debt, I have $40k. From what I've read, I know low interest rate loans are not completely terrible. I just want to know how much I should be keeping liquid and how much I should be paying to rid of my federal loans. I am very new to financial literacy and just want to ensure I am maximizing and doing the best I can. This is what I have managed to save since moving to NYC in July 2018 (Full-time work since Sept 2018).

Cash on hand: \~$25.5K

Broken down:

\- $13.5K in checking

\- $12K in brokerage account (have invested $4,750 so far in mutual funds, ETFs, and some stocks)

Federal Student Loans: \~40K, no credit card debt

Income Pre April: $65K gross (not including year end bonuses)

Income Post April until end of year : $52K gross

investing,Recent Surge in SLV?,"I got into SLV back in March at around $11.60. My rationale was as follows:

1. It dropped a lot due to a liquidity crunch that would be addressed by the federal reserve.

2. As an asset with industrial uses, it wouldn't drop much more.

3. I was expecting stagflation due to a combination of massive stimulus and business interruptions. precious metals have always performed well during stagflation, and also performed well during the drastic fed actions post 2009.

Seeing all of this, silver seemed like a good asset for preservation of capital as well as a speculative one as well. While traditionally a non yielding asset which makes it a poor investment relative to equities, when equities are seeing declining earnings or losing money yet retaining value, precious metals seemed a lot more appealing.


I wake up this morning and see SLV is at $19.70. Does anyone know what is driving today's surge? It seems that federal reserve QE is slowing down, and inflation is still relatively low.

What would you do in this situation? Part of me wants to take profits, but on the other hand, there's not really anything else good to invest in, and I still worry cash is vulnerable to inflation. Part of me is waiting for stock valuations to decline again, but I have a feeling that won't happen now that most of the uncertainty is gone, and I need to take profits eventually since silver is not a long term investment.

personalfinance,Paying off loans in forbearance vs increased savings,"Hi all! Been reading through r/personalfinance for a while and love all the great advice. I was hoping to be able to have you all help me out with my financial situation.

I'm a medical resident in my 2nd year out of 4 years of residency. I am married, and my partner is a practicing healthcare professional (not physician). Our current combined income is around $100k pre-tax, but our income will increase significantly to about 200-240k pre-tax after I am done with residency . I have 220k in federal loans at 5.5% for which I am currently paying the minimum in a REPAYE plan as I am hoping on forgiveness through PSLF in the future - I have been diligent about staying on top of all of those requirements. Even if PSLF falls through, I would have the ability to pay off these loans with my attending salary in about 4 years.

My partner has about $44k in federal loans at varying interest rates from 3.4-6.8%. We are working on paying off these loans as quickly as possible, and we should have them paid off by the end of 2021 based on our current rate of saving and paying off loans. We also put into each of our 401k to achieve the match provided by our employers. We are not currently saving anything into a Roth IRA, but we have agreed it is more important for us in terms of our mental health to get his loans paid off as quickly as possible.

My question comes about in regards to a set of private loans I have in addition to my federal loans. I have $32k in loans I took out through a unique situation with where I did medical school. These loans are locked in at 5% and are in forbearance until I am done with residency in June 2023 and not accumulating any interest until then. After paying off my partner's federal loans, I am wondering if I should start paying off these private loans which will not accumulate interest until 2023, or rather start increasing savings for retirement, as I know this will start accumulating interest immediately. It is also a weird situation in that my salary will increase by about 3x its current rate when I become an attending, which will be the same time these loans start accruing interest.

I'd appreciate any and all feedback on this situation. Thanks!!",finance

stocks,Buffet on predicting interest rates and the stock market,"From a recent 2020 Yahoo finance interview:

*""Charlie and I, we believe in trying to focus on what's knowable and important. Now, interest rates are important, but we don't think they're knowable... my circle of competence doesn't include being able to predict interest rates a day from now, a year from now or five years from now... So, I say, can I function without knowing that? Same thing with predicting what a business is going to do, or what the stock market is going to do - I can't do any of those things. But that doesn't mean I can't do well investing over time.""*

Why does it seem to me that investors tend to overemphasize:

- Macro (trying to anticipate interest rate changes, recessions, etc.)
- Valuing the stock market as a whole (""stocks are too expensive now so I'm not buying anything"")
- Trying to predict the future in general (business, consumer and secular trends)

As an example, consider NCR vs SQ. It's obvious that Square is the future and NCR is the past. So a ""futurist"" investor will buy SQ regardless of the price. An investor who thinks that the stock market is overvalued and/or that we're already in or at least headed to a major retail recession will buy neither.

IMHO, a better approach would be to study NCR as a company (customer base, products, earnings, assets, debt etc.) and to assess their management's ability to compete with Square.

You may not be a Buffet-fan like I am. You may think that Buffet was past his prime 10-20 years ago and that the stoolpresidente is the guy to follow now. I have no issue with that. But given Buffet's historical record, I would pay heed when he says there's no point in trying to predict interest rates or the stock market as a whole.

P.S. I have no recommendation wrt SQ vs NCR, I just used them as an example.",finance

**If we buy cash:** We will put the entire mortgage payment amount directly into an investment account each month instead.

**Final assumption:** We'll be somewhat conservative with the investment returns, assuming an average annual return of 10% over 30 years, and we won't touch it in either scenario for 30 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly payment towards house or investments:** $898.09

**Amount saved in 30 years in buy cash scenario:** $2,030,120.19

**Amount saved in 30 years in finance scenario:** $3,753,690.78

&amp;#x200B;

**The bottom line:** you will have paid more than **$1.7M** over 30 years for peace of mind in your home situation if you buy in cash.  In monthly terms, you've given up **$4,787.70 per month**.  Well over 5x your monthly payment amount.

That's with a sub prime interest rate (for the time), you investing your ENTIRE mortgage payment every month, a year's worth of emergency fund payments bearing no interest for 30 years, and a conservative market outlook.  If we adjust the market outlook to the historic 14% average annual return over 30 years, you're now forgoing $7.3M dollars over 30 years, or over 20k per month!!

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said at the start, risk aversion is a personal choice, but I feel like a lot of people have an unhealthy relationship with debt.  Its seen as an evil burden, when that's not at all what it is.  It's not your friend, it's not your enemy, it's just a financial tool that you may want to become comfortable with wielding. This aversion to debt can contribute greatly to keeping people from moving up in economic class and being comfortable in their retirement. Change your relationship with debt, see yourself as making the sound financial decision, and maybe that mental benefit of having no debt will wane.

personalfinance,Removing PMI vs. Investing,"Hey all,

My wife and I just sold our first house and bought our new house in a slightly roundabout way to optimize mortgage rates - now I'm trying to figure out the best use of the proceeds from the sale. 

When we bought our new house, we had the equity in the old house to put 20% down, but ended up only putting 15% down at closing to prevent the interest rate from going up. (We locked our original rate at 5% down, going above 15% would have caused them to re-evaluate rates and it would go up). So now I have the remaining proceeds from the house in my savings account and I'm trying to decide if it's better to invest it, or pay the remaining 5% to remove PMI. 

Here's the relevant info:  
\- Money to be used: $28,000  
\- PMI: $59.50/mo  
\- Interest Rate: 3%  
\- There's no fee to remove PMI or recast the loan after the payment is made. 

The calculation I did was that the return from PMI savings is approximately 2.6%/yr. (720/28000). Add that with the 3% saved on interest and it's an effective return of \~5.6%. A guaranteed return of 5.6% seems like the obvious choice here - anyone disagree?",finance

Do we have any options other than massive interest rate private loans or saving up to buy a house with cash? Co-signer/borrower is also very likely out of the question.

I've seen in a few articles mention information about Fannie Mae's HomeReady Mortgages and how W-2 dispensary employees might be eligible under this type of mortgage. Does it all come down to the lender?

I am 33 and make around 110k-120k per year before taxes in San Diego, CA. I qualify under the cares act to pull out of my 401k &amp; 457b plans without the 10% penalty.

Current assets are 100k between my three retirement accounts (401k, 457b, and roth ira) and a rental condo that's worth $330,000 that I owe $187,000 on. I also have around 25k in my emergency fund in cash. I'm currently renting a place that only costs me $1000 per month which is why I'm renting out my condo since that cash flows $350 per month. I also have a pension at work that will pay me 3% of my salary per year that I work that I can start drawing from at the age of 50. No debt besides the mortgage on the rental condo and no children. 

The idea is to pull the 65k out of my two accounts and possibly the 35k out of my roth ira as well and buy a rental property either in the San Diego area or somewhere within driving distance. Depending on where the numbers make sense with a 20% down payment.

I always hear it's dumb to steal from your future but that's only if you cash out your accounts and do something stupid like buy a new car or some other consumption. I would be ""stealing"" from my future to make a lateral move into something else for my future. I could either buy something now and take advantage of the super low interest rates or simply hold the cash and wait to see if the housing market drops at all in the next few years.  

Also curious if its smart to just pay all the taxes in 2020 that this triggers or spread it out over the 3 years the cares act allows for.

Thoughts? Other ideas?

Given Boeing's troubled past, in an event, they need more $$$ and the government steps in to take control (similar to GE in 2008-09), I understand that there's a chance shareholders will get wiped out, but what happens to bondholders? Would I still receive my principal + interest? Lastly, given that there are still investment-grade bonds available that yield higher than CD's (with a maturity of 2024 or earlier), why do people put their money in CD's rather than bonds? is it because bonds aren't as easy to understand or rather interesting?

There's this language from the contract:

The System stays at your Home, the person buying your Home does not make any Monthly Payments and has only to comply with the non-Monthly Payment portions of this Lease.

I was thinking, maybe add the buy-out price to the total cost of the house (interest rates are super low; 2.75%), but does this language allow for that? I see ""use"" of the system but not ""ownership"".

investing,European Union Leaders Agree on Spending Plan for Recovery,"From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;European Union leaders agreed on a €1.8 trillion ($2.06 trillion) spending package aimed at containing an [unprecedented economic downturn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-suffers-record-contraction-steeper-than-u-s-11588242162) by resorting to new measures that could ultimately deepen the bloc’s economic integration.  
&gt;  
&gt;The package, built around the bloc’s first-ever issuance of hundreds of billions of euros of common debt, came together early Tuesday after four days of talks among the bloc’s 27 leaders—the bloc’s longest summit in 20 years. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were forced to compromise on what would be spent and how much would be handed out in grants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaders ultimately agreed on a €750 billion recovery plan. Of that, €390 billion will be offered in grants and the rest will come in the form of loans. That is down from €500 billion recently proposed by Brussels. The leaders also agreed on a multiyear EU budget of over €1 trillion that will run from next year to 2027.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We did it. Europe is strong. Europe is united,” European Council President Charles Michel, who hosted the summit, said in a press conference Tuesday morning. “These were of course difficult negotiations in very difficult times for all Europeans. This is a good deal. This is a strong deal.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The agreement represents a significant step in the EU’s move toward a more genuine fiscal union. Some have hailed it as the [bloc’s Hamiltonian moment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hamilton-is-hot-in-europe-the-debt-policy-not-the-musical-11592493271), referring to Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, who had the federal government absorb the debts of U.S. states. Some economists, however, say the cash may only make a modest difference to revive depressed economies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU deal will need to be approved by the parliaments of member states, which could prove contentious. Under the recovery plan, the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, will for the first time issue debt on a large scale to fund grants and loans for countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The aim is partly to boost Europe’s economic recovery from the new year, while allowing Italy, Spain, Greece and others to increase government spending now without fearing that already high national debt will rise to unsustainable levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the bailout plan, Italy’s national debt risks ballooning to a level that could endanger the euro. Wealthier northern countries decided that helping Rome now was preferable to facing a currency crisis later. The recovery plan grants must be paid out by 2023 and loans allocated by then. Repayments will take place over decades, ending in 2058, leaders agreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the new agreement, the eurozone’s economy will shrink by up to 9% this year, according to several estimates, before rebounding somewhat next year. While EU unemployment sparked by the crisis has been abated by government support programs, many economists predict an upsurge later this year as those measures expire.  
&gt;  
&gt;European economies have resumed activity in recent weeks, following a three-month induced coma to squelch the pandemic. But significant portions of the EU economy remain moribund, most notably [tourism and related service businesses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-tourist-hot-spots-suffer-as-u-s-big-spenders-are-told-to-stay-away-11594132862). World-wide [travel bans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-opens-up-to-some-travelers-but-not-americans-11593524652) mean that the normally vast numbers of Asian and American visitors who each summer pump billions of euros into the EU aren’t coming this year, exacerbating woes in Southern European countries reliant on tourism.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alongside the recovery plan, the regular trillion-euro EU budget will pump money into infrastructure and other types of public investment starting next year, while helping the bloc meet its ambitious climate targets. The bloc has already agreed to a €540 billion coronavirus emergency package of loans to governments and businesses and funding for job-support plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tuesday’s agreement represented a revival of the postwar Franco-German alliance, which had flagged over recent years, with Ms. Merkel having repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Macron’s push for deeper economic integration in the eurozone.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think it’s a very important message to the rest of Europe—but also beyond Europe, that this very special entity, this very special construct of 27 member states of the European Union...is actually able to act together and has proven that it is able to act together,” said Ms. Merkel in a press conference alongside Mr. Macron.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet others expressed disappointment that the plan’s ambition was reduced by a group of fiscally conservative countries—led by the Netherlands—that had wanted a plan focused around loans, not grants. Those countries argued the plan risked turning the EU into a wealth-transfer union that would bolster domestic euroskeptic opposition and could breach current rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the deal was secured Tuesday morning, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the recovery plan wouldn’t convert the EU into a wealth-transfer union because the Netherlands and its allies had ensured it was a time-limited, one-off program launched for the health crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte—who clashed with Mr. Rutte over the size of the grants and the conditions to be attached to loans—said the accord, despite the reduced amount of grants, was a major step forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are satisfied we have launched an ambitious recovery plan,” he told reporters. “It’s a historic moment for Europe. It’s a historic moment for Italy.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of the coronavirus, the summit was the first in-person meeting of EU leaders since February. Extensive measures were taken to prevent it from turning into a super-spreading event, but as talks wore on, fatigued leaders put aside social-distancing and mask-wearing instructions in a push for a deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a Friday morning start, negotiations nearly broke down that evening. There were tense exchanges after dinner Saturday between France and Germany and the Dutch-led group, and several leaders rounded on Mr. Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, during Sunday night’s discussions. However, around dawn Monday, an agreement was reached on the amount of grants that should be given under the plan. Once that fight was settled, the rest of the package fell into place.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Rutte also insisted that member states be allowed to hold up payments to other countries if they don’t push economic reform plans. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban opposed plans to link some EU budget spending to a member country’s upholding of democratic principles.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in past years, a deal was made possible only after the EU shelved some of its more ambitious, long-term spending plans on issues like the digital economy, security and defense and migration. Despite EU efforts to gradually kill off the special budget repayments enjoyed by a few countries, the final package saw the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria walk away with larger so-called rebates.",finance
Bitcoin,The Federal Reserve,[removed],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The Federal Reserve,"The Federal Reserve. The Fed.

A source of numerous memes.

A topic that has recently reached the critical mass of mainstream consciousness.

A question that always lingers in the air is...who controls the Fed?

Before we can answer that deep question we need some context: what does the Fed do?

Officially...and unofficially.

&amp;#x200B;

Officially, the Fed has four main responsibilities:

1. Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.
2. Supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.
3. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets.
4. Providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions, and foreign official institutions, and playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payments systems.

&amp;#x200B;

***“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”***

Those are the words of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.

Unofficially, the Fed enriches the top 0.1% in a process known as the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), which basically states that money printing itself increases inequality via asset price inflation.

***Moreover, we currently have a situation whereby corporations run by executives with HUGE stock packages borrow money from Fed-fed banks for roughly free, buy back stock - thus boosting its price, then sell their own shares, using the proceeds to ""diversify"" into other assets (namely other stocks), expecting the Fed to keep the asset-inflation scheme going indefinitely.***

The recent spate of bailouts has highlighted the severity of the situation.

The Fed's policy of subsidising interest rates has incentivised corporations to borrow cheap money and buy back shares instead of saving cash for a rainy day.

The executives pocketing multi million dollar bonuses via this financial engineering should be chastised, but ultimately it is the Fed that facilitates this - just like it was the Fed who incentivised greedy bankers leading up to the '08 mortgage crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand who controls the Fed, we must go back to the Fed's formative years.

The year is 1910.

The month is December.

Senator Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.

As an aside, his daughter Abby actually married John D. Rockefeller Jr, son of the famous John D. Rockefeller.

Aldrich and six other men were about to embark on a journey to Jekyll Island, an island off the coast of Georgia, where there was an exclusive resort which counted the Morgans, the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts as members. 

These six men were:

Paul Warburg (a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.);

Frank Vanderlip (president of National City Bank - now known as Citibank - and a former Treasury official);

Benjamin Strong (vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and the future founding chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York);

Henry Davison (a partner at J.P. Morgan);

Charles Norton (President of J.P. Morgan's First National Bank of New York);

and A.P. Andrew, who coincidentally was an economics professor at Harvard where he taught FDR, who would later sign Executive Order 6102 (otherwise known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1933).

Aldrich chose the attendees for their expertise, but he knew their ties to Wall Street could arouse suspicion about their motives and threaten the bill’s political passage.

So he went to great lengths to keep the meeting secret, adopting the ruse of a duck hunting trip and instructing the men to come one at a time to a train terminal in New Jersey, where they could board his private train car.

Once aboard, the men used only first names to prevent the staff from learning their identities.

For decades after, the group referred to themselves as the “First Name Club.”

A member of the exclusive Jekyll Island Club, most likely J.P. Morgan himself, arranged for the group to use the club’s facilities.

Munsey’s Magazine described this exclusive club as “the richest, the most exclusive, the most inaccessible” club in the world.

According to Frank Vanderlip:

***“I was secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator. I do not feel it is an exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.***

***Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.”***

The bankers initially drafted the Federal Reserve as the “Aldrich Bill,” but when it came to Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich’s name, became suspicious, and decided against passing the bill.

To make it sound more official, they decided to re-brand the bill as “The Federal Reserve Bill.” 

Three years after their historic meeting at Jekyll Island, The Federal Reserve Act was singed into law on December 23rd 1913, and with that a small group of bankers had the monopoly over creation of American money.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve Act was originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks, however on February 25th, 1927, it was extended indefinitely.

This proved crucial, as the sentiment in 1933 (nearing the end of the original 20 year charter) was not exactly positive with regards to the Fed.

Now the good thing is that, since then, the Fed have been held to account by [rigorous audits and comprehensive investigative procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ)...

&amp;#x200B;

On June 4th, 1963, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates.

This was the first of a series of moves to take control of US money back from the Federal Reserve by giving greater power to the Treasury.

On November 22nd, 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

&amp;#x200B;

1861 was the beginning of the Civil War.

Abraham Lincoln was short of money to finance the North's war effort and went to the bankers of New York, who agreed to lend him money at interest rates varying from 24 to 36 percent.

Lincoln refused, but he still needed to solve his money problem.

Colonel Dick Taylor came to the rescue and put the solution to him:

***“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes, and pay your soldiers with them, and go ahead and win your war with them also.”***

This is what Lincoln did: and on February 25, 1862, Congress passed the first Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issuance of $150 million greenbacks.

(These Treasury notes were called “Greenbacks” by the people because they were printed with green ink on the back.)

***Lincoln called these Greenbacks “the greatest blessing the American people have ever had.”*** 

A blessing for all, except the bankers, since it was putting an end to their racket (i.e. the stealing of the nation's credit and issuing interest-bearing money).

So they did everything possible to destroy these Greenbacks and sabotage Lincoln's work.

Lincoln said:

***“I have two great enemies, the Southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. And of the two, the bankers are my greatest foe.”***

Lincoln was re-elected President in 1864, and he made it quite clear that he would attack the power of the bankers once the civil war was over. The civil war ended on April 9, 1865...

Lincoln was assassinated six days later, on April 15.

The central bank in each country is the legal entity that manages the nation’s money supply and can lend money, with interest of course, to the government and other private banks in the country. This is how it all works:

1. When the government needs more money, they ask the treasury department for money by issuing an IOU or government bond, which is a bond issued by the national government with a promise to pay periodic interest payments and to repay the face value on the maturity date.
2. The Treasury (an executive department of government) receives the bond from the government and forwards it to the nation’s Central Bank.
3. The Central Bank (a privately owned bank and the entity that owns the monetary system of the nation) then writes a check to the commercial banks in the country for the value of the bond and authorises them to create this new money. This central bank, of course, just invents money out of thin air.

For more clarity, we can refer to ""Putting it Simply"", released in 1984 by the Public Services Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

***“When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our accounts to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money”***

4. The commercial banks then type numbers on a screen and create money out of nothing. At this exchange at the private banks, money is *officially* created and can be used to pay government bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Another part of this money creation system happens at the commercial banks.

***Every time you take out a loan, banks simply type in some numbers digitally in your account and charge you interest on it. So basically, each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn’t use other people’s deposited money to loan to you. It creates new money by typing digits into a computer.***

***97% of all money is generated that way. Only 3% is the physical paper cash and coins that we carry.***

Moreover, commercial banks lend out up to 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves; a practice known as fractional reserve lending.

To demonstrate how absurdly the system is currently leveraged, that [reserve requirement has recently been cut to zero.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) Yes, zero.

&amp;#x200B;

So who controls the Fed?

Well, an international Cartel of Central Bankers, more ruthless and more intelligent than Escobar or El Chapo ever were.

A Cartel who have effectively perfected a form of modern slavery; with debt taking the place of chains...and Central Bankers playing the role of Masters.

I close with a quote from Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's father:

***""Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home.""***

personalfinance,"21 years old, graduating college soon, and have $10k saved. Looking for general advice.","Hi, as stated in the title I am looking for some advice/guidance for my current situation. I have more money saved than ever before and I'm slated to graduate by the end of this fall. I consulted the common topics section of the PF wiki and am looking for some more specific advice in the era of COVID-19.

 I go to a large state university that's close to a major US city. My on-campus job temporarily shut down due to COVID and is reopening in early August. I qualified for UI benefits, and by the time I can go back to work I'll have just over 10k in my main checking account with 2.5k in a Roth IRA I started freshman year. I have one semester left of undergrad (not sure what I'm doing after) with monthly expenses coming around $800/mo for the next 4 months (rent/food/fun).

Realistically I can live comfortably for the next semester with 4k since I'll be working again and won't have many expenses with travel or parking (semester is almost entirely online). Saying I have 6k to move elsewhere, should I put most of that into my Roth IRA? Or look for a short term high yield investment? What about buying bonds or CDs? I want to avoid having it all sit in my main student checking account since it has a 0% interest rate.Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"My car broke down, and I’m not sure what option is smartest to replace it.","Some context:

I am a 24F grad student making about $30k per year working part time. My husband is 25M and makes about $60k working full time. We’ll probably each be making about $75k in the next 5 years, and we don’t have any kids or plan on having any for the foreseeable future. We rent an apartment in South Carolina (US).

I bought my first car, a 2002 Civic, for $3000 in cash four years ago. It now has 200k miles on it and consistently overheats and breaks down. My husband is savvy with this stuff, and I don’t remember exactly what he said the problem was (something with the coolant system and something with a head gasket), but he says it would cost more to fix than my car is worth.

Fortunately, I’m currently working from home, so I have time to evaluate my options and save up before making any decisions. I currently have no savings because being a student is fun that way.

I have a bit of credit card debt (~$3500) due to unexpected medical bills from last year. I’m currently making the minimum payments each month. I *could* be paying more each month, but I’m opting to wait until after I graduate to really attack it. I know I’m paying more interest as a result, but I don’t really care since the overall amount is still low enough that I won’t have trouble paying it off when I‘m working full time, and choosing to not stress about it right now gives me the mental bandwidth I need to finish out my degree strong (only two more semesters to go).

Of course, I’ll also have to start paying back my student loans when I graduate, which is a lot ($50k), and I want to pay off those as fast as possible too, ideally within 5-10 years.

With that in mind, I know that I can currently afford about $200-300 per month without cutting it too close with my other bills, but that won’t necessarily be the case when I’m paying back my student loans and cc debt, even if my salary goes up as much as I expect it to. I also know that you’re not supposed to evaluate the monthly payment primarily, but I just don’t know how to measure what I can afford by any other metric.

Whether I pay for a cheap car in cash or put a down payment on a nicer car, I know I’m going to have to come up with a chunk of change somehow. That’s what I’m currently working on. In the meantime, I’m trying to decide what to put it toward. I don’t want anything flashy. I just want a car that gets good gas mileage that I don’t have to think about apart from the regular oil changes and stuff. I loved my Civic, but it just hit its limit. I would actually like to get another Civic or something similar, just a newer one so it’ll last longer this time.

Assume I’m able to save up at least $3000 for a down payment, which is my plan. I have no idea what overall price I should be looking for, interest rates, loan term, etc. I’ve tried researching this stuff, but every time I start looking at actual cars, I panic that I’m gonna make a stupid decision. I almost want to just get another temporary car for cash, but I’m just so sick of dealing with an old, struggling car, especially with my frequent doctors appointments. I need reliable transportation.

My husband and I both have good credit (based on the metric on the Experian website). I’m sure he would co-sign on a loan with me if it meant I could get better interest rates or something, but if that’s not a thing, then I’d prefer to do it myself. I just really don’t know what in the world I’m doing.

Help. :(",finance
personalfinance,Are there any legitimate ways to make some quick cash online? Considering taking out a loan with OneMain but I really don't want to do that.,"Not going to give a long backstory but long story short, this pandemic has absolutely screwed me financially. I had been an unemployed full time student for about three months when it hit, so that I wasn't eligible for unemployment, and many jobs I'd been applying for have dried up completely. 

Over the course of the past eight months I've spent through my emergency fund and also taken on significant debt, in addition to the debt I already had from an emergency surgery last year. At the time I didn't know how medical bills worked, and the hospital kept threatening me with collections, so I prioritized those payments and paid bare minimums on everything else while my cc debt continued to collect interest. 

 I have about $20k in debt, spread across three credit cards. The total I pay on them is around $860/month, and it's a tiny bit more than minimums on each. I wanted to round each payment to the nearest $10 so I could easily keep track of them. 

In the meantime, I've been applying for any remote job I can find, and I managed to land a full time contract position that pays decently and starts next week. Problem is, it doesn't pay until September 1st (and every subsequent 1st of the month after that). I still need to pay rent in ten days and I'm $250 short, and I'd still need about $1k at some point over the next month to pay my CC bills and car insurance. I'm pretty much covered on food (bought a lot of rice and beans when people started talking about supply lines going down back in March). 

Currently the only company that will give me a loan (because my credit usage is so high) is a company called OneMain, for $1500, which I've been trying to avoid because the interest rates on this loan are around 35%. 

However, here's where my situation is unique and why I don't believe this question fits on r/povertyfinance. In January of 2021 and January of 2022 I'll be receiving two respective $9k payments (for a total of $18k) because a trust I'm a part of is being dissolved over the next couple years, so I'll be able to tackle most of this debt within the next three years. 

I've been making $1-5/day doing surveys and selling stuff on Redbubble for the past week but it's dawning on me that this is unsustainable and I need to figure out some way to make $250 by August 1st. 

Any tips?",finance

**Why should I care**? Research and development activities are regarded as one of the most influencing factors of the future of a country. Large investments in research can yield a tremendous outcome in terms of a country’s overall wealth and strength. However, public financial resources of countries are often limited which calls for a wise and targeted investment. Scientific publications are considered as one of the main outputs of research investment. Although the general trend of scientific publications is increasing, a detailed analysis is required to monitor the research trends and assess whether they are in line with the top research priorities of the country.

Such focused monitoring can shed light on scientific activities evolution as well as the formation of new research areas, thus helping governments to adjust priorities, if required. But monitoring the output of the funded research manually is not only very expensive and difficult, it is also subjective. Using structural topic models, in this paper we evaluated the trends in academic research performed by federally funded Canadian researchers during the time-frame of 2000–2018, covering more than 140,000 research publications. The proposed approach makes it possible to objectively and systematically monitor research projects, or any other set of documents related to research activities such as funding proposals, at large-scale. Our results confirm the accordance between the performed federally funded research projects and the top research priorities of Canada.

personalfinance,Pay student loans aggressively vs. PSLF and start retirement saving,"Hey everyone! I’m a recent graduate from pharmacy school in the US and just started a 2 year residency program (essentially less pay to continue training, then will make pharmacist salary). I’ve been doing a lot of research to figure out what my best financial plan should be in terms of saving for retirement and paying off my student loans. I’ve thought through a lot of different options, but wanted to pose them to some other minds to see what others think makes the most sense. I’ve included what I think are the most important pieces, but feel free to ask if I’ve left something out. 

29 years old, not married

Student loans: $150,000 (all federal direct loans, interest rates ranging from 5.31-7.6% - weighted interest rate 6.26%; the 7.6% is my only grad PLUS loan at about $27,500 balance; the rest are direct unsubsidized; grace period ends in November) 

Current cash on hand: \~$9,000 (already opened an Ally high yield savings account and plan to develop a budget at the start of residency and keep \~6 months there for an emergency fund and use the rest for….? Not sure yet – student loans to reduce interest capitalization before grace period ends? Start retirement account? That’s one of the questions) 

Short term goal: purchase a new car in 2 years at the end of residency (would assume \~$30,000; and yes, I do plan to buy new, not used – not up for negotiation in the planning for reasons I won’t get into)

Income: \~$42,000 gross/year for 2 years then anticipate a starting salary around $128,000

* Take home pay during residency: \~$1100 biweekly 
* Current monthly expenses: $1,400? Still figuring out what the new normal is

I do not have access to an employer sponsored retirement account option during residency, and currently do not have an IRA or anything set up – just the cash on hand 

I’m strongly considering PSLF as I intend to work for the government (VA) or other non-profit for my career. My only hesitation with this route is the requirement to be working full-time for the 10 years. It’s hard to predict if that’s what I’m going to want to be doing for time period (or god forbid something happens and I’m unable to).

* If I went the PSLF route, I would be interested in creating an investment account of some sort where I could essentially invest the difference between what I would have paid on a standard repayment plan with what I am paying under income-drive repayment with PSLF to create kind of a “back-up” pot of money that I could pull from and use to pay the balance of my student loans if something went awry with my PSLF plan.

Prior to thinking about PSLF, I had originally made a plan to aggressively pay my student loans with essentially half my take home pay (targeting the smallest loan first then targeting highest interest rate) starting when my grace period ends this fall (aka including during my residency). Following this plan, the loans would be paid off by the end of 2025. However, this plan doesn’t account for putting any money away for retirement (especially during residency – I’d be stretched pretty thin) or saving for a car. 

I guess all of this information boils down to, what combination of paying loans, saving for retirement, and saving for a car makes the most financial sense? What factors might I be overlooking?",finance

Bitcoin,Recently I decided to change all my professional and personal plans. I left my job. I left my friends and family. I left my country. All for Bitcoin. Here is why.,"**Discovering my core values**

I was born and raised in an upper-middle income family in Mexico City under catholic values but turned agnostic as I grew older. I kept the values that made sense, such as the importance of charity and giving back, and threw away the ones that were outdated, such as the focus on guilt as a motivator of change.

As a kid, I remember how conflicting it was to see other kids working in the streets, starving, drugged, and abused. I couldn’t understand why they couldn’t focus on their education the way I did. That planted a seed in my spirit that still grows.

**Seeing in economics hope**

As a teenager, I entered the rabbit hole of economics with hope. Economics seemed to be this mystical force capable of solving the world’s biggest problems: poverty, corruption, global warming, and many more. I knew that the way we were doing economics was wrong and I wanted to change that.

Just think about the horrible things that have been done under the name of communism, such as the Cambodian genocide, or how the United States, the crown jewel of capitalism, makes of fundamental rights, such as healthcare and education, profitable businesses instead of granting everyone equal access to them.

While studying my undergrad, I quickly fell out of love with the idealistic idea of economics as an almighty force that can conquer all evils. I saw how economics was often used as an excuse to force simplistic representations of culture and society into complex problems. I never understood how that approach of thinking about problems in a vacuum could be useful.

**Understanding the power of financial services**

Later in my life, while working as a consultant for McKinsey, I finally understood the importance of financial institutions. They decide who should do business and have access to goods and services and who shouldn’t. And financial institutions don’t grant everyone that right. It was clear to me that that was a problem that needed fixing. That’s why I devoted so much time studying this industry back then.

I came to Berkeley to Business School more out of inertia than out of will. I was sponsored by McKinsey and had an offer to go back. I didn’t know exactly what to do with the experience, but I knew I wanted to keep exploring financial services. During my MBA, I heard about Bitcoin in a serious academic environment for the first time and it immediately caught my interest.

Via Berkeley-SkyDeck, UC Berkeley's accelerator, I heard about lastbit (lastbit.io) for the first time. I read everything I could about the project and about the founder, this cool, heavy-metal lover, who wanted to change the world with the disruptive power of Bitcoin. I could see myself in him. I had to meet him. After failing to meet him in person at an event, I just cold emailed him praying for him to answer. He did.

That’s how I came in contact with Prashanth for the first time, this impressive 25-year-old genius who managed to get Charlie Lee on board of his project with little more than a prototype. There’s a reason why he managed to do this. Today Bitcoin is almost impossible to spend. With Prashanth’s his solution, anyone will be able to swipe a card or tap their phone and pay with Bitcoin instantly anywhere where they are able to pay with their credit card today. Something not so long ago possible only in bitcoiners’ dreams. Through Prashanth I finally understood what Bitcoin really is. It blew my mind.

**Unveiling the real meaning of Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is not an investment asset, it’s the possibility of a new social contract. Bitcoin is a decentralized, transparent, and auditable network to store and transmit value to which everyone in the world can have access to. This presents a real opportunity to redefine money, which today is inherently centralized, first by central banks, and then by financial institutions. The centralization of money has at least three critical problems that Bitcoin solves.

First, there is a macroeconomic problem that has to do with monetary policy and that today with the COVID-19 economic crisis is more relevant than ever. Money is supposed to be a reflection of real economic value, but some central banks print money arbitrarily. Bitcoin’s monetary supply is limited by design. Second, centralized financial services are discriminatory and don’t allow free access to everyone. Bitcoin is universal and free. This means that for the first time in human history, everyone will be able to participate in the global economy. And participation is the pillar of democracy. Third, central authorities control private information. The recent attacks to high profile account on Twitter illustrate how vulnerable private information is when stored in centralized networks. Bitcoin allows people to have full ownership and control of their personal and financial information, protecting both their identity and their wealth.

As such, Bitcoin emerged in front of my eyes as a way to instrument basic democratic principles in a way in which everyone can have equal representation. Money as we know it will soon be a thing of the past because money as we know it not fair nor egalitarian and now people can choose.

worldpolitics,"""START III extension: mission impossible""","The process of negotiations between the US and Russia on START III continues, but this may simply be the “beginning of the end” in international arms control practice.

The US presidential administration is currently negotiating China's accession to negotiations on a new treaty on the reduction of advancing armed forces. START 3 expires on February 5, 2021: there is little time left to update such a complex document, not to mention the preparation of a new treaty with the participation of a third power - China.

The US President's special envoy for arms control Marshall Billingsley is stepping up pressure in Beijing, stating that the success or failure of the negotiation process depends entirely on the participation or non-participation of the PRC. The insistence on China's involvement shows the frivolity of the Trump administration's intentions. Beijing has repeatedly refused to take part in negotiations on a limited nuclear arsenal versus Russian or American. For comparison, the Russian Federation has about 6.5 thousand nuclear warheads, the United States has about 6 thousand, and the PRC has 320. Given the tension in Sino-American relations in the South China Sea and in the economic sphere, the participation of the Celestial Empire becomes almost impossible.

Russia offered to participate in the new treaty to its American allies - France and Great Britain, which are related to 290 and 215 warheads. There are four other countries with small nuclear arsenals in the world: India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. The American response was naturally negative.

The head of state and the deputy foreign minister simply put forward START III to give them time to think and a possible addition to the treaty.

It is obvious that the United States intends to refuse to participate in START III. The Russian nuclear arsenal is, of course, a prerequisite for the defense of the United States. The stalemate over strategic offensive arms and the termination of other treaties (in the open skies and the INF) suggests that bilateral agreements on the control of nuclear armed forces between the US and the US may be a relic of the Cold War and are coming to an end.",energy

Chainlink,Nexo is insolvent due to Chainlink's recent rise?,"""Looking into Nexo's business model it's increasingly clear to me that they are insolvent due to chainlink's recent rise.

A brief introduction to how these crypto deposit/lending sites generally work, or are supposed to work.

You deposit a cryptocurrency. Someone else wants to borrow it against their own cryptocurrency as collateral (reasons typically are to get some funds without selling their own crypto, or for margin trading). The borrower pays an interest rate, the lender receives a lower interest rate and the middleman (in this case it would be nexo) takes a large cut of the difference.

A decentralized version of this is Aave. Centralised versions are crypto.com and nexo.

Typically stablecoins have the highest borrow and lending interest rate, because demand to borrow them is highest. Next is typically bitcoin/ethereum, and most ERC tokens are very low because there's little demand to borrow them. Chainlink has been close to 0 on the likes of Aave as well as binance for months, while nexo pays 5%.

Now, nexo's business model is a bit different. While they take deposits in LINK and pay 5% on them, it seems they do not lend out LINK or other cryptocurrencies. Instead they lend out fiat.

This means they are not lending out assets deposited by other users, like Aave and binance. Instead it would mean they are selling user deposits to fiat and then lending out said fiat.

Chainlink has been trading as low as $1.8 this year and mostly in the $3-5 range. No doubt chainlink deposits are very popular with nexo, there are lots of long term holders and the 5% interest rate they claim to pay is much higher than elsewhere. So this likely means they've taken a lot of LINK deposits and sold them to fiat.

So why is this a problem?

Well the way this business SHOULD work is:

User A deposits 1 BTC. User B borrows 1 BTC. A receives 1%, B pays 2%, and the middleman/nexo would receive the 1% cut.

Nexo doesn't care which way the price of bitcoin moves. It has one bitcoin as a receivable (that which B has borrowed) and one bitcoin as a payable (that which A has deposited). It's overall exposure is zero.

However, it's clear that nexo's business model is:

User A deposits 1000 LINK Nexo sells 1000 LINK for $5 each User B borrows $5000

So now, nexo has 1000 LINK as a payable, and 5000 USD as a receivable.

As you can see, nexo is essentially opening a large synthetic short on every asset that is deposited with them.

Now LINK goes to $8. Suddenly nexo has $5000 in receivables and $8000 in payables. Now consider this but with millions of dollars of LINK deposits. Nexo is now insolvent.

Look at the site yourself (if you trust it, I understand if you don't). You can confirm all this yourself. Their business model is not sustainable. This is the first crack. And absolutely explains why they have released the fraudulent short report. It's because they are close to insolvent.

Do you think it's a coincidence that they recently stopped paying interest in LINK and are paying in USD?

A corollary of the above is that your LINK deposits , or any deposits on nexo are not safe. They likely do not have enough LINK to honour all deposits.

Nexo likely received a load of chainlink deposits. Possibly millions of LINK. Chainlink has an attribute that there are lots of long term holders who would all love to receive interest on their LINK. The recent price increase in LINK means nexo can’t afford to pay back all their LINK deposits.

They likely sell LINK as it comes in. Which means they’ve been selling as low as $1.80 and are essentially short since then.

personalfinance,Advice for setting up beginning personal finance accounts,"Am a zoomer so am totally open to having multiple financial institutions managing specific aspects of financial affairs (especially if it saves/makes me more money). I am fairly organized when I try to be, so figuring out the real options I have for choosing the best financial institutions for specific needs is what matters most to me. Once everything is setup and running, I don't mind having to tap a phone screen a few extra times to manage a bunch of accounts.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First I planned on saving enough wages for covering 6 months  of expenses for an emergency fund.

I was planning on using Ally Bank as it seems like an overall well rounded institution for a savings account and central hub for all financial operations. I know there are several other banks that offer similar APY and other benefits, what makes Ally Bank stand out for me is that they allow for unlimited ACH transactions between institutions and cover $10 of ATM charges. If there are any suggestions for other institutions with similar or better benefits, let me know!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Then I wanted to begin putting payments into Roth IRA. What are some good institutions for Roth IRA accounts? What should I look for in a Roth IRA held by an institution? Are the investments I make the only thing that matter? Or are there different benefits of the Roth IRA accounts held by different organizations that I am missing?

I would then move onto investing in my 401k, but it isn't totally clear if I will ever actually have a job that offers a 401k or fund matching. So this is just up in the air for now.

After maxing out the $6,000 yearly investment for the Roth IRA, I planned on moving into safer, long term trading to gain a  diversified, solid portfolio that will help my retirement along with the savings account and Roth IRA. Then later deal with riskier investments.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So from what I understand certain institutions are best for different kinds of safer, long term investing. I planned on investing with Fidelity, I don't know much about options, but I understand their $0.65 fee per contracts is very middle of the road. Everything else they basically have no fees on: stocks, etfs, funds, etc. but apparently there are ""hidden fees"" when it comes to their etfs/they don't actually have a whole lot of non-commission etfs? (Not exactly sure what that means/ what the deal is here) Is Fidelity even good for all these supposed no fee investments? Or should I look at another company for these kinds of investments (such as stocks, which would be mostly dividends that are reinvested, options, commodities, real estate+properties (and possibly bonds and cds) for reasons I am not thinking of?

So I understand that lots of these investing institutions are using Vanguard index funds, so Vanguard is apparently the best to go to for etfs, but nothing else? As in their fees are way too high for their mutual funds and you should basically be rich if you're using them for anything but etfs? Am I getting this totally wrong, or is this basically all correct?

If so, I would by this point within a single year have an emergency fund within a savings account (Ally Bank), maxed my yearly investment for my Roth IRA &lt;$6,000&gt; (unsure where I would open this account) (and try to invest a decent amount in employer matched 401k if I had one), then have a Fidelity account for mutual funds, Vanguard for etfs, and invest in them decent amounts, then use Fidelity for riskier investments such as stocks (which would be mostly dividends that are reinvested), options (when I learn more about them), commodities, real estate+properties (and possibly bonds and cds). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So on top of doing all this confusing work, there's taxes to think about. Explain to me any troubles I may face with the whole plan so far regarding taxes, and anything I should generally know to not be surprised by/should avoid altogether even if it means changing all of my plan. Retirement accounts, taxes or hidden fees at institutions (like Fidelity or Vanguard) and kinds of trading that could create major tax problems. 

I believed cds to be a good investment when I first learned about them, especially no penalty cds. Then I read about how short capitol gain taxes basically destroy any sort of profit you would earn so they're more or less useless nowadays? As in, even if I wanted to have a higher interest rate for my money by putting it into a no penalty cd, it would probably be better utilized and show more gains in an etf or mutual fund or perhaps even stocks (even though that is riskier, less so for dividend stocks).

If my understanding is correct, the only use I could think of for cds would be putting my emergency fund into no penalty cds and just try to increase it by a slight bit more than the APY offered by a savings account in Ally Bank. If this is correct, this is pretty pathetic, but I suspect I am seriously missing something here.

I am entirely confused by bonds, I remember learning about them when I was young and they seemed so simple. Now they seem more confusing than options! Can someone explain to me how they work to make you a profit and how they are different form treasury notes, if at all. I remember a investment source that I trust said that bonds are basically useless nowadays as well, but I'm not going to just go off a vague memory. I've heard that bonds are useful for cushioning the blow during economic downturns, but I am not an investment tycoon, I won't have thousands of dollars in my portfolio for years most likely. If they're a useful investment, let me know, but bonds usefulness may not apply to me depending on what position the investor is in.

Something that confused the HELL out of me was Roth cds. MAN, I can't wrap my head around this concept and whether it's even worth investing in either. Regardless of Roth cds' usefulness, can someone explain how they work and if they are useless like regular cds or if I'm totally wrong about about everything I just wrote (or partially wrong).

So, coming full circle, what should I look for in a checking account, I would be using a credit card as much as possible to gain a better credit score and cashback, and I am not really the ""getting into debt"" type, unless of course it's for an investment that really calls for it (car, college, house, etc.) I'm not a big fan of miles and other reward programs, I prefer to focus directly on saving and making money, so what is a good debit card then for me? Does it offer a high APY or a good amount of cashback? Either way I won't be using it too much, so perhaps there's some other use I can get out of a debit card and checking account that I'm not really thinking about. Obviously I will need a checking accounts for all the bills I will pay and other monthly transactions that need to be made and Ally Bank, as stated before, will charge fees for more than 6 transactions on a savings account, like most banks. I am open to holding a checking account in a separate institution from Ally Bank.

I know some things about what a good credit card is, basically looking at it as a more serious debit card that can carry significant benefits and losses depending on how well you manage. What credit cards do you recommend based on the type of lifestyle I am going to be living?

As weird as it may sound, I like the idea of being fully automated and robotic and just knowing exactly where all my money will be going and having life almost overly planned out. I plan on having all my financial accounts and institutions' apps on my phone to make transferring money and paying things as simple and effective as possible. It's a real pet peeve of mine that young people don't even think about starting to look into these things, like how will they retire one day? Those commercials for services that track your subscriptions and other reoccurring monthly fees, just... HOW CAN YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY, like how is that a service in demand? Like are people seriously this irresponsible with their expenses that they need to pay a whole paternal-like company to come in and tell them to stop wasting money on things they could easily have looked up in their bank accounts? Like are people this underdeveloped now? Sorry quick rant over.

 Anyway, I want to automate everything and not be so clueless to not know where money is going and needing a service to remind me. This will make it clear to me how much ""fun money"" I will have per week/month and help incentivize me to not spend too much if I want to invest more at a particular time. This will also help me make budget and see where percentages of it really do go. I am talking very specific, as in taking only the necessary routes to and from work to know exactly how much money will be spent on gas and when, using reoccuring amazon groceries to have the same exact dollar amount every weekspent on food, and have all the daily life bills paid automatically (but most online banking people seem to do this.)

Last, but not least, I realistically may need to open a solo 401k. If anybody knows anything or has any experience dealing with one, let me know! I don't know where to look to set one up, and if it has different benefits at different places (perhaps like a Roth IRA, reffering to a question I asked WAY above) and honestly it doesn't take extremely high prority (at least not yet).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok fellas, that's it. Look, I'm not a day trader, not a super advanced investor, I'm a very middle of the road guy. I will check my portfolio and stocks at least once every month, if not every week, I want to do solid, effective investing for my deep future. All this information I've learned recently is very time consuming, frustrating, confusing, and honestly I feel like my brain is going to explode. But this is good knowledge that is worth having my wrists go limp typing, and having my shoulder blade kill me.

I apologize for how long this post is, I am moving out soon and will live on my own, financially independent, for the first time. I am confident I can do it, but I wanted to get this plan together as fast as I could. I have recently become very serious about my future in terms of finance. If I am moving out into a place and living on own, I am trying to know exactly what to expect and do, and have a very good plan, and to generally not be a moron with no money.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my $15K car loan?,"I got about $25k in my savings. I put about $250 to $300 bi weekly. Sometimes less. I’m pretty stable with rent and pretty much the only bill I got besides my rent is my car and insurance. 

My car loan is at 7% interest rate and have $15k left to pay off.  I pay $650 a month and $220 for insurance. It was a dumb money decision no need to school me but I love the car.
I believe my car is valued at $28k to $32k it’s a 2018 Camaro SS with 10k miles. I’m planning on keeping this car until I die. But I was wondering if it’s smart to pay it off, like this month or just make extra payments until it’s paid off?

I still got a little bit extra money to fall back on, on a couple stocks valued over $10k+ but I’m planning on holding since they’re still been going up for over a year. I believe after I paid off, I would still have about $20k to fall back, or 10 without stocks but I will still put $650 in savings regardless. Would this be a good move?

personalfinance,Advice Please! Should my wife and I cash-out refi our home based on the information provided?,"My simple question is whether or not a cash-out refinance would be recommended for my family’s current situation. 

Current home: $250,000 and 27 years remaining on mortgage (fixed rate at 3.625%). $170,000 in untapped equity. 

Plans for home: we love our home, the location, the schools, and don’t plan to move hopefully ever. We need a new roof (tar and gravel roof so old that insurance won’t cover repairs related to it in the event of damage), and since we live in Florida and have two children under 6, we want to add a pool and outdoor living space. Since our house was built in 1952, we have minuscule bathrooms, and want to add an updated master bathroom and walk-in closet. 

Student loans: between my wife and myself, we have a combined $79,000 remaining in student loans at an average interest rate of 4.5%. She pays $700/mo and is on pace to pay them off in the next 2-3 years. I pay $800/mo and have 7 years to go. 

Both of us work in healthcare and have to be physically at work (have been working throughout the pandemic with no real changes). I am also growing a mobile healthcare business that will become my full time job. $10,000 in debt remaining for the business before I can start paying myself. 

Current mortgage plus student loans per month is $3,300. 

If we cash-out refi $150,000, and have a new mortgage at $400,000 with fixed rate of 3.5%, we have calculated our new payment to be ~$2,500 including taxes and insurance. 

We could immediately pay off all remaining student loans, which would decrease our mortgage plus loans payment from $3,300/month to $2,500/month. 

The remaining $71,000 can do so many things, but most importantly, can provide us an emergency cushion that would allow me to quit my job, dive into my business and give it the attention and time it needs to thrive, allowing my schedule to be more flexible to help with our son’s schedule of autism therapies. 

We could also do some, but not all, of our house projects or pay off business debt. 

That’s the gross overview. Probably left out some key info here and there, so please ask. 

What do you suggest we do? Thanks in advance.",finance

He will be able to collect social security too, of course.

In retirement, he wants to buy a motor home and travel the country. Maybe buy a piece of land out west and settle there for retirement. 

His debts:

A 2016 Hyundai Sonata with a 15% interest rate because of his poor credit when he bought. His credit is improving. I’m urging him to refinance. 

A mobile home in a trailer park that sits on a piece of land that he doesn’t own and he pays lot rent on. He’s going to sell it when he retires. 

What advice would you have for him? I want to make sure he gets to enjoy his retirement to the best of his ability without worrying about money. 

I’ll be happy to answer any questions.

personalfinance,"This sounds too good to be true, but it might be possible to get paid to go to college (undergraduate) by getting married. Anyone know if it is, in fact, too good to be true?","Important note before I begin: everything in this post is hypothetical. Anyone should only get married for the purpose of getting married, not monetary gain. The purpose of this post is to inquire into whether or not the hypothetical situation would play out as expected considering only the financial implications of the situation. With that out of the way, let's lay out the situation. 

Suppose I go to a great private school that has a financial aid policy such that they meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need. The school costs 76000 per semester before aid, with about 59000 being tuition and fees, and 17000 of that being room and board.  With a marital status of single, I am required to include information about my parents on the FAFSA and CSS profile. This results in an EFC of somewhere in the nature of 15000; since this school meets 100 percent of demonstrated financial need, out of 76000, they pick up the bill for 61000 of that so we pay what the FAFSA and CSS profile say we should. Of course, this is not an accurate representation of what we can actually afford because they don't care about bills and debt your parents may have. As such, currently, I pay all of that through earned income and federal loans. 

Now suppose that one summer I get married. Suddenly, I can file as independent and I don't have to include my parents income. Even with the wife's income the EFC drops to 0, so now the school picks up the bill for all 76000; I now have free college. But, what if I don't live on campus? According to this school's policy, as long as I don't live with my parents, the financial aid decision remains the same. However, I am no longer paying the school 17000 in room and board, so the rest goes to me. Now suppose my cost of living is below that even after taxes...am I effectively getting paid to get an undergraduate degree?

So what do you guys think, is this scenario too good to be true from a financial perspective? Am I missing something critical that would effect the financial picture?",finance
investing,Silver spiked yesterday and again today,"https://www.ft.com/content/7cfc5ece-64b9-4288-93df-d2599bd927a2

Silver prices soar to six-year high on ‘green recovery’ bet

Silver prices have touched their highest level in six years, encouraged by low interest rates on other long-term assets as well as hopes that the industrial metal will be a winner in the “green recovery” promised by politicians.

The price of the metal rose as much as 6 per cent to $21.17 an ounce on Tuesday afternoon — the highest in intraday trading since July 2014 — before falling back slightly. The price is now more than 70 per cent above its March low, outpacing gold, which is up about 24 per cent to a nine-year high above $1,800 an ounce.

Silver, which has a lively following among retail investors, can enjoy explosive spurts when conditions are right. Catalysts typically include a pick-up in manufacturing demand and loose monetary policy, which increases its relative attraction as a store of value.

“We see both of these factors driving silver higher over the next 6-12 months,” said analysts at Citi this week. The bank expects the price to hit $25 an ounce by the middle of next year.

Industrial applications, including electronics and photovoltaic cells used in solar panels, account for about 55 per cent of silver demand, according to RBC Capital Markets. This contrasts with gold, where investment makes up a far larger proportion of demand, making its price more susceptible to swings in sentiment.

Investors have picked silver as a way to play this “green” recovery, said Colin Hamilton, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Governments across the world have approved more than $50bn of environmentally friendly stimulus measures this year, according to BMO. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the US Democratic presidential nominee, has put clean energy at the centre of his $2tn plan to revive the US economy.

This green focus has been reflected in investment flows. Holdings of silver in physically backed exchange traded funds are up a record 35 per cent since the start of the year to 820m ounces, or about $17bn, according to Eikon data. Gold holdings in such ETFs, by contrast, are up just 26 per cent. This “velocity” of inflows should continue through the third quarter, lifting prices and silver-linked equities, said Mr Hamilton.

Shares in Fresnillo, the Mexico-based silver producer listed in London, have risen almost 70 per cent this year, making it the best performer in the FTSE 100. Mid-cap peer Hochschild is up about 40 per cent.

Silver bulls point to the gold/silver ratio as evidence that the rally has further to run. This reached an all-time peak in March at 125, but has fallen back below 100 as silver’s run has outshone gold. However, it remains above its long-run average of 66.

Some analysts see threats to industrial demand. RBC has warned of lockdown-related delays to large solar projects. In a recent report prepared for the Silver Institute, consultancy CRU predicted demand from the photovoltaic industry would decline from its 2019 peak of 100m ounces, because of new manufacturing techniques that require less silver.",finance

economy,The Federal Reserve,"The Federal Reserve. The Fed.

A source of numerous memes.

A topic that has recently reached the critical mass of mainstream consciousness.

A question that always lingers in the air is...who controls the Fed?

Before we can answer that deep question we need some context: what does the Fed do?

Officially...and unofficially.

&amp;#x200B;

Officially, the Fed has four main responsibilities:

1. Conducting the nation's monetary policy by influencing money and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of full employment and stable prices.
2. Supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.
3. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets.
4. Providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions, and foreign official institutions, and playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payments systems.

&amp;#x200B;

***“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”***

Those are the words of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.

Unofficially, the Fed enriches the top 0.1% in a process known as the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), which basically states that money printing itself increases inequality via asset price inflation.

***Moreover, we currently have a situation whereby corporations run by executives with HUGE stock packages borrow money from Fed-fed banks for roughly free, buy back stock - thus boosting its price, then sell their own shares, using the proceeds to ""diversify"" into other assets (namely other stocks), expecting the Fed to keep the asset-inflation scheme going indefinitely.***

The recent spate of bailouts has highlighted the severity of the situation.

The Fed's policy of subsidising interest rates has incentivised corporations to borrow cheap money and buy back shares instead of saving cash for a rainy day.

The executives pocketing multi million dollar bonuses via this financial engineering should be chastised, but ultimately it is the Fed that facilitates this - just like it was the Fed who incentivised greedy bankers leading up to the '08 mortgage crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand who controls the Fed, we must go back to the Fed's formative years.

The year is 1910.

The month is December.

Senator Nelson Aldrich was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.

As an aside, his daughter Abby actually married John D. Rockefeller Jr, son of the famous John D. Rockefeller.

Aldrich and six other men were about to embark on a journey to Jekyll Island, an island off the coast of Georgia, where there was an exclusive resort which counted the Morgans, the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts as members. 

These six men were:

Paul Warburg (a partner at the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb, and Co.);

Frank Vanderlip (president of National City Bank - now known as Citibank - and a former Treasury official);

Benjamin Strong (vice president of the Bankers Trust Company and the future founding chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York);

Henry Davison (a partner at J.P. Morgan);

Charles Norton (President of J.P. Morgan's First National Bank of New York);

and A.P. Andrew, who coincidentally was an economics professor at Harvard where he taught FDR, who would later sign Executive Order 6102 (otherwise known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1933).

Aldrich chose the attendees for their expertise, but he knew their ties to Wall Street could arouse suspicion about their motives and threaten the bill’s political passage.

So he went to great lengths to keep the meeting secret, adopting the ruse of a duck hunting trip and instructing the men to come one at a time to a train terminal in New Jersey, where they could board his private train car.

Once aboard, the men used only first names to prevent the staff from learning their identities.

For decades after, the group referred to themselves as the “First Name Club.”

A member of the exclusive Jekyll Island Club, most likely J.P. Morgan himself, arranged for the group to use the club’s facilities.

Munsey’s Magazine described this exclusive club as “the richest, the most exclusive, the most inaccessible” club in the world.

According to Frank Vanderlip:

***“I was secretive, indeed, as furtive as any conspirator. I do not feel it is an exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.***

***Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.”***

The bankers initially drafted the Federal Reserve as the “Aldrich Bill,” but when it came to Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich’s name, became suspicious, and decided against passing the bill.

To make it sound more official, they decided to re-brand the bill as “The Federal Reserve Bill.” 

Three years after their historic meeting at Jekyll Island, The Federal Reserve Act was singed into law on December 23rd 1913, and with that a small group of bankers had the monopoly over creation of American money.

The Federal Reserve Act was originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks, however on February 25th, 1927, it was extended indefinitely.

This proved crucial, as the sentiment in 1933 (nearing the end of the original 20 year charter) was not exactly positive with regards to the Fed.

Now the good thing is that, since then, the Fed have been held to account by [rigorous audits and comprehensive investigative procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqM2tFOxLQ)...

&amp;#x200B;

On June 4th, 1963, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates.

This was the first of a series of moves to take control of US money back from the Federal Reserve by giving greater power to the Treasury.

On November 22nd, 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

&amp;#x200B;

1861 was the beginning of the Civil War.

Abraham Lincoln was short of money to finance the North's war effort and went to the bankers of New York, who agreed to lend him money at interest rates varying from 24 to 36 percent.

Lincoln refused, but he still needed to solve his money problem.

Colonel Dick Taylor came to the rescue and put the solution to him:

***“Just get Congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes, and pay your soldiers with them, and go ahead and win your war with them also.”***

This is what Lincoln did: and on February 25, 1862, Congress passed the first Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issuance of $150 million greenbacks.

(These Treasury notes were called “Greenbacks” by the people because they were printed with green ink on the back.)

***Lincoln called these Greenbacks “the greatest blessing the American people have ever had.”***

A blessing for all, except the bankers, since it was putting an end to their racket (i.e. the stealing of the nation's credit and issuing interest-bearing money).

So they did everything possible to destroy these Greenbacks and sabotage Lincoln's work.

Lincoln said:

***“I have two great enemies, the Southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. And of the two, the bankers are my greatest foe.”***

Lincoln was re-elected President in 1864, and he made it quite clear that he would attack the power of the bankers once the civil war was over. The civil war ended on April 9, 1865...

Lincoln was assassinated six days later, on April 15.

&amp;#x200B;

The central bank in each country is the legal entity that manages the nation’s money supply and can lend money, with interest of course, to the government and other private banks in the country. This is how it all works:

1. When the government needs more money, they ask the treasury department for money by issuing an IOU or government bond, which is a bond issued by the national government with a promise to pay periodic interest payments and to repay the face value on the maturity date.
2. The Treasury (an executive department of government) receives the bond from the government and forwards it to the nation’s Central Bank.
3. The Central Bank (a privately owned bank and the entity that owns the monetary system of the nation) then writes a check to the commercial banks in the country for the value of the bond and authorises them to create this new money. This central bank, of course, just invents money out of thin air.

For more clarity, we can refer to ""Putting it Simply"", released in 1984 by the Public Services Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

***“When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our accounts to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money”***

4. The commercial banks then type numbers on a screen and create money out of nothing. At this exchange at the private banks, money is *officially* created and can be used to pay government bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Another part of this money creation system happens at the commercial banks.

***Every time you take out a loan, banks simply type in some numbers digitally in your account and charge you interest on it. So basically, each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn’t use other people’s deposited money to loan to you. It creates new money by typing digits into a computer.***

***97% of all money is generated that way. Only 3% is the physical paper cash and coins that we carry.***

Moreover, commercial banks lend out up to 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves; a practice known as fractional reserve lending.

To demonstrate how absurdly the system is currently leveraged, that [reserve requirement has recently been cut to zero.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) Yes, zero.

&amp;#x200B;

So who controls the Fed?

Well, an international Cartel of Central Bankers, more ruthless and more intelligent than Escobar or El Chapo ever were.

A Cartel who have effectively perfected a form of modern slavery; with debt taking the place of chains...and Central Bankers playing the role of Masters.

I close with a quote from Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's father:

***""Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home.""***

personalfinance,Question Regarding Cashiers Checks And Pay to validity,"Really stupid question today:

I bank with Capital One and needed a cashiers check for first month rent at a new place.

The apartment office has limited hours so I had Capital One send the Check via Fedex to my own address ahead of time so I could ensure I was there to sign for it and and I could hand deliver it in person on Friday when I get the keys. Despite calling to confirm with Capital One this precise event wouldn't happen. They ended up sending me a cashiers check with the correct Pay to name, correct city/state (since its the same) but used my current mailing street address. So basically it ended up as :

`ABC Apartment Complex (Correct)`

`1234 My wrong current address street (wrong)`

`Correct city, state (correct)`

I emailed the the apartment complex but they are closed today and need some kind of check in hand by Friday so I'd have to figure it out quick. I'm curious if anyone knows if this is usually an issue. The payee NAME is totally correct as is city/state. he street address is totally wrong....last time I got a cashiers check from a regular brick and mortar bank I don't recall if they even put an address on it, just a name.

personalfinance,Adding my GF as a domestic partner to my health care vs finding an individual health plan,"Hello, 

My GF and I are having trouble deciding what will be her best option for health care coverage due to her wanting to leave her unsafe job. She was already planning to leave pre-covid, and wants to enroll in classes to change careers, so we think the best case scenario would be for her to be unemployed or just doing some kind of gig work part-time while studying for the next 6 months. Obviously, in the current job market there is a chance that she will not have full-time employment for longer than that though. 

I have stable a stable job that offers exceptionally good health care and they can add her to my plan as a domestic partner for $153/month. However, the IRS considers that portion that my employer contributes towards her part of the plan, which is around $500 as taxable income which will result in my federal taxes increasing by about $110/month at my marginal tax rate of 22%. I am not sure if that is also taxed under FICA and my State taxes which are 7.65% and 5.25% respectively, but I will assume that it is which brings the total additional cost of adding her to my plan to $328/month. 

I have looked into if we declare her as a dependent to the IRS, which would eliminate that additionally tax burden and make the $153/month fee a no-brainer, but I am not sure when she would be eligible for that. If she quits on August 1st and from that point forward is receiving more than half her support from me, can she be considered a dependent immediately? Or does she need to be a dependent for a full tax year? That may come into play in 2021 if she enrolls in a longer program or can't find a job. 

The other option we are considering is an individual plan through the ACA. On healthcare.gov there are a few options that look ok, but once you start plugging in some things to the estimate the total yearly costs go up a lot. The cheapest plan has a $170/month premium but way higher deductible and out-of-pocket maximums than my plan. And, when we added some estimates for a doctors visit here and there and her regular prescription drugs it looks like the total yearly cost would work out to being more like $330/month. So at best it looks like the cost would be similar, and if she were to have something more serious happen the cost would be much higher. 

However, if she is unemployed all of next year would she be eligible for medicaid or other low income health care programs? And if so would there be any advantage to enrolling her in that vs being a domestic partner on my plan? We are definitely leaning towards just going with my plan because it is great coverage and I don't have much trust in my state (NC) providing anything decent for low-income people.

I have 4 credit card balances that I'm looking to take down in the interest of raising my credit score.  From my tax return, I'm going to use $2k toward this.  I know there's some science to paying down the higher interest or higher balance, to either free up your available credit or lower the amount you pay to financing, I just don't know what it is.  All are currently set to autopay at the minimum payments, so this is what I have:

Card 1:  Balance: $1,848.38, Limit: $2000, Monthly payment: $53, finance charge: $38 (22.9%)

Card 2: Balance: $938.59, Limit: $1000, Monthly payment: $31, finance charge: $19.55 (24.9%)

Card 3: Balance: $167.05, Limit: $500, Monthly payment: $25, finance charge: $4.47 (24.9%)

Card 4: Balance: $554.30, Limit: $800, Monthly payment: $27, finance charge: $10.77 (22.9%) 

It's a mix of Mastercard and store cards but as you can see all interest rates are pretty high.  On one hand, I think it'd be great to pay off the smaller balances and increase the payment on the larger ones so I'd have fewer accounts with open balances.  On the other, when I see that only $11 of my payment is going to the principle of my largest account, I know that needs to get paid down quickly.

Can anyone offer advice on how I should handle this?

My fiancé and I will be buying our first home in eastern Tennessee soon. We are considering putting in an offer on a manufactured home. The home in question is on a permanent foundation and we would own the land (25+ acres!) that the home is on. It also seems to be in really good condition structurally and visually, but it's a little dated, e.g. floral wallpaper everywhere!

None of the local banks or credit unions would pre-approve us for a loan for a manufactured home, so we will likely end up financing with US Bank, which is fine because they offered us a really low interest rate and reasonable fees. I've talked my our mortgage loan officer several times and he assured me that as long as there are no major issues with the manufactured home and we do our due diligence, we should be able to close, though it might take a little longer than if we were buying a site-built home. 

Does anyone have experience getting a mortgage for a manufactured home? If so, what was it like? What were some of the challenges you faced, if any? Were you able to close on time and, if so, how long did it take?

**Background**

I am a graduate student about to start their 2nd year in College. I applied for the FAFSA every year during my undergraduate and graduate career and took out an unsubsidized loan every year. The loans are as follows and broken down by Undergraduate and Graduate.

Undergraduate Loans

Loan 1 - Principle: $5,500 Interests Rate: 4.66% Unpaid Interest: $1,338.97

Loan 2: - Principle: $6,500 Interest Rate: 4.29 % Unpaid Interest: $1,180.34

Loan 3: - Principle: $7,500 Interest Rate: 4.76% Unpaid Interest: $912.48

Loan 4: - Principle: $7,500 Interest Rate: 4.45% Unpaid Interest: $747.18

Loan 5: - Principle: $4,000 Interest Rate: 5.045% Unpaid Interest $278.43

Graduate Loans

Loan 6: - Principle: $14,638 Interest Pate: 6.08% Unpaid Interest $302.32

This year I was offered another unsubsidized loan for $20,500 with an interest rate of 4.3%. I initially planned on rejecting this loan as loan 6 was large enough to cover both last and this year’s tuition fees and through some smart fiscal decisions, I am able to support myself for the coming school year and a possible 3rd year of graduate school.


**Question**

As this year’s interest rate is lower than the rates on Loans 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 my question is, should I take out this year’s loan and immediately repay Loan 6, 5, and as much of 3 as possible? These loans have accrued a relatively small amount of interest and yet have the largest rate of them all. This way some of my loans will be consolidated at an overall lower interest rate. My concern is that I have overlooked something important or that this would be an unwise fiscal decision due to some unknown factor. I would appreciate any help.",finance

My wife and I have a strong 6-figure salary and pretty good job security. We do live in one of the highest COL areas in the country though, and we’re not exactly frugal with our money. I’m currently on the 25-year plan and paying ~$850/month. We have excellent credit, so would likely qualify for a good interest rate. One other factor, but more a long-term consideration, is that both of my parents are solid financially, and when either of them passes, there will be more than enough money to pay off the remainder. But depending on the parent, that could be 3, 5, 10, or 20 years. 

The factors I’m balancing are pro-refi: the amount of money saved. Contra-refi: 1.) all of the fed protections in case I do suffer an adverse career event (not super likely, but not out of the realm of possibility if COVID goes on for a significant period), and 2) I’d eventually (2-4 years) like to move into a govt or corporate position, which would pay less in the former, and in the latter, at the very least, cap my earnings potential (hopefully some of that to be made up through equity). 

Are there any rules of thumb on this? I’m not sure how to approach this. I feel like my grad school’s financial advising consultant gave really poor advice that has wormed into my psyche (ie, do fed loans as long as possible)

One other thing is that I don’t want monthly payments beyond what I pay now—I’m dealing with high COL, daycare, saving for a down payment, etc.

So right now I have co-signed on a FHA mortgage with my mom with the monthly payment being 2300 before refinancing. So currently my DTI is running at 40%. 

I went to apply for an auto loan at 2 credit unions before I knew about DTI ratios and asked to borrow around 15k however I really was going to need 12k and I was ready to put down at most half of the cars value. I wanted the loan so I could take advantage of low interest rates and invest the 12k over the life of the loan in a high dividend etf since it would pay the interest of and I would potentially get some capital gains. I was denied because of the high DTI and that I couldn’t borrow anything even with all those factors I list above unless I got a co-signer. I didn’t want to add a co-signer because I didn’t want someone else responsible for that debt.

So after getting denied, I panicked and thought if I can’t get approved for an auto loan, how is someone going to approve me for a mortgage to borrow more than 15k with my other mortgage under my name when I want to move out this year. 

Now I talked to a loan officer and she said that the condo I was looking at (160k-180k with a monthly payment of 800-900) wouldn’t be a problem to get a mortgage by myself if I put 20% down because I had good credit, high income, etc.

How is this possible?

I hadn't played any of them since 3 and I'd heard this one was good so I had pretty high hopes. It's been a while since I played a good shooter and I was really in the mood for one.

Everything started promisingly. The opening was exciting, cool crazy characters, beautiful visuals and through the first section on the island the gameplay felt so smooth and satisfying. Then, the second the first section ended and the world opened up it turned on me. This beautiful open world I'm so excited to explore, especially given the freedom of the main story's design, is a chaotic mess, and not in a good way.

I cant make it a few hundred meters without something trying to kill me. The frequency with which cars and vehicles pass by on the road makes them pretty much unusable and the amount of wildlife lurking off the beaten track doesn't make that much better. To make matters worse, when I do manage to get myself to an outpost or location I decide to take on the ""open world"" buts it's nose in and screws it up. Wanna flank this outpost and scout it from the high ground? Surprise! There's a cougar up there! Wanna kill those baddies and blow up that silo? Better do it in the 20 seconds before the next van comes along the road unless you wanna fight that too, as well as every other vehicle that will continue to turn up as you're fighting the previous one. Wanna just get from this point of the map to that one? Well you'll have to fight a cougar, a bear and about three skunks on your way. Like Christ game just give me a breather once in a while.

The dog companion is a great illustration of what I mean. When I got him I was like ""oh, he tags nearby enemies and occasionally retrieves ammo from dead ones, that'll be super useful."" After about 20 mins I got rid of him because I was fed up of the soundtrack to my game now being the dog constantly growling at all the nearby things that want to kill me and the persistent pings of enemies being tagged whenever I'm anywhere near a road.

What makes this so frustrating is it's not a bad game, it's actually really good once the shooting starts, and for the first hour or so it looked like exactly the game I wanted to play right now. But at 3 hours in I'm already fed up. Worse still I know that tomorrow evening, I'll look at it there in my library and want to play again... and again... and again. Chasing the occasional periods of super enjoyable fps gameplay amidst the chaos, and before long I'll have sunk 40 hours into this frustrating mess of a game.

investing,Need for Financial Mindshift in this Dispensation.,"The financial system has made it difficult for the poor and average to benefit from their saving culture, based on reduction on interest rate on government bonds and fixed savings interest, the system isn't built to give you freedom rather to meet up the financial needs of the government.
Saving is a good habit but for the right purpose and application leads to financial freedom. Our financial system has made it difficult for one to benefit from a good saving culture, interest paid on savings is minute or close to nothing and deductions are now made that the interest on savings is almost nothing.
Looking at the government and the financial sector, getting intentional about how your money should work for you should be an area of concern, should you keep enriching the Rich on a system that is built on corruption without the interest of the people at heart? Or would you prefer sending your money out to work for you to give the desired financial freedom? When it comes to financial freedom, there should be a level of Mindshift for that to happen.
Looking at human history, you will notice there has been 4 major Mindshift in human economic age. The four major Mindshift in human history are:
1. The Hunter-Gatherer mindshift: in the hunter gatherer age, human relied on nature to provide wealth. They were nomadic and went where the hunting was good and the vegetation plentiful, you had to know how to hunt and to gather or you die. For the hunter gatherer, the tribe was social security, socio-economically, everyone was even. They were all poor.
2. The Agrarian mindshift: The agrarian age saw the rise of different classes of people. Due to the development of technology to plant and cultivate the land, those who owned the land became royalty and those who worked it became peasants. The royals rode horses while the peasants walked. Socio-economically there were two groups the rich and the poor.
3. The industrial mindshift: while many people would place the beginning of the industrial age in the 1800s with the rise of factories, actually it began in 1492 with columbus, when columbus struck out for the new world, it was to find new sources of valuable resources such as oil, copper, tin and rubber. During this time, the value of real estate shifted from growing crops to providing resources. This led to the land becoming even more valuable and three classes emerged. The rich, the Middle class, and the poor.
4. The information mindshift: Today, we are in the information age, where information leveraged by technology and inexpensive resources like silicon, produces wealth. This means that the price of getting wealthy has gone down. For the first time in the history, wealth is available to just about everyone. There are now four groups of people: the poor, the middle class, the Rich, and the super rich.
In each economic age, you had to change your Mindshift to be Rich, but the strategy has was always the same..
In the hunter gatherer age, you wanted to be the chief then others will hunt and gather for you. They would bring goods to you. That was a form of additional income. Unfortunately, only one person could be the chief.
In the agrarian age, you wanted to be a landowner. You then had peasants work for you and produce wealth off your land, unfortunately, if you weren't royal, you had a hard a hard time getting land.
In the industrial age, you wanted to own the means of production. If you had control of natural resources and factories, you could hire people to work for you. The resulting goods produced cash flow for you. Unfortunately it took a lot of smarts and capital to build an industrial empire. Only a few could be Rich.
In the information age, the advent of the internet means that you can build a business with little capital or easily find investments. The bar to entry is the lowest it has ever been in history, but you have to think differently.
Have a passive income that comes through business or investments. Don't just depend on salary and savings, have a cash flow system that you wouldn't have to work for by trading your time.

personalfinance,Withdrawing all the money from 401k?,"Hello,

I'm a foreigner working in the US and I currently have $22,106 in my 401k account where:

Roth 401k contribution = $8633
Pre-tax traditional 401k contribution = $1341
Company contribution = $12,131

I'm currently in FL (22% tax bracket) where there is no state tax. In a week's time I'm going to be moving states and I'll be working in Massachusetts where I'll be in a 24% tax bracket plus the 5.05% state tax.

I'd like to withdraw all the money from my 401k before I move to MA so I don't have to pay the extra 2% in federal income tax and the 5.05% state tax. 

I'll get the entire Roth 401k contribution back since I've already paid taxes on it so that's $8633.

On the rest of the money in my account, a total of $13,472, I would just pay the 22% income tax and get back $10,508.

So I would get a total of $19,141. Does that seem right and do you think I'm missing anything here? Are my calculations correct as to how much I'll be getting back?

My family was impacted by Covid so I don't think I'll have to pay the 10% penalty.

personalfinance,"I have $25,000 to pay down one of three debts. Which one should I choose?","I have saved $25,000 this year and anticipate saving around the same amount every six months for the foreseeable future. I have multiple streams of income and my main source pays me monthly and I am on a budget with that income. My other streams come in big chunks several times a year. Here are my debts:

1. Student Loan Balance: $110,000. Half of this is at 3% interest, and the other half at 7%.
$1,100 monthly payment.

2. Car Loan: $11,000 remaining. 3.75% interest. 
$379 monthly payment.

3. Tax debt: $28,000. I'm not sure how the interest rate works, but I don't think there is any interest with my structured payment agreement.
$500 monthly payment.

Obviously I would like to tackle the monster student loan debt, but paying off my vehicle would save me almost $400 a month and would possibly lower my car insurance rate. The higher-interest part of my student loan is around $44,000, so I am unsure if I should pay off a chunk of that and then knock the rest of it out at the end of this year so I can only have the 3% interest rate student loans left.

personalfinance,Paying off a car loan or investing the money in a mutual fund/etf?,"Paying off a car loan or investing the money in a mutual fund/etf? If the car loan is 5.2% apr for 72 months, do you think it is better to: 

1. Pay off car loan quicker, lets say 36 months by doubling the payment.

 2. Take the whole 72 months paying the car loan and putting the money into the market? 

The interest rate being paid is in the 72 months would be $2550.

However, in the UK, there isn't the same system. Does anyone know any long term methods of saving money, preferably not something where there is a high risk of losing that money such as investing in stocks? 

Currently Im looking at Lifetime Independent Savings Account (LISA) which allows you to deposit a maximum of 4000 pounds a year which you get a 25% bonus of whatever you put in funded by the government. However the interest rates I belive aren't very high and even if say over the course of your working career you put in 100,000 pounds, your only going to end up with 125,000 pounds (+ small interest) unlike a Roth IRA which can land you hundred of thousands when you retire.

Last time I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/hppgrm/im_over_30000_in_credit_card_debt_ive_missed_a/). It was around midnight and didn't get a chance to look at it until I got off work. By then, it was locked for a day or two.

I was off on the credit card amount by $2,000. It's actually, $28k and some change. 28k - 22k, is about $6,000 difference, or 22%. Somehow from previous posts in the [last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/hppgrm/im_over_30000_in_credit_card_debt_ive_missed_a/), some were getting 30% knocked off! I'm disappointed.

I had taken note of the companies that were mentioned - Prosper, NDR, ACCC, Apprisen, American Financial, etc. Most of the companies were refinance companies. They didn't lower my debt, only the interest rate. NDR is the best option as of right now.

NDR ran a soft pull, and to no surprise, sparkling 810 credit score to an abysmal 505.... :'( At 505, I might as well just full-on file for bankruptcy. But the NDR rep said it will gradually go back up to to the original score the closer you are to paying them back. I found this reply refreshing but still have that lingering seesaw feeling: bankruptcy or pay it back?

personalfinance,Medical debt that I don't actually owe?,"In December of 2015 I was kicked off of my parents insurance. Being a full time student and waitress, I could not afford my own insurance and it was not offered by my school or employer. Anytime I needed care I went either to the low income health clinic or the university hospital. This was through all of 2016 and some of 2017. I was poor but not poor enough for Medicaid but luckily at the university hospital they had a program for low income people to get free healthcare at their facility, which I qualified for and was enrolled in. I could use it for lab, radiology, women's clinic, ER visits, and a few other things.

Despite this, I ended up getting billed for a couple of my emergency room visits (but not all) several months after going in. I was instructed by the hospital to send copies of the paperwork for my free care to Schumacher Group, the company that billed me. I did so and didn't hear anything from them again and figured that was done until I bought a house in early 2018 and learned that I had a few thousand dollars of medical debt on my record.

Then in late 2018 I started getting calls from a company called Radius Global Solutions. I explained the situation to them and also reached out to the hospital again. I was instructed by the hospital not to pay a penny towards those bills and fight it so I faxed copies of all of my free care paperwork to RGS and my phone went silent. I did not hear from them again. 

Now it's July of 2020, I live in a totally different state and I'm getting letters from a new company about the bills. I mailed copies of the free care documents to them last week but I'm starting to get fed up with this. I also now live in a state where having paychecks garnished for medical debt is a common thing and I'm worried that's what's going to happen. Should I just give up and call them to make a payment plan or should I keep trying to fight this? The hospital is still insisting all these years later that I do not owe this money.

Starting from 22 July 2020 federal banks of the US had allowed to custody cryptocurrency. This announcement received some scepticism because of the following necessity to share private keys. On the other hand, there is an opinion that not all the potential crypto holders are ready to take bank functions on themselves. In this case, this decision may help to increase the adoption of cryptocurrency.

## Russian legislation

On 22 July 2020 as well, the Russian government passed a bill “On Digital Financial Assets”. According to this bill starting from 1 January 2021 cryptocurrency will receive legal status. Now crypto holders will be able to store and trade crypto assets. Using cryptocurrency as a payment method is not allowed yet.

Only. my interest rate is at 19.8% and tbh comes out to like $80 something dollars a month in interest charges which basically means 80 of my 150 monthly payment  is paying the interest rate alone.

personalfinance,"Suggestions? $19,711 Net Worth at 24","Hi, I’ve read so many posts about finance but I would like advice for my situation. I’m a 24-year-old (25 next April) and I’ve always been very focused and careful with my finances. I graduated from college in 2018 and worked a job for $35,000 at the only place that would hire me after I moved across the country. After about 1.3 years there I finally switched to a much better job at $60,000 and I moved back to my home state. I started working at my new job mid-June.

This morning I decided to fully calculate my net worth. I added up all of my current assets (Roth IRA, savings, checking, car) and debts (car, credit card balances). I don’t have any more student loans to pay off. I paid off about $18,000 in total loans and other housing/tuition costs and I paid the final lump sum last year (avg. 4.5% interest rate). My car loan still has $12,283 on it, but my interest rate is only 1.9% because I bought it new two years ago. After all the calculations I am at a $19,711.

Assets (other than my car):

$6,187 in a Charles Schwab Roth IRA (target date fund SWYNX)

$419 in a Charles Schwab brokerage account (one hand-picked stock)

$5,979 in various checking accounts

$1540 in a HYSA at 4% (through employer)

$8,017 in a Marcus HYSA at 1.05%

My plan is to eventually park all of my savings in the HYSA offered by my employer. They only allow additions via payroll, so it’ll probably take a few months to transfer it over. I am not offered any other retirement accounts or match through work.

Based on everything I read, my plan is to keep around $11,000 in the HYSA as an emergency fund. I’m then going to max out my IRA for this next year ($6,000). Would everything kept in checking accounts also count as an emergency fund? I ask because I pay rent and almost all bills directly out of it, so I’d probably need to keep a couple thousand in there at all times just in case.

Is there anything else you would suggest? Am I currently in a good place financially? I’m already bummed I didn’t start contributing to an IRA before this last year! Based on my budget I’m set to save about $20K this year so I’d like to be as smart with it as possible. Thank you so much if you made it all the way through!",finance

personalfinance,Newbie questions about fees of Fidelity mutual fund,"I have a traditional IRA account at Fidelity

&amp;#x200B;

If I would purchase a mutual fund of Fidelity, say $6000 FSKAX, hold it for one month, and sell it one month later.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding:

1. I do NOT have to pay any tax for all above operations, because all operations are roofed under my traditional IRA (no distribution, no withdrawal).
2. The only fee I have to pay is 2-month incurring expense ratio fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Are my above understanding correct?
2. Does Fidelity have a mininum holding period for Fidelity's mutual funds?
3. How is the expense ratio fee calcuated? Like at beginning, NAV is $92 for FSKAX, so my $6k deserves a $6k/$92 = 65.21739 shares, and one month later, the NAV changes to $93. So my asset increases to $93 \* 65.21739 (shares) = $6065.22. When I sell this mutual fund, do I have to pay ADDITIONAL expense ratio fee for it? Or the expense ratio is already deducted in NAV beforehand?

investing,What is the relevance of Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis today?,"Greetings everyone.

I've started this post as a discussion on what are your thoughts on the famous book by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. My journey through the world of investing started in the beggining of 2019 since I became an undergraduate in economics. And, from the very start, my approach was always this one when i think about the stock market, which reads verbatim from the book:

""In other words, the market is not a *weighing machine,* on which the value of each issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities. Rather should we say that the market is a *voting machine,* whereon countless individuals register choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.""

This phrase, and the book itself, has given me quite a bit of solace and logical thinking whenever i approach the market, no matter the situation and even moreso in present coditions of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve and any expectations of what the market should do when looking to the future.

The original first edition was published in 1934, i currently hold the second edition from 1940. Even though it was written 80 years ago, i find the book and its advices on fundamental analysis, speculation and value investing very relevant to this day.

What are your thoughts on the book? Since i exposed my opinion on it, i would be glad to hear yours!",finance

personalfinance,When to cut losses on an “old” house and buy new?,"Currently living in a nearly 30 year old home. Purchased the home about 3 years ago and have remodeled the kitchen and both bathrooms myself. Also have done some landscaping and put in a patio. Roughly $15,000 worth of updates and a recent appraisal on my house would net a profit of about $30,000. Purchased home for $224,000 and could sell for $254,000. 

The issues.... I know the roof will need to be replaced within the next 5 years. I also know the air conditioner will need to replaced at some point in the next few years as well. The house also needs a new driveway. As stated, this is a 30 year old home that will continue to need maintenance and little fixes here and there that will add up. 

I like the idea of moving into a new home that won’t need a new AC unit, a new roof, a new driveway, etc. I know the new house may require some additional fixes here and there, but nothing quite like the current house. Anyways, a brand new home in the neighborhood across the street would cost $345,000. 

With current interest rates, my monthly mortgage with taxes and insurance would be about $325 more a month. Current mortgage is $1275 and the new mortgage would come out to $1600. Essentially, a new home would cost me about $4,000 more a year in mortgage payments. But, much less in general maintenance and future payments for new roof, AC, etc. 

Strictly from a maintenance, repair and future repair standpoint, does buying a new home make sense for an additional $4,000 per year? I just feel like I may be spending well over $4,000 a year alone with the upcoming known costs of my current home.",finance

EDIT: Initially it seemed like the national lender vs local would cost us an additional 232.68 if we consider closing cost adjusted for escrow refund with national lender, and no refund from local lender because the later closing date meant existing escrow was used to pay the tax bill. However, it would seem that one more payment at the higher interest rate with the local lender loan would cost us approximately $284, making the local lender $52 more expensive.

personalfinance,Layers of liquidity in emergency funds (how do you approach this?),"My wife and I recently accomplished our goal of accumulating $18k for our emergency fund (figuring that covers 6 months of our ~2k/month rent + 1k/month expenses, which should easily be livable).

Currently, this is all sitting in a high-yield Marcus savings account at 1.05% variable rate interest. My dad suggested that I might want to take some portion of this out to have as literal cash sitting in the house in the event of a prolonged electricity outage, which isn't out of the question here in wildfire-prone California. This seems reasonable enough to me, but got me thinking more about how to structure liquidity in an emergency fund.

Cash would be the highest possible liquidity, at the cost of not even keeping a savings account level of interest. So it might make sense to keep ~1k in cash in case the power goes down, but I wouldn't want to keep the whole emergency fund in bills.

Savings accounts are pretty damn liquid, taking only a few days at most to get the money out, and their interest rates put a solid dent in losses to inflation. This seems like a good place for the majority of the fund to stay.

But in the event that we actually need the last 4-6 months worth of emergency fund, we'd presumably have a good bit of lead time to figure out we may need to access that money and plan on making it available for ourselves. This has me thinking about where this might better be put than a mere online savings account. Obviously I don't want to dump it into an S&amp;P index fund since broad market volatility is a large part of what I hope to avoid by having an emergency fund in the first place, but are there any good options for 3-6 month long rotating low-risk bonds, or other investments with slightly-better-than-1.05% returns and limited downside risk (or at least downside risk weakly correlated to the rest of the market)?

How do you structure your emergency fund? Do you keep some part of it in hard cash? Do you have any of it tied up in actual investments rather than just savings accounts? If so, which ones, and how have you balanced protecting it from volatility with trying to eke out a better return? I'm interested in hearing perspectives on this. And don't feel like you need to convince me not to dump the whole emergency fund into crypto; I'm not doing anything with it unless I can find something that very clearly meshes with the point of the emergency fund :)",finance
personalfinance,Taking money out of a refi,"My goal is to be able to buy a bigger house.   


I currently own a very small house in a hot Southern California market where I've already been priced out of my own neighborhood. I also own a condo in the same city in a less desirable place. I held on to the condo as an investment, and also out of necessity because it was underwater for years from buying in 2008.   


Given everything that's happening right now, I am trying to figure out the best move, and I cant afford anything right now. The current interest rates seem to make doing a refi a no-brainer. It looks like real estate MIGHT be cheaper from the after effects of covid in the not to far future, and I have about half of a down payment for a bigger house. If I refi the condo, would it make sense to ""take the money out"" so that I have a full down payment IF things are to my advantage in the future? What do I stand to lose by doing so? I understand I would lose to inflation by just sitting on the money. After a year or two, if I am wrong, I can just pay down what I took out, right?

personalfinance,Should I put extra payment towards mortgage to cut down on interest or invest in the market,"Hi all - looking for some advice here on go forward strategy (btw for background we're mid 30s, no kids yet but planning for one in next few years, fortunately have no credit card or student loan debt and car is almost paid off, also have 9 month worth of emergency savings, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a rental condo I used to live in, I have 10 years left on the mortgage. I refinanced 5 years ago at 3.00%, got out of paying PMI and now have approx. $65K left (originally purchased in 2010 at $100K, 30 year mortgage at 5.00%, but thank you first time homebuyer credit and appreciation!). It's worth a lot more now (basically more than doubled since original purchase price) and is in a highly desirable area (well at least until this COVID situation) so I have always had steady tenants (typically for 1-2 years lease) and while I could charge a bit higher for rent, about break even when I take into account expenses which is all I could hope for (never quite figured out how to calculate tax benefit of this so let's ignore this for now). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a new job and while I was calculating our income and expenses, I figured out I can easily afford putting another $550 or so a month towards it (probably could have done before with my last job too but didn't quite map out our complete finance situation until very recently). If I do so, I'll be done paying this mortgage off in 5 years. I save about $5K in interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have another mortgage in a different state for the home I current occupy with my wife which is brand new as of May this year. 3.15% for 30 year, about $465K left. Idea was to pay off the rental condo and put the profit towards this mortgage eventually. But I calculated if I were to put the extra payment towards this mortgage as opposed to the rental condo the interest savings are substantially more (if I just made the 5 years of extra payment and nothing else, it'll be $40K in interest saved and I would've shaved about 3 years off of mortgage payments. No brainer that I should put extra payment towards the loan with the higher balance and higher interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea was to pay rental condo off and put profit towards this mortgage. Sure, it's entirely possible we could refinance this home down the line to a 15 year. I also calculated what would be the savings if I paid off my rental condo early and put the regular rental condo mortgage towards current home or just put the extra payment to current home, not pay extra for 5 years and when rental condo is paid off, put what I would have paid for the rental condo towards current home, and it's almost the same in savings, approx $66.5K and the mortgage term shrinks to just a tad over 22 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I did one more calculation where I continue to put extra payment for 10 years until rental condo is paid off and continue to put the same total amount towards current home (basically 550 + rental condo mortgage after) and the savings is about $93K and mortgage is paid off just under 19 years or so.

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is.... is this worth the effort to pay down debt and minimize interest over putting the extra amount every month in the market, say high dividend ETFs and reinvesting the dividends? I know the market can be uncertain, but if I were to look at it long term (let's say 20-30 years), is it reasonable to expect 6% returns on the low end and perhaps 8 to 10% on the high end? Wouldn't the potential gains through investing in the market greatly overweigh the savings in interest? My original thinking was to pay off both the mortgages, continue to save towards another home and then rent the current home out, and let the income from both rental properties pay for our final home.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,[Ohio] Looking for ways to lower wife's taxable income for income-based student loan payments due to loan forgiveness program,"My wife just started working full time at the public defender's office in January, after finishing law school.  She's working toward the federal loan forgiveness program.  Right now we put $2500 into an FSA through my employer, but now that she's eligible to put money into an FSA, we're thinking about shifting to do that through hers.  We're both pretty healthy and don't use anywhere near that amount, but I put extra away since we were planning for our first child.

We did the math and filing our taxes separately will net us a monthly savings with our disparity in income, since it will significantly lower her monthly student loan payments.  She's on an income-based repayment program.  To me it makes sense to try and get her on-paper income as low as possible, to get the loan payments lower, since they'll all be forgiven after 10 years working for the public defenders office.  

We are also expecting our first child in September, and are trying to decide which of us should claim him as a dependent for next year.  Again, on paper it feels like it makes sense to me for her to claim him, if we want to get her income on paper as low as possible.

\* Options: Adjust the W-4 withholding so the homebuyer pays less taxes out of each paycheck throughout the year.

I've used [mortgagecalculator.org](https://mortgagecalculator.org) to get a general idea of monthly payment, total interest paid, etc.   
The difference between 2.75% and 3% is approximately $7000 in interest over 30 years.  The difference between MTC or no MTC is $30134.47.

The part I'm not completely understanding is how the Mortgage Tax Credit works.  I'm basically looking for someone more knowledgeable than myself to share their opinion on which would be the better option long term.

Let's say I get a tax refund of $3000, if I choose the MTC program, would I receive my original $3000 + the $2000 MTC for a total of $5000?  It specifically says not a refund above, so I'm confused how it applies.  Approximate yearly income is $62000 if that makes a difference.

personalfinance,Would it be a bad idea to take equity out of personal home to be in a position to make a down payment on a second home or rental property if housing prices crash?,"My pre-tax household income is about $150k/yr with negligible growth expected in the near future. Our home, currently our only property, is worth about $400k, we owe about $200k on it.

Our (not particularly informed, savvy or aggressive) assumption has always been that we'd pay our house off, save up a downpayment for a second home, move, and keep the paid off home as a rental for additional income.

But, assuming it's reasonable to speculate that the housing market might crash, I was thinking we could refinance the home into a 30 year mortgage at .80 LTV ratio and just store the equity as cash in the bank for the next year or so. Our mortgage payment would probably go up from about $1200 to $1400. Homes like ours rent for a little over $2k/month in our area.

My thought is that if the real estate market tanks, we'd be in a position to buy a second home earlier, and put 20% down using the banked equity. We'd be able to afford both mortgages even without a renter if we had to, though obviously the idea would be to have a property that was paying for itself.

If the market doesn't tank or the right opportunity doesn't happen, the cost of speculation would be a couple refinances (pulling equity out of our current home and at worst putting it back in) and any interest rate changes. 

On the personal finance side of things, our jobs are pretty stable, and we have no other debt other than the mortgage. But the only savings we maintain is a 3-month crisis fund, run of the mill 401k, and kid's education savings. We've been dumping any extra on the current mortgage, so we don't have an extra savings that could be used for a down payment on a house (thus thinking of temporarily banking equity for that possibility).

So is this a decent idea or a bad one? I haven't really done any research yet, so I guess I'm asking if the idea is worth seriously investigating.

We have most things ironed out (emergency fund, etc.), but how to handle our debt is still a bit, well, confusing.

We have a combined $63k debt, broken down as follows

&amp;#x200B;

My student loans - federal, all are covered by a single payment

* $16211 @ 6.55%
* $4529  @ 4.41%
* $7069 @ 3.61%

Spouse's student loans - also federal

* $200/month
* $26112 @ 5.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Auto loan

* $200/month
* $12441 @ 4.19%

&amp;#x200B;

Our monthly income varies widely based on spouse's OT hours, but we typically have anywhere from $600 to $1500 leftover each month. Our emergency fund currently covers about 4.5 months of expenses and is still growing. Job security is fairly solid for my spouse, and a bit shaky for me, but he is the breadwinner so even if I'm furloughed again, we'll be ok. We are comfortable putting aside about $100-200/month as extra payments on our debt until our EF is at 6 months+

I have $120k in a high savings interest account and $38k in 401a. My total assets equate to about $180k (including liquid assets, retirement, and trade-in value of both my cars).

I am looking to purchase my first property, especially now that interest rates are at an all-time low and I do not generate much in the high yield savings account as rates have dropped. I have toured multiple homes, but I stumbled across and toured a condo that I completely fell in love with by accident. By no means was I looking for a condo, as single family homes are a better investment and are easier to sell, this condo fits my current needs perfectly as a single guy. The more I did some thinking, the more I realized how much I don’t like the idea of living in a home by myself, and rather put my focus primarily on my wants for a “home” and what I like, and this condo delivered. (Smaller, cozier space, less maintenance, nicer, more secure location, beautiful view, amazing upgrades, etc.; quite simply put it, it’s a place I don’t mind spending time in compared to other homes I looked at.)

The pros: It is located in one of the best sought-after neighborhoods in the city, is in a gated/ 24-hour guarded country club community, located down the street from million dollar estates, it sits on a premier golf course, overlooking a beautiful lake, and offers amenities to the private country club, golf course, tennis court, swimming pool, etc. The HOA docs/board is well ran and provides weekly landscaping and grounds maintenance, driveway maintenance, trash, roof maintenance, and insurance on the exterior (which is why the HOA is so high). Not only does this condo provide a stress free lifestyle of living, but it also is quite large (\~1,700 sq/ft) 2BD/2BTH, has many luxury upgrades and designer appointments, includes an attached 2 car garage, and layout that is perfect for living and entertaining. All of this is rare for a condo, and again, it is perfect for my needs and wants.

Here comes the downside: the cost. This is in the top 3 most expensive condos in the county, listed at $438K. HOA dues are $535 per month. My mortgage will be $2300 per month (PITI and HOA), which I have been pre-approved for. My monthly bills (utilities, car registration, car insurance, internet, Netflix, food, gas) comes to $540 and another $300 into my investments. That leaves me with a net monthly remainder of about $600 per month, or between 15-18% of my monthly net, everything else goes to bills/essentials/investments. I have little leftover for life\*.

\*With that being said, I do not travel, have no plans on purchasing a car any time soon, am single and with COVID going around, I might be stay single for a while so I don’t see having a family soon. Everything in the condo appears to be in good working condition with little chance of it needing repair ( I will get an inspection). I will also have about $7k in savings (retirement and investments remain the same and continue to grow) after closing which leaves a little cushion for furniture purchases, etc.

Does this sound acceptable? *(see below and read all before responding)*

Net monthly income: $3770

Total monthly expenditures: \~$3200

Net monthly leftover: \~$600-700

I know the majority of posters will say it is not a good idea and that I should look for a property that is lower cost, BUT this condo fits both my needs and wants, gives me a better quality of living, provides me with peace of mind living by myself in a nicer area, and is overall good for my mental health; all of which is priceless and something I can’t really put a “dollar amount” on. I also know there are other/less expensive properties I can buy, but I refuse to live in less quality areas given the opportunity to live somewhere nicer. I’ve always been a frugal person and have always been extremely good with my money (which is how I am able to save so much in a small amount of time, able to purchase my cars in cash, invest my funds, all while living debt free). I also feel like I’ve been saving up for so long to have my own place and now that I have the opportunity, I want to execute this long lived goal of mine. I personally feel like having \~$600 leftover each month is little, but it is definitely possible, considering my frugal lifestyle. And in case anyone asks, I do not want to have roommates to help offset the cost. If all else fails, I can always move back home and sell to get back roughly 20% equity since I plan on putting down 25% upfront.

Bitcoin,Thoughts on decentralized finance and crypto lending...,"I've been thinking about storing my crypto in de-fi accounts to gain interest but have been debating the past couple of months. I came to the realization that de-fi firms probably work with miners to issue said ""interest"" by mining more crypto hence putting more crypto into circulation (More supply smells like inflation if the amount of coins aren't fixed or haven't been issued yet). Also, by storing your crypto in an interest bearing account they're using your crypto to lend hence increasing it's liquidity. If investors are just hodling their coins, there probably is a low trading volume which is bad for any commodity or asset. I believe de-fi lending is a great use case but smoke and mirrors aside what is this really? If banks are switching to ""0"" to ""negative"" interest rates how can these de-fi firms afford to give 4-8% interest?

personalfinance,10% down payment for house right now,"Hi,

My wife and I have saved about $50k and save another $4-5k per month. We have 9 months left on our lease ($2k per month), but my wife wants to invest in a house while the market is down. We are looking at homes in the $500k range and the market is down $50k on average. 

We would be looking to save for 3 additional months before potentially doing so. Assuming the house payment including PMI, taxes, HOA, and mortage come out to $3k per month, we will likely also have to pay the $2k apartment rent for 6 months leaving us to save $1-2k while paying both mortgage and rent. 

Is it worth investing in a home now while prices and interest rate are good while sacrificing $12k in rent? Other things about us, we are in our early 30s, have about $300k in retirement savings, $275k in gross income ($15k monthly net) and $2500 in monthly debts (student loan - $2k, car payment - $600).

personalfinance,Should I start looking for a house now or wait?,"Here’s some general information before I get into my thoughts.

-	Location: Portland, OR
-	Age: 22
-	Salary: ~88-95k depending on how much I work. I’m a full time SWE making $40/hr. A raise incoming in December which will probably be 7-10%.
-	Debt: None. Own a 2008 car outright.
-	Job Security: I work in medical tech and haven’t been affected by Covid. The company had its strongest months in April and May. No chance of losing my job.
-	Retirement: I save a lot of money. I’m currently maxing out my 401k and IRA. I get a 4% match from my company by contributing at least 5% to the 401k. Company maxes my HSA. My contributions come to $2100/month or so.
-	Savings: I have about 40k in cash (30k in HYSA).
-	House price: Looking at $375k maximum for a single family home. 3bd, 2br probably. It’s expensive and over 3x my salary, but Portland housing is expensive. I also plan on staying in Portland permanently as I grew up here.
-	Rent: I was renting for awhile in a city a ways from Portland before Covid, but now I’m living at home paying a few hundred dollars in rent to my parents. I’m not very fond of living with my parents, but its helping them out and saving me money on an apartment.
-	Reasons to buy: Portland area is the final destination for me. I have a long term girlfriend that I will likely be proposing to in the next few years. We will want a space that’s our own. My girlfriend will not be part of the mortgage or payments to make things simple, as we are not married yet. 
-	Other expenses: $250/month to a nephew’s 529, $122/month for car insurance, $550/month on food (lol), $100/month in gas, $300/month misc, $40/month phone 

I really want to pull the trigger now and start looking, especially with interest rates so low. I figured I would get a traditional loan putting 5% down, plus ~7k for closing costs if needed. However, I would be paying a few hundred a month in PMI and my monthly housing cost would go from a few hundred a month up to $2100-2500. With my retirement savings as they are now, I would be cutting it fairly close every month. However, one option is to reduce my 401k contributions to 5%. This could potentially open an extra $1k or more in my budget would be much easier to handle any unexpected costs that come up with owning a house + building my emergency fund further than 3 months. Also, since I’m paid hourly, I can ramp up my hours a bit if I need the extra money. As far as saving 20% for a down payment, I know the benefits. However, without reducing my 401k, it would take me 2-3 years to do this. I also know it’s crazy to be saving this much for retirement at my age. At the same time though, the money I put into my 401k now is the most powerful it will ever be. 

Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated. Should I wait a bit? Or does make sense to buy now?",finance

Bitcoin,"[Rant] Ten harsh truth everyone on this subreddit needs to hear, or why this subreddit pisses me off","Two years ago, I had Bitcoins, Etther, liteecoin, Zccash and Rripple.

As of today, I only have bitcoins. I sold my Etther because the project is a mess. I sold my littecoin because why would I hold littecoins when I can hold bitcoins. I think Zccash is dead and rippple, well, it's just another fiat system.

All this to say, today, I have a sizeable amount of bitcoins and really no other crypto. I won't go into details, but I will say 90% of my assets are into bitcoins ATM, and I earn six figures a year and don't spend much.

Yet this subreddit pisses me off. Here's why:

**1) Too many shills.** Almost every day, on every post, there is a guy or several guys saying that bitcoin will be replaced by a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""better"""""""""""""""""""""""""""" crypto. First of all, there are no better cryptos. Yes, you can fix some of the weakness in the bitcoin protocol, but in order to do that, you have to create other weaknesses.

For instance, take gold. Know how you... can't exactly pay for your groceries with gold? Or that if you sell gold, you'd be lucky to get 90% of market value at any store? Or how you have to store it, insure it, etc etc etc. Well, bitcoin is the same. Bitcoins is NOT a solution to all the world's problem. Bitcoin is BY FAR the most solid online cryptocurrency. It's been mercilessly attacked by EVERY SINGLE ENTITY ON EARTH and survived again and again.

Bitcoin is NOT: a) fast b) a way to buy coffee and pay instantly c) some kind of online purchasing token. You can buy stuff with bitcoins, but it can take weeks to confirm. This isn't a ""bad"" thing about bitcoins, it's just the way it's been designed.

""but but but muh etther is faster!"" yes but etther has other drawbacks, it's not scalable, it's not the easier thing to mine, they haven't gotten their POS to work in years, it's not as reliable and protected, etc.

There are cryptos that are faster than bitcoins, but they all have their weakenesess. Bitcoin is ultra stable and protected against attacks. Many cryptos aren't.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2) **The Lightning network is a joke.** I personally don't believe in it. I delved a bit into it and always thought it was a joke. The idea makes no sense, having nodes and ""off the network"" transactions might work for very small, rare transactions, but on a large scale, it simply will never work. If I send bitcoins, I want them sent through the main chain, period.

People here LOVE the lightning network but trust me, it will never work. No one wants to set up 20 app and wallets for the ONE shop that MIGHT accept it, especially when it bugs half the time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3) 99.9% of cryptos are worthless.** Take for instance the Ravencoin. This shit is fuckign worthless! Why do people buy that crap? Obviously some traders grab it to speculate, but over the long term, ravencoin is going to 0. No one wants that shit. Would you invest in Zimbabwe money? Of course not. Just because it has reached higher price points and been valued at a huge market cap is MEANINGLESS. There are plenty of ways to pump useless shit crypto coins. I can't believe peopel fall for that. And ravencoin is one of the best altcoisn btw. The rest is even worse.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**4) YOU CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE** BITCOIN PRICES BASED ON PAST ACTION! Stop trying to post graphs and all that BS doesn'T work! IT DOESNT WORK! You cannot predict how the bitcoins will move, PERIOD. If you could, you wouldn't be here, you would be rich.

STOP posting ""last ten times bitcoin did this, xyz happened. NO ONE CARES.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**5) Bitcoin crash and w/e are obvious scam** and no one really falls for that shit. They do trades between accounts they own to pump up the value. These are all scams. There's plenty of that on the pinksheets.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**6) Bitcoin is THE crypto.** 99% of people have no fucking clue even what etther is, but have heard of bitcoin. Keep that in mind. My old mother knows what bitcoin is. My grandma fucking knows what bitcoin is. They saw some bitcoin ATM. They heard about it on the news. They know what it is.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**7) There is no ""bitcoin 2.0"" coming.** You people might be a bit young (i'm older), but we heard that shit all the time growing up. ""Google 2.0 is coming! Windows 2.0 is coming!"" Guess what, 20 years later, google is still top, microsoft is still top, and there's no fucking iphone killer.

There's no bitcoin killer coming neither. Bitcoin is it. Its been ""it"" for ten years and this is as good as it gets.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**8) Bitcoins prices are too low.** Right now, bitcoin is valued at $17B. Remove the lost bitocins and we are mostly looking at $12B. Twelve billions is FUCKING NOTHING in the grand scheme of things! Piece of shit Payapl is valued at $200B+ and it's a fucking scam, see paypalsucks.com

Are you trying to tell me bitcoin is not even worth 10% of paypal? Even with all the miners, website, etc etc etc. Yeah, I don't think so.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**9) There is a ton of room for growth for bitcoins.** Specifically, there is tremendous growth opportunity for an independant financial system. One that doesnt depend on the FED that just printed $5,000,000,000,000 (LITERALLY printed, they admitted it) out of thin air to pay sure their buddies wouldn't go bankrupt (airlines, banks, etc). Look at a 5 years graph for bitcoins, did it go down? Compare it to USD and inflation, which ROBS YOU blind.

\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**10) Bitcoin is the best investment today.** I cannot repeat that enough. It has so many attributes that make it attractive I just don't get why people don't put at least 10% of their savings into it. Last runup it went from what, 2k to 20k? This time it could go to 10k to 100k.

Not saying its likely, but what if it does? I mean it's happened before, time and time again. Look at annual return for bitcoins in the last 10 years, it crushed anything because unlike cash, you CANNOT PRINT UNLIMITED bitcoins. In fact, bitcoins are getting rarer and rarer, and the volume is not going down. Bitcoin is THE money to get.

People say ""but its pricey"" Yeah no shit, try to order something from someone overseas, see how much the fees rekt you. And then taxes. Bitcoins is unrelated to all of that. There will come a day where you won't have to deal with US and bullshit Fintrac altogether.

If you wanna open a bank account, you get asked 100 questions, meanwhile banks like UBS and credit suisse allow big drug traffickers and owners of child soldiers to launder BILLIONS without any consequences. So fuck that.

All in all, bitcoin's got this, and I'm tired of disinformation and shills for shitcoins no one gives a shit about (like nano, no one cares about this shit) posting every day without response.

personalfinance,Advice on Whether to Refinance Condo Mortgage Now or Wait and Re-Evaluate Later.,"Background: I'm in my late 20s and I live in Seattle. Last March, I bought a condo with a 30 year mortgage at 4.75%. I have ~$60k in student debt which I pay biweekly with additional extra payments. I am lucky because I am able to live comfortably on my salary and have an emergency fund saved up.

Without the drop in interest rates, I probably would have paid off my student loans before doing anything with my mortgage. But I'm deciding whether to refinance my mortgage right now, and if so, whether to do a 15 or 30 year. Listing out my thoughts on each below:

**30 year refinance**: With a 3.75% interest rate (I haven't really explored rates so I'm guessing), my monthly payments drop around ~$150 per month. Depending on the closing costs, could have positive ROI in a couple of years. I'm only a year into my current mortgage so I'm not extending it by much but I still would pay a lot more in interest than with a 15 year.

**15 year refinance**: The ideal in terms of payments going toward principal. With a 3.5% interest rate (guessing again), my monthly payment would increase by ~$550. I could handle it (stop paying extra toward student loans), but things would be tighter and there is risk given uncertainty with the economy and how it would affect my job.

**No refinance**: I would pay the current (higher) interest rate. But while I like my condo a lot, I don't know how long I would realistically live there. It might not be worth it to refinance given the closing costs and fees. I live in a smaller studio which is perfect for me now because I'm single and I will stay as long as my needs don't change. I don't have any game so it is probably going to be at least a few years before anything changes. When/if I decide to buy a house, I would love to keep the condo as a second property if I could but it is probably unrealistic to pay two mortgages.

I have about $1250 extra a month that I’d like to invest or pay my mortgage down. I have no other debt except the house. According to calculators online if I put that money towards my mortgage I could pay the house off in December 2034. 

I’ve done a lot of research and learned that inflation and lower interest rates make it beneficial to pay the mortgage off in 30 years and invest my $1250 monthly. 

The main question is with the market in the state it is now, my interest rate low, and no debt, should I pay the mortgage off or invest? Mathematically investing would make more sense, but wondering if I could get some more insight.",finance

investing,Feedback on my strategy,"Hi all, first post here.

I have been self-educating quite a lot over the last year on investing and have decided to finally start investing due to the recent market drop.

To be honest, I probably should have invested back in April, but anyway, I am in the long run for this as I am currently 30 years old and can afford to wait at least five years, perhaps.

So, here is my idea. I have about $10000 to risk on the market. However, I am in debate with myself whether to be conservative or to be more speculative.

Here is my idea for a conservative, almost certain investment (I say almost because I know there is no 100% guaranteed ROI anywhere):

1: Long 20-30 MSFT shares

2: Long 1-2 AMZN shares

3: Long 1-2 TSLA shares(bit speculative, but the first two would probably compensate)

4: Long AMD due to the upcoming next gen consoles. 

Although I realize there may be not much sales immediately, there are products that are maintained for at least few years and eventually the sale numbers will go up. 

Another reason I consider AMD is that it is the prefered CPU for PC streaming and that streaming's popularity has drastically increased especially this year and in the near future. 

Also, this is a covid-safe activity and will probably further increase in popularity so the demand for AMD CPUs should go up. 

As you can see, this portfolio idea involves buying less shares of more sure-thing companies.

On the other hand, I am considering to buy more shares of cheaper, established companies as well as some up and coming ones for speculative purposes.

Here is an idea of what this may look like:

1: Long as many shares of AAL and hope for another quick double like in early June

2: Long Zynga, Pinterest, Snapchat and some other gaming stocks like Blizzard etc.

I would probably go with the conservative approach but would appreciate your feedback too.",finance

personalfinance,"Got a VA loan June 2020, can I get another house in Jan 2021?","Throwaway account because I'm asking about getting a house &lt;1 year after getting a VA Loan.

I refinanced my house in Virginia in June after living there two years and immediately moved out as I got out of the military and found a job in Detroit.  I fully understand you're supposed to live in your house for a year and communicated that I was using the house as a rental property with my mortgage company and they were somehow fine with it.  Others like Quicken Loans wouldn't issue a refi.

On moving to Detroit, I signed a six month lease and fully desire to move out in December and buy a property out here.  I can wait until June but have no desire to wait that long and financially don't need to.

Can I buy another house or is there a chance I'll get totally screwed looking for a second VA loan (owe all money back immediately for breaking one year residency requirement)?  How about if I go for a traditional loan?  Also, my brief research is showing FHA loans are only for first time home buyers and that they typically have higher interest rates than VA/traditional loans, is that correct?",finance

personalfinance,Is it better to make extra principle payments on a rental property with a higher mortgage interest rate or my primary residence?,"Hey everyone! I’m thrilled to celebrate that I have nearly completed my 6 month of expenses emergency fund and looking for what to do next with my excess income. I've followed the PF Flowchart and gotten pretty close to the bottom already. I’m already contributing 15% to my 401K (including the employer contribution). The household has 3 sources of income: two fulltime jobs and a rental property. No household debts outside of 0% car loans and two mortgages, one at 4% (rental property) and the other at 3.5% (primary home). 

My next milestone is to start a family which my wife and I are actively pursuing, though not yet pregnant. In the meantime, I’m considering what to do with excess money now that the emergency fund is built. It seems a little too early to start saving for college, though we’ll make a 529 once the child is born. I could simply invest the money in a diversified portfolio. But I’m most tempted to simply make some principle only payments on my mortgages to get a “guaranteed” 4% return by not having to pay the interest. 

Some data: 

Primary House loan is 3.5% interest with $377K remaining on a house valued at $426K. 

Rental Property loan is 4.0% interest with $143K remaining on a house valued at $269K. 

Rental Income is $1440 per month after paying the property manager and the mortgage is $963 (net $477/month)

The 6 month emergency fund includes 6 months of both mortgages and household expenses. 

I figure if I’m going to make principle only payments, I should make it toward the rental property since it has a higher interest rate. However, I had someone recommend putting money toward my primary house instead. I couldn’t quite understand the logic, though I trust the person and was hoping the power of reddit might be able to shed some light on why I might want to pay down my primary first. 

I see the rental property as a savings vessel for the college fund for my future children, though I also intend to save for their college separately anyway. But if I can pay off the house in 20 years and sell it for say 300K, I’d hope that’s enough to pay for college!

I’m also open to other ideas. These are just my thoughts. Happy to fill in any more details requested.",finance

Key takeaways

The new asset change was +$6.1B week over week. The balance sheet grows for a second consecutive week.

For the last couple of weeks, the fed has been mainly unwinding currency swaps and offsetting the unwind by adding to their Treasury and MBS balances, barely touching their credit facility SPVs.

personalfinance,Any experience with worthy bonds?,"I just saw an ad for worthy bonds which I had never heard of before today [https://worthybonds.com/](https://worthybonds.com/)

They advertise a 5% fixed interest rate with no fees and you can withdraw your money at any time penalty free. Obviously this is much more appealing than a savings account, money market account, or a cash fund which only get 1% interest or less. My lendingclub account is averaging a little over 7% but it's much less liquid and obviously has some risk.

So my thinking is, what could they possibly be investing in that earns a 5% rate of return? According to their website, they only invest in small business loans that are secured by collateral, making them very low risk. But this seems too good to be true. How many businesses can their possibly be that are looking to pay a 5% interest rate when they already have assets to borrow against? A typical small business owner that owns a house for example, could typically get a HELOC using the equity in their house as collateral and get a lower rate than that if they have good credit. So that means worthy only loans to small businesses that are either A) dumb and don't know what a HELOC is or B) have terrible credit so they can't get approved for a HELOC or C) have ""assets"" whose values are heavily inflated like collector pokemon cards or something that a normal bank would never accept as collateral.

But that's just my 15 minute reaction. Do any of you have any additional information about worthy or any personal experience using the service?

Update: After reading the comments and doing a little more research I don't think worthy bonds are a good idea. It's a similar model to lending club but with a little more liquidity and a lower rate of return. But the business model is untested. They might not make enough money and need to reduce the 5% return drastically. In a few years if they're doing well then it might be a good idea to check them out.",finance

I need some income tax advice. So last year i was under the single federal income tax level of 22%  ($39,475)  by about $100 bucks ($39,348) so I was only taxed 12%. This year after a scheduled raise of .70 I will now make above the single 22% bracket for 2020 ($40,125) by just a little under $2,000 ($42,036.8) Including OT my taxable income will be about $43.5k. I would like to maximize my salary while paying the least amount of taxes. My employer has a mandatory pension plan that is taken out pre-tax that i pay in 7% of my salary and they pay in 8.26% so that is a start. I'm looking into a pre-tax 403b and I'm wondering if it is too late in the year for this to make a difference in what I'm being taxed or if I'd really have to put in a lot to make up for the first 6 months of taxed income. Or is there something here I'm missing? HRs only response to any of my questions is ask one of the 403b partners i can go through and that's it. My main question would be is the 403b worth it and will it reduce my income tax? Any help is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Tax implications of adding my SO to my healthcare plan as a domestic partner,"My SO and I are having trouble deciding what will be her best option for health care coverage if she decides to quit her job which is unsafe due to CoVid. She wants to go back to school to change careers so she may be out of work for quite some time. Financially, we will be fine on just my income and she has some other support available if needed, but healthcare is a concern if she is out of work for a while. 

I have a stable job that offers exceptionally good health care and I can add her to my plan as a domestic partner for $153/month. However, the IRS considers the portion that my employer contributes towards her part of the plan, which is around $500/month as taxable income which will result in my federal taxes increasing by about $120/month at my marginal tax rate of 24%. I am not sure if that is also taxed under FICA and my State taxes which are 7.65% and 5.25% respectively, but I will assume that it is which brings the total additional cost of adding her to my plan to $338/month.

I have looked into if we declare her as a dependent to the IRS, which would eliminate that additionally tax burden and make the $153/month fee a no-brainer, but I am not sure when she would be eligible for that. If she quits on August 1st and from that point forward is receiving more than half her support from me, can she be considered a dependent immediately? Or does she need to be a dependent for a full tax year? That may come into play in 2021 depending on the program she enrolls in. She will probably pick up some kind of part time or gig work job for a little extra income, but still probably would be receiving more than half her support from me during that year. 

The other option we are considering is an individual plan through the ACA. On healthcare.gov there are a few options that look ok, but once you start plugging in some things to the estimate the total yearly costs go up a lot. The cheapest plan has a $170/month premium but way higher deductible and out-of-pocket maximums than my plan. And, when we added some estimates for a doctors visit here and there and her regular prescription drugs it looks like the total yearly cost would work out to being more like $330/month. So at best it looks like the cost would be similar, and if she were to have something more serious happen the cost would be much higher.

However, if she is unemployed all of next year would she be eligible for medicaid or other low income health care programs? Our state, North Carolina, has not expanded medicaid so it doesn't seem like there a lot of good options there, but maybe we are missing something.

Thanks for any thoughts.",finance

personalfinance,Moving for new job - mortgage help?,"It is looking extremely likely that my fiancé and I will have to move a few hours away for a job that would start near the end of August. Ideally we'd like to buy something instead of renting. The issue is getting a mortgage when neither of us will have any proof of income. Renting in this town would cost more than buying something of a comparable size, even when including property taxes, utilities, and saving for repairs.

**Questions:**

We would have a 20% down payment for a smaller house or condo, however for what feels like only slightly more (~50%more - ok, not so slight) we could get what is basically my dream house. But that would leave us under 20% for the down payment, and so we'd also have to pay for PMI. Which alone isn't the end of the world, but when we're already trying to somehow get a mortgage with no real proof of income, just an offer letter, now we're making an already unlikely situation even less likely. Is this a possibility somehow?

*Why not just rent for a while and buy later?* Ignoring the dream house thing, the only rentals I can find are for a year-long lease. I've heard of six-month leases and wouldn't feel outrageous trying to negotiate that, but asking to rent for only month or two seems.... well, also very unlikely. If I offered we pay more in rent, do you think that's something a landlord might go for?

Another idea was to ask if the ~dream house~ would let us do some kind of rent-to-own thing for the first year. Do you guys know if that's something worth asking? 

**Other misc info:**

The mortgage (nothing else) of the dream home would be just over 25% of my fiancé income alone. (He's the one with an offer letter - I'm still job hunting. I have a phone interview later today though!)
Realistically a job in my field would pay about as much as his, so we'd double our income at that point. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is even what I consider a dream house is well within our means. It's asking price is ~3x *his* annual salary. So it feels like such a... waste(?) to have this slip through our fingers. I've listed a few questions in here, but really any advice on the general situation is welcome + appreciated.

*Why don't you have 20% for the down payment?* Covid, I guess? Because of the suspension on federal student loan interest, we got a little aggressive paying down student loans since we didn't anticipate any major expenses (ha).

*tl;dr - Want to buy a home, but won't have proof of income (just an offer letter) and to make matters worse don't even have 20% down payment. Can we make this work somehow?*",finance

financialindependence,"Today is the day! With thoughts, numbers, and graphs [M 38]","After 16+ years of employment, today is the day. I’ve hit my goal, I’m packing up my desk and leaving my job. In retrospect, my FIRE reddit user name feels  short-sighted...

**What FIRE means to me:**

I’ve been working on this goal basically from the start of employment, well before I heard the term FIRE. I’ve always been frugal and very interested in being financially independent allowing myself to work on my own independent projects. As a result, I’m viewing this more as financial independence, than retirement. I’m still a driven individual who wants to work on ideas/projects, but now I have the ability to take risks, work on what I find interesting, and ultimately I can fail on these projects. In addition. I also have the ability to take the time off giving me more time to travel and work on hobbies.

**The numbers:**

I’m 38, single, and my goal was to have roughly 75k USD a year (after taxes). After doing a lot of research and number crunching, the withdraw rate I felt comfortable using was 3.3%. That means my net worth target was 2.5 million.

Here is a graph of my net worth over time: [https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG](https://imgur.com/a/sMBawDG). The first graph is tracking just my personal investment starting with 2008 as I didn’t track my retirement accounts over time until many years later.

It took me 10 years of working to hit the 500k mark, and then roughly 6 more years to hit my 2.5 target. It’s crazy how momentum builds in the later years.

**Allocation and performance:**

Here is a rough breakdown on how I invested my money

* 45% S&amp;P 500 and growth index
* 10% Tech funds
* 15% International
* 15% Small cap
* 10% Speculation individual investments
* 5% Bonds

As you can see, I was a bit different from the ""tried and true"" FIRE strategy. I work in Tech and felt that will be the most influential industry as time moves forward. In addition, starting in 2012 I wanted some money set aside for individual investment, offering a bit higher risk/reward.

For the speculative investments, I only put money in growth companies I felt confident in never pulling out and that would continue to grow and change society. I also ensured that I felt they had a high barrier of entry for competition. These all ended up being tech companies. The majority of this discretionary amount was put into Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla. The first 2 of those have done quite well over the years. And my one potential flop, Tesla, has clearly exploded the last year. So I am quite fortunate and lucky these individual investments have done so well. And while they make up 10% of my initial investment, they make up 25% of my overall private worth now. With these, my allocation has out performed the S&amp;P500 over the years by a decent amount.

And last, you will notice on the graphs that my 401k earnings did way worse than my private portfolio (or the S&amp;P500). The offered funds had higher expense ratios, worse performance, and while I had a similar allocation to my private interments, it did significantly worse.

**Lessons learned along the way:**

2008 – This was the big one. I was lucky to have paid off my debts and just start investing in 2007, before the 2008 crisis hit. I learned a lot from that mess. When the 2008 crisis hit, I took my money out of the market after a 40% loss. Based on those results, I was frustrated and I decided to a large amount of the remaining money and put 35,000 towards a car in cash (missing the 2009 rally). Paying cash for the car seemed like the financially correct thing to do – Had I financed, that money in my portfolio would now be worth 130,000ish. While this seemed very costly at the time, learning this lesson early saved me much more in future mistakes. When this 2020 market dip happened, I remained cool, left my money where it was. At the end of Q2, I’m up 10% on the year. The amount of stories I read on people still with the money out of the market after this recovery, missing 40% recovery, hit home as the lesson I learned in 2008.

Advise from people on what is happening in the market – As I read investment analysis over the years on what the market will do, I learned that for the most part, no one knows shit about the future (myself included). I made a point to write down what the sentiment was and check 6 months later where things stood, it was wrong far more than it was correct. People in general are very emotional and overreact, I’m still shocked in how the market over reacts and then settles. I kept plugging in money constantly along the way, and that has worked.

**My take-always:**

* Don’t try and time the market 	(duh, but I had to learn it)
* You are playing a long game, don’t 	get scared and take money out as the market falls
* If you can, continuing to invest after a market fall is key. It's important have the emergency fund to help limit down-market hardships preventing investment.

**The FIRE plan now that I’ve triggered:**

As I said, my safe withdrawal rate is 3.3%. Some CAPE &gt;30 models show that having odds of failing over a 50 year period, but I am OK with that smaller amount of risk. I also feel that past result of CAPE ratios wont have the same results as they will now. The market and fed reserve tools are evolving. Clearly this is totally speculation.

I’ve reallocated money so I have essentially 2.5 years of living money in bonds/cash. I’m taking a the approach where I will live off dividends and sold allocations in good and neutral performing years. When market years are bad, I will live off withdrawn bond money, and will be reinvesting dividends. I will then be replenishing the bond money after the market has pulled out of the recession.

I plan to continue living in a Medium cost of living city in the US. Being single - living in a good city environment with easy access to people, hobbies, and having a good place to work on my projects in paramount. I was debating moving internationally, but now doesn’t seem to be a good time to consider that, I will reevaluate that in future years.

**Conclusion:**

personalfinance,Should I take out a 401k loan to pay off my car?,"Some context...

&amp;#x200B;

Car loan:

Payment: $320.19

Remaining Balance: $7182.57

I think I have 23 payments remaining 

Interest Rate: I believe somewhere around **18%**!! (Yes I know...)

I can take out a loan at 4.25%. Seems like a no brainer right? I have a very stable job going on 7 years now, and have no plans of the leaving my company any time soon. No issues with my car either, just sick of seeing all the money going to interest.  The main question I guess is, is the 14% difference in interest going to outweigh the money I would compound with that $7200 in my 401k?",finance
personalfinance,Credit Score Dropped 80 points after Car Loan,"I recently got a car loan and I started having regrets over the interest rate on it and saw that I am able to pay it off interest free if I do it before July 28th. I would save about $2,500 if I paid it off early but I was wondering if this would be bad for my credit? I was going to go ahead and do it to save the money over time but just yesterday the loan appeared on my credit score and lowered it a whole 80 points where I am now under 700. Would paying it off cause me to go even lower or will it hopefully bring me back above the 700 mark since I would have a loan paid off? Would love some advice on what to do. I am only 21 so my credit wasn’t well established yet as it is.",finance

personalfinance,Sell house to pay off student loans or refinance?,"Currently I'm in the process of refinancing my home (to a 3.25% interest rate) and it appraised out at $302k and I owe $227k (currently 4.25% interest rate) on my mortgage.  Also I have $65k in student loans (4.5% - 6.5% interest rate).  I was thinking perhaps I could sell my home and use the equity to pay off my student loans (combined with some savings in the bank).  If I did this, I would be debt free but without a house and no down payment on a new home.

I could rent for a year and save up to buy a new home within a year or two.  However with the current market I'm looking at probably paying around $300k for a similar home or if I down size I could probably get into something for about $275k (I'm guessing).

But not sure which path to take, any insight?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay Off my Auto Loan sooner?,"So I just recently refinanced a buyout on my lease vehicle. I borrowed a loan for 23k.

My loan interest rate is 2.7% on a $600/month payment for 36 month terms.

I'm thinking of paying off sooner. Looking at about 9 to 11 month if I put in $1800-$2100/month and really pushing it. 

I honestly don't have much in savings($200) nor checking($5k). But would like to be debt-free sooner. 

Would it make sense to really push for it under 1 year at such low interest rate? I have family members advise to just do a 36 month instead.

But to expand a little, due to some major money mismanagement in my younger days I’m in some financial trouble. I work a full-time, salaried job making $47K (~ $2600/month) but am currently unable to save hardly any money after rent ($1300/month, yes I live by myself), car payment + car insurance (~ $450/month), electricity + cable/internet (~ $150/month), credit card minimums (~ $600/month), student loans (~ $220) with the rest of my money going towards food, gas, and other miscellaneous expenses. Basically, my question comes down to how to best pay of my credit card debt. I’ve kind of boiled it down to two options: 1) cash out my 401k (and take the tax hit whatever that is) and use it to pay down as much debt as possible, or 2) open a new credit card that offers a 0% interest rate on balance transfers and transfer as much as I can (while taking a 5% hit on however much I transfer over), move to a much shitter apartment/get a roommate, cut out every non-essential expense, and slowly pay off the debt. 

Unfortunately, other than these two options, I don’t see how else I would manage to start paying down my credit card debt.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is (the best) money for reasons different of what you think,"Too much people have a bad understanding of money. We all know that here. But even in r/Bitcoin, we often read this :

""Bitcoin is money because it is store of value, medium of exchange and wil be unit of account thanks its fixed supply"".

This is misleading, those are the functions of money, if a money furfils them well it is a good money but stuff can have these functions without being money.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what money IS really ?

Simple: a money is a bank IOU. Money is created when a bank gives a loan. Against the IOU, the bank asks the borrower to give it an IOU for the same amount plus interest and Money is destroyed when the principal of the loan is redeem (the bank's IOU vanished, but borower's IOU interest are still there). When we talk about money, we are in fact talking about a banking system, nothing less, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of fiat money, the central bankers owns the banking systems. The ""regulation"" is the set of rules of issuance of fiat (the credit issuance work is made by the commercial banks). When the central bank says it wants X% of inflation it sets how well its money is unit of account. ""Stabilize the prices"", ""avoid hyperinflation"" truely means ""maintain credibility of the banking system"". That's why banks are always saved too, they are just the right arm of the central bank to issue credit, they are the money itself.

Precious metal like gold are popular as a good way to physically represent an IOU because scarcity and durability make them good collateral in case the bank who issues the IOU disappears but it is not money in itself (it also lacks the medium of exchange function because gold can be faked). Gold standard was just a way to issue IOU so that it furfills the store of value and unit of account function automatically and add medium of exchange function (it is easier to check a dollar is a a real one than gold) creating a very good money. This was the choice of the FED before 1971 (and the dollar becames the international money as it was the best money).

So a money is always issued by a banking system as it wish to issue it (meaning it determines who get the loans), a bank provides by its network (of ATMs, of payment processors, of credit agencies...) easy ways to exchange its IOU and backed the IOU to give them credibility. Before all banks were private but when the states started to have one, they centralized all the banking system around it and private banks were forced to issue IOU against state bank's IOU, giving birth to the central banking system and so fiat money (as money = banking system's IOU). State money don't need collateral because you need to pay taxes in state money: the collateral is that you can pay taxes and so not ending up in prison. State money is a violent but hidden freedom restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

# So now, why Bitcoin is money ?

The Bitcoin's tokens are the IOU of a bank. Who is the central bank ? The Bitcoin protocol. Each node is a bank who applies strict rules of IOU issurance: loans are for miners, preferably the first ones as the supply schedule says. ""Run a full node to be your own bank"" is litteral, by validating Bitcoin's rules you are like a bank in the current banking system, except the central bank doesn't exist, it is just a protocol you follow with others. The only difference between Bitcoin and classical banking system is that the protocol doesn't ask an IOU to the miners in exchange for the newly created money to destroy it later, it is as if the miners made in fact a deposit of their computational work and the returned IOU value depends of supply schedule and difficulty.

Now, is Bitcoin a good money ? The answer is a bit subjective but mainly yes, it is certainly the best money if we look at how it has the three functions of the money (store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account). The IOU are valuable by the same principle of fiat money is valuable: you can use the Bitcoin ledger only if you pay at least the minimum relay fees... in bitcoins ! You also have to pay additionnal transaction fees but you can also pay them to a miner directly in something else but chance are low he found a block himself. Notice however that nothing force you to use the ledger so Bitcoin is peacefull contrary to state money. Bitcoin's IOU are extremly easy to exchange since if you don't find full node for that, you can just build one as soon as you have internet access ! So bitcoins are the absolute best medium of exchange. And finally, unit of account is more subjective but in expectation the best choice is indeed choosing a capped supply to get a form of price stability.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it: Bitcoin is money because it is a (peer-to-peer) banking system. It has the three functions of money. Bitcoin is valuable because you need to pay in Bitcoin's IOU to use its ledger (which is valuable for many applications because it is backed by miners' work). Bitcoin is the best medium of exchange because it is permissionless and decentralized: if there is no bank to process your payment, you can build one for you. And finally, the capped supply is the best way to have a unit of account function when you can't adjust the money supply to the economical context automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why Bitcoin is the best money for me, if it is not the best it is at least a very good one (many are worse) moreover it is peaceful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS : what about shitcoins ? Well they have a value to use their ledger as Bitcoin, but that's all.

Bitcoin's rules take care of your ability to run a full node, not shitcoins, so they are not good medium of exchange (censorship possible).  Shitcoins ledger are not as valuable as Bitcoin's one since it has less work. And finally many of them didn't choose a capped supply and the ones who premined or issue a big part of tokens to funders effectively give them the control of the issuance schedule of IOU, so a node is not a true bank: nothing to insure unit of account.

&amp;#x200B;

PPS : transaction fees have nothing to do with medium of exchange function. Minimum relay fees is the real taxe imposed to use the ledger and gives value to the token by opening access to the work of miners (it is a commitment to avoid spam). Transaction fees is something else, it is a way for the network to pay miners for their computational work with or without issuing more IOU's depending of the schedule. As miners will mine only if they earn enough money, and as the value of the money first came from this work in the ledger, a valuable Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency can stay valuable only if it has high enough transaction fees (newly issued IOU's included, they are the hidden inflation taxe imposed to all money users if high !). Those transaction fees depends of the congestion which happens when users use the network more than what allows it to stay in consensus, they naturally increase with usage of the ledger and will incitivise miners to mine more in the short term (this will be observed when transaction fees will represent most of the block reward). So the value of the Bitcoin's IOU will also comes from the value of what people can achieve with this ledger when block's subsidy will be lower after some halvings. It is true that transaction fees paid by users (and not issued) restrict the case where the ledger can be used. But the fact that it is used by very few people doesn't make it bad ! (particulary if you can transact IOU's with other networks without the ledger)",cryptocurrency

The expenses...I have about $130k in private student loans and another $30k in federal loans. I just paid off my medical debt and am taking care of other two things that have been in collections for a while now.

DEBT:

Credit Card- $4737.02 It has an interest rate of 14.99%. We have been making minimum payments only of $97, and I swear it never budges. Neither of us have used it in at least a year and it only has a max of $6000.

Student Loans- $46965.21 We must begin paying these on 12/26/2020. We don't know how much those payments will be. I will list these with their interest rates separately:

1. $5762.00 - 3.76%
2. $4500.00 - 4.45% 
3. $4491.12 - 3.76% (currently accruing interest)
4. $6614.40 - 4.45% (currently accruing interest)
5. $5500.00 - 5.05%
6. $7519.13 - 5.05% (currently accruing interest)
7. $5500.00 - 4.53%
8. $7078.56 - 4.53% (currently accruing interest)

Mobile Grooming Van Loan- $72194.15 I just started a mobile dog grooming business and this is how much I owe on the van. This is a business debt, but I still am classifying it as a household debt because I don't want any debt anywhere in my life. I make payments of $1507.97 each month and my last payment will be on 4/8/2025, about 5 years from now. It has an interest rate of 8.34%.

Business Start-Up Loan- $32,500 This is a loan that I got from my grandparents to be able to start my business. It included a $25,000 down payment and $7,500 to cover start-up costs. I forgot what the interest rate is, I will update this post if I find it. I do know it is quite low. I'm paying around $135 a month right now which covers interest only. 

Mortgage- $75,330.25 We got a nice little house about 3 years ago, and it has been heaven. We pay $716.15 each month for Principal/Insurance/Taxes/Interest. Our interest rate is 4.75%. 

MSHDA Loan- $7500 To get our home we used a MSHDA first time buyer program which covered the closing costs and down payment.  We do not have to pay it back until after the mortgage is paid off and it has 0% interest. This is the least of my concerns right now.

&amp;#x200B;

TOTAL MONTHLY BUSINESS EXPENSES: $3300 (estimate)

TOTAL MONTHLY BUSINESS INCOME: $6300 (estimate)

&amp;#x200B;

MY MONTHLY PERSONAL INCOME: Right now I haven't taken a paycheck yet as I just started. I am very successful so far, already booked out through the middle of September and about to stop taking new clients. I plan on starting to take $500 home each month starting August 1st, 2020. The rest of my business income will go straight to paying off my grandparents once I reach $32500. After that I plan on taking $1000 per month until I have enough to completely pay the van off. Once that has been accomplished I will start taking between $3000-$4000 per month home. This all being said, I do take home cash tips to supplement my husband's income so that we can pay our current bills. 

MY HUSBAND'S MONTHLY NET INCOME: $2,140.70

&amp;#x200B;

OUR PLAN OF ATTACK:

1. Get rid of that damned credit card. We've had it together since we were 18. We haven't used it in well over a year and it doesn't move with minimum payments. Like I said I'm bringing home cash tips, so the little bit extra we have each month I have been setting aside. Every time I save up $1000 I'm going to take a chunk off of it, so it should be gone by springtime just with this method.
2. Pay off my grandparents. This is a business expense, so I plan on doing this fully inside my business. I'm setting aside at least $1000 a month in my business account just for them so that I can have it paid back within a few years. This is very important to me to pay back as soon as possible.
3. Begin paying off my husband's student loans with my $500/month income. Once I switch to $1000 a month income (after my grandparents are paid off) I will put all of that into his student loan payments, starting with loan #6 that has the highest amount and interest rate.
4. By this point 5 years should pass, so my van will be paid off as well. I can take $3000 per month and throw it at my husband's student loans. 
5. Once those are paid off all we will have is the mortage and the MSHDA loan, which will have a lower amount by this time. It should be quite easy to pay off at this point, as it will be our only debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my plan. We don't mind living frugal while we do this, we live simple lives. We are happy with what we have, don't go shopping, and don't want any more debt. We plan on cash purchases for the rest of our lives after this, we are over it.

We would like to accomplish this in the next 10 years, do you think it is doable? We want to be efficient about this, but we also don't want to wear ourselves down on the way there. This is a war, not a battle for us.

If you read this whole thing and have anything to contribute, I thank you. Have a lovely day!

P.S., I know weed is not a necessary expense. We don't drink, we don't smoke cigarettes, and we don't eat out often. Dog grooming is a physical job, and it eases my aches after a long day and helps me turn off from work. My husband and I both enjoy it together.",finance
personalfinance,"Best Way to Pay Off School for My Own, and My Parents Taxes and Credit Scores.","Hiya, first time posting here! 

Asking for help on figuring out the best way to pay off school to get the best tax and credit income for myself, and my parents.

I'm graduating this August with my B.A. I'm independent when it comes to my taxes. I work a part-time W2 job and operate my own business (private contractor/freelancer). I need to pay two separate Universities in order to *technically* graduate and get my BA. I've primarily paid my way through school, but my parents are surprising me by offering to pay everything off (meeting my payments halfway)! 

* I owe School A: $13,000. 
* I owe School B: $2,000. 
* I have around $21,000 in FedLoan from FAFSA. 

My concern is what is the best way for my own taxes, and my parents (who are both semi-retired getting pensions and working odd W2 jobs) taxes as well. I know that education credits are new with the American Opportunity Credit versus the standard education credit from the past few years. ***T******he Goal?*** How can I go about this in the best way for my own, and my parents' taxes and credits.

We've concluded three avenues?

* I pay everything off on my own, then my parents gift me the money by checks/wire transfer. 
* My parents pay everything off on their own, I don't thrown down anything.

We wanted to max out on this American Opportunity Credit, while boosting both our credit scores (namely mine since I'm 23 and started a Credit Card at 18, score around 780). However, we're concerned that something might be flagged or damaged by receiving a lump sum? We're not entirely sure how to go about this, any help or suggestions would be helpful!",finance

personalfinance,Credit Cards and Score,"Hey y’all. I know it’s generally negatively viewed to close active credit cards. However, I have $25,950 in available credit limits across 7 cards. 712 credit score, but I’m looking to close some of the cards. CapOne won’t let me consolidate the credit limits, one is via Amex, one via Chase, one via Barclay, one via NavyFed Amex and one from Synchrony for furniture. 

Card CL’s are as follows:

•Chase ($9,800)

•Synchrony ($7,500)

•NavyFed Amex ($3000)

•Barclay ($1600)

•Amex ($1500)

•CapOne ($1500)

•CapOne ($1050)

I’m really big into organization and streamlining what I have. I hate having 7 cards, which is ironic given I opened them. I used to have 9 lmao. Would it be better just to put them away (both CapOne’s, the Barclay and Synchrony) and keeping the other 3 in my wallet or should I close the CapOne’s and Barclay cards? I hate having so many to keep track of and have been using NavyFed, Chase and Amex exclusively for 7 months. Just want to try and avoid my score dropping too much by closing 3 or 4 cards over the next 6 months. I don’t carry a balance - avoiding interest - and have more than enough saved in emergency funds and savings accounts. I really just want to clean up my phone’s finance folder (the cards apps) and my wallet without harming my score too much. I’m assuming it’s best to just put them up and delete the apps than closing them as it would decrease my available CL by $2550-$4150 total. But, just wanted to see what some of y’all had to say. I’ll cross post to other subreddits over the next couple of hours.",finance

gaming,Games where matches escalate in complexity?,"I've always enjoyed such games. My first introduction was Magic the Gathering. I haven't played that game in a good many years now, due to financial reasons. I did play Mobas for a while, but I just got fed up with them. Trolling is rampant in all of them, one of the last ones I played (smite) had non-existent balance, and it was just so infuriating putting so much effort into something only for it to all blow up in your face in the end half the time. Despite this, I was unable to quit until I finally realized it was having a detrimental effect on my psychologically. I've always been afraid that I may get sucked into those bs games again.

I'd like a replacement. Preferably something offline, so I don't have to deal with other players (I often played against bots in moba games when I was getting fed up with dealing with trolls). Besides, I have a crappy internet connection it turns out, so I can't really play anything online anyway (I can't even play slitherio without significant lag, don't ask me why though). And no, I didn't experience fps drops in smite or anything, I only started to notice this when I found that game on youtube videos ran significantly slower than it did when I played it. I started testing my ping, and found it was abysmal. I was seriously playing at a disadvantage because of that, it turned out. Because of the lag, things took longer to render on my screen, giving me less time to react. I couldn't last-hit worth shit, I couldn't dodge skill shots too well, and I even had a problem with Hebo's canceling my abilities with his geyser ability, even though everyone told me that shouldn't even be possible. Apparently, because of my mild lag, my character on my monitor would appear to be doing the animation before what I did registered on the server. This meant to my opponent, I appeared to just be standing there, allowing him to seemingly cancel my abilities while I was in mid-animation. Oh, and it didn't help when I found out that matches in that game were all rigged (note that it would appear they changed the system about two years ago, so I don't know if matches are still rigged or not). Long story short, I can't play online, even if I wanted to.

Sadly, I don't know of any other games like this, besides RTS games. However, the only ones I've ever played are Warcraft 3 and Starcraft. I refuse to have anything more to do with Blizzard, because of how they personally mis-treated me just because I didn't use my real name on my account. I actually had starcraft 2 once. After that incident, I uninstalled my game, deleted my savefile (I was in the final mission), and never played it again. Never even got the expansion. Besides, the game sucked anyway. 

So, can anyone recommend something to me? Genre recommendations would be nice. I'm just looking for games with the type of match-based escalation you see in Mobas and CCGs. I'd rather have nothing more to do with either of those, just so we know.",technology

Also letting the money sitting in a 0.5% interest rate savings account isn't going to do much good.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq’s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday’s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It’s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.
*****
&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading — the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.
*****
&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Everyone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.”
*****
&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy
*****
&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; “What the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,” said Boockvar. “That’s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it’s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?”
*****
&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv’s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.
*****
&gt; “The earnings numbers overall, they’ve been pretty good. It’s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “Other parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.”
*****
&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.
*****
&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald’s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed
&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats’ proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.
*****
&gt; “Bipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more ‘realistic’ case,” writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.”
*****
&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it’s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.
*****
&gt; “Overall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),” Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.
*****
&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.
*****
&gt; “They pretty much told us, they’re all in. They told us they’re willing to do whatever else it takes,” said Keon. “The Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they’re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.”

# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week

&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.

# Dollar Weakness May Continue

&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market’s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.

&gt; This isn’t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.

&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “a weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers’ buying power, but for investors’ portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.”

&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.

# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance

&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**

&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.

# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys

&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.

&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the “stay-at-home” economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday’s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday’s close, qualifying this as a “Hot July Market”.

&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.

&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today’s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.

personalfinance,Time to Buy a Home?,"I'm gonna try and include as much detail as possible, so I apologize for the lengthy post and appreciate any and all help. Also, please let me know if you need any additional details. Happy to provide in the comments or edit my post. 

**Quick Background**: Lived in Brooklyn, NY for a year. After my dad passed, I moved home with my mom and sister and have been living in my childhood home since early 2019. That's allowed me to save, and between living at home and now coronavirus, I have been putting away a good amount of money each month, as well as starting to invest. Not sure if that's important to the story, but.. 

A few years ago, an older woman who owned the house across from my parents passed away. She left her son around $3 million - you wouldn't know it from looking at her or the house (small ranch) but she was a millionaire. The son bought a mansion in Virginia and just wanted to get rid of the house. Our neighbor's uncle bought the house (stick with me here), and rented it to friends of the family. Those friends have been a headache and can no longer afford the home. As a result, they're leaving in the next month or two and the uncle is planning to sell the house for $380k. On Long Island, $380k gets you a gutted, foreclosed home with flood damage. I'd say her home would go for $420k easily, especially with this market, but apparently the uncle is fed up and wants to just flip the house. Yes, I see the red flag as I'm typing this. My mom told me, though, and I'm intrigued. The house needs some work (I'll get to that) but it's in solid condition and was well kept. 

**About Me:**

Location: Long Island, NY

I'm 30 years old, male, working within the in-house advertising agency for a major alcohol brand. I'm grateful to work in alcohol (knocks on wood) during this pandemic, as it seems pretty stable and this company in particular did well during the pandemic. Like I said, I've been putting away around $3k/month. At the start of the pandemic I was overspending at the grocery store a bit (not just on toiler paper) unsure of the next time I'd get in there... but now my spending has lean'd out a bit. 

Salary: $90k

Savings: $60k 

Checking: \~$5k 

401k: \~$30k. My current job matches up to 8.5% and I'm currently contributing 10%. 

Investments: A **Pioneer investment worth** **$13k** (that my parents started for me at my Christening), and I have **$5k** spread out across ETFs and a few stocks 

Other: My grandmother left me a **$20k bond** when she passed earlier this year. I'd assume when i cash it I need to put away around $3k for taxes, so let's call it **$17k**.

So assuming I cash my Pioneer and $20k bond, **I currently have $90k.** 

**The House**

Going price: $380k

\- 3 beds, 2 baths

\- Taxes: Around $975/month

\- Needs new siding

\- Would probably replace windows

\- Needs new garage door, but that could probably wait

\- Needs a tree or trees taken down form the backyard 

\- Mom called out she doesn't remember ever seeing the roof replaced, but I can find out 

\- No basement, no upstairs - ranch style

\- Would need flood insurance. That's a biggie that's been driving buyers for other homes on the block away. It'd be like $1200/year

**Monthly Budget**

Car: $180-215/month

OWN my car, pay $135/month for car insurance and around $60/month for gas. House is a mile from train station and I *can* walk if I wanted to save some cash

Memberships: $70/month - Amazon, Spotify, etc

Utilities: $180 

Phone bill + storage unit - currently have my apartment furniture stored for $125/month. That bill would go away if I purchased a house or chose to move somewhere. Keeping it at my mom's house is not an option. 

Groceries/Food: $200

Travel: lol. Nothing now, but I've been putting away $200 each month because there's a destination wedding (hopefully) coming up next month and I know once it's safe I'll wanna take a trip 

Other stuff: $400-$500

On average I'll spend about $400-$500 throughout the month if there's a wedding, toiletries like deodorant and all that crap, clothes (haven't spent on clothes since last year), emergency stuff that pops up, etc. 

**My Predicament**

With about $90k to spend on a house, I'd cover the 20%, but would have very little left over to spend on the house itself, and wouldn't have 6 months salary saved away. 

I can put less than 20% down, which is normal for Long Islanders here given the COL and house prices, but I'd be paying PMI. 

I can wait, and based on the budget sheet I made. save another $40k over the next 12 months, but even after doing so, I'd be right back in the same predicament, as houses around here go for $440-$480k. 

**My Questions**

Is the house worth looking into, or would I be ""house broke""? I worked out the numbers and most months I'd have a hundred or two to save, but it'd be tight for the first year

Do I hold out and keep saving? Once could argue I'd have the literal exact same commute when I go back into the office, so wouldn't it be better to live under the same roof and just save? 

Homes in the area are going for a lot more ($440k-$480), but those homes have a basement and upstairs. Don't care about an upstairs, but I've always wanted a finished basement. 

Even if I save another $35-$40k ($133k if I use cash the Pioneer fund/$120k if I don't) then would I be able to afford something in the $420-$480 range?",finance

personalfinance,Has anybody made a US IRS withholding calculator that works?,"Hi all.  Here's my situation: about half of my total income is withheld at the ""supplementary"" 22% rate.  

Rather than try and pay estimate quarterly taxes, I request additional state and federal withholding on my W2 to make up the difference.  I don't see a way to do additional local withholding, alas, but I don't think the under-withholding penalty in NYC is large if it exists at all.

I'm probably going to spend my afternoon putting together just such a spreadsheet, where you can put in YTD income, YTD payroll withholding, YTD fed taxes paid, YTD state taxes paid, expected rest-of-year regular income, and expected rest-of-year supplementary income, and it'll spit out how much extra to withhold for both state and federal.

I'll post it as an edit to this post if I make it myself.  But before I do, I figured I'd ask - has anybody made anything like this?",finance
personalfinance,Overtime tax rate different than salary hours?,"Hi r/personalfinance! Long time reader first time poster. Gained a lot of knowledge from y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

So my question: is the tax rate for income made in the US while working ""overtime"" higher than your normal salary tax rate?

I work a 30 hr/wk salaried position and during this lockdown I have increased my hours to between 35-40. When I look at my paycheck for a 30 hour week I have paid about 20.9% in total taxes (federal income, medicare, social security), however when I worked 37 hours I paid 22.8% in taxes. Why is this?

I know I get paid the exact same rate per hour whether it's overtime or not (this is explicitly stated on my pay statement) and I know my earnings fall within the same marginal tax rate even if I worked 40 hours a week. Am I missing something obvious here?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks to several helpful comments below I now see that the discrepancy I observed was based on how withholdings are calculated during discrete pay periods with varying income, rather than how my income is taxed in different brackets. I appreciate all the thorough and fast responses! :)",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage broker to get paid $7k at closing of refinance. Is this normal?,"I realized now that I should probably have had several ""mortgage brokers"" competing with each other. I have paid for appraisal and The Work Number verification out of pocket so far (about 600 bucks). The broker showed me an estimate that showed like 9k of lender credits. I inquired about the credits and he emailed me back with a new one that didn't have the credits, but the same interest rate. I am waiting on his explanation 

But this makes me wonder, since I paid for an appraisal for this lender, I assume I am stuck with them to use the same appraisal. Please correct me if I am wrong and I can take this appraisal I paid for already and shop around with it. I assume I would have to pay another appraisal fee for a different lender if I change now. 

Can I tell my broker to kick rocks and contact the lender directly? 

Can I use my appraisal with another lender or will I have to pay for another one?

$150 auto insurance
$450 Groceries
$125 electric and water

$270 (maintenance house car etc, might not use all )
$1125  fed  loan payment 8 years left 

Total: $4726 monthly expenses
______
That leaves $10k monthly income - $4726 expenses = $5.2 k extra per month... or I’ll just go to
$5k extra 
_____
MY PLAN for $5k each month $:
$2000 extra each month to student loans pay off in 2.5-3 years 
$1000 each month for savings 
$1000 each month retirement


What’s your advice for the extra $5000 each month?

Other things we might need to consider to modify plans:
- we plan to have 2 children in then next 1-3 years  (way to factor in this cost, our insurance is good so birth appts would be $400 or less) 
- we want to get a minivan in 2 years (used but auto doors, auto seat moving, cam etc.)
- my family lives thousands of miles away, we are thinking of visiting them in 4 years maybe earlier. 
-so far if I stay in my military reserve job for atleast 20 years I will get $1300 per month, my civilian job has been as a contractor not stable, I think I might look for a good gov job if able or stable long term employer next year for a stable civillian job with retirement benefits 
- spouses job is stable long term as a teachers, spouse will have teachers pension, currently not paying into SSI (state teachers pension) but thinking she might ask HR to deduct from her pay check.

personalfinance,Credit Union refuses to finance a car loan because of the dealer we're purchasing from.,"We have Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU). Approved for a used car loan at a great rate. Just found the car and signed a P&amp;S. Working with DCU to finalize the loan and get the check cut we find out that they will not work with the dealer we're purchasing from. No reason why other than they are on a list of dealers they won't work with.

This is obviously a huge red flag for us, but we really want the car. We were preapproved through AAA for a car loan but at a slightly higher rate. We could also finance through the dealer, but I would prefer not to. Is it even worth it or should we run away from this dealer just based on the red flag from DCU and find another car?

I plan to take approximately $250K and will it partially to buy and renovate a house. Current coupon would be about \~2.5%. There is no current pay on the advances; interest accrues. I could get about $350K max commitment, with each security having a different advance rate, with a max of 80%. Securities are collateral for the loan, so it works like a margin account, except (a) better interest rate and (b) I can't use proceeds to buy securities. Underlying portfolio is in income-producing stocks and bonds (about 80% equities), yielding around 5%. Positions are relatively safe dividend payers (e..g, $O, $T, $VZ, etc.). Plan is to have dividends pay the interest on the loan and net about a 2% profit. Risks are (i) interest rates rise increasing cost of funds/driving down values of securities and/or (ii) underlying securities fall causing a margin call. Time horizon is 3 years or so; plan seems like it works if rates don't rise sharply. Please let me know if anyone has thoughts/suggestions or if I'm missing anything here.",finance
Banking,Am I overcomplicating this simple savings account assignment?,"This is driving me nuts. I have been assigned a seemingly simple project for my Java class but the question to me seems far too vague. Perhaps it's not however. Looking for some input on what calculation I should use given the instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Your goal for year 2020 is to start saving some money in order to accumulate enough so you could purchase that cell phone you want in six months. You go to the Bank of America and open a savings account that will pay 5% annual interest rate. You then decide to deposit a $100 every month in that saving account. The entire balance including the interest (usually referred to as “Future Value” will be withdrawn at the end of six months.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Required:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Part A: Do hands-on calculations that shows the balance in the account at the beginning of every month that include your monthly deposit for six months.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Part B: Create a method that request account holder’s (you) first name, last name, social security number (SS#), Date of Birth (DOB), and future value (amount accumulated at the end of 6 moths). Your program should include all the seven (7) methods listed below.*

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately (and embarrassingly) I'll have to admit that even simple financial concepts like these tend to not make much sense to me. Wouldn't I actually need to know whether this annual interest rate is simple interest or compound, or do I actually have enough info to work with here? None of the formulas I have found account for monthly contributions and calculators I have found that do account for such don't share the formula they are using. Additionally, different calculators give me different figures.

Asking the professor is a last resort here because he is a complete buffoon when it comes to questions - he practically never understands what you are asking him and treats all questions like they are dumb ([ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com) can back this claim up quite nicely). Not a single question I have ever asked this guy ever gets a real answer.

I went to apply for a car loan and was given a 15% interest rate so of course I didn’t go though with it. They only show 2 things on my credit history. I hastily went to my bank and told them the situation and that I wanted to boost my score. I ended up securing a $2000 personal loan to pay off the items in collections. 
I’m confused as to where to go from here because I don’t know if I should just let the $1700 drop off or just pay it with my loan?

Here is a list stocks that have already reported their Q2 earnings.  As you can see from this list, Intel is very undervalued at the moment. There's a total of 152 companies from the s&amp;p 500 that have reported Q2 already. So that tells me we still have a ways to go.

&amp;#x200B;

The companies at the top are the best deals. The stocks at the bottom of the list are bad deals.

I took the top 60 or so stocks and sorted them by industry to create a little portfolio. You could buy all of these and be in pretty good shape. Some industries got excluded because there were no good stocks in them like industrials.

 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjJeEKBmdpuLxdBAeqZPZSNCc946\_HLDoovqy1M7DNc/edit#gid=616174786](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjJeEKBmdpuLxdBAeqZPZSNCc946_HLDoovqy1M7DNc/edit#gid=616174786) 

Make sure to glance at the balance sheet before purchasing.  HRB just went what, 2.5 billion in debt? Not sure what's going on there. May have sold the fed bonds lol. So i won't be buying that company. If the balance sheet looks good then its a buy. Total equity and stock equity should be steadily going up over time.

AT&amp;T and Intel maybe but I think the fact that there's not many compelling deals is more evidence that the top of the market is in and we may see further declines. When I did this back in April a lot of companies looked good. I guess that's what Q2 earnings will do to you.",finance

personalfinance,Is Asset-based loan a bad idea for a new rental investment?,"Hi Everyone,

I know the debt-free spirit is strong in this post, but I wanted to get everyone’s opinion on a potential investment I’m currently contemplating. I’m currently exploring the option to obtain an asset-based loan for a new rental, 2-family investment. The collateral will be my current home, which is a 2-bedroom condo also located in New York. The estimated market value of the house is around \~500k to be conservative (could be higher when I looked at comparable sales near my neighborhood)

**About the Investment**

\- Price: $850k

\- 2 Family-house with 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (2 bedrooms each on 2nd and 1st floor with 1bed 1 bath in the basement)

\- I plan to house hack by living in the first floor and rent out the rest

\- Estimated Rental Income: \~2k on the 2nd floor and \~800 for basement

**About me:**

\- 25-year-old with a $90k annual income. I expect to reach 100k by year-end.

\- \~100k in an investment portfolio (stocks, retirements,401k)

\- Student Debt: \~17k

\- Cash: \~33k for emergency

\- Live in my current condo, so monthly expenses are low

**About the current condo:**

\- Fully paid off 

\- $400 monthly property taxes

\- $330 monthly maintenance fees

\- I feel like I’m losing 700 bucks each month without getting much benefit (vs. owning a house). So maybe selling the property will be the most ideal?

**I’m exploring a few options atm:**

1. Sell my current place for \~550k, put the cash to the new house, and obtain a mortgage. The only issue **is execution risks**. If I don’t time it right, I might need to find a rental property to live in amid COVID. It would also be difficult to find tenants during COVID.
2. Get **home equity refinance**, take out the cash, and put it to the new investment property. I would get rental income from the current condo and also income from the new property.

a. Risk: COVID and finding someone willing to rent during this time. I would also have to obtain two mortgages so my interest rate might not be the best.

3. **An asset-based loan using my current condo as collateral.**

a. Would this option be ideal? I would assume interest on an asset-based loan against the new investment property would be lower than a cash-flow loan. **How would I execute this?**

stocks,The Value of P/E Ratio in Today's Climate,"**Intro**: Hello Investors! Today I will be posting an opinion on P/E ratio. This ratio is a very important statistic used to measure how good a price for a particular security is in comparison to the amount of money said security earns. Now for the good stuff...

P/E Ratio stands for Price to Earnings Ratio. It is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its per share earnings. Per ""Buffetology"", any company that has a P/E Ratio of 25 or more is considered above fair value. While anything above 40 is considered to be trading at a ***significant*** premium cost. If you did a screener of blue chip companies right now, most would be overvalued, some of them massively so. But, is this as valuable of a metric as it would normally be? In my opinion, absolutely **NOT**. But why is this the case you ask? Here are my answers.

**Government Intervention**:

The United States Government has thrown 7 *Trillion* Dollars into the economy. What has this caused? For starters, a huge bailout for Wall Street. While I believe unintentional (this up for debate) this has definitely been the result. So, despite massive earnings dips, with wage protection and other economic backstops, these companies have managed to stay afloat. On top of this, interest rates have plummeted to almost nothing, and there is even debate on negative interest rates within the US. This has caused banks and bonds to provide negligible returns over the long term, and have driven real estate prices sky high. This has poured money into the stock market because there is no where else for people to put their money for decent returns. All of these different trends inflate stock prices from their true value, which makes P/E a less valuable measure.

**Circumstantial Earnings Drops**:

The majority of companies out there have been impacted negatively by coronavirus. Some for the whole time this pandemic has occurred, other just partially. Most blue chips (but certainly not all) will be able to recover from this and continue operating as normal, and some already have or in the most rare of cases done better. With earnings dropping, the denominator in the P/E ratio has been reduced, which obviously increases the number. Understand that for most companies that this is drop is circumstantial, not permanent, and is not indicative of the company's future.

**Low Interest Rate Environment:**

While I am very cautious with companies taking on debt, it would be silly to not take this into account. As discussed earlier, the interest rates in the US (and really around the world) are negligible. While this means diminished returns in fixed income investments, this simultaneously means cheap (or even zero interest) loans. Companies will be able to take on more debt with less of a concern on the payments crippling them once the status quo is restored.

**Conclusion:**

Considering all of these factors, I believe that looking at past earnings and future earnings projections are the only true way to get a proper fair value. You should also look to include average past earnings or projected future earnings in your DCFs as well. Do I believe you will uncover a lot of undervalued companies using this method? Not at all. However, you will see a significant decrease in P/E ratio, and be a little closer to the true value of the companies you are researching.

personalfinance,Looking for best approach for tackling significant student loan debt,"I'm looking for some input on my wife and I's current situation related to student loan debt. Here is our current picture:

Debt: I have 67k in student loans with recent refi at 3.5%, wife has 315k in federal student loans at rates ranging 6-7% (though this is at 0% through September).

Assets: $120k cash in savings account, $150k in non-retirement brokerage account, total retirement account balances (between the two of us) at $140k.

personalfinance,Credit Card History,"Looking for opinions here. 

When I turned 18 (I’m 30 now), I opened up a Discover credit card so that I could start building a credit history. It was a student card that offered 0% interest as long I was enrolled in college. Long story short, I got a job on staff at my college, so I was able to stay in school for free (staff benefit) for way longer than normal while also working a full time professional job. The kicker is, when I finished school, the credit card company kept my interest rate at zero...for years. 

 I continued to use the card to pay for small expenses like gas up until two months ago. Even though I had a 0% interest rate, I still kept the balance below $100. 

Two months ago, I decided to just pay the card off and not use it anymore. The only reason I kept it so long is because it was my oldest line of credit and it helped my credit score. 

Flash forward to this month and they’re now wanting to charge me $99 a year to keep the card open. 

I’m trying to weigh the positives and negatives...should I keep the card open and pay the $99 a year, or should I close it and risk dropping my credit score due to my average length of credit availability decreasing?

I’m heavily leaning towards keeping the card open, but I’m certainly open to thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,How should I go about finding the right mortgage lender as a self-employed first home buyer?,"I live and run a small business in Austin and am looking for a home here.  My girlfriend and I have talked about purchasing a house but haven’t made any concrete steps towards it.  It all changed when we got the news that we were pregnant. We’ve known for several months now but after hearing about how low the interest rate is right now and having heard rumors that Tesla would be moving here which is now confirmed to be true, we are officially house hunting. 

The problem is, I haven’t saved much to prepare for a sizable down payment.  My credit score pulled from experian and credit karma is 690 and 730 respectively. I spoke to a mortgage lender that my realtors have been suggesting and he gave me a rough estimate of the interest rate (4.5%). I plan on purchasing a home preferably below 280k with a 50k down payment.

personalfinance,"How to find appropriate legal/financial professionals? Questions of real estate, stock, a break up.","I’m going through it right now. I’m breaking up with my long-term live-in boyfriend and am not sure where to turn next to rebuild my life. I have lots of questions, and rather than looking for answers to those questions, I’m seeking advice about how to locate appropriate financial and legal representatives who may be able to assist. Advice on what to look for and ask in a professional is much appreciated!

(Please be kind)

Relevant details:
Boyfriend and I currently rent, we have not yet discussed the terms of our separation or a timeframe. I’m praying we can find some flexibility here, but who knows.

I’m hoping to buy a home. First-time home buyer, would not qualify as low-income. I’m nervous about the market - my uneducated sense is that housing prices are currently overinflated, so it would be best to wait. I may not have that option due to aforementioned breakup. Then again interest rates are low right now.

I live in Boston MA, and am not sure what kind of home I’m looking for yet, so I’m hoping a quality real estate professional can help me narrow down my search. This situation is not consistent with what my long-term plans would have been, making decisions more challenging and expert/compassionate guidance all the more important.

A condo or suburban starter home in this market would be around $500-$600K

My financial situation:
- Roughly $50K liquid, no debt
- Bought into my company’s EPP program at a 15% discount on stock, first vesting period ends in about two weeks. Expected to net $6K or so from this, but am concerned about capital gains implications. This $6K payout comes every 6 months.
- Have been granted approx. $100K in stock that vests over 3 years, in different timeframes. The first $20K vests in November, which is too far away to be relevant for this conversation and again I have concerns about capital gains taxes
- $3K or so expected to be deposited into my account as windfall from a corporate acquisition last year where the payout is currently in escrow
- Probably not relevant, but as a corporate benefit, I have paid into access to legal services, but am concerned about their quality
- I have more than I need currently in my 401K (mix of  Roth and IRA) but will not liquidate it. I can afford to reduce my monthly contributions.
- Over 800 credit score

By my count, it feels like I cannot afford to rebuild my life in a modest but nice little new home or condo given the situation above. I hope I’m wrong.

To reiterate, I am not looking for free tax/legal/financial advice but rather advice on how to locate such professionals (and avoid common pitfalls) that may be best for my personal situation.

I've been saving for about 3 years now, and I'm up to about $50,000 in savings &amp; short-term CD's. However, interest rates have gone to crap (2 years ago I was getting 2.55% on my savings, now I'm at 0.95%).

personalfinance,Should I dip into my savings to finish paying off student loans while interest rate is 0%?,"Hello!
About me: 27 years old, masters degree, job in my field, no credit card debt (I pay off my balance in whole every month). I’ve been fortunate enough to keep getting regular paychecks throughout the pandemic and have no concerns about this changing. My salary is a little over $60k. 

I’ve been diligently budgeting and paying off my federal student loans since I graduated/got my first job about 2 years ago. My loans started out near 38k. I’ve paid off about 20k in those two years, and about 8k in addition to that during the pandemic while expenses are lower and the interest rate is 0%. I have about $8500 left to pay, which is very exciting! When at the normal interest rate, my 4 loans range from about 3.5% to 5%, and I’ve been targeting the higher interest loans first, paying the less on the lower interest ones. 

I have $10k in a savings account, about $11k in retirement funds (401k and 403b). My expenses include rent, utilities, car/gas maintenance, food, etc. - the basics!


With the interest rate being 0%, I’m wondering if it would make sense to dip into my savings to finish off my loans completely. My mom is encouraging me to do so, reminding me that if anything happens that I would need my savings for, she can back me up and support me. I totally trust her and she’s very responsible with money, so no concerns there. 


What do you all think about me dipping into my savings to finish off my loans before the 0% interest rate is removed?

personalfinance,Taking advantage of the low interest rate,"Hi.  I've been considering buying a home for a long time now, but there wasn't a need since I don't have my own family yet. 

I currently make 84k/year (stable), credit score around 780-800 via those bank apps, no debt, and no recurring bill outside of current rent, car insurance and phone bill.  I am also a veteran, so I can get a VA loan.

I checked costcofinance today and I looking at stupid low rates like 2.250% on an 800k loan with 1.3% down payment (30 year-fixed), and I feel like I need to take advantage of this somehow.

Sorry if the questions are dumb.  I don't have any experience with this.

What is the best way to lock in this rate when I'm not ready to buy a home yet?  Can I just get the loan, have the money dumped into my bank account and start making mortgage payments until I'm ready to be a home owner?

Is there any other way to lock in this rate?  If not, is it wise to take a second look at buying a home to rent out rooms to tenants in the current environment?",finance

personalfinance,Cash-Out Refinance?,"With interest rates as low as they are right now, im strongly considering refinancing my single family primary residence. My current rate isn't terribly high, but with some number crunching, it looks like I could still save almost three hundred a month (with a loan for only what I owe). That being said, I have about 50% equity in my home and have some repairs to be done. So, a cash-out refinance was my first thought. Even with a higher loan amount and the cash out, I'd still be saving just under one hundred a month-ish. Note - I say all of this realizing that I'll incur multiple thousands in fees and closing costs.  And also, I'm not worried about re-starting the 30-year clock on my mortgage - I don't plan on moving from this house any time soon

Can you all share your experiences with cash-out refinances? My current mortgage is a Freddie Mac loan that didn't require an appraisal at the time. Are appraisal-less refinances still a thing today? With COVID, are banks so backed up that refinances are not their current priority? My last refiance was with a brick and mortar bank. Are the online-only lenders reputable enough to consider? Last but not least, I know how high mortgage rates have gone historically, can they realistically go any lower than they are now? 

Sorry so many questions; just a lot to consider. It just seems crazy not to jump on this...",finance

investing,"Gold,silver,mining bull market guide","Guideline to Investing in gold/silver/precious metals/mining and make it a long lasting and sustaining bull market.
How do Banks manipulate the price of gold/silver/precious metals/mining? SHENANIGANS
(Futures/COMEX/LBMA)
-Banks suppress prices by holding massive net short positions on the futures market/COMEX/LBMA.  
-When there are increased buying of gold/silver and banks are holding all-time highs in net short positions, they have 1 available move to make(Increase their net short position).  By increasing their short position, there are 2 possible outcomes
-They short so much that it induces a price smash to trigger limit stops, which allow them to cover their shorts by the induced artificial selling. (This has the effect of dampening investor demand)
-or they just build their net short positions and hold prices steady (most of the time this works, but if they are unable to discourage excess new buying into the assets, they run the risk of becoming vulnerable if the demand does not wane).
-When investors are standing for delivery in hopes to drive up prices, Banks end up borrowing from other holdings such as ETF’s/country’s storing gold/silver with the Federal Reserve/LBMA.  If there are no physical precious metals available to borrow to supply for delivery, Banks offer to pay a premium to get out of their contract obligations.
-Banks count on being bailed out, so they just continue to increase their net short position to infinity.
(ETF’s) 
-Banks also suppress prices by using ETF’s to absorb new flow of investors into this asset space because it is an easy option for new investors that know nothing about this investment space.  Most new investors that know nothing start by investing in ETF’s to get exposure into this asset.  
-By absorbing the flow of new investors into this space, Banks are able to short these ETF’s.  By shorting ETF’s, there is no need to issue new shares for ETF’s and the ETF wouldn’t have to add to their physical gold and silver holdings.  This turns the net demand into physical gold/silver to equal 0.
-When banks are vulnerable, they will most likely borrow physical gold/silver from ETF’s to meet obligations when investors are standing for physical delivery. (In essence, by borrowing physical metal from other holding to meet investor demand standing for physical, Banks are basically shorting precious metals)
(Lehman/Bear Stearns)
-I believe that Lehman/Bear Stearns had developed such a massive net short position that they had to go under in order to tank the Stock Markets and drag gold/silver along with it in order to cover the net short positions that they were unable to unwind at the time.
 
Buying Strategy
-Initiate your gold/silver position(20-50% of your net worth)
-purchase physical gold/silver
-purchase mining shares
-Be ready to buy when there are obvious price smashes.(1% of your net worth each time)
-Have a set amount your willing to purchase regularly to dollar cost average.
-By being ready to buy and adverse to drops in prices, it allows for prices to recover and more investors to flow into this asset space.

-401K’s can invest in gold related assets.  Many major corporations allow for transfer of assets into Self Directed Retirement Accounts.  There are mutual funds the have exposure to gold related assets.
-Have an exit strategy if you are heavily invested.  For those heavily weighted in gold assets, look to shift out a little at a time on strong market/gold market up move days to unload, and shift to inverse market assets.  That way, when the market turns and drags gold along with it, you will have more money to shift back into discounted gold assets.  (Remember, sell the rips and buy the dips)  By shifting a small amount at a time, if you are early and the market/gold market continues to move up, you have another opportunity to shift assets again.",finance

Combined ALL our cash assests would be enough cash for 20% down and should cover closing costs at the top end. With the rates so low right now should we pay the full 20% or do a smaller percentage in order to invest/more liquidity?

Prior I always planned for 20% down and that our monthly housing costs (mortgage, taxes, and insurance) would be about 40% of our take home AFTER retirement contributions. I make 2/3rds of our household income and work under the county in an ""essential"" job. It's a union job, so my job and yearly raises (3.75% each year over next 4 years) is pretty secure. My retirement is a pension that would pay ~60% and I max out my 457 plan ($19k). My fiancee works in the private sector and has only been contributing 3%!! so far. We'll fix this after we buy the home and get a handle on the expenses.

After talking to some lenders one mentioned not needing to put the full 20% down because it's pretty much ""free"" money right now. Pay 5% down and invest the rest.

With the current economic uncertainty, should we pay in cash for our first home? Or should we take a loan and take advantage of low interest rates?

- Avoid closing costs (not clear by how much by looking at online resources) 

- Unclear what would we invest in with the recessionary envt (our ETFs haven't been doing great)

personalfinance,Refinancing on Car Loan? - Advice Needed,"Hi all,

So this is my first actual post. I’ve simply stalked from shadows for the last year or so, so thanks in advance for your response!

I’m seeking advice on my Car Loan in particular. I also have a student loan through Fedloan that’s at a balance of about $6.6k, but due to the CARES act, forbearance is currently applied. I’ve been doubling down on that payment since April, and because it has no interest at the moment it’s not quite as concerning as the car loan is.

I’m not particularly sure how to refinance a car loan, but I’ve gathered that since this is the loan with the highest interest rate, I’ll want to address this loan first. 

Here are the loan Details:
- Fixed Rate Car Loan through USAA
- Original loan: $16.5k
- Interest Rate: 12.30%
- Current Balance: $8.85k

- Interest paid last year: A whopping $1,446

My loan, at this rate, will be paid off March 2023. My VW Jetta’s mileage has just made it past 90k miles, and so I’m at a crossroads. Do I try and refinance this vehicle through USAA and continue to maximize the vehicles usage? Or, do I trade it in? What even happens to the loan when I do that? I’ll consider all options!

personalfinance,Timing Refinance?,"Currently mortgage loan is at whopping 4.875% for a large sum of $, took it out on 4/2018, what will it likely change to if we refinance to today \~3.XX%? (Based on the current interest and loan origination date, high credit score).

&amp;#x200B;

General knowledge about interest rates and not being an economic expert lead to this, but is now a good time to refinance? This question easily could have been asked 2 years ago but the answer is simply no in the 'present future', because the 30 Year Mortgage interest rate is far lower than 2+ years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming mortgage loan rates move relative to 30 Year T-Bonds which are so close to 0% (We are at 1.226 % now as of 7/26/2020 for 30Y T-Bills), they can't possible go down any further now can they; ASSUMING the US will not go into negative interest rate territory is the bet. We only have 122 basis points to go before we get to 0 which is not a lot but still quite some change.

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe we are going to get close to 0% and NEVER negative, closest I bet is 0.5%. After that 4-5 years out, will the Fed and J Powell or the next chair raise interest rates? When they raise them, having the refinance being locked at this low % for 7 years is very favorable, correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Assume the interest saved is greater than the refinance fees. Is now a good time to refinance or a year and half out out when I predict 30 Year T bills will go down to 0.5%? (Assuming the crystal ball works). Can we time this thing?",finance
personalfinance,"I can afford to pay off my CC balance, but it's 0% apt through the end of the year. Should I pay now or wait?","I signed up for a CC last year which offered 0% apt through 2021. I currently have a balance of around $2,500 and with my tax refund, I can easily pay it off. My initial thought was to put this money in my house fund, but I think paying off my CC will have a better impact on my credit score.

To be clear, I will be able to drop the CC balance to 0 regardless of which path I take, and will do so no matter what.

As I see it, my options are:

A. Pay off CC, and pay $1000 to my house fund from here on out. My credit score goes up slightly since my utilization drops to single digits, but my fund liquidity drops slightly.

B. Pay to my house fund, and trickle money into my CC balance by the end of the year. I earn a small amount on bank interest rates, and have higher liquidity, but credit score is less favorable as utilization is higher.

No credit card debt. 2015 70k miles Car paid off. Credit score 805. 

Emergency savings: 13k

**TLDR: I might have a full-time job offer, but I desperately want to grow my two budding businesses into a full-time thing. I don’t have the energy or willpower to work two side hustles on top of 40 hours. This may prevent GF and I from getting a house/starting our lives. The thought of giving up and working an 8-5 is soul-crushing.**

I’ve been out of work since January. Moved cross-country just in time for COVID to dry up the job market. I only just started getting unemployment 2 weeks ago, but in theory will be getting \~$12k in back pay (after fed withholding) at some point in the future, in addition to weekly payments. I am in WA, USA.

I am living rent-free with my long-term GF and her parents. Alcoholism and high stress is involved, though we are grateful. My unemployment payments will take care of my bills, even after the $600 bonus ends next week. The unemployment back pay will cover almost all my credit card debt (I know) and GF’s as well. We don’t intend to marry, but have been together 5-6 years and are looking to buy a house in the next 6 months if I can get steady work, which has been VERY challenging.

On Friday I had a very positive job interview and it was made clear I need to tell them if I feel this job is for me to proceed. Full time, good benefits, $16.50/hour, which is decent for our area. Generic desk-jockey job. GF makes $15/hour full time.

Trouble is, for the last 3 months I have been busting ass working on launching two businesses. GF has sunk $3k investing in these. The first one launched Jun 1 and I am selling a modest but growing $400 in product/month, half of which comes back as “payroll”. The second will launch in September but has been advertised on social media and has a following waiting to purchase product. Conservatively, I am estimating this will pull $1,200 in payroll/month, but I can’t guarantee that. Point is, a LOT of our money has gone into this and I am starting to see a return on investment.

I don’t want to give up these businesses/dreams/hard work/investment to be a pencil-pusher again. I have ADHD, chronic pain, and anxiety/depression, and being able to work on my schedule on projects I actually enjoy doing has been profoundly positive for me. I have always struggled to thrive in a normal office job. GF knows this and supports me (obviously she has put her money where her mouth is more than I could ever expect).

But at the same time, if I go hard for this job we might get a house within a few months. The immediate boost to our income will let us knock off any remaining CC debt and start being aggressive with student loans ($35k total). It’s a better start. It’s what makes sense financially, but I feel absolutely crushed thinking about doing it. I don’t want to fuck over this potential employer, either, by telling them I’m the one and then bailing in 3-6 months. I guess I shouldn’t care, but I do.

Had a heart-to-heart with GF about this. She says as long as I get that unemployment back pay and we can wipe out the debt, she fully supports me doing my thing because she knows it’s good for me and has always hoped to get me out of the workforce. She is wonderful and I know she is committed to that but I feel fucking selfish considering not jumping on stable employment. Between the free housing and unemployment, I feel like I will never get another chance to build the life/job I've always wanted.

I don’t know what to do. I know what I WANT to do, but I don’t know if it’s right.

personalfinance,"I'd like to refinance my home. To improve my credit score before i do, should I withdraw from my stock portfolio to pay down credit card debt?","Hi folks.

Hoping this is an appropriate question for the sub.  I've got a fair amount of credit card debt and a bought my home a couple years ago.  I believe it's time to refinance because the rates are low and my property value and salary have both risen since I first acquired the mortgage.

Here are the numbers:

* Current Mortgage 235k @ 5.2% interest, current estimated property market value 275k
* Income 140k, Credit Score 650\~, 33k\~ in CC debt (58% utilization), no savings
* 50k$\~ in stock portfolio, primarily vested option grants

If I lose PMI and lower the interest rate, I believe I could refi into a 15 year mortgage and easily make the payments.  However I'm concerned that my credit score will prevent me from getting a good interest rate.  This credit card debit is quite annoying..

Should I liquidate some of my portfolio to drop that utilization down to under 30%?  Will that make much difference to my score and the interest rate offers I receive?

I've also received offers to roll all of my credit card debt into a refinanced mortgage...  Which may make more sense presuming the equity I've gained covers it?

Perhaps a combination of both?

personalfinance,Refinance from 20 yr to 15 yr conventional (currently have 17 yrs left)?,"Hi everyone! First time posting in this forum after lurking for years. Hoping you all can provide insight.

My current mortgage is a 20-year conventional through Chase at 3.75%. I currently owe $221k. My home was appraised at $325k in late 2017.. 

I am pre-qualified to refinance into a 15-year conventional at 2.75% also through Chase. There are no points, and only a $500 ""good faith"" payment to lock me into this rate for 45 days and allow them to begin this process.

My wife and I have excellent credit (\~810/815). I am not looking at extending the loan or cashing out, just reducing the interest and shortening the mortgage. 

My current mortgage (+ homeowners/property taxes) is $1888 per month. I autopay half my payment every 2 weeks ($944), which results in 1 extra payment per year.

My new monthly payment would be $1994. I would also set it up to pay every 2 weeks so that I make an extra payment each year ($997 every 2 weeks).

On the new loan, my closing costs would be \~$6000, rolled into the new 15-year mortgage.

Does it make sense to refinance to a 15 yr or just increase the amount I apply to the principal each autopay? If I were to just apply an extra $200 / month to the payment on the higher interest rate loan, does it even make sense to refinance and add $6k in closing costs into this new mortgage?

Is a 1% reduction in interest rates worth the hassle and time (and closing cost?)

I spoke with Chase today, and have yet to move forward, but was wondering if anyone had any advice?

personalfinance,Is it better to put more or less money down on a duplex?,"Also posted this to r/realestateinvesting

I'm purchasing a duplex which is my first property at 136k. I will be living in one unit and inheriting a tenant who pays $700 a month in rent.

I have the option to put as little as 10% down. Would this be a good move? Is it generally better to put less money down to increase the greatest value of return?

I had anticipated putting 20% down until a lender told me I was eligible for a first time home buyer's program and could put less money down at a lower interest rate of 2.875%. Obviously my monthly payments will be more and I will have a low PMI of $30/month, but which ever route I take, I will not be living for ""free"" based on the rent of the tenant. I will still have to pay regardless if I put 10% or 20% down. I would like to only stay here no more than a couple years before moving on and renting out my unit. Then is when the rent from both would more than cover the mortgage. What would you do?

Any and all advice is appreciated!! Financing is a huge deal and it's stressing me out.",finance
personalfinance,I was married last year while still in college and my wife was under her parent's insurance for the entire year.

investing,Company Debt Analysis - I created a checklist to help investors understand things to look for when analyzing a company's financial health - particularly in regards to the amount of debt they have and if they can afford to pay it.,"If companies cannot afford to pay their debt then eventually they will go bankrupt and you, the shareholder, will be left with NOTHING! How much debt a company has and more importantly if they are able to pay back their debt is essential to know before investing in the company. Ultimately companies who become too over-leveraged with debt may face trouble repaying it if their revenue declines, their earnings drop, if interest rates rise or in the case of COVID-19, an unexpected black swan event comes out of nowhere. Below is the checklist I use when analyzing the debt of a company.

Debt Analysis Checklist:

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt   
\- Remember use only ""Term Debt"" both short term and long term   
\- Liabilities are NOT Debt  
\- Ideally total debt would be decreasing over time, however, more important than the total dollar amount is whether or not the company can pay it

Step 2: Calculate Debt to Equity  
\- Debt / Equity = Long Term debt / Shareholder equity   
\- I do not include Short Term debt in the above equation unless the company does not have enough cash/cash equivalents and short term investments to cover it  
\- Ideally companies would have 25% or less debt

Step 3: Does the company have positive free cash-flow?   
\- We want to see positive free cash flow. This means the company is actually bringing in ""cash"" which it could use to pay back debt  
\- If a company has negative free cash flow then it's not bringing in any money!!! How can they pay their debt obligations with no money?

Step 4: Does the company have enough cash/cash equivalents/short term investments to cover short term debt?  
\- We want to see companies have enough cash/equivalents and short-term investments on their balance sheet to cover short term debt

Step 4: Does the company have enough free cash flow to cover short term debt?  
\- If the company is free cash flow positive, does that amount meet or exceed its short term debt obligations. Ideally it would.

Step 5: Check the income statement to see how much the company's interest expense is.  
\- Does interest / dividend income cover interest expense? This would be ideal!  
\- Does operating income / EBIT cover interest expense? If so what is the TIE ratio (times-interest-earned ratio: EBIT / Interest Expense). The higher the number the better!

Step 6: Look for trends in net income and free cash flow  
\- We want to invest in companies that make money and have positive free cash flow. If these numbers begin to go negative then investigate and determine if the company can turn things around.

Step 7: Calculate the company's overall cash position  
\- Overall cash position = cash + equivalents + short term investments / Long-Term Debt  
\- Higher the number the better.

Step 8: Remember not all debt is bad. What is more important that the total amount of debt is whether the company has the operating income, interest/dividend income, or free cash flow to cover it. Even if they took a significant hit to revenue - would the company still be able to pay its debt obligations - those are the types of companies we want to invest in!",finance
personalfinance,Starting out my life. Need advice for what to do with my doll hairs.,"22M here, just graduated college in may. Luckily with everything going on I got a full time ""big boy"" job. I am making 76k anually before taxes. I am currently maxing my 401k at 25% since I live at home and do not have any real bills. Also, I am saving up as much as possible.

Now for the bad news:( I have about 110k in private student loans (4.43%) and 20k in federal student loans (currently 0% because of COVID). (Yea i know this sucks and i made a bad choice going to a really expensive school for two years and luckily transferred, otherwise my debt would have been doubled.) So my grace period is coming to an end soon on my private student loans and my payment is going to about 840 a month. Obviously this is manageable with my current income and lack of other bills. Also, I plan to pay 1000 instead of the 840 to hopefully cut my loans down a good bit.

So, my questions. Should I be doing anything else with my money? I really want to move out and start my life (living with my parents isn't horrible, but not ideal) I want to move in with my girlfriend and think renting is a massive waste of money and I have already wasted a ton of money on my bachelor's degree... Any thoughts or opinions about buying a house soon would be appreciated. Planning on starting my Master's next year since my job will pay for about 85% of it.

That's about it. Any help would be appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

So lets just get down to it:

I graduated from college in May of 2020 with my degree in computer science and currently have a salary of $65,000 a year

Sometime in 2016, I invested about $1000 into crypto currency (in its peak it was worth 35k but I was stupid and didn't sell lol - it is what it is), as of current its value is about $7200

&amp;#x200B;

Current Assets:

CryptoCurrency: \~$7200

Savings Account: \~$5500

Stock App / Stock Investments: \~$2000

&amp;#x200B;

Current Debts:

Credit Card: \~$4000 (Used to pay for school when loans didn't cover the total tuition - currently 0% apr probably for the next 4 months or so)

Student Loans: \~$22.5k (Somewhere between 3.75% and 5% according to [https://finaid.org/loans/historicalrates/](https://finaid.org/loans/historicalrates/) (I took loans out 2017-2020) but they're currently on 0% until September since Covid and whatnot)

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses:

Rent $750 / month

Utilities $120 / month

Groceries \~$200 / month

totaling: \~$1250 / month roughly with other random stuff (I work from home so gas and stuff isn't really a factor for the time being - nice!)

&amp;#x200B;

My Biweekly paychecks come out to about $1700 from $2500 after 401k contribute, Employee Stock Matching, and Taxes, insurance, etc...

My yearly take home is roughly $50k/year after everything said and done. This is all just quick math so its all kinda rounded. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is - do I just sell my crypto and know out that credit card and even start digging into those federal loans? Or Should I hold onto it and just use my extra non-monthly expenses money and pay it off?

datascience,Genealogy Project,"I am something of an amateur genealogist. In genealogy, when researching a family history and/or ancestors, as you go further back in time, you sometimes (or eventually) hit what’s called a 'brick wall'. That's the term for when you are unable to proceed any further in determining who somebody was, who their parents were, where or when they were born or died, etc. This is often the result of insufficient record keeping. As you can imagine, as you go further back in time, record keeping becomes more and more of a problem. 

As a result of a brick wall I’ve hit, I’ve decided to try to attack my ‘brick wall’ in something of a different angle - with data science/analytics. I’m not a data scientist. I have some experience with web analytics (implementation, analyzing, and reporting), but certainly not at the level of the posts that I see in this sub. 

My hypothesis is that I can use known social relationships/networks/interactions in a specific region within the U.S. across 70-80 years (multiple generations) to try to answer some of my questions, the main one being, “of this selection of candidates, who is most likely (and to what likelihood) to be this person’s father and mother?”

The data that I have includes (1) the entirety of the Federal Census records for three counties where all family are known to have lived, (2) church birth records, if/when available for churches within those counties, (3) marriage indexes (which do not include birthdates) for many or most marriages within those three counties, and (4) an incomplete, but sizable, collection of tax records.

What I’m thinking is that of the people who interacted with each other, whether that’s as bondsmen in a marriage, witnesses at birth/marriage, people who lived near each other, or people who were in some other way a part of each other’s social network - their parents also interacted with each other in some or similar ways. Friends of family span across multiple generations. Person A is best buds with Person B because, in part, their parents were best buds. I have seen this several times earlier/later in my own family tree, and it’s pretty interesting to see this insight. 

So, I wanted to reach out to ask for any suggestions/advice anybody might have about how I should go about this. I would appreciate if you can comment or PM. I’m willing to learn what I need to, in order to accomplish this task, even if it takes some time.",technology
stocks,"Toronto-Dominion ($TD) is Undervalued, Long-Term Buy (and Banks in general)","I was going to write something super long and windy, but I'll keep things short and sweet.

**Overall Investing Thoughts:**

**I personally feel like people are way too crazy and overhyped about Tech &amp; Healthcare stocks rn when both of these sectors are extremely overvalued.** I probably scroll past 20 posts **per day** about whether Microsoft at X price on X date is a good buy before I call it quits haha.

Nonetheless, I feel like **one of the sectors being overlooked is Banks/Financials**, due to the nature of Federal policies/interventions and other detrimental affects of the Big Rona on business and loan repayments.

Obviously **in the SHORT-TERM**, these companies are going to face hardships and rocky-seas, however if you are **long-term investor**, these companies are at a pretty solid sale. 

As good ole, Warren Buffet says: 

&gt;""It's better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price""

I believe that some top financial banks are at a good sale to be held onto for the long-term. Heck, even Buffet increased his stakes in Bank of America just recently. (Although I will say I think BAC is a little overvalued rn)

**JPM** is a strong company I'll mention that is at a decent sale at a **23% Margin of Safety (MOS)** at it's current price point, as well as **Royal Bank of Canada ($RY)**. I will note that $RY is **only at a 15% MOS** and I don't have any positions in $RY, but I would have if: 1) I didn't already have too many bank stocks, 2) I didn't like TD more, and 3) if I had more capital since I'm a small time, young ""investor"". 

\*I got my MOS from Gurufocus's DCF calculator\*

But I digress...

**TD Snapshot:**

26MM global customers, 2300+ locations, retail-banking focused company, and 3 Business Segments: Canadian Retail (60% of revenue), U.S. Retail (28% of revenue) and Wholesale Banking (12% of revenue). 

Relevant news is the Charles-Schwab + TD Ameritrade Merger. Don't think this really has an affect on TD since TD Ameritrade is a separate *BUT RELATED* entity to TD, but I thought this should be mentioned. 

*From Yahoo Finance:*

**PE (TTM): 9.97**

**PB (MRQ): 1.26**

**EPS (TTM): 4.52**

*From Seeking Alpha:*

**Dividend Yield: 5.04%** 

**Quarterly payouts of $0.5815** (equals $2.27 annually per share)

**10% Annualized Dividend Growth** [(here)](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2020/2020-Q2_QuickFacts_F_EN.pdf)

The dividend yield and its historical growth is really solid for this company at this price point. Probably the best bang for your buck when compared to its counterpart, $RY.

Another reason I chose $TD over $RY is mainly due to the international exposure. TD is in the process of expanding their network in the United States, which will give it a diverse stream of revenue and growth for the future of retail banking. 

To the best of my noobie investing abilities, their balance sheet looks strong, and they've had consistent and steady growth in their revenue and cash flow. Management is also very strong and I'm confident in how they've been handling TD in recent years.

Despite the stock being flat since 2017 at $60, I think the dividends will pay for itself if that happens again and just means that if you get in now at $45 you can hope to gain at least $15 in the long-term when it returns to $60 (this is my subjective opinion)

Being one of the Top 2 Banks in Canada, I don't really think the Canadian government would let this company go under (if it ever does) and the same can be said about their other top bank $RY. I equate these 2 companies to Bank of America and JPM in the U.S., respectively. 

Like with other banks, their Q2 and future Quarterly earnings look bleak. And I think we won't see much stock appreciation for another 2-5 years. However, given how strong TD's financials, management and positioning have been, they are really undervalued in this current market.

Based on Gurufocus, they have a **fair value of $71, giving them a MOS of 37%.** 

I'm not smart enough to do my own DCF calculations, but I do trust Gurufocu's calculations enough which I back up with my own DD.

Really happy to discuss this stock or how to analyze bank stocks in general since I'm still learning. Enjoy!

**TL;DR: $TD is a Long-Term BUY that has solid growth, management, dividends, and financials. Its current price at $45 makes it extremely undervalued and I think it has more upside in the long-term.**",finance

This is the basic idea of how bitcoin became an actual asset. The central banking system and the federal reserve is much too powerful to be reasoned with or taken by force. A new system had to be created. Enter bitcoin. Ironically, bitcoin shares the same strength as the federal reserve, its can not be taken by force. In order for bitcoin to be ""shutdown"", you would have to literally destroy millions of computers worldwide, which would never happen. This idea had me pondering, what will the federal reserve and banking system do to deal with bitcoin?

The [United State](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/01/senate-moves-closer-to-digital-dollar/#2683b5f97279) will soon follow suit. I think it's pretty obvious at this point that the future is digital. This brings me to the threat to bitcoin. Bitcoin is still in its infancy stages and is still a hard sell to most people. The average person would much rather trust a USD Coin or a GPB Coin linked to a financial institution like VISA or MasterCard.

As luck would have it we found our dream rental.  We are renting the cutest little house from a landlord and probably paying $800 under what it could be rented for.  It's probably worth about $500,000 and we are paying $1,200 a month. We LOVE it,

In this slide they state that 'experts' are predicting interest rates will be at 6% in 2025 and that that's a conservative estimate (experts are in quotes not because I think it's false but because they didn't state their source).  If that is the case then one would likely pay an additional $500 per month for their mortgage if we bought in 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

So my wife and I are wondering if we should buy now since the interest rates are so good.  We are thinking we could find our forever home and buy it and maybe rent it out for a while since we aren't ready to leave this rental yet.  Unfortunately we heard that interest rates are different if you are planning on renting your home out.  

Or should we buy our home now and just move out of the rental we love, because I'd rather do that then get stuck paying $500 additional dollars per month while I pay off my mortgage.  

Or should we stay and not buy a home now and wait until we are ready?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions:

1.  What are your thoughts on the projected 6% interest rates in 2025?
2. What are your thoughts on buying a home now to take advantage of the interest rate?
3. If we bought a home now and weren't ready to move in do you think it would be a good idea to rent it out and pay the higher interest rate?

worldpolitics,Hker defend for Trump,"Here is the google translation for the block:

We all know that Trump is a businessman. He has never been a politician in his life. Those Washington politicians he doesn't understand say a set of gambling rules. In the past 40 years, I have seen six presidents. Except for President Reagan, each of them spoke in circles, and they all spoke nicely. After listening to them, I felt like they didn't say anything. Trump is not the same, he just said it when he saw it, and he didn't save face.

And every president knows that news media reports are a knife that can stab the president in the back. Therefore, for the past 80 years, after World War II, every president has been holding the media, pampering, guarding, all kinds of preferential treatment, delicious food and drinking. I am afraid that the news media will speak ill of the president. As a result, I met this big boss of Trump today, but he didn't flatter him and went back directly with the news media. Alright.... In the past few years, mainstream media reports have brainwashed Trump into a hate maker, racist, anti-humanity, and war-mad world destroyer.

Let's calmly think about it, is Trump racist? Yes, he said that ""blacks have the highest crime rate."" Wow, that's ridiculous, TV newspapers scolded all day long. But he did not follow his second sentence, ""We want to help the education of the black community."" In the past three years, Trump signed the Optional School Act, which will always grant funds to black universities and colleges. These are all facts, and you can check it by Google.

Trump said that ""Baltimore is the dirtiest and smelliest city in the United States. It is all black, not even as good as a third country."" The media did not say his second sentence: ""The federal government provides more than one billion yuan each year for improvement. As a result, these corrupt governors and mayors are embezzled. These officials are the most shameless."" Yes, these are all Democratic governors and mayors. In fact, Trump's black employment rate in three years is the highest in American history.

Trump said that ""Illegal immigration in South America is terrible and poses a threat to the national security of the United States."" The result must have been Hispanic discrimination again. I have already explained this in the previous article, so I won't say more. Some illegal immigrants are criminal groups and no country welcomes them. Moreover, Trump’s three-year Hispanic employment rate is also the highest in history.

Trump said that ""Chinese students studying abroad are spies."" Wow, it's not that there are not many reports in the mainstream media. The Chinese have turned their faces and it is racial discrimination. The problem is that the ""Thousand Talents Plan"" is indeed a fact, and it is true that many foreign students with military background were arrested in the United States. Therefore, Trump invited 3,500 students with Chinese military background to return to China. I don't speak for the two parties, I just ask a word of conscience, which country’s president considers issues for which country’s interests, did he do it wrong?

So is Trump really racist? Or do you hear it on TV news? Trump’s political views when he was elected in 2016, against Iran, Israel, North Korea, and the ISIS terrorist organization, everyone said, it’s over, this kid is crazy. Trump was elected, military experts, news, and TV stations assured the American people that World War III began. Look at the data in three years.

President Bush killed more than 5,000 US troops in the Middle East.

President Obama killed more than 2,500 US troops in the Middle East

Up to now, Trump has killed 63 US troops.

Israel moved its capital to Jerusalem, and no country in the Middle East dared to do it.

In less than three years, the ISIS terrorist who was once the most feared terrorist in the world, Obama was uncertain in eight years and is getting bigger and bigger. In October 2019, ISIS was officially resolved. Now the world has no ISIS.

Still fresh in my memory, early this year, drone surgery eliminated Iran’s No. 2 figure. Three fats know not to be too eye-catching for North Korea, otherwise Trump is not a soft persimmon. So far, I have not seen any signs of the Third World War, but rather quiet.

I personally think that Trump is a businessman and a billionaire. Internally, he regards this country as a company, and he does not lose money to make money. Be nice to the company (country) employees (people), otherwise the employees (people) will not have a good life. The departments of the company (country) that do not make money but only lose money are cut off, otherwise the company (country) will lose money sooner or later and close. The company (country) makes money, and its employees (people) have good jobs. This is his way of governing the country. People have jobs and earn money to support their families. Natural economy is good and society is healthy. He is also a businessman externally, and the negotiations are fierce.

The question is, I have been thinking, what is the picture of such a billionaire? His presidential salary is zero. (All donated) his brother stopped making phone calls with China today. Do you still want to make Chinese money? If his family has any oil and water rebates, the mainstream media has long been poaching them 24/7. So far, there is nothing. Then a person is not profiting for fame. Then please think about it, if a person is for fame, he is a real hate maker, racist, war madman? Or we are called by the mainstream media agains

By my calculation that would put your investment at 120k by the end of 15 years vs. no investment with the 15yr mortgage. At the end of 30 years you’d be well over 400k along with your house being paid off and appreciating the same whether you had a 15 or 30 year mortgage, minus an extra 46k in interest.

personalfinance,"Unpaid collection hurting my credit score, getting the run around from everyone involved","So I’m trying to buy a house within the next year, and had my credit score pulled for a pre-approval letter. I found out I have had $60 in collections since January 2020 with SCA collections. I had no clue what it could be, so I called SCA and they gave me the name of two labs I had never heard of. I called the labs and finally found out that it was from a doctors visit in September 2019. The lab told me they filed a claim with my insurance to pay the bill, but it was returned that I was “no longer under coverage by the carrier”. This is inaccurate, as I was and still am under coverage. I checked my insurance account and received claims for the doctor’s visit itself, but NO claim from this lab. So the lab said they would send a note to collections to put a hold on my account while they refiled with insurance. I am currently waiting for that claim to come through, so I called collections about a week later to make sure the account was on hold. They said they received no notifications or updates on my account. I called the lab back and they said “oh that’s strange” and said they would send another note. I feel like I’m just getting the run around. I also called Equifax to see if they had any advice/would be willing to delete the collection and they said no, because the bill was accurate. I never received the bill because the doctors office had my address wrong which got passed to all of these people (they mistakenly wrote Alexander City instead of Somerville?!!) 

The guy at Equifax kept telling me a paid collection is better than an unpaid. I understand that, but I know a deleted collection is best. Is there any hope for me to get this deleted? I understand with my score I will still qualify for a loan, but I’m concerned that we wilted a terrible interest rate. 

Also my Discover score shows 768, credit Karma shows 729 for both as of July 23. Why did my credit report (that was pulled July 13 for the loan pre-approval) show 694, 688, and 697?

personalfinance,[x-post][First House]Can we afford this? PLEASE help me look over our budget,"I would really appreciate anyone who could take the time to really look at this and tell me if they think this is do-able.  We don't really have anyone in a similar situation we can ask for input so we're putting it out here.


We've been working on this budget for almost a year and think we're comfortable but now that we're under contract we're freaking out (first house).

All numbers are monthly averages (or best guess for future) over the last 15+ months pulled from YNAB, living in a 3/2.5 1600sqft townhouse for $1650/mo:  

***EXPENSES***

* Recurring subscriptions: **$59.32** (hulu, spotify, disney plus, amazon prime[yearly], sam's club[yearly], beachbody[yearly])
* Utilities: **$245** (internet, electricity, water/sewer/trash)
* Vehicles: **$245** (insurance, gas, tolls, both cars paid off)
* Groceries: **$450**
* Household goods (toothpaste, trash bags, etc.) + pet food/toys: **$30**
* Restaurants/entertainment: **$150**
* Cell phone bills: **$110**
* Gifts: **$42**
* Husband stuff: **$250** ($75 budgeted for car maintenance fund, fun money, rounded up)
* Wife stuff: **$150** (fun money, rounded up)
* Loan from relative (long story, but 0 interest): **$240**, will be paid off in 20 months

***Total: $1,971.32***


------------------------



Monthly *take-home* pay: **$5,990** (can be 6390 if teacher wife takes extra class, but is NOT for 2020-2021 school year, so working off of the lower number)  

Assets: **\~$106,000 cash, \~$23k of which is allocated as an emergency fund**, leaving a little over $80k for the house.

Since we started looking 9 months ago we've saved an average of $2247/mo towards the house fund.



------------------------



House: 3/2 \~1480sq/ft 1-story single-family home w/ garage and pool.  Offer: $345,000.  Conventional 30-year loan, 10% down, working off of a 3.25% interest rate (right now it's 2.99 but not locked in yet, using the higher number to budget). This comes out to, with my best calculations/estimates:  

* Mortgage payment: $1,351.32
* Insurance: $300 (best guess, lender suggests $250, saw quotes for a similar house for $268, rounding up)
* Property Taxes: $434.17 (using formula from lender, which is a best guesstimate before property appraisers office actually calculates it)
* PMI: $48
* No HOA

Bringing the total to $2133.49/mo.  Only other cost I can think of is the fact that it has a pool.  Which, by my research, I can assume will add up to $150/mo in extra electricity/water, and chemicals.  So total that up and we're at $2283.49/mo.

**Also budgeting 1.5% of the cost of the home per year for repairs, totaling $431.25/mo**

Closing will cost us $48,300, assuming 4% closing costs, leaving us with a ""safety net"" or cushion of about $30k cash, not counting our emergency fund.



***Grand totals***:  

* $57,700 cash left after closing (\~25k allocated as emergency fund).
* $5,990/mo income (right now)
* $4,254.81/mo expenses (best guess for this house from numbers above, with no lifestyle changes and no cutting of fun money) + $431.25/mo budgeted for any repairs
* Leaving $1303.94/mo left over, which is 21.7% of our take-home pay.
* If, next school year, wife takes an extra class, and after loan is paid off, income will change to $6,390 (assuming no raises) and expenses will drop to $4,014.81, leaving $1,943.94, which will be 30% of take-home.

So, it seems, we're going to close and have over $30k cash left over, budget over $400/mo for repairs, and still have over 20% of our take-home pay as cash left over after everything.  Unless I missed something major....",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Two Homes?,"Hi all, 

First post here. Here's the situation: 

We recently moved a few blocks down from our old house (house A), which we are now renting. Our new house (house B), we bought foreclosed through a private loan (friends, basically). This gave us the awesome ability to pay cash and get a great interest rate. 

House A has roughly 50k left to pay at 4.125% interest to the bank. 30 year loan. Monthly mortgage payment is $584, but this will increase next year when our homeowner's exemption falls off (could be wrong, but estimating the payment becomes about $750...Cook County IL sucks). 

House B is 110k at 3% to private lender. 15 year loan. Monthly payment is $760, plus about $90/mo insurance, plus about $750/mo taxes (again, Cook County sucks...don't tell me to move, not looking for that input here). So total monthly here is about $1,600. 

I'm wondering if it would be wise for us to refinance somehow....perhaps take out one loan that would combine both of these loans. I have friends who just bought through a bank at 2.99% interest, so I'm guessing we could bring down the interest on house A and perhaps save a lot of money over the term, maybe even bringing down the interest on house B or just a tick up (but with the other coming way down, perhaps would still save?). 

I could be missing lots of important info here. Let me know if anything else is needed. Thanks!",finance

cybersecurity,Social Engineering Attacks from China on Tinder (and Bumble) ?,"For quite a while now I get a very disproportionately high number of matches with chinese girls (about 1-2 a day compared to maybe 1 non-chinese match a day, despite chinese profiles only making up for max 5% of the profiles I see and swipe on). Almost all of these matches behave in a similar, suspicious manner:

\- They are not bots. I can't tell of course if their profile pictures are real, but it's a real person communicating  
\- They usually state that they are on some business trip or so and they ask about my job fairly early into the conversation (usually they initiate the conversation, then the second message is some form of asking where I am from and then quite soon follows some question related to my job. It's never the same text though and I'm confident it's not copy pasted messages)  
\- They usually want to exchange phone numbers or other social media fairly quickly and when I tell them that I don't want to give out private data before I get to know someone better, they unmatch me

The most suspicious thing about it is the distance though: The profiles are either shown to be about 9'200 km far away (which is about the distance of the city I live in to Hongkong) or the profiles show as 1km far away (there are only very few that are some normal distance, like something between 5-50km).

When I ask them why their profile shows them to be in close proximity despite them saying that they are in mainland china (or in hongkong or singapore on a business trip or so) they say they are using Tinder passport to set their location to switzerland and find matches there. When I then point out that Tinder passport is not actually changing the distance reported on the profile, I usually get unmatched.

I also noticed that when I drive with my car after having matched, the distance increases from 1km, so they must have specifically spoofed the gps location to be as close to me as possible, meaning they likely triangulated my exact location.

Especially the last part I find pretty unsettling and was wondering whether anyone else on Tinder noticed a similar increase of matches with chinese girls (especially those that claim they are in China/HongKong or that they just were on a business trip in the country you reside or will travel there soon).

personalfinance,Getting married this week and trying to buy a home someday,"Hi r/personalfinance ! I’m about to enter a new chapter in life, and it seems like a good time to get my ducks in a row financially. I’m getting married this Friday! We’re having our ceremony at the courthouse, so our expenses are essentially nil. My almost-husband and I are both in our mid-30s and thus very accustomed to spending our own money, so we have elected to maintain separate checking accounts and continue splitting bills equally the same way we have been for the last 4.5 years that we’ve been together. We have each had a bout of joblessness while we have been together, during which time we financially supported one another with little difficulty. Neither of us has ever missed a bill, and I have no concerns at all about whether he will be able to carry his share of the burden financially once we marry. Even with separate checking accounts, we do intend to file our taxes jointly and put any refund we get towards our savings or collectively beneficial purchases. We have no aspirations of having children or returning to school. We currently live near Boulder, CO and are itching really hard to buy a house because of the low interest rates, but I have concerns that we may be trying to jump the gun.

\- Entertainment: $0 currently, lmao… let’s say an average of $150 a month otherwise, if you count in my going to a lot of burns and those tickets being kind of pricy at times

\- Clothing: $75 (I almost exclusively support small, Etsy-style retailers, which aren’t cheap overall, and new clothes are my #1 joy in life. This averages out to roughly 1 new piece per month, as many items cost more than $75.)

\- Miscellaneous: $500 (I’m legitimately addicted to Amazon, but \*most\* of the stuff I buy is at least semi-practical)

\- I have a one-time expense of $1500 coming up sometime in the next month or two for the balance of the cost of a new electric unicycle I’m waiting on to be released (the InMotion V11, if you were curious)

\- Approximate wiggle room remaining after my expenses settle back to normal in a few months: $500

&amp;#x200B;

Current Major Goal

\- Our first home!

\- Location is our top priority (we want to remain close to our jobs), so the market is a bit limited

\- Looking for a 2/2 condo or townhouse, but would settle for a 2/1 if it was a particularly good deal

\- Estimated market value: $325,000-$450,000

\- Condos at this price point oftentimes charge as much as $350-400 a month in HOA fees (gross), but single-family homes cost a minimum of $500,000

\- We intend to bring our current roommate with us to the new place, so we will continue to have a minimum of $650 in rental income to put towards our mortgage

\- Housing in this location has excellent returns; the house we live in is worth $200,000 more than it was 10 years ago when it was purchased

\- First-time home buyers, so eligible for an FHA loan

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns

\- I have been wondering if it wouldn’t be better to go ahead and pay off my personal loan out of my savings right now, but the $160/month payment also doesn’t feel like a huge burden, so I have been reluctant

\- Our retirement situation is abysmal, but I’m also worried about doing too much about it with the market the way it is right now; also, we look at buying a home as our #1 shot at long-term financial stability, so buying a house wouldn’t be running contrary to working towards a comfortable retirement

\- Coming up with a 10% down payment, even on the cheapest homes we are looking at, would take an absolute minimum of 2-3 years, if you include closing costs and the need to maintain an emergency fund; scrounging up 20% for a traditional mortgage is essentially out of the question

\- All of the mortgage calculators I have looked at have offered SIGNIFICANT increases in our cost of living… like I said, we have a super sweet deal where we are currently

\- I feel weird, somewhat inexplicable guilt about focusing on my own debt first instead of our collective goals

\- I am afraid of being cheap and getting a janky place that will require lots of upkeep and/or frustrate us the entire time we live there; it’d be great to snag a deal on new construction because we can stay where we are as long as we like while it’s built, but that would definitely run towards the high end of our price range, if not slightly above (plus there’s not a boatload of new construction in this area due to zoning restrictions)

\- I'm not really sure how much of an emergency fund we need to leave ourselves after a down payment

personalfinance,Keep paying credit card or personal loan,"Hi everyone! First post but long time lurker.

I've accumulated a chunk of credit card debt (some of it out of need 6 years ago) over the years but established a plan earlier this year and plan on sticking to it for the next couple of years (different stage in life now, so a lot more responsible). Quick summary of what I'm doing:

Total CC debt: about $50k

Total minimum payments: $1,250

Monthly additional ""snowball"" payments to debt: $750

I've already paid off one credit card and will pay off a second one next month (August) but still a long way to go. If I keep this up, I will finish paying everything off by February 2023 (according to a debt reduction calculator I found here). Factoring in annual raises (probably about 3%/year) and a few extra dollars here and there going to additional payments, my goal is to be done with everything a few months sooner than that.

Anyway, my dilemma is between taking out a personal loan to pay off two credit cards (about $9,500) or keep snowballing until they are paid off.

Credit Card #1 - $2,947 balance out of a $3,200 credit limit. APR of 22.99% and $87 minimum payment. Debt reduction calculator estimates payoff date December 2020

Credit Card #2 - $6,400 balance out of a $7,500 credit limit. APR of 24.9% and $233 minimum payment. Debt reduction calculator estimates payoff date June 2021.

I have an offer from Upstart to take a 3 year personal loan for $10,100 with an interest rate of 11.68% and an APR of 16.77%. The minimum payment for the loan would be $335/month.

**The plan: take out the personal loan and aggressively pay it off by June 2021 (the payoff date of Credit Card #2). My logic is that doing so vs. keeping my credit card payments would save me a nice chunk of money in interests.**

In case it matters, I already have a small emergency fund to cover any emergencies (about $6,500). Health insurance and retirement are covered as well. Very stable job. I want to get rid of debt ASAP and then plan on aggressively increasing the emergency fund. No big purchases coming up at least before finishing paying off my loans (no mortgage, new car, etc.).

Thoughts?

1. Clear lines of credit so I have it available for emergencies as well as improving overall credit score.
2. Keep mortgage payments low. My escrow account/loan is evaluated around march of every year to readjust my payments. This past march, there was a large jump in my monthly payment due to a large shortage in escrow because I irresponsibly cashed in an insurance refund check (from swapping providers) that I should have applied back into the escrow account. This coming March I am worried that the evaluation will be worse, because I deferred 3 payments due to Covid. (maybe someone can clarified how worried I should be about this. A large portion of my monthly payment is for taxes/insurance. by deferring payments, does this mean that my escrow will be short yet again because the taxes,etc. weren't paid?)
3. Begin to use my savings account for it's intended purpose- saving money

 Lastly, I'll give a brief insight as to my income. I wish I had time to list out my budget for daily living, but I will do my best to update that information after lunch.

 Income

I make 13.50 and hour, 40 hours a week. The only deductions are Fed/State deductions, and $75 per check to 401k. I live check to check, doing my best to keep the wolves at bay, but I feel as though I'm scooping water out of a sinking ship.

I have to get back on the clock now, but I will be closely monitoring this post. I really don't think I can manage this without you folks, and I'm losing sleep over it. If you've read this far, I can't thank you enough and I hope this finds you all safe.

Please let me know if there is any valuable missing information and ANY droplet of advice is very, very appreciated.

personalfinance,I need help with my finances on a grand scale. What professional do i contact for their services?,"Hello all, 

I think i need to talk to some kind of person that will help me with the money that’s coming at me quickly this year. I have questions about freelancer taxes, taxes with an llc, how to set up retirement accounts, and how to handle my freelance money. I have sorta basic budgeting down but it can’t hurt if i speak to someone about that, too. Who is that person? What am i looking for? 

About me:

* Job 1: Junior Designer at a small Agency, $36k with benefits 
* Job 2: part time Designer at Startup, $18k
* Job 3: Freelance Illustrator, $300-$600/mo 

I’m 25, I live in a midwest city with a decent standard of living in a nice apartment. I personally have $66k in federal student loans and $3k in medical debt. I work roughly 55h a week and I work from home fulltime. After all of our bills i have about $2k to mess around with. We have no plans for children and I flirt with the idea of buying property. I don’t have a car but i plan on buying one cash in the next two years. I’m establishing an llc for my freelance business with a business bank account and such— just need to.. figure out how to do that. 

About spouse: 
* Job 1: Paramedic, $30k with benefits
* Job 2: Paramedic, $5k 

He will be going back school fall 2021 for programming at a community college, which i will pay for. He has a retirement account and he’s $15k in credit card debt. He is paying off a car with about $7k left. 

We do combine finances! 

So, i guess that’s the high level. Am i looking for a financial advisor? A lawyer? Is there a profession for helping people who are financially illiterate? I grew up in an immigrant family that was deep in poverty so i don’t have anyone i can ask. I have only been falling up when it comes to my finances and after i sign the Job 2 contract next month that’s $1500 a month I don’t know what to do with. I would really appreciate any help. Thanks!

personalfinance,Should I pay off car or LOC?,"Hi everyone,

I know it seems obvious but hear me out. I recently made a very hard decision. In the spring of last year I bought my dream car. I got an amazing deal.

However, as COVID has progressed working from home and with some lost income (not all) I've decided rather than paying off two depreciating assets (we have two cars) I should sell this one and buy a similar one again later when times are better.

I am actually selling the car at a profit, which is great. This leaves me with an additional 7k after the lien is paid off.

This leaves me with two most basic options:

1) Pay off my second car ($3000 left), put remainder on my LOC

2) Continue paying off my car, put all $7,000 on my LOC

Now it might seem obvious, because the car loan is at 0.9% and the LOC is at 4.45% but it goes a little deeper.

First, there is some mental peace knowing that I've completely paid down the car in the event (god forbid) that I lose work it's just one less payment and debt account to deal with. Also, it lets me snowball the LOC until it's gone more efficiently. It also lets me take collision off the car which will save even more money. I'm also still making a dent in the LOC with the remainder, it feels like a win win.

However, the Line of Credit due to covid and some other circumstances not worth going into is at like 80% utilization, although my credit rating remains at between 750 and 812 the last year so it doesn't seem to be an issue. I cannot raise the limit without doing a hard hit which I don't want right now. Also the LOC is higher interest rate, so makes more sense to put full balance on.

So my concern is this... what is better?

1) Paying off the car to clear this account from my debts, and having peace of mind, paying off the rest of my LOC as fast as I can, but having the option for lower payments if situations get worse or

2) Pay down the highest utilization and interest, taking the risk that if things go south the car payment could become an issue and leaving the other debt account (second car) open.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"Buy a house while working a side-job to help pay down loans, wait until side-job contract ends to ensure less risk, or pay off large chunk of mycar and hold off on all plans for 1 year?","Background information:

I am currently 26 and working as a software engineer in Boston (WFH due to COVID). **I am new to having money**. I make 95,000 / year at my day job. I recently (June 2020) started a side job with a startup making $40/hr doing development work, and make nearly $4000 / month before taxes from that side income. That job's contract is up 12/31/2020.

The breakdown:

I currently have $25,000 saved in an Ally savings account.

I am looking to buy a home (not in Massachusetts) for \~300-350k.As of August 1, I will be living rent-free and saving $1400/month because of that. I can live rent-free for 6-12 months, but my QoL will take a hit (as will my dog's QoL).

I owe $22,000 on my engineering loans (online course that you pay back after you find a job), interest-free, slated to start back up October 2020 (paused payments due to COVID), and end October 2021. I will be paying \~$2000/mo from October 2020 -&gt; October 2021.

My only other debt is my car, which is an outrageously high monthly payment ($800) and at 3.15%. My commute was terrible when I first landed my job, I had and still have the means to pay for it, so I bought a Tesla. It has increased my QoL more than I could have ever imagined and I would never sell the car unless I absolutely had to.

I've been pre-approved for a mortgage at an interest rate of 2.87%.

So my question is this:

A. Should I take all my side income money that will come in from now until December 31, set 30% aside for taxes, and pay off my engineering loans -- thus leaving me with whatever I can save from my 9-5?

B. Should I take all the side money I make, continue making the monthly payments ($2000) towards my interest-free engineering loan, and instead take my extra cash and dump it all on my car loan to drastically lower my monthly bill?

C. Should I take the side money, pay off engineering loan as it comes in, and take the rest of the cash (still save some for an emergency fund) and look to buy a home I can afford SOLELY on my 9-5 income in order to lock in this crazy low rate of 2.87%?

personalfinance,"Refinance mortgage, should we cash out and pay off student loans?","So here’s the short of it. We have about 23 years left on our mortgage, and we’re looking to refinance with rates being so low. Pricing out a bunch of lenders, we’ve come across a straight rate-reduction (one full percentage point lower) that would effectively lower our monthly mortgage cost by about $600. 

Or, we could cash out $50,000, which would only lower us by about .7% on our current rate. But, we would wipe out my high-interest student loan debt (7.5%). Our monthly mortgage would only go down by about $200, but removing my monthly student loan payment (about $450), we would sort of end up in the same boat financially each month. 

However there’s a wrinkle. Sometime within about the next 10 years, we are going to inherit a decent sum of money (well into the 6 figures). So we could easily pay off the remaining student loan debt once that comes in. 

So there’s the main question. Do we take the straight rate reduction permanently and suck up the student loan payments while the world is in a weird place, knowing we can dump that debt later on? Or do we dump the debt now and have a slightly higher interest rate with less equity in our home? In either scenario, we’ll have nearly the same financial ability to do home projects or reinvest the money for our future.",finance

personalfinance,"Closed accounts, collections, late payments. I'm buying a house and I need advice ASAP","Firstly thank you all for helping me through this process. 

I'm currently in the process of buying a home using my VA loan. I have little education on credit / credit use but I've been doing countless research since I began mortgage shopping. I could have sworn up and down that I had good credit but I didn't know about the '30%' credit utilization. Long story short I paid down my debt from owing 60% to 18%.

After reviewing my credit report (one that I received from a potential lender one mortgage shopping)  I noticed a few items in bold.

Best Buy/CBNA - Closed - amount owed $625 - 1 late remark 2015 - this account is current I make all monthly payments I can also pay this off. 

Verizon - Collection - amount owed $529 - this was for equipment that we already returned we have the receipt and everything and were told it was going to be taken out of collection, obviously it didn't. 

Dept of VA - Collection - Amount owed $125 - this was an over payment that I honestly don't even remember ever getting. I just got off the phone with the VA and they have an old address on file which explains why I haven't seen this. Apparently the debt is with the Treasury department now not the VA.


Comenity/Boscovs (department store) - amount owed $0 - 4 late payment remarks. 3 of them are 5/2016, 8/2016, and 5/2017 30-59 days late and 1 of them 9/2016 is for 60-89 days late. This account has been paid off and not used in over 2 years. 

Conserve (a collection agency used by my University) - Amount owed $0 status reads 'Paid Collection' 

My credit score should be at a 640 (fico) with my debt paid down from 60% to 18%, but I want to be at a higher score so I can get better rates. A different lender mentioned a credit repair agency, but everyone on the subreddit seems to hates these agencies. I have the money to pay the debt on the Best buy and VA loan but my lender told me not to do so just yet because it might reflect negatively on my credit. Would it be the same if I write pay for deletion letters? Given my time crunch it'll probably be faster if I pay an agency or someone to do it for me are there any recommendations? Is this something I can realistically do myself? I'm really anxious and would rather get approved with better interest rates than just get approved if that makes any sense.

personalfinance,Dad sold project house... Need advice on investing.q,"Hi

My dad recently sold a house that he built on some land that he bought years ago. He made a total of €385,000 Were looking for advice on how to invest it properly. 
As a family we have never really had anywhere near this amount of money, and we would like to be smart about it and use this money to invest, and grow, that way my dad can retire, and he can live off of this.

The house is in Italy, but we are Spanish and we technically live in the UK atm (though my parents don't plan on living here anymore), not sure if that matters, but I thought that I should mention it just in case.

We were thinking of putting the money in a bank from a country with higher interest rates, from the research that we have done by reading articles and basic googling, countries like Georgia seem tempting offering around 10%, however since me and my dad are pretty far away from financial experts I'm still skeptical, would that really be worth it? I'm assuming that there could be downsides?

Another thing to ask is what to do with the money, how much should we think about putting into index funds, or real estate? Are there other options like hedge funds that we should be looking for? Are there any rule of thumbs that we should know? Tbh any advice would be greatly appreciated.

We are used to being careful with money, I'm already self sustaining, and as a family we are very frugal, so we have no plans on buying new cars, or anything fancy. We would rather continue living our current lifestyle and put as much as we can to invest, and later down the line have more options to spend money on menial things.",finance

stocks,Stock market growth can be attributed to the weakening dollar.,"A majority of investors (including myself) have set aside our coronavirus worries to join the surprisingly rapid recovery of the market. 

In fact, we are heading for the strongest simultaneous four-month rise on record.

# Very rare market conditions

We often see the stock market moving upwards and growing, then because investor optimism is high, the investments such as bonds, gold and silver - they begin to suffer.

Then the market becomes overheated and investors fear the Fed might introduce counterbalances such as raising interest rates, and so investors begin to rotate out of the stock market and into those other investments.

**However, all markets (stocks, gold, silver, bonds, etc) are raising at this current moment, which is very rare.** 

If the investors are bullish in the stock market, why are they investing so heavily into other safer investments? This should indicate they are concerned about the stock market and not so bullish. This can seem very confusing at first.

# Why is the stock market rising?

The broad rise can be attributed to investors' faith in government and central-bank stimulus programs, vaccine development and increased opportunity for large companies (at the expense of others' struggles). 

Investors are also throwing their money at just about anything that rising as well now (again, including myself). Riding the upwards momentum.

# There may be another reason behind the stock market rise.

The biggest markets are priced in US dollars. If a stock increases from 100 dollars to 120 dollars, we say its increased by 20%.  But what this really means is the stocks increased by 20% compared to the value of the dollar. This makes sense but does make the assumption that the foundation, the currency, is stable.

Is the currency stable? Well, the federal reserve has already printed trillions of dollars to prop up the economy and so it's only a matter of time before the currency itself begins to lose value through inflation. 

**Central banks worldwide are devaluing their currencies which are leading to inflated prices in nearly all markets.**

To summarise, you could say the Federal Reserve has pumped so much money into the stock market that they've caused the market to swell up, and at the same time this money has flowed over into other investments such as gold and commodities - causing these alternative investments to also swell up. 

# Why I think this could be important if a stock market crash occurs.

This idea the Fed has caused numerous markets to swell up simultaneously may cause investments often less effected by crashes (such as commodities and bonds) to also drop in a market crash. A very uncommon scenario. 

Traders are riding momentum in everything from large technology stocks such as Apple to precious metals such as silver and gold. The record-breaking rises in gold, silver and other commodities prices can be attributed to investors both wanting a safer place for $$$ suspecting a second crash soon and riding the momentum commodities are getting from worldwide currency inflation.

**This rise of investment into gold, silver and many other commodities is making them less stable.** Therefore, if a stock market crash does occur the many investors in these 'safe' commodities will be moving their dollars back over to the stock market to snag the bargains they were waiting for. This huge rotation back over to the stock market could cause commodities such as gold and silver to significantly drop.

**These unprecedented times have left safe-haven investments, normally used to stabilize portfolios against stock market crashes, considerably less bullet-proof then before.**

As a result, I think it does make sense to hold a portion of money in cash (even if Ray Dalio says it's trash). I realize cash is losing value with each passing month and with no end in sight I don't think holding too much cash is necessarily the best idea either. 

**So, perhaps a reasonable balance between cash and investments makes sense.**

investing,Vanguard Challenges Bond Behemoths With Active Funds - WSJ,"Vanguard Group, the titan of low-cost index funds, is coming after a fast-growing pocket of the money-management industry: actively managed bond funds.

The firm’s investment dollars in such funds pushed past the half-trillion mark for the first time in June, a potential problem for competitors such as BlackRock Inc. , Fidelity Investments, Pimco and Western Asset Management Co., which have long dominated bond investing.

Malvern, Pa.-based Vanguard has made a number of hires in recent years to expand in areas like emerging markets, short-term corporate debt and pan-market, or “core bond” funds. Most of the nascent funds are small to midsize but they are growing quickly, in large part because they charge much less than the competition.

&gt; [Inline Image](https://images2.imgbox.com/d0/73/vQwfqpI2_o.png): Assets under management in short-term bond funds

Lower-cost bond funds are particularly attractive now because the U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates close to zero to soften the pandemic’s economic pain. Bond yields have declined in lockstep. The yield of a widely followed Bloomberg Barclays U.S. bond index fell to 1.15% last week, its lowest level in at least 20 years, according to data from FactSet.

“With rates where they are, if you pay an extra 0.50 [percentage points] in fees, you have to go a long way to make up for it,” said Bob Brinker, who publishes an investing newsletter focused on bond mutual funds. “Overall I think it’s really about cost and Vanguard is the leader.”

Vanguard is already a leader in funds that mimic pre-set indexes of stocks and bonds rather than trying to beat them by actively picking specific securities. Investors have flocked to index products because they charge less and, by some measures, deliver more consistent returns. Vanguard’s push into active bond investing is a new front in the fee war between large asset managers as they trim their own profits to win more customers.

Launched in 2016, Vanguard’s core bond fund has become one of its fastest-growing bond products, growing 60% in the first half of the year to $2.2 billion in assets. The fund costs investors $1-$2.50 annually per $1,000 invested depending on the share class, compared with older and larger funds operated by Western Asset, which charges $4.20-$15.20, and BlackRock, which charges $3.80-$14.30, according to data from Morningstar Inc.

Spokeswomen for Western Asset and BlackRock declined to comment

Vanguard’s actively managed bond funds grew by $27 billion in the first half of 2020 to $506 billion, according to a company spokesman. Active bond funds managed by BlackRock grew by about $11 billion to $950 billion over the same period, according to the company’s quarterly earnings reports.

Vanguard has been steadily expanding its bond-fund menu since the 2008 financial crisis as aging investors shifted toward fixed income and away from stocks. Investors have put about $1.5 trillion into bond mutual funds since the start of 2009 and pulled about $1.4 trillion out of stock funds over the same period, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.

The bulk of that growth came from Vanguard’s primary business, index funds—rather than from active funds competitors such as bond powerhouse Pacific Investment Management Co. specialize in. A Vanguard index fund dethroned Pimco’s flagship bond fund as the largest in the world in 2015 and has roughly doubled since then to $277 billion.

Vanguard has managed active debt funds for decades, primarily in municipal debt, but the business has been slower to grow.

“Vanguard is thought of as an index shop and when you’re looking to buy an actively managed bond fund it is probably not the first name that comes to mind,” said Jeffrey DeMaso, director of research at Adviser Investments, a money manager that focuses on mutual and exchange-traded funds.

About five years ago, the firm set out to change that by broadening the range of active bond funds it offers, said John Hollyer, global head of fixed income at Vanguard. It launched an ultra-short-term bond fund in 2015, and the core bond fund and an emerging markets bond fund in 2016.

Mr. Hollyer also recruited outside talent, hiring Daniel Shaykevich from BlackRock for emerging markets, Sara Devereux from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Anne Mathias from Guggenheim Partners for interest-rate strategy and Arvind Narayanan from State Street Global Advisors for investment-grade credit.

The new funds are still relatively small, and Vanguard’s active bond funds account for about 8% of overall assets. Still, the rate of growth picked up in 2020.

Vanguard’s ultrashort fund has been particularly attractive this year as a slightly riskier alternative to money-market funds, which now yield close to zero because of the Fed’s rate cuts, Mr. DeMaso said.

The fund, which yields about 1%, has grown to $9.3 billion from $6.7 billion at the start of the year, while Pimco’s comparable fund has shrunk and Fidelity’s has stayed unchanged, according to Morningstar. The lowest-cost shares in Vanguard’s fund charge $1 per $1,000 invested, compared with $4.50 for Pimco and $2.50 for Fidelity.

“It took decades for it to happen on the index side and Vanguard’s competitors are going to resist this but I think the direction, the gravitational pull, is for fees to come down,” Mr. DeMaso said.

“Fidelity has a large, global research organization and decades of experience managing fixed income funds, with $1.4 trillion in fixed income assets of June 30, 2020, over $450 billion consisting of both actively managed and index bond funds,” a company spokesman said. “Fidelity Conservative Income Bond Fund has performed well and we continue to see strong investor interest in the fund.”

personalfinance,I need some help with my budgeting plan for college. And giving myself a fall back cushion,"Okay so right now my job is non essential and I am collecting UI. The last $600 was this last check and I forgot about that and accounted into my budget an extra 3.5 payments with the added $600. 

I currently save with a 60/30/10 rule and am currently making $1293 every 2 weeks. Savings, bills and spending money respectively. I have 4000 even in savings and 943 in bills and spending money is food and such. I am a full time student and planned working this job during the summer so I unfortunately will have to decline if they offer the position back up. 

My bills are $510 for rent and my half of utilities, 4.99 for Spotify and Hulu bundled and 6.88 for Amazon prime. Internet for $70. So I usually just round up and assume $600 each month. 

I planned on adjusting my saving/bill/spending to a 50/40/10 but that was also including an extra $600 for 3.5 more payments. My last 3.5 payments will be about $130. I also planned on doing UberEats and some other little apps for some extra money on the side sometimes.

Now the last bit of income I have is my federal aid excess. I usually get 3k back, once in September and once in February. And I'm thinking about 1.5k in from my tax return since I'm not expirenced enough to know how much those yeild. 

I'm wondering how I should budget to be able to make it to May when school ends. I'm also thinking about enforcing a 40/50/10 split now just as a safe guard. Could someone check my math and tell me if this is a wise budget. I've only been savings and budgeting for 3 months now. I'm trying to learn all this stuff with no previous knowledge. 

I am currently on academic probation for dropping out last semester due to an exhausting and time demanding full time job. Depending on how I do in August and September will dictate whether I can handle a part time job for roughly an extra $840 a month. 

So I currently have 943 + (1293 x 0.50) + (458.8)+ (6074 x 0.50) +(1582*0.50) = 5676.90

5676.90 - (9 * 600) = 276.9 so obviously my current budget sucks a bit for having leftover just incase I don't find a summer job right away.  

Accounting for a work study job I'm looking at about 2400 or so left over assuming I work a pretty consistent 40 hour max per pay period if I can manage. 

Originally I had an agressive savings plan that I estimated to earn me anywhere between 11k to 14k by the end of December total.Now I'll only have 7.5k saved or so. I'm bummed about that but it is what it is. Money saved is money saved I guess. 

I keep stressing about it alot, is there anything you would do differently or set up different to give yourself more of a cushion? I don't really have a plan for my savings yet, just saving for savings sake so any bit towards it would be preferable. I'm just looking for the best way to make sure I never have to keep adjusting the budget for lack of funds or never have to take out of my savings except for emergencies. All of this is assuming my math is correct and I get them maximum amount I can get in each feild of income. I don't really have a fall back plan other than dip into the 4k in savings I already have.

I plan on paying off the 5.05% as soon as interest starts accruing again in September and then aggressively paying off the 4.53% until I move out of my parents' place. I plan on moving out by Summer 2021. I have budgeted out my expenses and savings goals and it seems like I will have an extra $200-300/mo to put towards my loans.

Since I will have a low 4% interest rate when I move out would it be better for me to put the money in the market to potentially grow faster than the interest just pay the minimums on the loans?

According to a calculator I used, by paying minimums it will take me about 10 years to pay it off and I will be paying $4,000 in interest. By paying minimums, it will take me 4 years and I will be paying $1,500 in interest.

I feel like the extra $200-$300/mo invested in the stock market across the 6 years could probably out grow the $2,500 extra I'd be paying or am I calculating something wrong?

More specifically, the employment market has  showed signs of weakness. 

1-  The Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey showed that “*The  number of employed Americans declined by about 6.7 million from mid-June  through mid-July, including a 4.1 million plunge from the first to the  second week of July*”. 

2-  [Saint Louis Fed economists](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/june/reading-labor-market-real-time), that use [real-time data from Homebase](https://joinhomebase.com/data/) to track labour market trend, see a decline in July.

3-  The Labor Department said last Thursday that initial jobless claims  came in at 1.416 million for the week ending July 18 (above the  consensus of 1.300 million). It was the 18th straight week in which  initial claims totaled more than 1 million, and it snapped a 15-week  streak of declines. 

 All in all, it seems that employment situation no longer improved and  even deteriorated slightly in July compared to June, reflecting the halt  of the reopening process in several states. Even if it’s a bit early to  look at the consensus for July NFP, the first guess of +2.0M looks  elevated.

\* We collectively make $240k (me and spouse) with very stable jobs. (software &amp; healthcare)  
\* We have one car loan and currently pay $250/month with a &lt; 1 % interest rate.  
\* No debts other than one car.  
\* Saved $275k. Looking to put around $200k down payment.  
\* We would get around 3% interest rate (800 score)  
\* $150 HOA fee.  
\* In early 30s.

Looking at the payments, we are looking at around $3400 for mortgage, interest and property tax. Another $150 per month is HOA fee.

What do you recommend? Are we okay with an 800k house based on the details above or should we go for less?

personalfinance,Adjusting Financial Plan - Help Needed,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text and the ramblings of a madman. 

Currently I am being scheduled between 32 and 40 hours. I’ve had to make adjustments to my financial plan as I’m trying to save for a down payment on a new car, pay down student loans, put money on my Roth account, and make a bigger emergency fund. 

I’m still in school and about 4-5 semesters away from graduating with my bachelors, so I’m trying to be proactive with my loans. I’m also planning on going back for my Master’s degree. I’ve been fortunate and didn’t have to take out much and I have about $1100 remaining and paying down what I can each month after paying everything else down. 

My goal is to save about $5000 for a down payment for a new car with the idea that my loan will be somewhere in the $20k neighborhood. I have $100 a paycheck going into a separate savings account to resemble the car payment + insurance. I don’t really need a new car, but my current car has broken down twice this year so far resulting in me having to get it towed so I have some anxiety when driving it at this point. The cars I’m looking into also are a bit on the more expensive side, but I’m treating this purchase as a treat to myself and I want a fun car. 

Prior to returning to work, I was saving the extra funds I was getting into an emergency fund and bumped it from 6 months to roughly 8-9 months. I did this because after reading on this subreddit that it’s probably a good time to beef it up a little. I have 6 months stored away in a HYSA and the rest in my credit union savings account, which does has a small interest rate. I do this because I felt like in the case of an emergency, that money is more easily accessible than the money I have at another bank. Should I transfer more of the money to the HYSA or is it better to keep it more accessible?

Prior to COVID, I was on a tech team and was able to contribute to my 401k account with an 8% company match. That position has since been eliminated and my current position is part of a union and does not offer any sort of 401k plan. I have opened an account directly through Fidelity and have been contributing $50 a week. Not much I know, but better than nothing. 

The main issue I have right now is that there have been rumors that we are heading into a second closure. Since returning to work in June I have kept my finances tight and making sure every dollar is going to where it’s best utilized. I don’t have many bills outside of rent and utilities and the only debt I have technically is my student loan. With the rumors floating I am contemplating putting pretty much everything into my emergency fund, minus the car down payment (since that is just a second savings account at my credit union and I can dip into when needed) and money for my bills. At least while I still have a job, I’d like to continue to contribute to my Fidelity account as it’s not much out of my weekly paycheck. Is the adjusted plan I have ideal, or should I continue to pay my student loan down and/or contribute more to my Roth account? Really I’m just looking for peace-of-mind that I’m doing something right.",finance
personalfinance,How to diversify our savings and factor in the possibility of retiring a few years early?,"**Summary:** ‘A’- 36 ‘B’- 41. No children (will not be having them)

We got off to a late start with our “big boy jobs” and within the past few years have had employers who offer 401k match and HSAs. 

We recently bought property, and even more recently refinanced to a lower rate. It’s a two family. We live upstairs and our tenant lives on the first floor. We are in a Midwestern city - ie low cost of living. 

We both grew up incredibly poor (so don’t expect us to receive a windfall) but that also means that we are insecure/confused about our money. 

We are in the fortunate state that we are both still working full time during “this time”, and luckier still that our savings accounts have grown significantly due to no longer going out to concerts and dinner once a week. (very eye opening…)

Overall I’m just looking for feedback about how we are doing with allocating our money, but I have more specific questions regarding **HSA’s, IRAs, 401ks** and if we both should have **life insurance** policies? Did we miss the boat on life insurance due to our age? 

I would also like for 'B' to retire early, between 55-60 ideally, but life happens. 

**Income: Gross**

“A” - 61,600.00

“B” - Recently got a new job, estimating \~50,000.00

Rental property - 850.00  X 11 months (conservative) 9,350.00

Total = 120,950.00

“A” has additional tax withholding taken out of her paycheck to cover the income received from the rental. 

**Savings:**

US Bank Checking \~ 5,000.00 ish

US Bank Savings \~ 5,000.00 ish

Capital One Savings \~ 19,000.00 ish

Note: We like to keep about 5 grand in both US Banks accounts and transfer anything else to the Cap One because it has a higher interest rate. 

We transfer 250.00 per week to the Cap One account from the US Bank for general savings / emergency fund.  We also transfer any surprise money, like the stimulus check. 

**Retirement:**

“B”- Has a pension. 600.00 / month once reached official retirement age. 

**401k**  (each have .5% match up to 6%)

“A” - Currently is investing 10% of her income. Has about 41,000.00 thus far. 

“B” - Currently is investing about 9% of his income. No idea how much is saved, I’m assuming about 20,000.00. 

**HSA** \- ‘A’. 

Employers contribute 1,000.00 / year. 

‘A’ contributes 2,600.00 / year.

Total 3,6000.00 / year.

Should I be maxing this out (7,100.00)? 

What happens if I lose my job with this benefit? Where will my HSA money go? 

**IRA** \- 

\-0- 

I would like to 'B' (41) to start an IRA and max it out every year. I figured due to ‘B’ being older this means we would have access to the funds sooner. Should 'A' (36) also start one? Or Should 'A' max out the previously mentioned HSA? 

If we want to retire a bit early is it a bad idea to have so much money tied up in a 401k and / or IRA that can’t be touched until the official retirement age? 

**Outstanding loans:**

2 family property: We owe about 143,000.00 with a 3.625% interest rate. 

Our monthly payments are 960.26 and we add 300.00 every month to the principal. We have almost the full 30 years left not calculating the extra principal applied. It's a brand new loan. 

If I’ve done my math right, we should save a ton in interest and the property should be paid off by the time 'B' is 57 if we stick to the additional 300 per month. 

Our only car payment is paid off next month so I’m not including that. However we will need a new car in the future, once WFH ends / our car totally dies. 

We have 2 credit cards that we pay in full monthly. One has good cash back rewards, the other travel. 

**Life Insurance:** 

Where do we even start? I know we should get ‘term’. 20 or 25 years? I would like the amount we receive to cover the rest of the mortgage and funeral cost, I’m thinking 150k - 200k each should cover it. Thoughts? Advise on how to start looking? 

‘A’ has a history of depression and anxiety and was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in both high-school and college. ‘A’ is on meds now and doing well, but will this prevent ‘A’ from being covered? 

This is getting pretty long so I think I’m going to end it. If you have questions or comments I’ll try to answer when I can. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Mortgage,"Backstory; My parent's bought a home in early 2000s, and had to file for bankrupcy in 2007, where I assume they got a new 30 year loan to pay. This loan has an interest of 8.93% and is a conventional without PMI and currently the principle is ~92,000. Their current credit scores are both in the 750 range. And they both still have their jobs even through covid. 

It seems to me refinancing is a no brainer, but my question is how does refinancing work? Is it possible for them to refinance and do it now during covid? And is it possible for my name to be listed on the mortgage? Would it be better for them to ""sell"" the house and have me buy it with a new loan term?

I tried looking through the sub, but most people have interest rates of 3% and don't see any guides or personal experience with refinancing. Any guidance and help is extremely welcomed and appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"US Student loans in PAYE: to repay a specific loan, do I have to pay off the existing interest on ALL loans?","I have 11 graduate loans with one loan payment servicer divided into two groups, Stafford and Grad PLUS. Grad PLUS has a higher overall balance and all interest rates are higher. As I am on PAYE, I am not paying the full amount of interest that is generated every month by these loans. From the group with higher interest rates, I have one loan with a balance of around $9K principle and $2K interest which is the lowest balance. I was thinking to work towards paying this one off over the next year once I free up some money when I reach my savings goals. I know that any excess payments I make go to interest before they go to the principle. 

The question is, do I have to pay off the interest on all 11 loans held by the servicer before I can start targeting payments to one specific loan? Or can I start paying off that $2K interest balance and subsequently the principle of this loan before catching up on the interest on ALL of the loans?",finance

personalfinance,Buying a home without mortgage,"I’m in a unique situation. My dad has offered to put 200k towards building a home on his land. I have about 100-150k in stocks I was going to put in towards the home as well. The house plans we have drawn up are about 480k so I figured it’d be smart to get a mortgage and keep more of my investments in the market. However after a meeting my dad called to order this morning my dad seems super paranoid about the thought of me taking out a mortgage for any amount. I have no idea why. 

He’d even prefer me to take out a personal loan instead of a mortgage at a much higher interest rate than have the government “hooks” latched into my assets. 

Doing things his way would mean I’d have to redraw up my plans entirely and I don’t completely understand the rationale. 

Does anyone have any insight on the tax standpoint...gift tax, property tax, etc. Anything to help me better understand his strong aversion he has to me getting a 100-150k mortgage at a low interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,Using Plastiq to Pay down Mortgage and remove PMI?,"Okay so ever since I've been paying my Mortgage I've been sick of having to constantly pay PMI on the loan. I've been paying it down pretty aggressively because I have been doing a side hustle in addition to my full time job, but I'm still $9,500 away from that 80% sweet spot in order to request removal. I recently learned about Plastiq (which allows you to make payments using a Credit Card on items you can't traditionally pay with a CC, such as rent/Mortgage). So here's my thought process:

Step 1.Sign up for a cash back rewards CC that has an intro 0% APR on purchases (the best one I've found is Wells Fargo Cash Wise - 1.5%, 15 months 0% Intro APR)

Step 2.Get approved at or above a limit that I would need to pay to 80% LTV on the loan

Step 3. Use Plastiq, and pay a 2.85% fee for the service BUT:

a). I get 1.5% cash back on the amount spent PLUS a $150 cash back bonus on spending over $500 in the first 3 months of account opening

b). I remove the $35/month I currently pay in PMI

c). I save 3.5% interest on this extra principal payment for at most 15 months.

Step 4. Request removal of PMI from the mortgage lender. I can chip in the additional 2% out of savings if I needed to get it to 78% LTV.

All in, using the above factors in part 3, I roughly calculated that I'd save about $600-700 from this method above.

Now, I understand I would need to pay off that $9,500 in 15 months or pay a rediculous interest rate, but I consistently earn more than spend already and have plenty of room to cut expenses if needed. I'd also need to get approved for a limit that high (but if I didn't, I would wait until I paid it down more and try again). I have a secure and stable job, so COVID-19 job loss concerns are not in the near future.

Other than the above potential downsides, is there something glaringly obvious I'm missing here??",finance

personalfinance,[Q] seeking other options after issues with transferring custodial account funds —&gt;,"kind of a complicated issue that has been going on since April, as my account value waffles and sinks;
  
 - Merrill Edge had a custodial account in my legal guardian’s name until I turned of age. 
 - They had my birthdate completely wrong by a decade. 
 - I was instructed to open a new ME account in my name alone. 
 - To do this they said I must go into a BoA branch to fax my license to them, probing my birthdate to be fixed. 
 - I did this (and after they lost my license in a crevasse behind the fax machine cabinetry for 10 days)
 - I opened an account online
 - Heard nothing from them for 7 business days
 - I had to call *them* and was told that because during their back end search they couldn’t verify that I currently have a utility bill in my name at the address listed on the application, the account was in limbo to be verified.
 - I was instructed to send a secured email with scans of my birth cortificate, license, 2019 federal tax form &amp; a recent bank statement. 
 - Another 7 business days pass and I again have to call *them* to find out that the account application now has a new “block” on it because there already exists a custodial account in their system with my name on it. No kidding. 
 - I was to wait another 5 business days and a decision will be made on whether my account can be opened...(?)
 - Meanwhile I have been staving off ME sales marketing calls from a different associate each time, trying to make commission on my new account opening, yet they can’t call me to let me know there’s issues with the application. 
 
 So;
  - do I *have to* open a Merrill CMA account with them, in order to release these custodial account funds? Or could I just have my advisor at Fidelity move this to my Fidelity account directly?
  
 I asked this same question to a ME rep who snuck through my phone’s spam filter two months back and they said “no there’s no way to do that, you have to open an account with us”.

In some ways it seems like a no-brainer, as our monthly payment would decrease $211 and we’d lock in a nearly historic-low interest rate. We also have some student loans left to pay off, at interest rates above 6%, so in that sense it makes sense to roll the closing costs into the loan and use our extra cash to pay down the student loans.

On the other hand, it seems crazy to increase our loan balance even higher than it was when we purchased, just 8 months ago!

investing,The argument for buying marijuana stocks today,"After swing the question being asked many times, Just wanted to lay out the argument in simple text for everyone to read, in my opinion:

1. States need tax revenue. Several states like NJ will be voting to legalize this fall. Others will be looking to decriminalize or otherwise eliminating barriers to entry. IE: more favorable laws

2. Election year. If Trump wins, not much changes. If Biden wins things are expected to quickly change in marijuana’s favor. In their current plan at the very least they look to decriminalize, make medical marijuana federally legal and pass the SAFE banking act and MORE act.

3. Bad news is out. Write offs for goodwill ending. Wild expenditures reigned in. Emphasis on profit. Vape crisis seems to have been solved with elimination of several “brands” of black market vapes, proving that legal weed is safer, when regulated.

4. Price dropping is a good thing. Will remove weaker players. Better competition with black market. Better quality, more choice. Drinks edibles chocolates, things your local weed dealer doesn’t have. Safer, less chance of additives and cutting agents.

5. More stores opening every week. CGC just opened an online store. Weed deemed an essential business during COVID. Many places allow delivery. Simpler easier access and becoming much more publicly accepted. More research into possible health benefits,...not dangers. People less afraid and more accepting.

6. Social justice. So many people incarcerated for smoking a joint. Backwards policies ending. If you let people do shots of tequila, why can’t they eat a marijuana cookie. What’s the difference? Why are we arresting people for getting high, but not getting drunk. Society begging for change

7. Short interest and investor disgust with the sector. How many people do you know who lost many on marijuana stocks? How many people got burnt so bad, they won’t even look at it. How many giant funds are short marijuana stocks. The buying going forward could last a long time. Money sits on the sidelines waiting for a reason to get back in.

8. Earnings. Profits. Less dilution. Financials improving. It all comes down to this, is marijuana a profitable business, or is it a commodity? Brands like CGC want to make it a package good, with proper marketing and loyalty. It was done with tobacco, done with liquor, done with beer,...why wouldn’t the same happen with weed? Pick the right one, and in many years time it will be table conversation at Thanksgiving.

9. A whole new industry, with plenty of ancillary business looking to invest. More jobs and Farming. Farmers need new profitable crops. Even McConnell in the Senate wants his farmers to have new cash crops. So far he allows Hemp farming, is marijuana next?

10. Pie in the Sky rumors. Consolidation. Buyouts, mergers. Giant package goods companies waiting to see what happens. Already Constellation Brands, Altria, Anheuser Busch, Molson Coors, Novartis have partnerships,...whose waiting to jump in? All they need is to see 💰. Also Trump could jump over Biden and legalize taking the card away from Biden. Doubtful. But would be a brilliant move,...",finance

They have been super good to me, do good things for the community, and generally have very reasonable rates.

They offered me a 3% refinance rate with about $5k in closing costs. No points to pay down. Their appraisal guess is about $365k, which gives me 77% LTV so I could even take a few thousand out to cushion my emergency fund. 

Loanpal calls me since they finance my solar, nice people, definitely salespeople though. I was resolute on sticking with my credit union but Loanpal offered 2.75% with about $9k in closing costs. They didn't tell me the original interest rate, but it involves about $5k in points. Waived appraisal, assessed at $350k. This gives me about 82% LTV so I would have to pay some finance charges to bring my LTV to 80% to ditch PMI (this is incorporated into the $9k closing costs). One thing that put me off a bit was the fact that they will basically immediately sell my loan to Wells Fargo, with whom I have a sticky past.

investing,"Modified All-Weather / Permanent / Golden Butterfly Portfolio: $10,000 experiment (QQQ instead of VTI)","Ever since I learned about Dalio's **All-Weather**, Harry Browne's **Permanent Portfolio**, and Tyler's **Golden Butterfly** ([https://portfoliocharts.com](https://portfoliocharts.com/)) I've been fixated on trying to construct my own **Modified Permanent Portfolio (MPP)** that survives all 4 economic cycles: Expansion, Peak, Contraction, and Trough.

The individual components alone may seem strange (long-term bonds, gold, commodities, etc), but **together as a whole**, a permanent type of portfolio attempts to match the superior historical returns of the Total Stock Market **with less volatility, less max drawdown, and less standard deviation**.

Before analyzing some backtests, my current portfolio is as follows:

* Maxed out Fidelity 401k: FXAIX (S&amp;P 500) + FXNAX (US Bond Index)
* Maxed out Vanguard Roth IRA: VWELX
* Taxable accounts (Vanguard and M1 Finance): QQQ, VXUS, VDIGX

At 30, I find myself with $40K excess cash (sitting in a money market fund) because in 5-7 years I need a 20% down payment for a home purchase. Instead of letting my growing cash pile sit around, I figured I'd deploy $10K now into my MPP and then accelerate cash savings in 2-3 years.

\-----

**My Modified Permanent Portfolio (MPP) costs 0.20% and has a dividend yield of 0.831%:** 

* **40% QQQ (Nasdaq-100 index)**
* **35% TLT (long term US treasury bonds index)**
* **25% IAU (cheaper than GLD)**
* Portfolio Link:   [M1 Finance easily maintains asset allocation because future contributions automatically target underweight holdings](https://m1.finance/plO4WnBKUULV) 

Parameters / Assumptions:  As a naturally cautious person and out of personal preference/bias, my MPP doesn't track commodities, small-cap value, short term bonds, or international stocks, and doesn't utilize leverage.  I wanted to limit dividend yield because this portfolio is held in my M1 taxable account.

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

W**atch Joe walk through the entire proposal and answer questions on** [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/RZHuqo_XOoQ)**.**

This proposal is also available on the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder &amp; CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will  answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit, and I've answered some questions in the stream on YouTube.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours. Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty &amp; rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

## Response and PoC

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

## Live Demo

&gt;A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

[24 hours in 4 minutes](https://reddit.com/link/i023gf/video/pf6glgi52td51/player)

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

## Scaling

&gt;How it works &amp; scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain. For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).

## Economic Scaling

An interesting feature of Dragonchain’s network consensus is its economics and scarcity model. Since Dragon Net nodes (L2-L4) are independent staking nodes, deployment to cloud platforms would allow any of these nodes to scale to take on a large percentage of the verification work. This is great for scalability, but not good for the economy, because there is no scarcity, and pricing would develop a downward spiral and result in fewer verification nodes. For this reason, Dragonchain uses TIME as scarcity.

TIME is calculated as the number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held. TIME influences the user’s access to features within the Dragonchain ecosystem. It takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. TIME is staked by users against every verification node and dictates how much of the transaction fees are awarded to each participating node for every block.

TIME also dictates the transaction fee itself for the business node. TIME is staked against a business node to set a **deterministic transaction fee** level (see transaction fee table below in Cost section). This is very interesting in a discussion about scaling because it guarantees independence for business implementation. No matter how much traffic appears on the entire network, a business is guaranteed to not see an increased transaction fee rate.

## Scaled Deployment

Dragonchain uses Docker and Kubernetes to allow the use of best practices traditional system scaling. Dragonchain offers *managed nodes* with an easy to use web based console interface. The user may also deploy a Dragonchain node within their own datacenter or favorite cloud platform. Users have deployed Dragonchain nodes on-prem on Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure, and other hosting platforms around the world. Any executable code, anything you can write, can be written into a smart contract. This flexibility is what allows us to say that developers with no blockchain experience can use any code language to access the benefits of blockchain. Customers have used NodeJS, Python, Java, and even BASH shell script to write smart contracts on Dragonchain.

With Docker containers, we achieve better separation of concerns, faster deployment, higher reliability, and lower response times.

We chose Kubernetes for its self-healing features, ability to run multiple services on one server, and its large and thriving development community. It is resilient, scalable, and automated. OpenFaaS allows us to package smart contracts as Docker images for easy deployment.

Contract deployment time is now bounded only by the size of the Docker image being deployed but remains fast even for reasonably large images. We also take advantage of Docker’s flexibility and its ability to support any language that can run on x86 architecture. Any image, public or private, can be run as a smart contract using Dragonchain.

## Flexibility in Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture considers interoperability and integration as key features. From inception, we had a goal to increase adoption via integration with real business use cases and traditional systems.

We envision the ability for Reddit, in the future, to be able to integrate alternate content storage platforms or other financial services along with the token.

* **LBRY** \- To allow users to deploy content natively to LBRY
* **MakerDAO** to allow users to lend small amounts backed by their Reddit community points.
* **STORJ/SIA** to allow decentralized on chain storage of portions of content. These integrations or any other are relatively easy to integrate on Dragonchain with an Interchain implementation.

## Cost

&gt;Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain) For the purpose of this proposal, we assume that all transactions are on chain (posts, replies, and votes).

On the Dragonchain network, transaction costs are deterministic/predictable. By staking TIME on the business node (as described above) Reddit can reduce transaction costs to as low as $0.0000025 per transaction.

Dragonchain is an open source hybrid platform. Through Dragon Net, each chain combines the power of a public blockchain (like Ethereum) with the privacy of a private blockchain.

Dragonchain organizes its network into five separate levels. A Level 1, or business node, is a totally private blockchain only accessible through the use of public/private keypairs. All business logic, including smart contracts, can be executed on this node directly and added to the chain.

After creating a block, the Level 1 business node broadcasts a version stripped of sensitive private data to Dragon Net. Three Level 2 Validating nodes validate the transaction based on guidelines determined from the business. A Level 3 Diversity node checks that the level 2 nodes are from a diverse array of locations. A Level 4 Notary node, hosted by a KYC partner, then signs the validation record received from the Level 3 node. The transaction hash is ledgered to the Level 5 public chain to take advantage of the hash power of massive public networks.

Dragon Net can be thought of as a “blockchain of blockchains”, where every level is a complete private blockchain. Because an L1 can send to multiple nodes on a single level, proof of existence is distributed among many places in the network. Eventually, proof of existence reaches level 5 and is published on a public network.

## Nobody’s Perfect

&gt;Known issues or tradeoffs

* Dragonchain is open source and even though the platform is easy enough for developers to code in any language they are comfortable with, we do not have so large a developer community as Ethereum. We would like to see the Ethereum developer community (and any other communities) become familiar with our SDK’s, our solutions, and our platform, to unlock the full potential of our Ethereum Interchain. Long ago we decided to prioritize both Bitcoin and Ethereum Interchains. We envision an ecosystem that encompasses different projects to give developers the ability to take full advantage of all the opportunities blockchain offers to create decentralized solutions not only for Reddit but for all of our current platforms and systems. We believe that together we will take the adoption of blockchain further. We currently have additional Interchain with Ethereum Classic. We look forward to Interchain with other blockchains in the future. We invite all blockchains projects who believe in decentralization and security to Interchain with Dragonchain.
* While we only have 700 nodes compared to 8,000 Ethereum and 10,000 Bitcoin nodes. We harness those 18,000 nodes to scale to extremely high levels of security. See [Dragonchain metrics](https://metrics.dragonchain.com).
* Some may consider the centralization of Dragonchain’s business nodes as an issue at first glance, however, the model is by design to protect business data. We do not consider this a drawback as these nodes can make any, none, or all data public. Depending upon the implementation, **every subreddit could have control of its own business node**, for potential business and enterprise offerings, bringing **new alternative revenue streams to Reddit**.

## Costs and resources

&gt;Summary of cost &amp; resource information for both on-chain &amp; off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost &amp; resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).

Every transaction on the PoC system had a transaction fee of $0.0001 (one-hundredth of a cent USD). At 256MM transactions, the demo cost $25,600. With current operational fees, the same demonstration would cost $640 USD.

For the demonstration, to achieve throughput to mimic a worldwide payments network, we modeled several clients in AWS and 4-5 business nodes to handle the traffic. The business nodes were tuned to handle higher throughput by adjusting memory and machine footprint on AWS. This flexibility is valuable to implementing a system such as envisioned by Reddit. Given that Reddit’s daily traffic (posts, replies, and votes) is less than half that of our demo, we would expect that the entire Reddit system could be handled on 2-5 business nodes using right-sized containers on AWS or similar environments.

Verification was accomplished on the operational Dragon Net network with over 700 independently owned verification nodes running around the world at no cost to the business other than paid transaction fees.

## Requirements

## Scaling

&gt;This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on &amp; off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:  
&gt;  
&gt;\*100,000 point claims (minting &amp; distributing points) \*25,000 subscriptions \*75,000 one-off points burning \*100,000 transfers

During Dragonchain’s 24 hour demo, the above required numbers were reached within the first few minutes.

Reddit’s total activity is 9000% more than Ethereum’s total transaction level. Even if you do not include votes, it is still 700% more than Ethereum’s current volume. Dragonchain has demonstrated that it can handle 250 million transactions a day, and it’s architecture allows for multiple systems to work at that level simultaneously. In our PoC, we demonstrate double the full capacity of Reddit, and every transaction was proven all the way to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

[Reddit Scaling on Ethereum](https://preview.redd.it/k9itp7es3td51.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c959bcb45321396857cc5e3e041d8b854cc065f)

## Decentralization

&gt;Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider. We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider

Dragonchain’s architecture calls for a hybrid approach. Private business nodes hold the sensitive data while the validation and verification of transactions for the business are decentralized within seconds and secured to public blockchains within 10 minutes to 2 hours. Nodes could potentially be controlled by owners of individual subreddits for more organic decentralization.

* Billing is currently centralized - there is a path to federation and decentralization of a scaled billing solution.
* Operational multi-cloud
* Operational on-premises capabilities
* Operational deployment to any datacenter
* Over 700 independent Community Verification Nodes with proof of ownership
* Operational Interchain (Interoperable to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic, open to more)

## Usability Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.

&gt;Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions

Dragonchain and its customers have demonstrated extraordinary usability as a feature in many applications, where users do not need to know that the system is backed by a live blockchain. Lyceum is one of these examples, where the progress of academy courses is being tracked, and successful completion of courses is rewarded with certificates on chain. Our @Save\_The\_Tweet bot is popular on Twitter. When used with one of the following hashtags - #please, #blockchain, #ThankYou, or #eternalize the tweet is saved through Eternal to multiple blockchains. A proof report is available for future reference. Other examples in use are DEN, our decentralized social media platform, and our console, where users can track their node rewards, view their TIME, and operate a business node.

Examples:

* [Den social media](https://den.social)
* [Eternal &amp; Save The Tweet bot](https://twitter.com/save_the_tweet?s=21)
* [Lyceum/Academy](https://academy.dragonchain.org)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)

All transactions are **immediately usable** on chain by the system. A transaction begins the path to decentralization at the conclusion of a 5-second block when it gets distributed across 5 separate community run nodes. Full decentralization occurs within 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on which interchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ethereum Classic) the transaction hits first. Within approximately 2 hours, the combined hash power of all interchained blockchains secures the transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)

With transaction pricing as low as $0.0000025 per transaction, it may be considered reasonable for Reddit to cover transaction fees for users.

[All of Reddit's Transactions on Blockchain \(month\)](https://preview.redd.it/p9tmb6i04td51.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6575e26f0e2f2d368123500d62d9a875efb3add1)

Community points can be earned by users and distributed directly to their Reddit account in batch (as per Reddit minting plan), and allow users to withdraw rewards to their Ethereum wallet whenever they wish. Withdrawal fees can be paid by either user or Reddit. This model has been operating inside the Dragonchain system since 2018, and many security and financial compliance features can be optionally added. We feel that this capability greatly enhances user experience because it is seamless to a regular user without cryptocurrency experience, yet flexible to a tech savvy user. With regard to currency or token transactions, these would occur on the Reddit network, verified to BTC and ETH. These transactions would incur the $0.0000025 transaction fee. To estimate this fee we use the monthly active Reddit users [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/) with a 60% adoption rate and an estimated 10 transactions per month average resulting in an approximate $720 cost across the system. Reddit could feasibly incur all associated *internal* network charges (mining/minting, transfer, burn) as these are very low and controllable fees.

[Reddit Internal Token Transaction Fees](https://preview.redd.it/cbnnso9a4td51.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdcef7c919820dac4fc5b78fc8e68f5032126e35)

&amp;#x200B;

[Reddit Ethereum Token Transaction Fees](https://preview.redd.it/5vrfq1nf4td51.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed092be8b21e0df4bb60ca0832f5bdda7665e8d)

When we consider further the Ethereum fees that might be incurred, we have a few choices for a solution.

1. Offload all Ethereum transaction fees (user withdrawals) to interested users as they wish to withdraw tokens for external use or sale.
2. Cover Ethereum transaction fees by aggregating them on a timed schedule. Users would request withdrawal (from Reddit or individual subreddits), and they would be transacted on the Ethereum network every hour (or some other schedule).
3. In a combination of the above, customers could cover aggregated fees.
4. Integrate with alternate Ethereum roll up solutions or other proposals to aggregate minting and distribution transactions onto Ethereum.

## Bonus Points

&gt;Users should be able to view their balances &amp; transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface

From interfaces for users who have no knowledge of blockchain technology to users who are well versed in blockchain terms such as those present in a typical block explorer, a system powered by Dragonchain has flexibility on how to provide balances and transaction data to users. Transactions can be made viewable in an Eternal Proof Report, which displays raw data along with TIME staking information and traceability all the way to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every other Interchained network. The report shows fields such as transaction ID, timestamp, block ID, multiple verifications, and Interchain proof. [See example here](https://eternal.dragonchain.com/transaction/c26fa966-1ae1-43d3-854b-5cf9c6ee0cd2).

Node payouts within the Dragonchain console are listed in chronological order and can be further seen in either Dragons or USD. [See example here](https://imgur.com/gallery/NbzS9bU).

In our social media platform, Dragon Den, users can see, in real-time, their NRG and MTR balances. [See example here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/580spr1)

A new influencer app powered by Dragonchain, Raiinmaker, breaks down data into a user friendly interface that shows coin portfolio, redeemed rewards, and social scores per campaign. [See example here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/7NdOSKu)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Exiting is fast &amp; simple

Withdrawing funds on Dragonchain’s console requires three clicks, however, withdrawal scenarios with more enhanced security features per Reddit’s discretion are obtainable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Interoperability Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.

Proven interoperability at scale that surpasses the required specifications. Our entire platform consists of interoperable blockchains connected to each other and traditional systems. APIs are well documented. Third party permissions are possible with a simple smart contract without the end user being aware. No need to learn any specialized proprietary language. Any code base (not subsets) is usable within a Docker container. Interoperable with any blockchain or traditional APIs. We’ve witnessed relatively complex systems built by engineers with no blockchain or cryptocurrency experience. We’ve also demonstrated the creation of smart contracts within minutes built with BASH shell and Node.js. Please see our source code and API documentation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it Open source and extensible  
&gt;  
&gt;APIs should be well documented and stable

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible &amp; straightforward Smart contracts are Docker based, can be written in any language, use full language (not subsets), and can therefore be integrated with any system including traditional system APIs. Simple is better. Learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary.

Advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or L2 scaling should not be required. Compatibility with common utilities &amp; toolchains is expected.

Dragonchain business nodes and smart contracts leverage Docker to allow the use of literally any language or executable code. No proprietary language is necessary. We’ve witnessed relatively complex systems built by engineers with no blockchain or cryptocurrency experience. We’ve also demonstrated the creation of smart contracts within minutes built with BASH shell and Node.js.

# Bonus

&gt;Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!

## TIME

Community points could be awarded to Reddit users based upon TIME too, whereas the longer someone is part of a subreddit, the more community points someone naturally gained, even if not actively commenting or sharing new posts. A daily login could be required for these community points to be credited. This grants awards to readers too and incentivizes readers to create an account on Reddit if they browse the website often. This concept could also be leveraged to provide some level of reputation based upon duration and consistency of contribution to a community subreddit.

* [TIME](https://dragonchain.com/community/time)
* [Learn more about TIME and how to apply this to your nodes](https://dragonchain.com/blog/pooled-nodes-apply-time)

## Dragon Den

Dragonchain has already built a social media platform that harnesses community involvement. Dragon Den is a decentralized community built on the Dragonchain blockchain platform. Dragon Den is Dragonchain’s answer to fake news, trolling, and censorship. It incentivizes the creation and evaluation of quality content within communities. It could be described as being a shareholder of a subreddit or Reddit in its entirety. The more your subreddit is thriving, the more rewarding it will be. Den is currently in a public beta and in active development, though the real token economy is not live yet. There are different tokens for various purposes. Two tokens are Lair Ownership Rights (LOR) and Lair Ownership Tokens (LOT).  LOT is a non-fungible token for ownership of a specific Lair. LOT will only be created and converted from LOR.

Energy (NRG) and Matter (MTR) work jointly. Your MTR determines how much NRG you receive in a 24-hour period. Providing quality content, or evaluating content will earn MTR.

* [Den social media](https://den.social)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security. Users have full ownership &amp; control of their points.

All community points awarded based upon any type of activity or gift, are secured and provable to all Interchain networks (currently BTC, ETH, ETC). Users are free to spend and withdraw their points as they please, depending on the features Reddit wants to bring into production.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else

Users can withdraw their balance to their ERC20 wallet, directly through Reddit. Reddit can cover the fees on their behalf, or the user covers this with a portion of their balance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else

Through our console users can withdraw their ERC20 rewards. This can be achieved on Reddit too. Here is a walkthrough of our console, though this does not show the quick withdrawal functionality, a user can withdraw at any time. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNlTMxnfVHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNlTMxnfVHw)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline

If necessary, signed transactions from the Reddit system (e.g. Reddit + Subreddit) can be sent to the Ethereum smart contract for minting.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available

To our knowledge, at least two large corporations, including a top 3 accounting firm, have conducted positive reviews. These reviews have never been made public, as Dragonchain did not pay or contract for these studies to be released.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bonus points  
&gt;  
&gt;Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress

See above

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Compatibility with HSMs &amp; hardware wallets

For the purpose of this proposal, all tokenization would be on the Ethereum network using standard token contracts and as such, would be able to leverage all hardware wallet and Ethereum ecosystem services.

## Other Considerations

&gt;Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly

This operation can be automated by smart contract on Ethereum. Subreddits can if desired have a role to play.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships) should be possible and scalable

This is possible and scalable with interaction between Dragonchain Reddit system and Ethereum token contract(s).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred

Dragonchain is fully open source (see section on Disney release after conclusion).

## Conclusion

Whether it is today, or in the future, we would like to work together to bring secure flexibility to the highest standards. It is our hope to be considered by Ethereum, Reddit, and other integrative solutions so we may further discuss the possibilities of implementation. In our public demonstration, 256 million transactions were handled in our operational network on chain in 24 hours, for the low cost of $25K, which if run today would cost $625. Dragonchain’s interoperable foundation provides the atmosphere necessary to implement a frictionless community points system. Thank you for your consideration of our proposal. We look forward to working with the community to make something great!

## Disney Releases Blockchain Platform as Open Source

The team at Disney created the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. The system was a hybrid interoperable blockchain platform for ledgering and smart contract development geared toward solving problems with blockchain adoption and usability. All objective evaluation would consider the team’s output a success. We released a list of use cases that we explored in some capacity at Disney, and our input on blockchain standardization as part of our participation in the W3C Blockchain Community Group.

[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-blockchain/2016May/0052.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-blockchain/2016May/0052.html)

## Open Source

In 2016, Roets proposed to release the platform as open source to spread the technology outside of Disney, as others within the W3C group were interested in the solutions that had been created inside of Disney.

Following a long process, step by step, the team met requirements for release. Among the requirements, the team had to:

* Obtain VP support and approval for the release
* Verify ownership of the software to be released
* Verify that no proprietary content would be released
* Convince the organization that there was a value to the open source community
* Convince the organization that there was a value to Disney
* Offer the plan for ongoing maintenance of the project outside of Disney
* Itemize competing projects
* Verify no conflict of interest
* Preferred license
* Change the project name to not use the name Disney, any Disney character, or any other associated IP - proposed Dragonchain - approved
* Obtain legal approval
* Approval from corporate, parks, and other business units
* Approval from multiple Disney patent groups Copyright holder defined by Disney (Disney Connected and Advanced Technologies)
* Trademark searches conducted for the selected name Dragonchain
* Obtain IT security approval
* Manual review of OSS components conducted
* OWASP Dependency and Vulnerability Check Conducted
* Obtain technical (software) approval
* Offer management, process, and financial plans for the maintenance of the project.
* Meet list of items to be addressed before release
* Remove all Disney project references and scripts
* Create a public distribution list for email communications
* Remove Roets’ direct and internal contact information
* Create public Slack channel and move from Disney slack channels
* Create proper labels for issue tracking
* Rename internal private Github repository
* Add informative description to Github page
* Expand README.md with more specific information
* Add information beyond current “Blockchains are Magic”
* Add getting started sections and info on cloning/forking the project
* Add installation details
* Add uninstall process
* Add unit, functional, and integration test information
* Detail how to contribute and get involved
* Describe the git workflow that the project will use
* Move to public, non-Disney git repository (Github or Bitbucket)
* Obtain Disney Open Source Committee approval for release

On top of meeting the above criteria, as part of the process, the maintainer of the project had to receive the codebase on their own personal email and create accounts for maintenance (e.g. Github) with non-Disney accounts. Given the fact that the project spanned multiple business units, Roets was individually responsible for its ongoing maintenance. Because of this, he proposed in the open source application to create a non-profit organization to hold the IP and maintain the project. This was approved by Disney.

The Disney Open Source Committee approved the application known as OSSRELEASE-10, and the code was released on October 2, 2016. Disney decided to not issue a press release.

## Dragonchain Foundation

The Dragonchain Foundation was created on January 17, 2017. [https://den.social/l/Dragonchain/24130078352e485d96d2125082151cf0/dragonchain-and-disney/](https://den.social/l/Dragonchain/24130078352e485d96d2125082151cf0/dragonchain-and-disney/)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Help with Ex Name on Mortgage, General Disarray","Kinda of a long story, I am going to try and get the main points across:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Purchased home with Fiance in 2012, never got married.  Broke up in 2016, she moved out and I have been making all payments since then.  During this period(2012-2016) she quit her job, and I wasn't making much, fell behind, but eventually was approved for a modification, with a HUD balloon payment for the missing months (roughly 60k).  We got the modification approved and official in August 2015 and I began making the paymenyts as agreed.  In December 2015 she got a new job, didn't want to contribute to mortgage, broke up, moved out.

&amp;#x200B;

\-About a year and a half ago, she contacted me about refinancing/ doing something to remove her name from mortgage, she is not seeking equity, just wants her name off of it so she can go buy a condo or something.  I had been monitoring my credit which was consistently hovering around 620-640, and at the time refinancing would have made my monthly payments go UP.  So I contacted my lender (Fargo) about doing an assumption.  It was going to cost roughly $7k in fees/closing costs, but my grandparents had recently died and I had 5k sitting around and offered to split the cost with her, which(IMO) is more than fair.  She never got back to me after this.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Last week I receive a letter form her lawyer, saying I have 2 weeks to show proof of beginning to refinance/assume mortgage before partition lawsuit is filed to force sale of home.  The lawyer indicated that the remaining principal was $183k with a home value of $250k, however I don't think she understands that there is a HUD balloon payment in there, which essentially means there's no equity in the house.  I contact my attorney to have him be the point of contact for her lawyer.

&amp;#x200B;

\-So I check my credit, not much change from last year, and apply to ReFi with quicken as rates seem to be lower and I just wanted to see my options.  I was instantly denied with a notice saying my score is below 580, which was news to me.  So I did my research and learned that home lending uses Fico 2, 5 scores, and pay to have those pulled and they're all almost a full 100 points lower than the scores I was seeing, one is 560, one is 525.  I have noticed some inaccuracies on the reports,  which I am currently trying to resolve, but as you can see I don't have a lot of time.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I began the assumption, however am not optimistic, as they are going off a score of 525, but they said they will take into account by debt to income, as well as the fact that I have been making on time mortgage payments since the modification.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I make $65k a year and currently have a girlfriend living with me that contributes to billst, I also started a successful business last year that grossed me an extra $16k, and this year I am already grossing more than that.  This income is also being considered with the assumption process.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My loan is an FHA loan, I read somewhere that a streamline refinance loan has a minimum credit score requirement of 500.  But actually finding a lender that does not set their own requirements above that has been difficult, I have reached out to a company called Vylla that seems to have their minimum at 500.

&amp;#x200B;

\-At this point, my attorney said if I cant get a ReFi or Assumption the court will absolutely force a sale of the home, however, I can try to get her half of each missed mortgage payment (whether or not she actually has that available, who knows).  But my preference is to remain in the home and to just continue paying, I love the house and have invested in converting the basement into a work shop for my business which has taken off, as well as the odds and ends that come with ownership such as new flooring on second floor, hot water heater replacement, etc.  I have been making all of the payments by myself for years, its just now, I need to literally be bank approved to do so, which sucks.  Not to mention even if I did get a few years worth of payments form her, my score is shit and I cant go get another house.  Oh, I also literally finished building a deck and a pool last week, that I had been saving up for over a year for.  Obviously not expecting this, which in hindsight was clearly foolish.

&amp;#x200B;

ROI,"Every Uyghur Allegation, Debunked (As of 2020, July 29th)","Uyghur allegation: There are over 2 million Uyghurs jailed in concentration camps in the name of re-education, but they are secretly being raped, tortured, sterilized, and murdered.

General Logical Rebuttal:

There is no incentive to do so, there is no historical precedence that suggests so, and so far there is no proof of so.

There are 10 million Uyghurs in the entirety of China, taking away 4 million for the population for seniors and children (based on the average working demographic of the world). If a third of the working population are in camps, Xinjiang’s economy would collapse. You would disproportionately see seniors and children on the street instead of adults. A significant number of shops would close down because there are no primary customers to buy things and primary shop owners to sell things. None of this has happened.

Update: Some conspiracists brought up the fact that Han also has a comparable population in Xinjiang as Uyghurs, and that somehow debunks my argument. As far as I am aware, and corroborated by many travellers that have been to Xinjiang, Hans and Uyghurs generally live in different communities and have very little interactions. Most significant towns are occupied by Uyghurs rather than Hans.

On The Number “2 million”:

You have probably seen the satellite image of alleged camps that holds these 2 million detainees. Take one of the most packed areas in the world, New York Manhattan. This place regularly holds 1.6 million people and is an undoubtedly tightly packed place. As there are no skyscrapers in these satellite images, the area of occupation for the 2 million Uighur camps should take up another half of an extra Manhattan. Where are the satellite images of city-sized camps around Xinjiang?

If this does not give you an idea of how ridiculous the number 2 million is, the total population of US inmates is 2.3 million. There are 1,719 state prisons, 102 federal prisons, 942 juvenile correctional facilities, 3,283 local jails, and 79 Indian Country jails as well as military prisons, immigration detention facilities, civil commitment centers, and prisons. The US prisons are also known to be constantly operating at maximum capacity. There should be over 6 thousand different sized facilities in the province of Xinjiang, not just a couple of tens of small elementary school-sized structures.

There should be over 6 thousand different sized facilities in the province of Xinjiang, not just a couple of tens of small elementary school-sized structures.

The Origin of the number 2 million:

As far as I can trace back, there are currently 2 sources for numbers in the millions, World Uyghur Congress and Adrian Zenz’s “study”.

The World Uyghur Congress’ number is easy to debunk (not saying Zenz’s is any more difficult). Here is a video of how the president of the WUC, Omer Kanat, responded to their allegation of 1 million Uyghurs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8uZZjB4kfM

https://twitter.com/_nuntio/status/1282619936997888001

President Kanat is shown to be not very confident when making statements regarding where their source came from, which he then resorts to saying that the number is provided by “some western media.” Keep in mind that the WUC is what a significant amount of articles cite when addressing the issue of detainee numbers. It is safe to conclude that the World Uyghur Congress has lied.

Update: In the more completed footage, we can see that President Kanat gave tacit approval to the comment made by the interviewer regarding WUC’s affiliation with NED, the NGO that receives funding directly from CIA. NED is behind the civil unrest in Hong Kong, which is a fact that is barely conceived in their own website.

https://www.ned.org/region/asia/hong-kong-china-2019/

Adrian Zenz’s study is a bit more complicated to debunk because there is an actual “study” to look at. After taking some time to look at the actual study and doing some research on Adrian Zenz, one can quickly find out that he does not have a history in conducting academically approved papers. He has not received education in statistics related subjects and he has a long track record of making some very “questionable” claims. He claimed that he is “sent by God to punish Beijing,” and actively connects homosexuality, gender equality, and bans on corporal punishment to the power of “Antichrist.” His Wikipedia page has since removed any content regarding his “unconventional” beliefs but archives can still be found on the internet.

Regarding the actual study, there is actually nothing much of substance. Most of the paragraphs are dedicated to providing information on the geological and geographical information on Xinjiang. The conclusion of “millions of detainees” is made by interviewing merely 8 alleged former detainees. There is no further useful information in Zenz’s study on this topic. It is fair to conclude, with a relationship to his fundamentalist Christian views and track record of questionable beliefs by today’s standard, that Adrian Zenz’s study is ultimately unfit to be cited by any article.

If you don’t believe my personal account, here is an article that includes a more detailed explanation:

The “Evidence” of Vocational Training School’s Human Rights Violation:

Drone Footage of blindfolded men shackled and shaven:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU_w5UzdZEs

The mentioning of this specific drone footage usually comes with allegations regarding the nature of the content. Most would claim that this is a transfer of Uyghur detainees to the concentration camps. However, a mere close up inspection of the back of vests of these alleged detainees shows that these people belong to the 喀什市看守所, Kashgar Remand Prison. This means that these are inmates, prisoners, literal criminals that are now being portrayed as innocent victims to suit the commentator’s political agenda. Using this footage to argue that the concentration camp exists is ill-intentioned and aims to exploit viewers who can not read Simplified Chinese.

Update: Video of Blindfolded &amp; bound Uighur prisoners

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkmkcOdyrbw

This video holds even less water than the aforementioned drone footage, as the men in the video are featureless. They weren’t even shown to be Uyghurs. So what is video then? This is a video captured in August 2017 on Douban. The blindfolded men are pyramid scheme (MLM) missionaries, literal criminals that scams people of their hard-earned cash and literally destroy lifes and families. They are victimized to suit the agenda of whomever uses this as “evidence” of

Update: Adrian Zenz’s Sterilization Study:

Another unpleasant surprise coming from this Fundementalist Christian on his “God given mission to destroy Beijing.” Zenz, continuing his demonstration of reality warping magic-based power, recently published another study unearthing the shocking news that “80% of all sterilizations in China are performed in Xinjiang.” This is what everyone thinks they have heard.

The actual study is actually on the usage of IUDs, a reversible contraception device.

The actual study? It falls apart very easily. The very document that Zenz supposedly has cited shows that Xinjiang only contributes 8.7% of the total IUDs performed in China.

Credits to u/Beledorhan for his investigative work. He does a much better job at deconstructing this study.

Testimonies by “Former Detainees”:

First of all, it is important to understand the fact that testimonies are anecdotal evidence, heavily subjected to perception bias. Society today suffers from false victimhood because people are very likely to believe the perceived victim and disregard anything coming from the defendant. In the case of testimonies’ falsehood, the defendant is the one that suffers the most.

Tursunay Ziyawudun:

Tursunay Ziyawundun is the person that started the Forced Sterilization/Chemical Castration Allegation, which is very rampant on today’s internet.

https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c

The Problem? She stated in her interview with Buzzfeed months ago that she “wasn’t beaten or abused”:

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-uighur-xinjiang-kazakhstan

Why did she change her testimony? A simple explanation would be that had she claimed to have been physically abused, she would have been asked to show bodily evidence, something that would immediately debunk her claim. Now 7 months later, she could claim whatever she wants to, and can simply disregard any request to show bodily evidence.

Rushan Abbas:

Then there is the bizarre case of Rushan Abbas. She actually has a presence on Reddit. She runs an account called u/uyghurrallynyc that has since been shut down after her AMA on r/IAmA gathering over 30k upvotes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e9ad4n/i_am_rushan_abbas_uyghur_activist_and_survivor_of/

She claims to be an Uyghur activist and that many of her friends were locked up in the concentration camps. So what is the big news? She failed to mention her association with NED, a literal branch of CIA, and her participation in the human rights abuse in Guantanamo Bay in 2003, an actual verifiable human rights atrocity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp

It remains unclear what her role was at the detention camp. She later explained that she only did translation work, which, need I remind you, still facilitated the inhumane interrogation of innocent people and the worst-case scenario actually participated in the torturing of mostly religious Muslims. The camp remains open indefinitely under the Trump administration.

Update: Sayragul Sauytbay:

This person is on a whole new level of creativity and disgeniuncy. Her allegations took inspirations from grimdark fantasy fictions, including:

“Seeing an old woman having her skin flayed.”

“Starved throughout an entire week but being force fed BBQ pork on Fridays.“

“Personally raped in front of 200 inmates.”

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7599941/Whistleblower-escaped-Chinese-education-camp-reveals-horrors.html

This all sounds horrible until you look at her original testimony, being that “I didn’t see any violence.”

China Refuses Entry to These “Concentration Camps”? False.

Many galaxy brain internet conspiracists have made the same point, that is if there is truly nothing wrong with what they are doing at these camps, then why wouldn’t they allow entry to these camps?

They have, many times.

January 2019: China invited UN observers.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1456065

June 2019: China invited UN High commissioner.

https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/China-Invites-UN-to-Visit-Education-Centers-in-Xinjiang-20190613-0004.html

Many News Outlets like BBC and Vice have also done documentaries on the issue, with BBC having the opportunity to actually go inside the vocational training schools. The result? No matter how hard BBC tried to portray the schools as hell on earth, including blatantly mistranslating interviewee’s words, using out of context satellite images, and making up lies about a “graffiti that they just so happened to have found on a wall,” the documentary shows nothing of the accused “human right violations,” which of course upsets the conspiracy advocates.

https://medium.com/@sunfeiyang/breaking-down-the-bbcs-visit-to-hotan-xinjiang-e284934a7aab

Despite China’s efforts to clear it’s own name, the conspiracists of the west still refuse to accept reality and claim that these “inside footages” are planned and faked to trick the viewers. Simply take a look at the comment section of the BBC documentary.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmId2ZP3h0c

It is hard to believe that there is somehow a coexistence between people who think that China has something to hide so they won’t allow inside access, and people who think that China has faked the inside access.

The truth has always been there, but it may not be the truth that some people want to see.

The Fake Hair that is Weaved from “Uyghur Detainees’ Hair.”

The most cartoonishly ridiculous accusation award goes to this allegation.

Some media have covered the topic that the US has recently seized $800,000 worth of Chinese synthetic hair products, and with some strange connection to the fact that chinese prisoners’ heads are shaven (just like every other country’s prisoners, the allegation is born.

However, the debunking of the allegation lies in the articles that report them. Why do they use words like “suspected”,”alleged”, and “supposedly” when it is rather simple to tell the difference between real hair and synthetic hair? I have asked many people who have experience with fake hair extensions on whether synthetic hair feels or touches differently than real hair. My sister owns one too, which she gladly let me touch it for myself. The result is almost certain that hair extensions and synthetic hairs feel very different from real hair. If the people that seized the hair cargo are not idiots, why are the reports still using words like “suspected” when they would gladly jump on the conclusion of “yes, they are for sure real hair?”

Secondly, hair extension and fake hair weaved from real hair does exist, but they are comparatively very expensive. I could just see the clowns reaching the conclusion that “oh that must mean that the hair extensions are made from detainees’ hair to make big money.” You can sell your long, undyed hair for a good price, that is just a known fact if you have experience with the beauty or cosplay industry, and in most Chinese barbershops, you can sell your hair on the spot if you want. Thus, even if the hair seized is weaved from real hair, that's not evidence for it being made from the hair of detained prisoners that no one has the evidence of them even existing.

To be continued when more false allegations inevitably rise up.

personalfinance,Apartment vs Home Buying,"Looking for some reassurance that I'm thinking clearly with regards to housing.  22 and currently make 67K (started in May) while living at home with my parents.

Recently I started exploring the idea of buying a home.  After talking with a realtor and getting preapproval letters I realized that I'm not exactly in a good financial spot to buy a home.  

I would like to move out and rent an apartment for 6-12 months which would allow me to continue to save but also have my own place.  The costs of apartments in my area range from 650-1200 / month.  My parents are strongly against me getting an apartment because, ""Rent will be the same as a mortgage per month"". They want me to take a higher interest rate (4.5%) to get down payment assistance so I can buy a house vs me wanting to wait and save enough to not take down payment assistance (conventional at 2.5%).  I have enough saved up for down payment and closing costs but not enough to deal with furnishing and having a emergency fund.  

I don't think I can stay at home much longer without loosing my sanity.  My parents also claim that rent is a waste.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing - I keep seeing redditors getting 3% or less and little to no closing costs. How?,"Hey guys! I'm looking at refinancing my mortgage. We're almost 2 years in. We owe roughly $192k and the house is estimated to be worth $243k per real estate websites. I know this is not a solid indicator but we believe it's pretty close based on recent sales in our neighborhood. We paid $219,500 and have done some work on the house.


Current rate is 4.25%. My current mortgage holder is offering for us to refinance to 3.125% for 1% of the current balance so roughly $1,900. No additional closing costs or fee. We would keep our existing loan and still have ~28 years left on our mortgage. No appraisal or anything required. They said they offer the same interest rate to everyone regardless of loan size, credit score, etc and do not negotiate rates. I didn't think to ask if they negotiate fees though?


Our break even point is about 16 months if you count just the $120 we would save on mortgage payments. Is this a solid deal? I keep seeing people talk about an interest rate of 3% or lower and little to no closing costs. I've checked various online lenders and I don't see any of them advertising these types of deals..

CryptoCurrency,Passive investing strategy,"I have been holding crypto and following the ecosystem for a long time, and I believe crypto will revolutionise the financial system and still has much potential to increase in value.

However until now my holdings have been mostly handpicked. In traditional investments I am a subscriber to passive investing and usually invest in broad index funds, and I want to apply that investment philosophy to my crypto holdings.

With this in mind I looked at some available crypto indices and none of them seemed to fill my needs, but looking at them helped me define some of the criteria for my own index:

* Not too broad

I will be reproducing the index manually, so having too many assets will make the extra hassle of trading and storing the small-weighted assets not worth it.

* Exclude stablecoins

I don't see the point of including stablecoins in a cryptoasset index. If I wanted to invest in the asset the stablecoin tracks I'd be better off holding the followed asset itself.

* Exclude centrally managed tokens

All indices I found included assets such as Binance Coin and OKB. I see investing in such assets as investing in the managing entity and not in the crypto ecosystem itself, as those tokens will be much more correlated with the business success of the entity than with the success of the ecosystem.

* Require reasonable trading availability

The asset must be available for trading in a reasonable number of exchanges.

* Market capitalization weighting

Free-float market cap weighting is the standard method of weighting whole-market indices. I have seen some indices that use square root of market cap weighting in order to not be so Bitcoin-heavy, but I am not convinced that that is a better representation of the market or that it would lead to better returns.

With these criteria in mind I evaluated the top coins by market capitalization. I decided to use CoinGecko as my main source, but I do cross check the values with CoinMarketCap and CoinCap.io to avoid some big flaw in CoinGecko's methodology.

* Bitcoin

Obviously the big guy is in.

* Ethereum

I also have no issues with Ethereum.

* XRP

Ripple is a bit too centrally-controlled for my taste and there's also the worry that the value of the XRP token itself may not be too correlated with the network's success, but I still consider it to be worthy for inclusion.

* Tether

Tether is excluded due to being a stable coin and being centrally-controlled.

* Bitcoin Cash

The only thing that worries me about Bitcoin Cash is that the community seems to be too worried about insisting that it is the true Bitcoin instead of developed, but I don't see any reason to exclude it given my criteria.

* Cardano

This is the first asset with which I don't have too much experience. Their website is a bit too heavy on buzzwords, but my research seems to show that it is a real network, there's no big problems with their whitepaper.

* Bitcoin SV

I personally have no idea how Bitcoin SV is so high in market capitalization, as I see it as just Craig Steven Wright's tool to strengthen his Satoshi claim, but the point of the index and the criteria is to remove my personal feelings from the decision, so it stays in.

* Litecoin

Litecoin is one of the oldest assets around and I have no objection for it.

* Crypto.com Coin

This is the first one where I am having a hard time deciding if it stays in or not. Its website is full of buzzwords. They have a whitepaper explaining how the network works, but I can't see it as much more than a centrally-managed token with a bunch of apps around it and no real value proposition. The company itself seems shady, having been through a name change, as it was previously called Monaco, the way their cards work smells heavily like a Ponzi scheme, they promise huge interest rates for staking random coins with them and the amount of people that show up speaking well of it in any post about it reeks of paid shills.

For some reason it is also not listed on CoinCap.io, although it is listed on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. It is also listed on fewer exchanges than other coins we've seen so far.

I couldn't find any concrete evidence of it being a scam, but I am excluding it for being a centrally-controlled token.

* Binance Coin

This is a Binance-controlled token, so it is out.

* EOS

I also didn't know much about this coin, but my research didn't raise any red flags about it, so it's in.

* ChainLink

This one is an ERC20 token, but it is managed by a smart contract and although it seems to be somewhat centrally-controlled by now it does have a governance model to make this control be diluted over time. It is also trying to solve a real problem, so it is in.

* Tezos

I was not too familiar with it, but after researching about it I really like the idea. I see no problem in including it.

* Stellar

Stellar feels to me a bit too much like Ripple 2.0, but I don't have any concrete problems with it.

* OKB

This is an OKEX-controlled token, so it is out.

* Monero

Another one of the old kids in town, I have no problems with it.

* TRON

I have a ""too buzzwordy"" feeling about TRON, and I feel it is a bit too much connected to its founder, but no concrete problems as well.

* LEO Token

This is a bitfinex-controlled token, so it is out.

* USD Coin

USD Coin is excluded due to being a stable coin and being centrally-controlled.

* cDAI

This is an asset that I am not too sure I understand completely, and it is not listed from CoinCap.io and its market cap is not computed on CoinMarketCap.

From what I can gather a cToken is meant to be a token that identifies that you have deposited in Compound's loan market. The only place where it is really traded is in the Compound exchange itself, and it's value is tied to the interest accrued from the loans in the platform and to the underlying asset, which in this case is DAI, a stablecoin.

I find Compound Finance interesting and intend to read more about it, but I don't think cDAI is fit for my index, as it is not freely tradeable and tied to a stablecoin.

* Huobi Token

This is a Huobi-controlled token, so it is out.

* VeChain

This is one more buzzwordy smart contract platform with no concrete red flags to it.

* Ethereum Classic

A fork from the main Ethereum chain that rejects the rescue of stolen funds from a buggy smart contract. I am sympathetic to the idea of rejecting a centrally-proposed hardfork, and I see no red flags with this coin.

And with this we are up to my intended 15 assets. This is the composition of the index with current market capitalizations:

|Asset|Weight|
|:-|:-|
|bitcoin|72,29%|
|ethereum|12,71%|
|ripple|3,80%|
|bitcoin-cash|1,89%|
|cardano|1,56%|
|bitcoin-cash-sv|1,42%|
|litecoin|1,28%|
|eos|1,03%|
|chainlink|0,96%|
|tezos|0,73%|
|stellar|0,71%|
|monero|0,51%|
|tron|0,46%|
|vechain|0,36%|
|ethereum-classic|0,30%|

I have 100% payment record but I want to consolidate or reduce this. I got a mailing from a company and filled out a short form and after a 20 minute telephone conversation the guy sent me an email summary too look over. Here is the jist:

&gt;I attached a snapshot of your approved 52 month program and highlighted the main information we spoke about. Just remember this is a no interest program and all our program fees and costs are already included in your monthly payment of $782.32. This program will be saving you $628.68 per month compared to the minimums you’re paying on your credit cards right now.

 

&gt;A brief overview of the program- The 1 initial downfall is the initial dip in your credit, however it will end up helping your credit score in the long run as well as your debt to income ratio. The benefits to the program are you are out from underneath the high interest rates you’re paying, your saving nearly $650 per month, your saving $15,857 off the principle balance you owe the creditors, It’s a guaranteed program that you will be out of debt in 52 months as long as you make your payments on time, we guarantee that we will save you at least 35% off the principle balances you owe your creditors, there are no pre-payment penalties if you ever want to pay more month you can and you also have full legal representation by Slate Legal Group in this program as well.

personalfinance,PayPal Spear Phishing: Heads Up!,"Got a pretty decently mocked up spear phishing email from PayPal the other day, notifying me that my account was limited and under review.

More on this in a bit.**

Not a day goes by that I get a different one, mocked up to look like a follow up to the previous email, and that's when I took a closer peek. Sure enough, the from line was spoofed, the links in the address redirected to non-PayPal websites and the footer listed an address in Singapore.

At this point I forwarded the email to the spoof@paypal.com address for their review, outlining the process (nothing new to them, I'm sure). What's odd is that they correctly spoofed an email that had an account, and that the other recipient emails also listed in the ""to"" line were in alphabetical order, strongly suggesting that these emails came from a list of user accounts.

Odd, as I didn't remember a PayPal breach, nor did I receive an email from PayPal informing me that my account had been compromised. **Furthermore, the fact that I was simply able to input an entirely new phone number for 2FA WITHOUT confirming it through the original account is an *incredibly* stupid cybersec oversight.** I didn't even receive a confirmation email when I added the new number. If the phishers were able to get my password, say from a keylogger on the linked website, then add their own number, they'd be in without the owner even knowing.

I'm not expecting a serious response from PayPal, but we'll see. A quick Google turns up [a few articles on PayPal's issues recently,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/02/22/paypal-critical-login-hack-new-report-warns-you-are-at-risk-from-thieves-heres-the-reality/#711b77ac445e) and I remember reading on here about another user that nearly gave up access to their PayPal account using the linked method.

btc,Two reasons why stable 10 minute block times averages are more important than a rather small long term schedule drift.,"Before I open my two reasons, two preliminary facts:

1. Current schedule drift is less than 1 yr per lifetime of Bitcoin Cash up to now.

2. If we correct the oscillation and implement a stable new difficulty algorithm that is absolutely scheduled, we stop the future drift. We end up with the drift of the past meaning from wherever we base our absolute scheduling. That may mean we do not correct for past drift at all. To consider the question of whether we should, I want to put up two reasons why I think a stable 10 minute block time average is more important than a small long term schedule.

__1. The average time will be a factor in dimensioning computer systems that build on Bitcoin Cash.__

Right now, one might thinks the 10 minute block average is very big, because the network is not being heavily used and there is a quasi-consensus rule which implies most nodes will not accept blocks &gt; 32mb.

But 32mb is far from the end goal of Bitcoin Cash on chain scaling. For Bitcoin Cash to succeed, we hope blocks will become MUCH bigger. This means the performance of relaying and processing blocks will become an important factor for node implementations.

Software needs hardware and hardware systems need to be dimensioned for the expected workload.

A stable 10-minute average allows easier dimensioning of the server hardware needed to deal with large-sized blocks.

As Gavin Andresen said: ""_design for success_"".

Therefore we should think about the case where blocks are large.

Now, what happens if we implement an algorithm where the blocks can take longer in, let's say, the next 5 years, but then suddenly the difficulty is dropped a bit so that they now effectively arrive faster?

Then your system which you dimensioned for e.g. 11.25 minutes / block would suddenly need to process more per time interval and might be under-dimensioned.

We could say: no problem - technology is going to improve anyway. The consensus around which block sizes are allowed needs to move toward higher block sizes anyway which will make current systems under-dimensioned - perhaps much faster.

But is it really necessary to add another complicating factor to this already complex calculation by implementing a diminishing block time average?

__2. Enabling changes to monetary policy such as influencing the emission schedule opens the Overton window to including less well considered monetary policy changes.__

In the less harmful scenario, something like drift correction would be well motivated, its benefits and risks laid out clearly, discussed and eventually accepted by Bitcoin Cash (stake)holders.

In the more harmful scenario, such changes would be pushed through without much discussion by a small group which demonstrates that the protocol is easy to change in ways that don't need to be well motivated and largely risk-free and may even disproportionately benefit a certain subset of stakeholders. This would not be a good selling point for Bitcoin Cash.

Those are the two reasons I want to bring up for considering the stability of the ""10 minute block time average"" as a more important point than correcting for a drift which compared to long term emission (&gt; 100 years) is less than 1%.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[medical debt] Will a statement of support put family on the hook for my bills?,"#Question: 

The hospital's financial aid department is asking me to provide a letter of support from folks who are helping me out, written by them, and signed. My concern is that they will try to go after father (retired, fixed income) to pay for the medical bills.

#Background:
* In the US
* Knocked knife off counter onto my foot in May
* Trip to ER - stitches, tetanus shot, X-rays, discharge.
* Paid up front with Ortho follow-up, that debt's paid

Bill came for the Hospital visit and was: 

* ~$2500 from the hospital and 
* ~$600 for the Physicians group 
* $30 for radiology.

While in the Hospital the Financial aid folks came by and told me about their policies, and said they waive the debt if you're ~x00% of the federal poverty level.

#Personal Finances
* 36 male
* long term unemployed (2+years)
* less than $200 in bank accounts
* $500 in credit debt

I've been surviving with a room from my father, and he's been providing enough money for me to eat (no judgement please, I feel bad about it, it's no help for my current situation)

# TL:DR;

Will having my father write a statement that he's been supporting me by giving food put him on the hook for my medical bills? How do I proceed if Yes?",finance

personalfinance,My experience refinancing my student loans to lower my interest rate,"I'm not sure if anyone really cares or wants to hear this, but I just wanted to share my experience with students loans and refinancing. Since graduating college 4 years ago I have consolidated my loans and then refinanced a total of 2 additional times. Basically, I have restructured my loans about once a year in some way. By timing my refinancing with federal rate cuts I have collectively turned my interest rate from 5.29% to 3.85%.  
I'm not saying this is possible for everyone. I highly benefit from a stable job that pays me well. But it doesn't hurt to at least shop around interest rates for student loans every now and then. For me personally, I went to private loans when I consolidated because I was not going to be eligible for the federal student loan benefits and interest rates were much lower by going private.  
Just some food for thought as people work towards cutting down their student loans. Obviously each situation is unique so make sure you evaluate what you can safely handle as a monthly payment.",finance

Recently I was getting things in the mail about refi and how much I could stave so I contacted my mortgage broker that I used to by the house.  She ran some initial number and due to the increased value of our home (which would remove PMI) along with the lower interest rate we could potential save over $250 a month.  I said proceed and we filled out the paperwork to start the process. This was two weeks ago.  Since then I have no idea what she has done, in fact I cant even get ahold of her.  She is not returning calls or emails, her office says she is in but she is just not getting back to me.  I am getting quite frustrated and at this point do not feel I own her my business.  If my credit was already ran and the process started would it hurt my credit to back out and shop for a new lender? I havent signed anything other than an ok to run my credit.

For bonus points, since I was looking into home refi I also threw in some number for auto refi for the one vehicle I bought a year ago, the current interest rates are quite a bit lower and I could save a decent amount of money.  If I wanted to look into this should I do take care of the home refi first and then deal with the care or does it matter either way? Even my bank says I can apply for an auto refi online and be approved in a matter of minutes.

I keep up this trend I should be debt free \~26 months and pay roughly $1800 in interest.

I have a $20k 401k that could pull without penalty because I've been impacted by covid. I would pay off my student loan that's at 7.25%. This would drop my payoff date to 17 months and only pay $328 in interest.

I was considering doing so on a 600k townhome (I live in Los Angeles😭) and was going to use all my money on the downpayment/closing fees/points so that I could get a $510k loan at 2.5%. After doing some research we realized that if we only pay down $40k we can get the money we need while maintaining much more liquid cash at 2.75%; and if we go for an $800k home we could put down $30k and still have an interest rate of 2.5% (i have no idea how tf that works out.) My father-in-law is pressuring us to take these loans while putting as little as we can down and pump our money directly into home improvements as we probably won’t live in the home for 30 years anyway. I’ve been looking at the numbers and from a glance it seems like we’d be able to afford the payments plenty comfortably (we could even leave ourselves a year-long cash buffer if we wanted with this method, it seems.)

What cautions me however is that he refers to it as “free money” and that kind of verbiage always makes alarms go off in my head. From where I’m standing this is irresponsible feeling but seems ultimately sound enough provided we can keep our monthly payments low. I know we’ll end up paying a lot more interest than we would have otherwise, but we’ll also have a lot more home than we would have otherwise and if we make extra payments to attack the principle it seems like it could be a very good way to gain equity quickly while not stretching myself financially...

Hardware implementations like the Google [Titan Key](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) or Yubico [Yubikey](https://amzn.to/3hTQ5bt) are relatively affordable and seem to fix some of the problems mentioned earlier, no power required, harder to compromise however they are equally if not more 'losable'. They also appear to work with more devices where a synchronized code generator isn't always workable. 

How easy (or hard) is it to also recover access if you no longer have access to these devices or software? Is there any benefit of using one option (hardware vs software) over the other in this regard?",technology

personalfinance,Higher Limit Secured Card or just go Unsecured,"I'm trying to boost my credit and I'm not in bad territory. One bureau has me at 670, another just over 700. I'd like a $10K limit credit card but going the unsecured route doesn't SEEM like my best chance at approval. It's possible, but I'm willing to put money into a secured card (I have almost $40K in savings) to get what I want. I'm ok with it being locked away until I prove my credit-worthiness as it usually gets released within 6-12 mos (assuming no issues). I've looked around the web about secured cards stories and most have the same details: less than $1K credit amounts, bad or little to no credit applicants, etc. I don't really fit in that category at all. I asked one of my bank's (Navy Fed) employees about secured cards and he admitted most people who apply for them fall into that category and my best bet for what I want (the higher limit) is to try for the unsecured card.

So... the actual questions in all of this is ""What are your thoughts on going for the secured card? Am I better off rolling the dice on an unsecured and I hope they don't stick me with a $3K limit?"" Any personal experience advice would be appreciated. I'm not the most financially savvy person so let me have it if I'm missing something. Maybe I am putting too much thought into my credit score as I have been approved for everything I've tried for over the past few years but always at lower-than-I-expected limits. I want to alley-oop my own slam dunk, if you will. I may be making some larger purchases in the next couple years that I'd rather have a card for instead of just using cash. I DO NOT want to open anymore company-specific cards. This is the biggest reason why I need a more any-type purchase credit card. Otherwise, I'd just use cash from savings that wouldn't benefit me credit-wise.

Also, Credit Karma (I know... not the most reliable) shows on their Credit Simulator that if I open a card with a $10K limit, my 670 would jump to 720. This is the kind of impact I'm looking for and I understand it's not a guarantee. But that's what I'm aiming for that will get me into the territory I want to be in. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Extra mortgage payments to remove PMI - what is the 'rate of return?',"Let's say I buy a $400k house with 10% down, with a mortgage interest rate of 2.5%. Google says that PMI is typically 0.5% - 1.0% of the initial loan balance annually. For our example, let's say 0.75% of $360k, which is 2700/yr.

Depending on who you ask, there is minimal utility to paying off a 2.5% loan early compared with other investments. With that said, **what is the marginal benefit to paying down the loan to remove PMI? **

PMI can usually be removed at 20% with an inspection/appraisal, or 22% without an appraisal. So the question is: what 'interest rate' are we paying on that outstanding 12% of equity? Well that would be roughly 2700/(.12*360000) = 6.25% for the PMI component, plus the conventional interest of 2.5% for a total of ~8.75% annually.

Am I looking at this correctly? I'm aware that PMI is not ""interest"", but this seems like a nice way of comparing prospective rates of return when deciding whether to race to 20-22% equity in a home vs. contributing to retirement or other investments.

I'm interested in getting people's thoughts on this.",finance

personalfinance,2020 IRS W-4 Calculator Issues,"So I've switched jobs this year (for good reasons, thankfully, not Corona related or otherwise) and I'm trying to get my withholding correct on the second job, and the IRS calculator is giving me nonsense, and Turbo-Tax is giving me a completely different answer.

I assume it's user error, but I've double and triple checked and I'm very confused. I'm usually pretty good at this stuff.

Married Filing Jointly
Can't be claimed dependent
2 Dependents, 2 jobs this year

First job (01/01/2020 - 07/03/2020) Bi-weekly pay
Total wages $71,910
Total federal withheld $5693

Second Job (07/13/2020 - 12/31/2020) Bi-weekly pay
Total estimated wages for 7/13-12/31 this year - $110,000
Income tax withheld from my first (and only) check is $1850.

I'll get around $1000 in non-wage income.

Deductions - $10k SALT limit, $14000 mortgage interest, $2000 charity

The results - IRS.gov says I'll get a $24,343 refund if I leave it alone, which definitely doesn't seem right. But the even weirder thing is that the slider at the top, as I move it to the left, does crazy shit. If I move it to $24000 refund, it says I need $1289 withheld per check, $561 less than current.

Then if I move it all the way to $0 refund, it says I need $1170 withheld per check, $680 less than current.

I'm just an engineer, not a mathematician or anything, but that doesn't add up. It's like it thinks I get paid 4 times a week or something.

Turbo-tax on the otherhand, shows an estimated refund of 1400. Which is high, but close enough I'd probably leave it.

The issue is, when I use the tax tables, I think my tax should be around $18000 this year, and I'm currently on track to withhold about $28000. I think I'm probably withholding too much (because my second job's payroll system is probably calculating based on a full year at that pay).

Another slight wrinkle is that the second job is consulting paid hourly, so it varies slightly from week to week, this first pay period was 88 hours, most will likely be about 84 or so I think on average.

Any help? Switching jobs makes it really confusing. Thanks in advance.

(Obvious throwaway account since I'm not super comfortable putting my actual income out there)

Edit: Also will contribute about $9k to a pre-tax 401k later this year, and total health insurance premiums taken out of paychecks will be around $8k or so.",finance

personalfinance,Is there any benefit to having multiple checking and savings accounts?,"I have several checking and savings accounts, spread over four different banks. Right now, 3 checking and 5 savings. 

One checking account is for rental properties I own, one checking is my primary where my mortgage comes from, and the last one I've had for 20+ years so... Just never bothered closing it. Netflix and other small junk goes through there. 

I have several savings accounts mainly because I jumped around for decent interest rates. An account for emergency fund (same bank as my primary checking), one for primary savings (online bank), one tied to my 20+ year account, and a couple that I never bothered to close (online banks, less than $20 in each). Most of my funds are in 401K and stocks and I keep less than 100K liquid for emergencies.

personalfinance,Withdrawing from Roth IRA for down payment on a house,"After spending a ridiculous amount (about $70k) on rent the past 4 years, my husband and I are looking to buy a house and start building equity. We're looking at spending max $250k, and currently only have about $10k in savings. In order to supplement funds for the down payment and closing costs, I am considering withdrawing some of my contributions from my Roth IRA. Obviously it's not ideal to touch retirement savings; however when I look at the performance of my Roth, it's not clear to me that's it's been a good investment vehicle. Since I opened the account in 2013, I've contributed $14,750, and the current balance is $16,561. That doesn't seem like a lot of growth. I'm also contributing to a 401K that's currently at a $105k balance, and that is what I view as my primary retirement savings. Since I'm not able to max out my Roth contributions and earn more compound interest, is it really harming my financial future by using a chunk of those funds toward investing in a home? Our mortgage loan officer is trying to convince us to take advantage of a program his company has developed, a HOPP loan that requires no down payment at all, but the interest rate is 5% so of course that's what he would want us to do. I'd rather take out a conventional loan with a lower interest rate, but the trade-off is dipping into my savings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
politics,Megathread: President Trump Suggests Delaying 2020 Presidential Election,"President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November’s presidential election.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

personalfinance,About to Hit my 3-Month Emergency Fund Goal. Looking for what's next,"A little back story, I used to be a Dave Ramsey nut spending a good portion of my day listening to his videos in the background while I did work, so I was doing everything the man said:

* Save $1000
* Pay Debt (All Student Loans currently \~$29k ranging from 2.5% - 6.2%)

But after I recently moved, I felt so uncomfortable with only $1000 in Savings (COVID and increased rent), so I decided to extend it to 3-Months for a little cushion.

Part of me wants to start saving for investment property/rent hacking whatever you want to call. I do construction, so I feel confident that if I picked up property for cheap, comparatively, that I could restore it to working condition. Currently looking at property &lt;= $225k after all closeout, remodel, and fees. Income $75k.

The other part of me feels like I have house fever, would be biting off way more than I could chew, and I should be paying down debts asap.

Thoughts, opinions, and advice are always welcome

Edit: 

Holy crap, so much info in this post thank you guys so much for taking the time to get back to me. I went through, read, and upvoted everyone. I don't know if I'll be able to get back to you all, but the more and more I think about these student loans the sicker I feel. 

So, I think for the next 2 months I'm going to be stacking cash to the ceiling in a HYSA, Ally Bank, and then as soon as these bad boys come out of COVID forbearance, I'm going to get tackle them with every spare penny I got. I'm using the chart below to help track (Unbury Me for those familiar). Judging from my calcs, I'll be done around with the higher interest rate loans by September 2021 if I'm diligent. 

After those are out of the way I'm going to reevaluate, and either:

* Throw a chunk of my savings at the low interest loans and be done with them. Then, build my savings back up in conjunction with a down payment for foreclosures.
* Let the low interest loans ride for the remainder of their crumby lifespan and shift my focus to down payment on foreclosures.

The 1% rule was a new one for me thanks to the user who mentioned that, and all the users who talked about the struggles and successes they've had with renting property. Personally, I don't know if I'm ready for that level of responsibility at this time. I feel like I have enough things to juggle at this moment. Hopefully this time next year I'll be a bit more well-versed on home ownership and developed the skills in order to maintain an excellent property.

personalfinance,Hi! I am 24 and financially independent for a year now. How can I save/invest my spare income?,"EDIT: I found the wiki for young adult personal finance advice. However I'm very much still open to gathering opinions and ideas in the comments below. Thanks!!

Hi!

I'm 24 years old and have been on my own/financially independent in the Southern California area for about a year now. I have a bachelor's degree and am working a corporate position that I can live modestly with. I'm sharing an apartment with roommates that luckily is very manageable for the OC area.

I'm fortunate enough to not be paying crippling amounts monthly for student loans. My parents have been very kind and have blessed me with the old family vehicle and so I am not making any car payments yet. Only insurance. This car will likely need to be replaced in 4-5 years.

I'm a frugal spender and will only make big purchases after careful thought and have no credit card debt. I track every one of my expenses in an Excel spreadsheet against an allotted category allowance. For example, I allow myself $150 a month on Gas, and $250 on groceries, etc.

Right now I'm saving about $1,200 monthly, which is roughly 33% of my net income (after taxes and 401k/insurance deductions). $200 of this money is going into a High Interest Rate savings account, which is strictly for emergencies and my future children's college/car fund. The remaining $1,000 is going into a standard Bank of America savings account.

My goal is to set myself up for retirement and purchase a condo with my girlfriend sometime in five years. Our combined income is just over $100,000 pre-tax. I would like to find the most balanced approach to this.

My questions are

1. What are some good ways to start diversifying my money? I'm open to learn and would love to hear everyone's input and why.
2. What are some expenses I might not be able to see coming at this point in my life? Things related to being a home-owner or parent, etc. etc. I'd like to be ready for when those things happen. No one plans for a flat tire if you get what I mean.
3. Lastly, I'm not really sure if I'm on pace or doing a good job with finances for my age group. What are some ways I can improve my outlook? What are some habits I should get into?

If you've read this far, thank you very much!

I look forward to learning from you

**The German Hyperinflation, 1923**

Excerpt from *Paper Money* by ""Adam Smith,"" (George J.W. Goodman), pp. 57-62.

*In the mid-1960s, money manager George J.W. Goodman began to write a series of irreverent and witty columns for* *New York* *magazine under the borrowed name of capitalism's founding theorist, Adam Smith. As ""Adam Smith,"" Goodman went on to write several bestsellers about economics, the stock market, and global capitalism, among them* *The Money Game, Supermoney,* *and* *Paper Money,* *from which this account of the Weimar Republic's disastrous hyperinflation is excerpted.*

**Essay**

Before World War I Germany was a prosperous country, with a gold-backed currency, expanding industry, and world leadership in optics, chemicals, and machinery. The German Mark, the British shilling, the French franc, and the Italian lira all had about equal value, and all were exchanged four or five to the dollar. That was in 1914. In 1923, at the most fevered moment of the German hyperinflation, the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mark was one trillion Marks to one dollar, and a wheelbarrow full of money would not even buy a newspaper. Most Germans were taken by surprise by the financial tornado.  


""My father was a lawyer,"" says Walter Levy, an internationally known German-born oil consultant in New York, ""and he had taken out an insurance policy in 1903, and every month he had made the payments faithfully. It was a 20-year policy, and when it came due, he cashed it in and bought a single loaf of bread."" The Berlin publisher Leopold Ullstein wrote that an American visitor tipped their cook one dollar. The family convened, and it was decided that a trust fund should be set up in a Berlin bank with the cook as beneficiary, the bank to administer and invest the dollar.  


In retrospect, you can trace the steps to hyperinflation, but some of the reasons remain cloudy. Germany abandoned the gold backing of its currency in 1914. The war was expected to be short, so it was financed by government borrowing, not by savings and taxation. In Germany prices doubled between 1914 and 1919.  


After four disastrous years Germany had lost the war. Under the Treaty of Versailles it was forced to make a reparations payment in gold-backed Marks, and it was due to lose part of the production of the Ruhr and of the province of Upper Silesia. The Weimar Republic was politically fragile.  


But the bourgeois habits were very strong. Ordinary citizens worked at their jobs, sent their children to school and worried about their grades, maneuvered for promotions and rejoiced when they got them, and generally expected things to get better. But the prices that had doubled from 1914 to 1919 doubled again during just five months in 1922. Milk went from 7 Marks per liter to 16; beer from 5.6 to 18. There were complaints about the high cost of living. Professors and civil servants complained of getting squeezed. Factory workers pressed for wage increases. An underground economy developed, aided by a desire to beat the tax collector.  


On June 24, 1922, right-wing fanatics assassinated Walter Rathenau, the moderate, able foreign minister. Rathenau was a charismatic figure, and the idea that a popular, wealthy, and glamorous government minister could be shot in a law-abiding society shattered the faith of the Germans, who wanted to believe that things were going to be all right. Rathenau's state funeral was a national trauma. The nervous citizens of the Ruhr were already getting their money out of the currency and into real goods -- diamonds, works of art, safe real estate. Now ordinary Germans began to get out of Marks and into real goods.  


Pianos, wrote the British historian Adam Fergusson, were bought even by unmusical families. Sellers held back because the Mark was worth less every day. As prices went up, the amounts of currency demanded were greater, and the German Central Bank responded to the demands. Yet the ruling authorities did not see anything wrong. A leading financial newspaper said that the amounts of money in circulation were not excessively high. Dr. Rudolf Havenstein, the president of the Reichsbank (equivalent to the Federal Reserve) told an economics professor that he needed a new suit but wasn't going to buy one until prices came down.  


Why did the German government not act to halt the inflation? It was a shaky, fragile government, especially after the assassination. The vengeful French sent their army into the Ruhr to enforce their demands for reparations, and the Germans were powerless to resist. More than inflation, the Germans feared unemployment. In 1919 Communists had tried to take over, and severe unemployment might give the Communists another chance. The great German industrial combines -- Krupp, Thyssen, Farben, Stinnes -- condoned the inflation and survived it well. A cheaper Mark, they reasoned, would make German goods cheap and easy to export, and they needed the export earnings to buy raw materials abroad. Inflation kept everyone working.  


So the printing presses ran, and once they began to run, they were hard to stop. The price increases began to be dizzying. Menus in cafes could not be revised quickly enough. A student at Freiburg University ordered a cup of coffee at a cafe. The price on the menu was 5,000 Marks. He had two cups. When the bill came, it was for 14,000 Marks. ""If you want to save money,"" he was told, ""and you want two cups of coffee, you should order them both at the same time.""  


The presses of the Reichsbank could not keep up though they ran through the night. Individual cities and states began to issue their own money. Dr. Havenstein, the president of the Reichsbank, did not get his new suit. A factory worker described payday, which was every day at 11:00 a.m.: ""At 11:00 in the morning a siren sounded, and everybody gathered in the factory forecourt, where a five-ton lorry was drawn up loaded brimful with paper money. The chief cashier and his assistants climbed up on top. They read out names and just threw out bundles of notes. As soon as you had caught one you made a dash for the nearest shop and bought just anything that was going."" Teachers, paid at 10:00 a.m., brought their money to the playground, where relatives took the bundles and hurried off with them. Banks closed at 11:00 a.m.; the harried clerks went on strike.  


The flight from currency that had begun with the buying of diamonds, gold, country houses, and antiques now extended to minor and almost useless items -- bric-a-brac, soap, hairpins. The law-abiding country crumbled into petty thievery. Copper pipes and brass armatures weren't safe. Gasoline was siphoned from cars. People bought things they didn't need and used them to barter -- a pair of shoes for a shirt, some crockery for coffee. Berlin had a ""witches' Sabbath"" atmosphere. Prostitutes of both sexes roamed the streets. Cocaine was the fashionable drug. In the cabarets the newly rich and their foreign friends could dance and spend money. Other reports noted that not all the young people had a bad time. Their parents had taught them to work and save, and that was clearly wrong, so they could spend money, enjoy themselves, and flout the old.  


The publisher Leopold Ullstein wrote: ""People just didn't understand what was happening. All the economic theory they had been taught didn't provide for the phenomenon. There was a feeling of utter dependence on anonymous powers -- almost as a primitive people believed in magic -- that somebody must be in the know, and that this small group of 'somebodies' must be a conspiracy.""  


When the 1,000-billion Mark note came out, few bothered to collect the change when they spent it. By November 1923, with one dollar equal to one trillion Marks, the breakdown was complete. The currency had lost meaning.  


What happened immediately afterward is as fascinating as the Great Inflation itself. The tornado of the Mark inflation was succeeded by the ""miracle of the Rentenmark."" A new president took over the Reichsbank, Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht, who came by his first two names because of his father's admiration for an editor of the *New York Tribune.* The Rentenmark was not Schacht's idea, but he executed it, and as the Reichsbank president, he got the credit for it. For decades afterward he was able to maintain a reputation for financial wizardry. He became the architect of the financial prosperity brought by the Nazi party.  


Obviously, though the currency was worthless, Germany was still a rich country -- with mines, farms, factories, forests. The backing for the Rentenmark was mortgages on the land and bonds on the factories, but that backing was a fiction; the factories and land couldn't be turned into cash or used abroad. Nine zeros were struck from the currency; that is, one Rentenmark was equal to one billion old Marks. The Germans wanted desperately to believe in the Rentenmark, and so they did. ""I remember,"" said one Frau Barten of East Prussia, ""the feeling of having just one Rentenmark to spend. I bought a small tin bread bin. Just to buy something that had a price tag for one Mark was so exciting.""  


All money is a matter of belief. Credit derives from Latin, *credere,* ""to believe."" Belief was there, the factories functioned, the farmers delivered their produce. The Central Bank kept the belief alive when it would not let even the government borrow further.  


But although the country functioned again, the savings were never restored, nor were the values of hard work and decency that had accompanied the savings. There was a different temper in the country, a temper that Hitler would later exploit with diabolical talent. Thomas Mann wrote: ""The market woman who without batting an eyelash demanded 100 million for an egg lost the capacity for surprise. And nothing that has happened since has been insane or cruel enough to surprise her.""  


With the currency went many of the lifetime plans of average citizens. It was the custom for the bride to bring some money to a marriage; many marriages were called off. Widows dependent on insurance found themselves destitute. People who had worked a lifetime found that their pensions would not buy one cup of coffee.  


Pearl Buck, the American writer who became famous for her novels of China, was in Germany in 1923. She wrote later: ""The cities were still there, the houses not yet bombed and in ruins, but the victims were millions of people.

personalfinance,Questions on banking (Should I replace the leaky basket?),"I've always been told to not keep all my eggs in one basket. I've had a BOA checking account for 2 years now and it has been good enough for me. I recently got both a Navy Federal banking and savings account and they are comparatively better. My problem is the BOA account has a monthly maintenance fee that while small ($4.95/mo) is still a drain and since it is a checking account, it is not earning interest at all. I have enough money that if I move it all into a BOA savings account I would avoid the $8 monthly maintenance fee. Is having an extra checking account worth $60 a year? Would there be any hassle, especially now during lockdown with opening that savings account? Should I just ditch BOA and go for greener pastures? Are there good online application options, since I don't have a car and the closest banks are 20+ miles from my current address? Will this impact my credit score at all (new to the country, credit is 2 yrs old, greencard holder)?

Hi everyone, my wife and I recently went under contract on our first home purchase.  We live in Maryland, and the home we're purchasing is in Prince George's County, about 10 miles outside of Washington, DC.  We both have credit scores in the upper 700's (780ish). The pertinent details about the contract: Asking price was $450k, we offered $450k to include $20k in seller assistance, which was accepted, and our settlement date is 9/1/20.

I spent most of the day Monday negotiating with lenders.  I make a hobby of trying to get the best deal on pretty much everything, and that's especially true with a financial decision like this.  After speaking with multiple lenders I settled on terms with Capital Bank at 2.625%, no points, and a $1700 lender credit which covers their origination fee with ~$700 to spare.  

With the news from the Fed coming out yesterday, and more potential changes that could push rates lower before our close date, I'm wondering if I'll still be able to negotiate with my current lender.  Given my 9/1 close date I don't think it will be prudent to switch lenders, but as of yet we haven't ""locked"" anything.  The lender will be providing us with disclosures to sign today, and the official loan estimate etc.  

Is it still possible to come away from this with a lower rate? What are my negotiating options at this point?  I know there are folks that will say that's a great rate, don't worry about it.  I appreciate it, I'm happy with the rate, but I also want a lower one if I can get it.  No need to tell me to stand pat unless you're telling me I have to do that because I'm out of options.

personalfinance,How and when should I refinance my large auto loan.,"Hey reddit I recently purchased a 2020 Ram 2500 and was loaned about $80k with a 6.1% interest. My payments right now are $1170 for 84 months. I want to refinance for a shorter term and a lower interest rate through a credit union and I also want to pay around $10k upfront when I do this. The only problem is that I had a hard time trying to get the large loan by myself due to my age and my credit history being so young so my mother had to co-sign. I was wondering if I would be able to refinance in about 6 months with my name only to get a lower interest rate and lower the loan term.

personalfinance,Job is letting me WFH indefinitely. I'm moving from California to Michigan Sunday. Best financial moves to make?,"Hello Reddit,

I live in Oakland, CA working for a tech company in the Silicon Valley. My job announced we can work from home indefinitely and they will not adjust salary for COL if we decide to move out of state. 
With that being said, my partner and I decided to move back home to Detroit, MI.
We most likely will have to return to California around this time next year. 

In Oakland my rent was $3800. (Partner and I each pay 50% so it was really $1900 a month). We are now targeting a (bigger) apartment in Michigan for $1350 ($675 each).
Since we're saving a ton of money on housing, I was hoping to use this next year to either pay down debt or just make some smart financial decisions.
Can you all shoot me some advice on what I should pay off first or any other good advice you may have? 
 
**My Stats** 

* Salary: $71k (Hourly worker)
* Bonus (January): $10k
* Equity: $16k
*I also am a Shipt shopper so that amount varies each week/month.

*Debt*

* Car Note (Remaining balance): $7,549 (Interest Rate is 6.29%)
* Student Loans (All government loans): $60k
* Credit Card: $1050 (APR is 25.24% lmaoo)

My plan is to immediately pay off the credit card once I move to Michigan as I have a bit over $1500 in the bank right now. I am then going to use my next equity drop in September (about $6000) to pay up the car. I should be able to pay it off fully in October.

personalfinance,I'm fairly frugal--deciding to purchase a home at the higher/lower end of my budget?,"Hi r/pf,

I'm 24, single, and currently making $67k in a corporate role at a large company. I'm fully remote, based in Texas, with a monthly take-home pay of ~$4,200. I'm planning on purchasing a home in the next 3-6 months, and looking to weigh both the financial and *quality of life* considerations.

Current monthly expenses include:

* $920 rent
* $90 utilities
* $50 internet
* $120 gas/car insurance
* $350 groceries/dining out
* $290 student loan payment ($23k in debt)
* $75 misc. (haircut, toiletries, phone bill)
* $100 other (clothes, vinyl records, etc.)
* $200 401k contribution (not included in spend)

**Average total monthly spend of ~$2k of $4.2k.** The remainder is added to my brokerage account, (or used to fund occasional vacations, car repairs, etc.). On average, I probably save 25-30% of my take-home pay.

I'm planning on purchasing a home in the suburbs of Houston or San Antonio, searching roughly between $165-210k. Depending on down-payment, PMI, rate, this would bring my monthly PITI expense to between $1,000 and $1,450, plus higher utility costs than my current apartment, and occasional maintenance costs. Anywhere in this range should fall within my budget.

**How should I weigh the pros/cons of buying something at the lower end of my budget (slightly smaller, maybe older house/neighborhood, not as many upgrades, proximity to nearby amenities isn't great), versus something at the higher end of my budget (overall nicer home, larger yard, better area)?**

As an example within the price range:

* [More expensive style home](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/16742-N-Rail-Dr-Conroe-TX-77385/96623415_zpid/) (I'd expect similar homes at the higher end of the range. There's a reason it closed in 2 days).
* [Less expensive style home](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/23715-Sawmill-Pass-Spring-TX-77373/68420620_zpid/)

Other considerations:

* anticipating (but not relying on) an $8k to $12k salary increase in the next 1-2 years
* current assets of $46k ($40k excluding $6k 401k balance). Will likely increase $2-6k by time of home purchase.
* $23k student loan balance, average interest rate of ~4.2%

personalfinance,Advice on debt consolidation (reposted for visibility),"TL;DR credit card utilization is keeping my credit score ~50 points lower than it would be, is it a good idea to take out a personal loan with a lower interest rate, and how would that impact my credit in the short term? 

More context: My credit card utilization is at about 55% - I've paid it down from 92% since April (like 18k-11k) which has made a huge impact on my credit. My payment history is 100% and my age of credit is OK (~4 years, I'm 26). We are looking at trying to get a rental house in the next few months but I've noticed as I have started looking that most require at least 710 credit. Mine is currently at about 630, and credit simulators show that if I pay off my remaining balances on my credit cards it would shoot up to 720. I am on a good path with paying off debt since I got a higher paying job, but don't think I can make that significant of a jump by the time our lease is up in October.

So my questions are: 

 1. Does it make sense to take out a personal loan with a lower interest rate (my $6k credit card is at 25% apr I know, HORRIBLE decision making on my part) in order to decrease my utilization? 

 2. How is personal loan utilization looked at compared to credit card utilization on a credit report? Overall I feel I'm on a great path with debt payoff, but unsure if a loan for the purpose of bumping my credit score quickly will have any negative long term impact.

personalfinance,I have enough for 15% down payment. I need a mortgage at the lowest rate and cost,"Hi, I got a preapproved letter from Better.com. I was interested in them because I read they had no origination fees and low fees in general. I haven’t really shopped around since then. However, this preapproval requires a down payment that I don’t have anymore.

I’m doing some research on finding other options with low fees like Better.com since I’m looking to put an offer on a home.

So far I’ve found Sofi. Apparently they can help on bigger loans for people who don’t have the down payment cash, but I’ve only read they charge higher interest rates. Not sure what their origination fee policy is. Personal loans they don’t charge, but mortgage it’s kind of vague. I’ve seen reviews where it says they don’t, but I haven’t seen it explicitly stated on their site they don’t charge them.

*I’m a little short on cash for the down payment
*This property won’t be on market long, so I need preapproval and money from loan fast

1. Offer price is $2-2.1m
2. Available cash for down payment is a little over $300k (15%)
3. About $1.2m in equity on a couple different properties (one property is about 60% paid, 2nd property is $300k paid off)
4. Super excellent credit and payment history
5. Looking for 30 year fixed
6. A little over $600k annual income the last 5 years including bonuses
7. About $1m in various brokerage accounts

Before anyone mentions HELOC or something similar, the reason I can’t do it is because closing time is around 60-90 days because the banks are slammed from all the refinancing.

Yes, I do have 401k that I can withdraw. I am trying to avoid doing this because I will have to pay income taxes on what’s withdrawn ($40k). This is my last resort.",finance
stocks,SOFO: An overlooked Stay-At-Home OTC stock with uplisting potential back onto NASDAQ,"Anyone knowledgeable on Sonic Foundry Inc. (SOFO: ~$30mm mkt cap)?  I own some and  think it’s an under-the-radar stock with grand potential once they report on ~8/14. Here’s why:

SOFO provides video capture/management &amp; streaming services specifically for higher ed institutions. With growing online schooling plus a deeper integration with Zoom announced last month plus the benefit of PPP money...this stock could do quite well. Here are some noteworthy factoids I’ve uncovered if any one cares:

- Based in Madison, WI and founded ~30 yrs ago and with ~200 employees.

- LTM 3/31/20 Revenue: $30 million. &gt;2/3 from higher ed (+1,700 universities globally).

- Last traded on NASDAQ on 12/28/18 and voluntarily delisted to OTC after impairments at the time (i.e., online schooling hadn’t gained as much traction as forecasted) lowered its S/E to less than NASDAQ’s $2.5mm minimum.

- Its Chairman &amp; controlling shareholder (a successful businessman &amp; business lawyer with his own law practice) took his $5.6 million SECURED note (that carried a 12% effective interest rate!!) that he had lent to SOFO and converted it all into COMMON STOCK at $5/share on 5/13/20. He now owns 42% of SOFO.

- He also tried to buy the rest of the company in May at $5/sh which SOFO accepted just 2.5 wks later but then rejected after shareholder revolt.

 - Got $2.3mm PPP funds on 4/21 &amp; is now likely forgiven (post-60 days) and turned into equity.

- 6/30/20 shareholders’ equity should now reflect infusion from that +$5.6mm debt-to-equity conversion PLUS +$2.3mm PPP loan being forgiven which shld’ve happened by 6/30.

- SOFO remains highly transparent &amp; is current with all its SEC filings which are timely, thorough &amp; informative. They’ve even held earnings calls!

- New mgmt: New CEO last yr &amp; new CFO inMay

- Avg trading volume at 5-10k area but some days it’s as much as +30-60k if not way more.

- Public float is only ~30% (2.3 million shares) while insiders hold/own the balance of SOFO. 

- I had to do my own due diligence since there is no analyst coverage due to its OTC standing but I’d expect that to change if/when they re-list back onto NASDAQ likely in coming quarters.

[**Kevin Hammond** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kevin-hammond)Please report this to zen desk. I have imported my own Byron wallet and delegated (with in 15 minutes of passing the hard fork)

[**SL13PNIR** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kai-chappell)Ok, I'm let them know (it's some of the reddit community having issues).

[**Darko Mijić** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/daedalus)This is a known issue. It is in the release notes. This feature only imports wallets from the state directory for users who lost their wallet recovery phrase. No need to import Byron wallets, they will all be in your Daedalus already if you upgraded.

[**SL13PNIR** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kai-chappell)Ok Darko thanks, the user is certain the lost their recovery phrase.

[**Darko Mijić** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/daedalus)This feature currently only imports from legacy, 0.X Daedalus versions. It was created for the Byron reboot release. It will be expanded with support for new wallets which will cover importing wallets from Daedalus Rewards for the ITN.

&amp;#x200B;

# When delegating, why is the minimum fixed fee 340 ADA per epoch? What if a pool does not perform well? Do they still receive that 340 ADA per epoch?

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)The minimum operational cost of 340 ada have been set to prevent price dumping and allow professional pools to be competetive. Yes, costs are taken from the available rewards first, then margin, then delegators get their share.

[**Duncan Coutts** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/duncancoutts)Note also that the minimum cost a pool can declare is an independent concept from how pool rewards are affected by performance. The effects of bad performance on rewards is exactly as the spec has always said. The only new thing is that pools are not allowed to declare a 0 cost. That is both an anti-dumping measure and needed as part of the Sybil attack prevention mechanism (along with pledges etc).

# Will Daedalus ever have a mobile wallet?

[**Kevin Hammond** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kevin-hammond)This is something that has been considered. For technical reasons, it wouldn't be easy to do right now

[**Cesar** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/caesar-desilva)I understand, thank you for answering :)

# Sometimes it takes a long time to “connect to network” in Daedalus; sometimes it goes faster. Is it normal for the connection time to be so long? Wondering if that’s a network or computer issue. Can I uninstall the mainnet software and reinstall it or will that require restoring the wallet?

[**Kevin Hammond** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kevin-hammond)It's likely to be something to do with your network topology or connectivity. You can install over the Daedalus software without losing your settings, but uninstalling/reinstalling would mean you needed to restore your wallet. If you still have problems, zen desk may be able to help

# Has your view regarding a0=0.30 and k=150 changed at all? Any chance for change (apart from the pre-determined 25 step increase in k)

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)Right now, there's not enough data to have reason to question our choice. But if such data comes up later, we'll be happy to adjust those parameters.

[**Kevin Hammond** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kevin-hammond)Yes, these are the initial settings. We have seen about 300 pools register overnight, so 150 looks like a good setting. We will monitor this and adjust it, of course. If we see good, sustainable network growth, we will be able to adjust it sooner in larger steps, but it depends on the pool operators and delegators to help make that happen

# Is it safe to uninstall the testnet versions from my computer?

[**SL13PNIR** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kai-chappell)Yes

[**Corey** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/coreypace)Thanks. I think I have 7 different Daedalus icons on my desktop!

[**Kevin Hammond** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/kevin-hammond)Most of them will no longer work anyway. You might want to keep the ITN one around until rewards have been transferred so you have records if need be

[**Corey** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/coreypace)Thanks, Kevin. That helps.

# Will exchanges be able to delegate the users funds?

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)Yes. And they might decide to offer this as a service and pass rewards on to their users.

[**Yiannis** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/djcvdjcvd)what about the fear that they will make 50 pools with some small pledge and then delegate there bilion of ADA?

[**Yiannis** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/djcvdjcvd)and kicking out stake pool operators that cant compete? they will do that with funds that they dont own

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)If they really use low pledge, those pool operators would have more attractive pools. Furthermore, exchange users can always move their funds to their own wallets if they don\*t like what the exchange is doing.

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)Exchanges compete with eachother, too. So if one exchange stakes their users' funds without passing on the rewards, users will change to other exchanges that pass on rewards to their users.

[**Yiannis** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/djcvdjcvd)i wonder if is is dangerous if binance makes 50 pools and delegates 100m to each if they will almost control the network

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)Well, 50 pools are still ""only"" 33% of the network - and that is with k=150, but k will probably increase in future.

[**Yiannis** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/djcvdjcvd)with higher k they will go 100 pools with 50m etc. This way 3-4 cartel exchanges achieve very close to 50% with users funds. I really believe this might be super dangerous

[**Lars Brünjes** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/larsbr%C3%BCnjes)Well, if they really own 33% of all the stake, then they do have 33% of the influence in the system. I think that's unavoidable, it's how proof of stake works. So if this actually becomes a problem, I think users have to act and move their funds away from the exchanges.

[**Yiannis** ](https://www.crowdcast.io/djcvdjcvd)i completely agree with that. I only ""worry"" because they dont really ""own"" the funds to own the network. And people are reluctant to move funds due to the ease of use of exchanges. Fingers crossed it will not be a huge road block...

They also made me realize I'd like to take over my investments rather than turning them over to an advisor and paying him the 1% fee. Additionally, and not related, I secured some contract work on top of my full-time job and have no idea how to manage all of them in regards of the possible tax implications.

personalfinance,Not really sure what to do- just stressed.,"So I have spent the last 2 years paying off my car and student loans (about 20k in 14 months) and all I have left is about 2k in credit card debt (7% interest rate). I have a 800 credit score. 
I live in a LCOL city in the south. 31/F single. 

Due to some unfortunate (and expensive) circumstances and living somewhere I hated, I had to quickly move to my hometown in May 2019 in with my parents (bless them) and take a job for 3 months that paid about $15/hr. It was with the same company I had been working for at about twice that pay previously, so basically they screwed me. So I sought out another job with a base pay of 45k, plus commission, and by this January was making closer to 55k and steadily increasing (would have been 60k by March). And I LOVE this job. 

I purchased a house on Feb 28 for 179k (admittedly should have had more of an emergency fund saved but also, very low debt). Still contributing to retirement (which I feel is healthy) and making an extra mortgage payment this year. Even though I’m stressed I’m grateful I bought a house when I did bc inventory in my price range is nonexistent and I am in an excellent location. 

Then 2 weeks later... corona lockdown, and being in advertising business we lost a ton of clients, and my base pay dropped to 36k. It’s starting to pick back up, but I won’t feel super comfortable till I’m back up to that precorona pay level. I have a roommate who pays $600/mo. Tried to apply for Shipt, haven’t heard back. I’m not in dire straits but stressed for sure. Have cut back on unnecessary spending, but also trying to build equity in my house bc it was super outdated. Have dont a lot of cosmetic things so I feel the house is already worth more.

My question is - what should prepare for or consider financially? My goal is to continue to contribute to my 401k (TSP in federal parlance), Roth, and HSA (provided I can find a plan that will let me keep it). I’ll be able to max out my Roth and HSA but not my 401k.

personalfinance,Advice Please Guys. Auto Loan Denied For Not Enough Credit History.,"Hey guys, figured I would get on here and seek advice on what I need to do in order to get approved for a car loan.

Let me start first by explaining my financial situation to give you guys more of an idea of what my back ground looks like.

I'm 20 years old.
Purchased my home in December of 2019.
I have been an authorized user of a credit card for 2 yrs, 1 month and it shows on my credit profile.
TransUnion score: 728
Equifax: 719
No auto loan currently.
0 late payments ever.
20% Credit card utilization.
Never held a balance.
0 derogatory remarks.
Have held a very consistent job for 2 years now.

So I applied for an auto loan through PenFed in early June 2020 and it was denied for ""Limited or no credit experience"". Then I thought to apply to a local Credit Union. Received a great rate and then they told me that I would need to acquire a co-signer to continue the loan. Don't have anyone to co-sign with. So rather than continuing to apply to different credit unions/banks and risk receiving multiple hard Credit inquires and possibly knocking my credit down I figured I would seek some advice on options what to do in my situation.

I can provide a down payment of %30.
Total vehicle price would be $15,000.

-How many hard inquires can I receive to the point where I'm hurting my credit. I've heard of a certain time period where multiple  inquires can happen and they all compile into one?

- What specifically is sufficient credit history?

I really appreciate any feedback or advice that would lead me to a solution.",finance

My federal taxable wages are about 10% higher than my gross payment each paycheck.

I get paid X biweekly, and I have deductions for the following:

* Std Medical EE pre-tax
* Dental EE pre-tax
* Vision EE pre-tax
* 401k EE pretax
* HSA Family (Sec 124)

These add up to several thousand USD. If it matters, my health plans are family plans, and everyone covered is a dependent of mine. My domestic partner and I are not married, but she is a dependent and not working. She also has a child who is my dependent, but not my biological or legal child.

Now, my pay stub shows a ""Other Benefits and Information"" section that appears (based on adding the numbers) to bump up my taxable wages. Those are

* deprecated Med DP Imp Inc
* Life Ins. Imp Inc 
* Dental DP Imputed Income

These add up to about 20% of my paycheck. My understanding is I should not be taxed on these, since my domestic partner and children are also my dependents and no one is working.

Is my assumption correct?

cardano,The Blockchain beta test is over!,"I would like to thank everyone who had to function with blockchain systems based on trial and error, DAO hacks, exchange hacks (on-going), broken protocols, poor smart contract designs, unproven ideas, irresponsible ICO's (on-going), systems focused on a poor choice of tradeoffs, lack of audits, and a long list of poor implementations of bad ideas.

By your trials and sacrifices, Cardano was set to address all these concerns with a research-first approach. Even in this, there have been some challenges to overcome, but through the hard paths of science and rigor and first principles, we can finally say the blockchain beta test is over!

As of July 29, 2020 the Shelley mainnet went live on Cardano marking the start of a brand new era in blockchain technology. First of it's kind in the industry. Forging a new path, a higher caliber of project, a project that offers the best because it demands the best. A project with a worthy foundation to bear the weight of a new world end to end blockchain infrastructure.

The future is not federated, it's decentralized and Cardano is a leader among many followers. Being an open source project, full access is granted and all are welcome. As we come to face new challenges, and adopt new ideas, Cardano will be there to build upon.

In a world with many uncertainties there are opportunities for change. There is a monetary system to re-invent, economies to reinvigorate, desperate markets to rebuild, supply chains to re-think and identities to reclaim.

There has been a lot of work to get to this point, but it's only getting started. We're in an industry in it's infancy and the growing pains are obvious and common. We are at the dawn of a new era and regardless of where you find yourself on this path, the future is looking so bright and so full of opportunity.

I can say that with all the work done on Cardano and the work yet to be done, with absolute confidence, and with perfect clarity, there is nothing more exciting in crypto.

Although I tend to reserve emotion and most the time maintain professionalism I just have to say..

investing,"Shorting Russell 2,000","I strongly believe there is a disconnect between the recovery in small-caps (~12% off Feb high) vs. more financially stable large-caps (S&amp;amp;P500 ~4% off Feb high). Looking to find an entry point sometime in August before the upcoming election.



Rationale: 

• 28% of the index consists of companies that currently have a negative FCF/debt ratio with payments due in less than 1 year.

• More than half of the index is concentrated in 3 sectors: financials, health care, and consumer discretionary. Most of the health care constituents appear to be hit or miss pharmaceuticals that are cash depleted - hard to predict. Financials have been crushed by lowered interest rates (XLF still down ~23% from Feb high). Small cap consumer discretionary - pretty straight forward, makes up 16% of the Russell 2k and consists of a lot of struggling companies.

• FTSE Russell recently completed its annual reconstitution in June. Going forward, underperforming companies will not be removed until at least next year or are delisted.

business,A client is lying to me...now what?,"tl;dr: I'm 99% sure my client is lying to me and I'm not sure how to handle it anymore. Asking for advice.

Background:  I'm a bookkeeper for multiple small businesses. I do bookkeeping, payroll, state tax filings, and I get files ready for the CPAs to do federal taxes. Earlier this year, a CPA called me about one of our shared clients - there was a big problem. The money I reported as income to the state was nowhere near what it should have been.  It turns out, the client in question had the money going to a different account I never knew about. The CPA knew this because he had the 1099 form for the federal taxes.

After repeated attempts to get the corrected information from the client, he finally sent me new numbers for his 2019 income with permission to correct his state returns soon.

The problem is, when I add up the ""corrected"" numbers with what I already reported, I'm still only at half of the income number the CPA gave me.  

I'm really not sure how to handle this with the client at this point. Should I play dumb and send an email saying something along the lines of ""I'm not sure why these new numbers don't add up to the CPA number?"" Should I fire him as a client because I've previously explained that I can't knowingly commit fraud? Do I just ignore it because the world is on fire and there are bigger things to worry about? Something else? Advice appreciated or direction to other subs if not appropriate here.

I am 23 and going to graduate school for the next three years. I will need to take out about 20k a year of federal loans; the interest rate is currently down to 4.5% (from like the normal 7%) due to the rona, and interest starts charging the day the loan hits. 

I expect to make at least 10k each summer (probably more the second summer), and I'm also heading into school with 10k in savings. I could use this money to take out less loans, or I could use it to max out my 6k Roth IRA annual contributions.

I am not super worried about repaying my loans, as my school has phenomenal employment numbers. I expect my starting salary to be well over 150k after law school based on median salaries, which are even higher than that.

I stated that I believe the people who use bitcoin will likely stand by it because of the fact that it is NOT controlled by any single entity.

I'm living in New Jersey, working in NYC as a dental hygienist. 
Recently I tried out a new office that sounded great on paper, but in real life, it was not my jam. So I worked there for only one day. 
I received my check today, and was confused about the amount because I knew I was supposed to be compensated $200 minus taxes which would leave me a little over $150 (I usually calculate about 18% in taxes when budgeting).
To my surprise, the check was only $103.16, with a total withholdings of $96.84!!! 

Here is a rundown of the withholdings:

Medicare- $2.90
NY Disability- $1.00
NY Disability PFL- $0.54
Federal Income Tax J +$80- $80.00

Just seems strange that 50% of my wage was eaten by federal taxes. 

I'm not sure how to proceed. Have not deposited said check yet. Have any of you experienced such steep withholdings before?

personalfinance,"24 year old looking to buy raw land for entertainment, talk me out of it","It has been a dream of mine to own a parcel of land for recreation/hunting/building a cabin. I have 16k of federal student loans which I pay 130$ a month for, 220$ a month for a car payment that I got 4K left on. Rent is 650$ a month. Job is what you would consider stable. Other than that I have no other debt. My monthly income is 2600$. With food and other expenses I’m left with just under a grand in a typical month. 

Now, I have recently found a 160 acre plot of land in one of my favorite parts of the state for 80,000$. After financing assuming I can put down 16k and get a decent rate my monthly payments would be around 400$ a month, which I can afford. I am just not fully convinced whether this is a good investment. I figure generally raw land is not a good investment (?), however, it would be something I have always wanted. Would I be better off waiting until I can put a larger down payment (we’d be talking 1-2 years here) or just go for it?",finance

personalfinance,FHA Streamline — Loan Provider is offering this program. Is this beneficial to me?,"FHA Streamline?

I received a phone call from my loan service provider about a FHA Streamline Rate Reduction Program. I have very minimal knowledge about this program, and almost seems “too good to be true”. My question is... is it worth it for me to refinance through this program? I purchased my home 7 months ago in CA, have a balance of $566K with an interest rate of 3.75%. My monthly payment with all fees/insurance is around $38K. Since rates are low, the gentlemen told me it could lower my rate to 2.75%. 

Other incentives offered was that the costs would be covered by the lender, my upfront MIP will be partially covered by my refund (68%?), ability to skip a couple payments (not clear what this meant), and lower monthly payment (but how much!).

Is this a program that would benefit me? Of course, I would love to lower my monthly payment..so I’m also curious how much it would lower it. Any thoughts or advice? I’m open to answering any clarifying questions as well.",finance

Currently, I am trying to refinance my house however I am new to this process. I recently received a letter in the mail from a mortgage lender with a good interest rate offer for the refinance. Thus I called the company to ask for more information. In the initial call, the mortgage officer sent over a few loan estimates, which seems fine to me. Then on the most recent call, he mentioned that he is in the process of renewing his license and that when he sends over the initial disclosures to sign it will be from another mortgage officer's name. I went online and saw that his license is expired but the other person that he mentioned does have an active license. Is this something I should be concerned about? And how should I handle this?",finance

I have a USDA loan with PMI at a current rate of 4.25%. I currently have an unpaid principal of 86,632 with the original loan amount of 91k. Now I have already submitted paperwork to refinance with a company offering me a 2.75% loan @ 15 years which would shave about 12 years off of my loan. The loan officer approximates that the refi will raise my monthly payment to about 768$ from the current 635$ and take the PMI off. Now, does this make sense to do financially if I only plan on keeping the home for a max of 3 more years? I have a friend who works as a realtor who thinks it is a good move regardless but I can't shake the feeling that this isn't going to do me any good. If I do refinance I will basically be financing 90k(almost back to my original loan amount once you roll in the closing costs) which to me seems like a waste if I'm only going to be here for a short period of time. I haven't signed any paperwork yet and was getting ready to but I want another opinion before I do because I know there are some very knowledgeable folks here on reddit.

new to the sub but have been reading posts for a while now. 

after an early mismanagement of my credit when i was a youth, i’ve managed to bring my score back up from the low 500s to 760. it feels great, however:

recently i haven’t changed my credit usage or payment activity (always pay the statement balance every month and use less than 15%), but every month my score has consistently dropped about 3-5 points. 

i’ve got two cards - one with about an 8k limit on it, the other was my first that i never closed that has about a $300 limit on it. i never use it. 

my student loans are deferred because of the pandemic assistance student loan act or whatever it’s called, but i’ve been manually making payments to utilize the 0% interest rate. that’s the only debt i have, of about $4k.

what am i doing wrong? what should i be doing differently to raise the score even higher?

Gross domestic product (GDP) across the euro area plunged by a record 12.1% in the second quarter, compared to the previous quarter, as coronavirus lockdowns brought commercial and social life to a standstill and plunged the bloc into a deep recession.

Output in the 19-country currency block had declined by 3.6% in the first quarter. Today’s second-quarter data however is the biggest drop in GDP since record-keeping started in 1995.

The EU’s major economies also released their own quarterly data this week.

Germany, the bloc’s largest economy reported a GDP decline of 10.1% in the April-to-June quarter. The federal statistics bureau described it as “the steepest decline since quarterly GDP calculations for Germany began in 1970… even more pronounced than during the financial market and economic crisis.”

France, the second largest economy, fared worse, with output shrinking by 13.8%, also a historic low.

Italy’s economy contracted by 12.4% in the second quarter from the previous one, a smaller slump than the 15% quarter-on-quarter drop predicted by analysts.

Spain, one of the worst-hit EU countries in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths, reported an 18.5% fall in GDP in the second quarter, a steeper drop than the 16.6% economists had predicted.

The Spanish economy, which had already shrunk by 5.2% in the first quarter, is now in its steepest recession ever.

EU countries like Spain are in urgent need of financial support from the EU as they tries to dig themselves out of recession. Earlier this month, EU leaders approved a €750bn (£677bn, $890bn) coronavirus recovery package in Brussels, of which around half will be issued as grants to struggling member states.",finance
cybersecurity,Someone spoofed my work email,"I work for a pretty large construction company.  Yesterday I received an angry phone call from one of our customers asking why I was demanding payment on one of our invoices that was A: not even due yet and B: paid last week.  After going back and forth with her for a while she finally forwarded me the email she received.  So at first glance the email appeared to be legit. It had my first and last name, my email signature, it was referencing a real invoice and job site.  When I looked closer at the sender I noticed the changed an i to an L in our email domain.  So for example they made John Smith &lt;john.smith@rockpipe.com&gt; to John Smith &lt;john.smith@rockplpe.com&gt;.  So unless you are actually looking for it it's very convincing.  They were basically asking our customer to remit payment right away and providing our ""new"" ACH information.  Luckily the customer called me on the phone and we were able to resolve it, but we could have lost $18k if they followed the email without question.  Not only that, but the same thing happened to one of our subcontractors with us.  A fake email followed up asking us to remit payment for an invoice and providing new banking information.  We also caught that before anything was sent out.  I called our I.T. company and they couldn't detect any 

My questions are:


1. How do these people get access to legitimate information to follow up on? They referenced a real invoice and the corresponding job site.

2.  Is there any way to prevent this from happening in the future?

3.  Is there any way to stop it from going out to any of our future customers.

personalfinance,31 year old new parents trying to prepare for the worst,"Hello all,

My husband and I had a baby in March and both of our industries have seen some negative effects of Covid. My company more specifically has laid off about 15% of our already small workforce and they aren’t sure that this will stop the hemorrhaging. 

My question is we are/were focusing on paying down debts and saving money to potentially buy a house next year if I’m still able to keep my job. We’ve pretty much been splitting any money we can between our savings and our debts. Would it be wiser to prioritize one over the other given the volatile nature of my job security right now? Our current savings could cover about 2.5 months of me not working at present and is the only savings we have.

Thanks for your thoughts and time.

Edit: Here are all of our debts, student loans, credit cards, debt consolidation loans. The one “tricky” one is the PayPal credit one. It has 6 month 0% interest rate and I usually pay the minimum monthly until a balance is going to get interest. Then I usually pay the remaining amount in full. 

I’m listing them in the order that I’ve been trying to pay them off. Given expected bonuses and severe budgeting as far as recreation I expect we will have the ability to pay off everything but the payoff loan and our student loans before it is time to move next year. 


Chase-   5,000.00	22.99%


Paypal Credit(tricky one- 0% until 6 months-usually pay minimum until interest will hit) 2,347.55-  25.49%

Payoff-(debt consolidation loan)18,500.00-  19.99%

Citi-  5,694.49-  19.49%

Avant(debt consolidation loan) - 8,989.64	17.95%


Discover Card- 3,669.99	16.49%


Citi Card-  5,800.00-  15.99%


Citi Card-   3,750.00	   12.24%


Nelnet(student loan) -34,676.53	    6.55%

investing,So what do you expect to happen to the US dollar in the medium term?,"Hello,

All emotions aside (""big inflation is going to destroy the economy!!!"" or anything else), we as investors should have more information about the state of US Dollar. As a European, seeing the value of American dollar go so low makes me wish that I hold more assets denominated in US dollars, as they are relatively cheaper to me. However, investors all around the world are calculating the same thing, and yet the pressure for the US Dollar to go down still remains, thus I'm probably just misinformed.

So what do you think? Will the Fed's stimulus have enough downwards pressure on the US Dollar? Are the future actions of the ECB + fiscal stimulus packages taken by many European governments likely to inflate the Euro next year, thus making the US Dollar stronger in comparison? If holding assets denominated in the US Dollar is a good idea, how long would it take for the US Dollar to appreciate again to exchange it?

I have had a lot of changes in the last year or so. I started a new job with a nice pay bump, purchased my first home (a small condo perfect for a single 20 something), had my beater car break down on me so I purchased a gently used vehicle. 

My car loan had a pretty high interest rate, so my focus the last 6 months was paying that off as quickly as possible. I just did so last month, and now I am looking ahead at what my wisest next financial steps should be. 

I am contributing enough to my employer 401k to get the full match on the table. I also maintain a Roth IRA that I make regular contributions. I stopped contributing for a bit in the winter, but with the car paid off, I am back on track with regular contributions. I also have 6 months worth of emergency savings built up. 

So my question for you all is what should my next financial move(s) be? When I purchased my home, I only put 10% down. So I do have PMI ($26 a month). My dad seems to think that I should start paying ahead on my principal to try and get rid of PMI. He's also floated the idea out about refinancing (even though I just purchased) with rates so low. I have a 30 year fixed mortgage, and my interest rate is 3.875%. 

Basically, I have no clue how to prioritize my next steps. Apart from my mortgage, I have no other debts. I also work for a company/in an industry with a lot of job security in spite of everything going on right now. Should I: 

1.) Contribute more to my 401k?

2.) Pay ahead on my mortgage to get rid of PMI sooner? 

3.) Refinance? 

4.) Anything else? Suggestions would be appreciated!",finance

**Episode highlights &amp; Discussion**

**Bitcoin Collateral Loans and Cryptocurrency Savings Accounts (06:46)**

Adam: We offer lending and savings products – really everything is on the mission to help more people save in Bitcoin and digital assets. We have a [loan product wherever you can put up Bitcoin as collateral](https://ledn.io/loans-product) and access a US dollar (USD) loan available to be dispersed in USD to your bank account, or in stablecoins to an address of your choosing. We also have a product called [Buy 2X or B2X](https://ledn.io/b2x) for short – that is a loan to purchase additional Bitcoin. On the saving side, we have [a Bitcoin savings account that currently pays 6.5% APY, and we have a USDC savings account that pays 10% APY](https://ledn.io/btc-savings).

**Tax Advantages of Bitcoin Loans (09:45)**

Adam: It’s tax deferral. If you have large capital gains built up in BTC and you have a lower adjusted cost basis by taking a loan…you can borrow against the value of that asset, perhaps invest it other assets that you have a strong conviction in, and then when the timing is right, repay that loan and then sell the Bitcoin at a later date.

**Simplifying Crypto Borrowing and Lending (15:07)**

Adam: It’s really just a simplifying that decision-making process: You own Bitcoin. Did you want more of it? That’s B2X. Do you want to take out dollars because you have an expense or investment that you want to cover? That’s our borrow product. Do you want to just simply save \[BTC\] and earn an interest rate? That’s our save product.",cryptocurrency

**Episode highlights &amp; Discussion**

**Bitcoin Collateral Loans and Cryptocurrency Savings Accounts (06:46)**

Adam: We offer lending and savings products – really everything is on the mission to help more people save in Bitcoin and digital assets. We have a [loan product wherever you can put up Bitcoin as collateral](https://ledn.io/loans-product) and access a US dollar (USD) loan available to be dispersed in USD to your bank account, or in stablecoins to an address of your choosing. We also have a product called [Buy 2X or B2X](https://ledn.io/b2x) for short – that is a loan to purchase additional Bitcoin. On the saving side, we have [a Bitcoin savings account that currently pays 6.5% APY, and we have a USDC savings account that pays 10% APY](https://ledn.io/btc-savings).

**Tax Advantages of Bitcoin Loans (09:45)**

Adam: It’s tax deferral. If you have large capital gains built up in BTC and you have a lower adjusted cost basis by taking a loan…you can borrow against the value of that asset, perhaps invest it other assets that you have a strong conviction in, and then when the timing is right, repay that loan and then sell the Bitcoin at a later date.

**Simplifying Crypto Borrowing and Lending (15:07)**

Adam: It’s really just a simplifying that decision-making process: You own Bitcoin. Did you want more of it? That’s B2X. Do you want to take out dollars because you have an expense or investment that you want to cover? That’s our borrow product. Do you want to just simply save \[BTC\] and earn an interest rate? That’s our save product.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Not sure if buy a house at this time or not, everyone seems to be buying houses since listings in my area dont last more than a day or 2, is it a good time in the current economy?",Im  currently looking for homes to buy in my area. I've already tried to  look at listings in my area and schedule them with my realtor but it  seems that these houses are only listed for a day or 2 and poof they're  gone. It makes me believe that due to low interest rates people is  trying to buy a house and take advantage of a low rate deal but could it  be a bubble? Bad economy and everyone trying to buy a house at the same  time doesn't seem like a good idea to me and it just came to me since  it seems everyone is trying to get a house at the time but again im not a  realtor or lender.

personalfinance,What to do with 401k after leaving employer to enter grad school full time?,"I'm in the US and will be leaving my employer to start grad school this fall. Through my employer, I've built up a 401k with about $15k in it. 

I'm wondering, what should I do with my 401k when I leave the company? Should I roll it into an IRA? Should I keep it in the employer managed account? What things should I consider to help make a decision?

Here are some details:
Grad school will take two years and total cost is about $60k.

By the time I leave my employer I'll have about $4k in savings.

I received some scholarships, but to cover all my expenses I am still about $20k short for one year. For now I have decided to take a federal unsubsidized student loan which covers those expenses. However, I do want to minimize my student loans because I still have about $50k from my undergrad.

I keep my credit cards paid off and I included my car payment in my expenses.

I have a spouse who will still be working full-time while I am in school. There is a chance I may get a Grad Assistant job while in school. Next summer I have a paid internship where I estimate I'll make about $15k.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"I want to put equity in, not pull it out. Refi?","The situation: We own property A free &amp; clear. In 2019 we took out a mortgage on property B with almost zero down. Excellent credit, good income.

The goal: reduce monthly costs/better position for potential economic roller coaster.

The plan: Sell property A and apply proceeds to: 
1. payoff auto loan (~$30k @ 4%) 
2. Refi property B

Capital gains tax should not be a factor. We're thinking refi instead of just making a large lump sum payment primarily because we want to reduce our monthly costs, and to take advantage of low interest rates.

Currently paying PMI so we'd definitely want to give the bank enough to drop that.

Considering closing costs and whatever else I'm not thinking of, would we be better off opening a money market (or ?) and using it to make our monthly mortgage payment (in order to achieve the same goal of reducing our monthly costs, with the benefit of still having the $ rather than sinking it into the house)? Is there a compelling reason to just give it all to the bank on the current loan and keep our same interest rate and monthly payment (minus pmi)? We're thinking the loan would drop from about $300k to $90k.",finance
personalfinance,Parents dropped upside down car loan on me,"Hi guys! just to preface this I recently immigrated to the US and to California specifically. When I got here I was just about to start my life. Fresh out of college and didn't know anything. I arrived in 2019 and they bought the car in 2018. I didn't know any details about the car nor what they signed and agreed to. Soon as I arrived here and got a job they just plopped the car on me and told to pay on it.   
It is a 2018 Honda Accord LX everything standard. The car is still not in my name also its still on my parents name

  
They told me the monthly payment is $435  and my monthly insurance to be $120. I was so aghast by this but just arriving here I was also thankful that I even had a car. A year later knowing more about my finances and having a stable job. I decided to look into the car loan/finance.   


I found out that they traded in a beater 2008 Honda accord that still had a $7,916.23 balance and the agreed total trade in value is $3,500 which would come up to $4,416.23 to carry over to the sales price which was only $22,100 before sales tax on the car which all in all put the amount financed to $29,488.93 at a 1.90% interest rate with a 6 year term starting 2018.   


What can I do to improve my situation? Any advice would be helpful. Thank you in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"Need some thoughts, opinions, wisdom on paying off house vs Continuing Taxable DCA Investing","**Stats:**

* 30 years old
* 175k-/+ (30% is commissions)
* No immediate goals just gain net worth
* High risk tolerance
* Assets: 244k (50% Roth 401k / 50% Trad 401k) 18k Roth IRA, 112k Taxable Index Funds  
Big debts: Truck 28k at 2.7%, Trailer 20k at 4%, Car 46k at 2.5%
* Relevant info: Single male, 30, work from home engineer

**Details:**

Hey was hoping to get some food for thought.

I have a unique situation that I might take advantage of. I'm single guy, make 175k+ and currently have:

$113k Index Funds (Vanguard Personal Advisor Services)

$244k in Retirement (Blockrock Large Cap) max out each year Roth 401k

$18k Roth IRA Index Funds (Vanguard Personal Advisor Services)

I'm all stock but very diversified in different sectors and markets.

Currently my mortgage has $186k left with scheduled payoff to be 11/1/2030. I'm on 15-year fixed at 3%.

My savings rate besides max Roth 401k is $2000/mo into Index Funds, and when I sell my extra car, that $1000/mo is going to be directed towards savings or the mortgage.

If I take all $2000 + $1000(when car sells) per month and put toward mortgage, I can pay off by the end of 2023.

Do I do it? I'm not trying to time the market but some weird stuff is going on and while I will still max out Roth 401k and DCA that... I'm thinking it might be a good oppty to pay off my house by age 33.

I know it's a very good position to have - so was wondering if anyone has any good calculators. Obviously in 3 years time it will be $108k in opportunity cost but at 3% mortgage I'll save $23,000 in interest but thats over 6 years (remainder of mortgage if I don't make extra payments).

Thoughts?

I understand the obvious interest rate on house minus inflation and if that's lower than some average rate of return with investments that I should always invest. However, the allure of paying off my house (woth $400k by then) is alluring. With that, my returns the last 5 years weren't THAT great.

When I pay off the house, the $3000 + $1700 payment would all go back into saving/investing.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to figure out how to get an updated version of this Credit History for mortgage refi,"Okay so this is a bit of a cluster f and I apologize in advance.

This past week my elderly parents asked me to help them with getting a refinance on their condo primary residence, this is the second time I've attempted to help them, the first time was 2017 and back then everything fell apart when it was revealed to me that my older sister who my dad apparently is a co-borrower on her home, had an extensive history of missed or late payments on her mortgage.

During that time I received [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/GkLhslD) document but I can't remember exactly how I got it or from whom. This was how I eventually confronted my sister about this situation and finally was able to get the truth out of her about this. 

Fast forward to now and my sister claims up and down that her and her husband who recently retired from the Sheriff's Department and is also a Veteran are financially solvent and hasn't missed a payment in the 3 years since the last attempt at a refinance.

However, yesterday afternoon while I was at my parents house discussing a refinance with their current lender (PennyMac) to try and get their 4.875% interest rate down to something more manageable, there was a man who sounded like he was trying to break down the door with how aggressive he was knocking. Well that man served my father with papers regarding my sister's house that he's the co borrower on, and these papers are from a law office representing the HOA of the neighborhood where my sister's house is.

These papers say they're seeking a payment of $12,000 within the next 15 days or else they will foreclose and force them to sell the property to repay the debt. The listed missed or late charges date back to 2006(!) 

When I confronted my sister about this she tried to downplay things and claimed it was all some huge misunderstanding and that she spoke with the lawyers representing her HOA and they were able to waive the late charges and fees and reached a settlement. 

She claims the money is in an inpound account(?) And the money wasn't being taken out of this account to pay these various bills. She claims this was a problem with her mortgage lender who was supposed to be paying these bills monthly as a part of their mortgage agreement.

I know that to remove my father from my sisters mortgage that it would require a refinance of that mortgage, and my sister claims that her and her husband will be able to qualify for the mortgage without my father as a co borrower. But at this point I don't have any faith in what she's telling me because of how often she attempts to mislead, or deceive me and everyone else about her finances. I could get into the various other financial catastrophes that she's gotten into since I was adopted into this family some almost 30 years ago, but there's just simply too many and as this is the most recent and pressing issue I figured it was deserving of the main focus.

I apologize if this isn't the correct subreddit for this kind of post, and also for maybe rambling too much but I'm really at a loss at what to do because I don't have any personal experience with a mortgage nor do I have a background in finance but I've been following this subreddit for a few years now and have used many of the tips and strategies posted here to rebuild my credit score and build up good fiscal habits that I previously lacked. 

I guess my question is, how do I get an updated copy of the form I included in the link earlier on in this post, or what is that document called? Any other advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated but I understand how convoluted and complicated this situation is especially without all the details. I can provide any information that could help, but I didn't want to inflate this already way too long post.

Thank you all in advance I'm deeply appreciative of all r/personalfinance members that help out others every day here.",finance
personalfinance,Question about Buying a House Without a Contingency to Sell an Existing One,"In today's seller market, a seller will not accept an offer that has a contingency of a buyer selling their  home.   In addition I would like to have a couple days (no more than  one week) if possible of overlap of buying a new house and selling the  existing one.    Offers on homes also need to see a mortgage  pre-approval letter without a contingency.

I  am in a position that I can put 20% down on the new house without selling the old one but my debt to income ratio is too high to allow me  to get a normal loan for the new house while keeping the old.  I was  told by a mortgage company that I would qualify for both mortgages if I did a FHA loan however it appears that this would be expensive and would require me to refinance later.    From my research it seems that I could not refinance from the FHA loan for a period of six months as terms of the loan.    Curious what my options are that won't ""break the bank"".   It seems to me that this would be pretty common and ideally I would like to lock in on my new loan at the low interest rates that are available today.   TIA",finance
personalfinance,How much house is affordable in a HCOL area?,"My wife and I (both 28) live in California in a (very) high cost of living area. We both earn good money for the area, and have a household pre-tax income of ~200k/yr. We currently pay $2,600/mo in rent, have limited debt (1 car payment, $350/mo), and are actively saving for retirement. We would like to buy a house here as for a variety of quality of life reasons, not necessarily for financial reasons, but we want to be VERY sure the decision won't cost us our financial security.

Where we live, the sort of house we are interested in goes for around 800k. Assuming a 15% down payment (which we can afford), 3% closing costs, PMI of 1% total yearly mortgage cost, a property tax rate of 1.14%, an interest rate of 3.6% (we have good credit), a reasonable estimate for increased utilities, and a budget of 1% of the home value monthly for cost of repairs, we end up looking at a monthly cost of almost $5,200, which seems WAY too high to be affordable. It would be like doubling our current rent.

So my questions are these: 
What are some good means of assessing the financial soundness of home ownership in a high cost of living area? Should we not even be considering this?

The monthly cost seems staggeringly high, yet it is not far off from some of the ""rules of thumb"" I've seen (i.e. 3x salary, 30% gross income). Am I missing something here?

Do you think I'm way off on this calculation for monthly cost (either direction)?

personalfinance,Moving from Mutual Fund to Index Funds,"Wife (30F) &amp; I (29M) have invested the last few years into a mutual fund through a Dave Ramsey ELP.

We have a fully funded emergency fund, a low interest rate on a 15yr mortgage, and a very low interest rate on an SUV. 

Both accounts are Roth IRA accounts in American Funds. Would we be able to move almost all of our money over to index funds without much penalty? Are there Roth IRA options with Vanguard Index Funds? And has anyone else done this?

We want to maximize our investments and I am doing research to educate myself prior to making the switch. We originally did the Dave Ramsey ELP because we were young and had no clue where to start other than to just get investing somewhere.

energy,How will electric car users make up for the gas tax?,"I was talking with my dad the other day about the rise of Tesla and electric vehicles. He made an interesting point. In our state (KS), 18 cents/gallon of fuel goes to federal and 24 cents/gallon of fuel goes to the state. That's a whopping 42 cents/gallon of tax that electric vehicles (EV) aren't paying. 
I think EVs are the future, but how are we going to fill in for the revenue lost on fuel tax? The current gas tax works pretty well, the more you use the roads and fuel, the more tax you pay. Any idea how this will be addressed? This will also lead to EVs being more expensive in the future, because current EV owners are essentially using the roads for free.",energy

*Baked by the pastry chefs at* [*Offchain Labs*](https://offchainlabs.com/)

*Please send questions or comments to* [*reddit@offchainlabs.com* ](mailto:reddit@offchainlabs.com)

***1. Overview***

We're excited to submit Arbitrum Rollup for consideration to The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off. Arbitrum Rollup is the only Ethereum scaling solution that supports arbitrary smart contracts without compromising on Ethereum's security or adding points of centralization. For Reddit, this means that Arbitrum can not only scale the minting and transfer of Community Points, but it can foster a creative ecosystem built around Reddit Community Points enabling points to be used in a wide variety of third party applications. That's right -- you can have your cake and eat it too!

Arbitrum Rollup isn't just Ethereum-*style*. Its Layer 2 transactions are byte-for-byte identical to Ethereum, which means Ethereum users can continue  to use their existing addresses and wallets, and Ethereum developers can continue to use their favorite toolchains and development environments out-of-the-box with Arbitrum. Coupling Arbitrum’s tooling-compatibility with its trustless asset interoperability, Reddit not only can scale but can onboard the entire Ethereum community at no cost by giving them the same experience they already know and love (well, certainly know). 

To benchmark how Arbitrum can scale Reddit Community Points, we launched the Reddit contracts on an Arbitrum Rollup chain. Since Arbitrum provides full Solidity support, we didn't have to rewrite the Reddit contracts or try to mimic their functionality using an unfamiliar paradigm. Nope, none of that. We launched the Reddit contracts unmodified on Arbitrum Rollup complete with support for minting and distributing points. Like every Arbitrum Rollup chain, the chain included a bridge interface in which users can transfer Community Points or any other asset between the  L1 and L2 chains. Arbitrum Rollup chains also support dynamic contract loading, which would allow third-party developers to launch custom ecosystem apps that integrate with  Community Points on the very same chain that runs the Reddit contracts.

***1.1 Why Ethereum***

Perhaps the most exciting benefit of distributing Community Points using a blockchain is the ability to seamlessly port points to other applications and use them in a wide variety of contexts. Applications may include simple transfers such as a restaurant that allows Redditors to spend points on drinks. Or it may include complex smart contracts -- such as placing Community Points as a wager for a multiparty game or as collateral in a financial contract.

The common denominator between all of the fun uses of Reddit points is that it needs a thriving ecosystem of both users and developers, and the Ethereum blockchain is perhaps the only smart contract platform with significant adoption today. While many Layer 1 blockchains boast lower cost or higher throughput than the Ethereum blockchain, more often than not, these attributes mask the reality of little usage, weaker security, or both. 

Perhaps another platform with significant usage will rise in the future. But today, Ethereum captures the mindshare of the blockchain community, and for Community Points to provide the most utility, the Ethereum blockchain is the natural choice.

***1.2 Why Arbitrum***

While Ethereum's ecosystem is unmatched, the reality is that fees are high and capacity is too low to support the scale of Reddit Community Points. Enter Arbitrum. Arbitrum Rollup provides all of the ecosystem benefits of Ethereum, but with orders of magnitude more capacity and at a fraction of the cost of native Ethereum smart contracts. And most of all, we don't change the experience from users. They continue to use the same wallets, addresses, languages, and tools.

Arbitrum Rollup is not the only solution that can scale *payments*, but it is the only developed solution that can scale both payments and arbitrary smart contracts trustlessly, which means that third party users can build highly scalable add-on apps that can be used without withdrawing money from the Rollup chain. If you believe that Reddit users will want to use their Community Points in smart contracts--and *we* believe they will--then it makes the most sense to choose a single scaling solution that can support the entire ecosystem, eliminating friction for users. 

We view being able to run smart contracts in the same scaling solution as fundamentally critical since if there's significant demand in running smart contracts from Reddit's ecosystem, this would be a load on Ethereum and would itself require a scaling solution. Moreover, having different scaling solutions for the minting/distribution/spending of points and for third party apps would be burdensome for users as they'd have to constantly shuffle their Points back and forth. 

***2. Arbitrum at a glance***

Arbitrum Rollup has a unique value proposition as it offers a combination of features that no other scaling solution achieves. Here we highlight its core attributes. 

*Decentralized*. Arbitrum Rollup is as decentralized as Ethereum. Unlike some other Layer 2 scaling projects, Arbitrum Rollup doesn't have *any* centralized components or centralized operators who can censor users or delay transactions. Even in non-custodial systems, centralized components provide a risk as  the operators are generally incentivized to increase their profit by extracting rent from users often in ways that severely degrade user experience. Even if centralized operators are altruistic, centralized components are subject to hacking, coercion, and potential liability.

*Massive Scaling.* Arbitrum achieves order of magnitude scaling over Ethereum's L1 smart contracts. Our software currently supports 453 transactions-per-second for basic transactions (at 1616 Ethereum gas per tx). We have a lot of room left to optimize (e.g. aggregating signatures), and over the next several months capacity will increase significantly. As described in detail below, Arbitrum can easily support and surpass Reddit's anticipated initial load, and its capacity will continue to improve as Reddit's capacity needs grow.

*Low cost.* The cost of running Arbitrum Rollup is quite low compared to L1 Ethereum and other scaling solutions such as those based on zero-knowledge proofs. Layer 2 fees are low, fixed, and predictable and should not be overly burdensome for Reddit to cover. Nobody needs to use special equipment or high-end machines. Arbitrum requires validators, which is a permissionless role that can be run on any reasonable on-line machine. Although anybody can act as a validator, in order to protect against a “tragedy of the commons” and make sure reputable validators are participating, we support a notion of “invited validators” that are compensated for their costs. In general, users pay (low) fees to cover the invited validators’ costs, but we imagine that Reddit may cover this cost for its users. See more on the costs and validator options below. 

*Ethereum Developer Experience.* Not only does Arbitrum support EVM smart contracts, but the developer experience is identical to that of L1 Ethereum contracts and fully compatible with Ethereum tooling. Developers can port existing Solidity apps or write new ones using their favorite and familiar toolchains (e.g. Truffle, Buidler). There are no new languages or coding paradigms to learn. 

*Ethereum wallet compatibility.*  Just  as in Ethereum, Arbitrum users need only hold keys, but do not have to store any coin history or additional data to protect or access their funds. Since Arbitrum transactions are semantically identical to Ethereum L1 transactions, existing  Ethereum users  can use  their existing Ethereum keys with their existing wallet software such as Metamask.

*Token interoperability.* Users can easily transfer their ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens between Ethereum and the Arbitrum Rollup chain. As we explain in detail below, it is possible to mint tokens in L2 that can subsequently be withdrawn and recognized by the L1 token contract.

*Fast finality.* Transactions complete with the same finality time as Ethereum L1 (and it's possible to get faster finality guarantees by trading away trust assumptions; see the [Arbitrum Rollup whitepaper](https://offchainlabs.com/Arbitrum_Rollup_Whitepaper.pdf) for details).

*Non-custodial.* Arbitrum Rollup is a non-custodial scaling solution, so users control their funds/points and neither Reddit nor anyone else can ever access or revoke points held by users.

*Censorship Resistant.* Since it's completely decentralized, and the Arbitrum protocol guarantees progress trustlessly, Arbitrum Rollup is just as censorship-proof as Ethereum.

*Block explorer.* The Arbitrum Rollup block explorer allows users to view and analyze transactions on the Rollup chain.

***Limitations***

Although this *is* a bake-off, we're not going to sugar coat anything. Arbitrum Rollup, like any Optimistic Rollup protocol, does have one limitation, and that's the delay on withdrawals.  

As for the concrete length of the delay, we've done a good deal of internal modeling and have[ blogged about this as well](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/optimizing-challenge-periods-in-rollup-b61378c87277). Our current modeling suggests a 3-hour delay is sufficient (but as discussed in the linked post there is a tradeoff space between the length of the challenge period and the size of the validators’ deposit).

Note that this doesn't mean that the chain is delayed for three hours. Arbitrum Rollup supports pipelining of execution, which means that validators can keep building new states even while previous ones are “in the pipeline” for confirmation. As the challenge delays expire for each update, a new state will be confirmed (read more about this[ here](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/how-arbitrum-rollup-works-39788e1ed73f)). 

So activity and progress on the chain are not delayed by the challenge period. The only thing that's delayed is the consummation of withdrawals. Recall though that any single honest validator knows immediately (at the speed of L1 finality) which state updates are correct and can guarantee that they will eventually be confirmed, so once a valid withdrawal has been requested on-chain, every honest party knows that the withdrawal will definitely happen. There's a natural place here for a liquidity market in which a validator (or someone who trusts a validator) can provide withdrawal loans for a small interest fee. This is a no-risk business for them as they know which withdrawals will be confirmed (and can force their confirmation trustlessly no matter what anyone else does) but are just waiting for on-chain finality. 

***3. The recipe: How Arbitrum Rollup works***

***4. Developer docs and APIs***

For full details about how to set up and interact with an Arbitrum Rollup chain or validator, please refer to our developer docs, which  can be found  at [https://developer.offchainlabs.com/](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/). 

Note that the Arbitrum version described on that site is older and will soon be replaced by the version we are entering in Reddit Bake-Off, which is still undergoing internal testing before public release. 

***5. Who are the validators?***

As with any Layer 2 protocol, advancing the protocol correctly requires at least one *validator*  (sometimes called *block producers*) that is honest and available. A natural question is: who are  the validators? 

Recall that the validator set for an Arbitrum chain is open and permissionless; anyone can start or stop validating at will. (A useful analogy is to full nodes on an L1 chain.) But we understand that even though anyone *can* participate, Reddit may want to guarantee that highly reputable nodes are validating their chain. Reddit may choose to validate the chain themselves and/or hire third-party validators.To this end, we have begun building a marketplace for validator-for-hire services so that dapp developers can outsource validation services to reputable nodes with high up-time. We've[ announced a partnership](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/scalable-low-cost-computation-of-ethereum-smart-contracts-using-arbitrum-on-the-chainlink-8985c6542d4e) in which Chainlink nodes will provide Arbitrum validation services, and we expect to announce more partnerships shortly with other blockchain infrastructure providers.

Although there is no requirement that validators are paid, Arbitrum’s economic model tracks validators’ costs (e.g. amount of computation and storage) and can charge small fees on user transactions, using a gas-type system, to cover those costs.  Alternatively, a single party such as Reddit can agree to cover the costs of invited validators.

***6. Reddit Contract Support***

Since Arbitrum contracts and transactions are byte-for-byte compatible with Ethereum, supporting the Reddit contracts is as simple as launching them on an Arbitrum chain.

*Minting*. Arbitrum Rollup supports hybrid L1/L2 tokens which can be minted in L2 and then withdrawn onto the L1. An L1 contract at address A can make a special call to the EthBridge which deploys a ""buddy contract"" to the same address A on an Arbitrum chain. Since it's deployed at the same address, users can know that the L2 contract is the authorized ""buddy"" of the L1 contract on the Arbitrum chain.

For minting, the L1 contract is a standard ERC-20 contract which mints and burns tokens when requested by the L2 contract. It is paired with an ERC-20 contract in L2 which mints tokens based on whatever programmer provided minting facility is desired and burns tokens when they are withdrawn from the rollup chain. Given this base infrastructure, Arbitrum can support any smart contract based method for minting tokens in L2, and indeed we directly support Reddit's signature/claim based minting in L2. 

*Batch minting.* What's better than a mint cookie? A whole batch! In addition to supporting Reddit’s current minting/claiming scheme, we built a second minting design, which we believe outperforms the signature/claim system in many scenarios. 

In the current system, Reddit periodically issues signed statements to users, who then take those statements to the blockchain to claim their tokens. An alternative approach would have Reddit directly submit the list of users/amounts to the blockchain and distribute the tokens to the users without the signature/claim process.

To optimize the cost efficiency of this approach, we designed an application-specific compression scheme to minimize the size of the batch distribution list. We analyzed the data from Reddit's previous distributions and found that the data is highly compressible since token amounts are small and repeated, and addresses appear multiple times. Our function groups transactions by size, and replaces previously-seen addresses with a shorter index value. We wrote client code to compress the data, wrote a Solidity decompressing function, and integrated that function into Reddit’s contract running on Arbitrum.

When we ran the compression function on the previous Reddit distribution data, we found that we could compress batched minting data down to to 11.8 bytes per minting event (averaged over a 6-month trace of Reddit’s historical token grants)compared with roughly 174 bytes of on-chain data needed for the signature claim approach to minting (roughly 43 for an RLP-encoded null transaction + 65 for Reddit's signature + 65 for the user's signature + roughly 8 for the number of Points) .

The relative benefit of the two approaches with respect to on-chain call data cost depends on the percentage of users that will actually claim their tokens on chain. With the above figures, batch minting will be cheaper if roughly 5% of users redeem their claims. We stress that our compression scheme is not Arbitrum-specific and would be beneficial in any general-purpose smart contract platform. 

***8. Benchmarks and costs***

In this section, we give the full costs of operating the Reddit contracts on an Arbitrum Rollup chain including the L1 gas costs for the Rollup chain, the costs of computation and storage for the L2 validators as well as the capital lockup requirements for staking.

Arbitrum Rollup is still on testnet, so we did not run mainnet benchmarks. Instead, we measured the L1 gas cost and L2 workload for Reddit operations on Arbitrum and calculated the total cost assuming current Ethereum gas prices. As noted below in detail, our measurements do not assume that Arbitrum is consuming the entire capacity of Ethereum. We will present the  details of our model now, but for full transparency you can also play around with it yourself and adjust the parameters, by copying the spreadsheet found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKb-Br0mD_oz3sp6JkkumDf8REejG3MLGdfNa1Ohmk/edit#gid=0).

Our cost model is based on measurements of Reddit’s contracts, running unmodified (except for the addition of a batch minting function) on Arbitrum Rollup on top of Ethereum.

**On the distribution of transactions and frequency of assertions.** Reddit's instructions specify the following minimum parameters that submissions should support:

Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:

* 100,000 point claims (minting &amp; distributing points)
* 25,000 subscriptions
* 75,000 one-off points burning
* 100,000 transfers

We provide the full costs of operating an Arbitrum Rollup chain with this usage under the assumption that tokens are minted or granted to users in batches, but other transactions are uniformly distributed over the 5 day period. Unlike some other submissions, we do not make unrealistic assumptions that all operations can be submitted in enormous batches.  We assume that batch minting is done in batches that use only a few percent on an L1 block’s gas, and that other operations come in evenly over time and are submitted in batches, with one batch every five minutes to keep latency reasonable.  (Users are probably already waiting for L1 finality, which takes at least that long to achieve.)

We note that assuming that there are only 300,000 transactions that arrive uniformly over the 5 day period will make our benchmark numbers lower, but we believe that this will reflect the true cost of running the system. To see why, say that batches are submitted every five minutes (20 L1 blocks) and there's a fixed overhead of *c* bytes of calldata per batch, the cost of which will get amortized over all transactions executed in that batch. Assume that each individual transaction adds a marginal cost of *t*. Lastly assume the capacity of the scaling system is high enough that it can support all of Reddit's 300,000 transactions within a single 20-block batch (i.e. that there is more than c + 300,000\*t byes of calldata available in 20 blocks). 

Consider what happens if *c*, the per-batch overhead, is large (which it is in some systems, but not in Arbitrum). In the scenario that transactions actually arrive at the system's capacity and each batch is full, then *c* gets amortized over 300,000 transactions. But if we assume that the system is not running at capacity--and only receives 300,000 transactions arriving uniformly over 5 days-- then each 20-block assertion will contain about 200 transactions, and thus each transaction will pay a nontrivial cost due to *c*.

We are aware that other proposals presented scaling numbers  assuming that 300,000 transactions arrived at maximum capacity and was executed in a single mega-transaction, but according to our estimates, for at least one such report, this led to a reported gas price that was 2-*3 orders of magnitude* lower than it would have been assuming uniform arrival. We make more realistic batching assumptions, and we believe Arbitrum compares well when batch sizes are realistic. 

**Our model.** Our cost model includes several sources of cost:

* L1 gas costs: This is the cost of posting transactions as calldata on the L1 chain, as well as the overhead associated with each batch of transactions, and the L1 cost of settling transactions in the Arbitrum protocol.
* Validator’s staking costs: In normal operation, one validator will need to be staked. The stake is assumed to be 0.2% of the total value of the chain (which is assumed to be $1 per user who is eligible to claim points).  The cost of staking is the interest that could be earned on the money if it were not staked.
* Validator computation and storage: Every validator must do computation to track the chain’s processing of transactions, and must maintain storage to keep track of the contracts’ EVM storage. The cost of computation and storage are estimated based on measurements, with the dollar cost of resources based on Amazon Web Services pricing.

It’s clear from our modeling that the predominant cost is for L1 calldata.  This will probably be true for any plausible rollup-based system.  

Our model also shows that Arbitrum can scale to workloads much larger than Reddit’s nominal workload, without exhausting L1 or L2 resources.  The scaling bottleneck will ultimately be calldata on the L1 chain.  We believe that cost could be reduced substantially if necessary by clever encoding of data.  (In our design any compression / decompression of L2 transaction calldata would be done by client software and L2 programs, never by an L1 contract.)

***9. Status of Arbitrum Rollup***

Arbitrum Rollup is live on Ethereum testnet. All of the code written to date including everything included in the Reddit demo is open source and permissively licensed under the Apache V2 license. The first testnet version of Arbitrum Rollup was released on testnet in February.  Our current internal version, which we used to benchmark the Reddit contracts, will be released soon and will be a major upgrade.

Both the Arbitrum design as well as the implementation are heavily audited by independent third parties. The Arbitrum academic paper was published at USENIX Security, a top-tier peer-reviewed academic venue. For the Arbitrum software, we have engaged Trail of Bits for a security audit, which is currently ongoing, and we are committed to have a clean report before launching on Ethereum mainnet.

***10. Reddit Universe Arbitrum Rollup Chain***

The benchmarks described in this document were all measured using the latest internal build of our software. When we release the new software upgrade publicly we will launch a Reddit Universe Arbitrum Rollup chain as a public demo, which will contain the Reddit contracts as well as a Uniswap instance and a Connext Hub, demonstrating how Community Points can be integrated into third party apps. We will also allow members of the public to dynamically launch ecosystem contracts. We at Offchain Labs will cover the validating costs for the Reddit Universe public demo.

If the folks at Reddit would like to evaluate our software prior to our public demo, please email us at reddit@offchainlabs.com and we'd be more than happy to provide early access.

***11. Even more scaling: Arbitrum Sidechains***

Rollups are an excellent approach to scaling, and we are excited about Arbitrum Rollup which far surpasses Reddit's scaling needs. But looking forward to Reddit's eventual goal of supporting hundreds of millions of users, there will likely come a time when Reddit needs more scaling than any Rollup protocol can provide.

While Rollups greatly reduce costs, they don't break the *linear barrier*. That is, all transactions have an on-chain footprint (because all calldata must be posted on-chain), albeit a far smaller one than on native Ethereum, and the L1 limitations end up being the bottleneck for capacity and cost. Since Ethereum has limited capacity, this linear use of on-chain resources means that costs will eventually increase superlinearly with traffic.

The good news is that we at Offchain Labs have a solution in our roadmap that can satisfy this extreme-scaling setting as well: Arbitrum AnyTrust Sidechains. Arbitrum Sidechains are similar to Arbitrum Rollup, but deviate in that they name a permissioned set of validators. When a chain’s validators agree off-chain, they can greatly reduce the on-chain footprint of the protocol and require almost no data to be put on-chain. When validators can't reach unanimous agreement off-chain, the protocol reverts to Arbitrum Rollup. Technically, Arbitrum Sidechains can be viewed as a hybrid between state channels and Rollup, switching back and forth as necessary, and combining the performance and cost that state channels can achieve in the optimistic case, with the robustness of Rollup in other cases. The core technical challenge is how to switch seamlessly between modes and how to guarantee that security is maintained throughout. 

Arbitrum Sidechains break through this linear barrier, while still maintaining a high level of security and decentralization. Arbitrum Sidechains provide the AnyTrust guarantee, which says that as long as any one validator is honest and available (even if you don't know which one will be), the L2 chain is guaranteed to execute correctly according to its code and guaranteed to make progress. Unlike in a state channel, offchain progress does not require unanimous consent, and liveness is preserved as long as there is a single honest validator.

Note that the trust model for Arbitrum Sidechains is much stronger than for typical BFT-style chains which introduce a consensus ""voting"" protocols among a small permissioned group of validators. BFT-based protocols require a supermajority (more than 2/3) of validators to agree. In Arbitrum Sidechains, by contrast, all you need is a single honest validator to achieve guaranteed correctness and progress. Notice that in Arbitrum adding validators strictly increases security since the AnyTrust guarantee provides correctness as long as any one validator is honest and available. By contrast, in BFT-style protocols, adding nodes can be dangerous as a coalition of dishonest nodes can break the protocol.

Like Arbitrum Rollup, the developer and user experiences for Arbitrum Sidechains will be identical to that of Ethereum. Reddit would be able to choose a large and diverse set of validators, and all that they would need to guarantee to break through the scaling barrier is that a single one of them will remain honest.

We hope to have Arbitrum Sidechains in production in early 2021, and thus when Reddit reaches the scale that surpasses the capacity of Rollups, Arbitrum Sidechains will be waiting and ready to help.

While the idea to switch between channels and Rollup to get the best of both worlds is conceptually simple, getting the details right and making sure that the switch does not introduce any attack vectors is highly non-trivial and has been the subject of years of our research (indeed, we were working on this design for years before the term Rollup was even coined).

***12. How Arbitrum compares***

We include a comparison to several other categories as well as specific projects when appropriate. and explain why we believe that Arbitrum is best suited for Reddit's purposes. We focus our attention on other Ethereum projects.

*Payment only Rollups.* Compared to Arbitrum Rollup, ZK-Rollups and other Rollups that only support token transfers  have several disadvantages:

* As outlined throughout the proposal, we believe that the entire draw of Ethereum is in its rich smart contracts support which is simply not achievable with today's zero-knowledge proof technology. Indeed, scaling with a ZK-Rollup will add friction to the deployment of smart contracts that interact with Community Points as users will have to withdraw their coins from the ZK-Rollup and transfer them to a smart contract system (like Arbitrum). The community will be best served if Reddit builds on a platform that has built-in, frictionless smart-contract support.
* All other Rollup protocols of which we are aware employ a centralized operator. While it's true that users retain custody of their coins, the  centralized operator can often  profit from censoring, reordering, or delaying transactions. A common misconception is that since they're non-custodial protocols, a centralized sequencer does not  pose a risk but this is incorrect as the sequencer can wreak havoc or shake down users for side payments without directly stealing funds. 
* *Sidechain* type protocols can eliminate some of these issues, but they are not trustless. Instead, they require trust in some quorum of a committee, often requiring two-third of the committee to be honest, compared to rollup protocols like Arbitrum that require only a single honest party. In addition, not all sidechain type protocols have committees that are diverse, or even non-centralized, in practice. 
* *Plasma-style protocols have a centralized operator and do not support general smart contracts.*

***13. Concluding Remarks***

While it's ultimately up to the judges’ palate, we believe that Arbitrum Rollup is the bakeoff choice that Reddit kneads. We far surpass Reddit's specified workload requirement at present, have much room to optimize Arbitrum Rollup in the near term, and have a clear path to get Reddit to hundreds of millions of users. Furthermore, we are the only project that gives developers and users the identical interface as the Ethereum blockchain and is fully interoperable and tooling-compatible, and we do this all without any new trust assumptions or centralized components. 

But no matter how the cookie crumbles, we're glad to have participated in this bake-off and we thank you for your consideration.

personalfinance,"Readmitted after 10 years to school! Help appreciated. 4 loans slipped by and are default. Eligible for $20K of grants, but have to address loans. Consolidate, Rehabilitate, Private?","My brother passed away when I was 3 years into college. I fell into a dark place and failed an entire year. I have worked full time since then. I have been re-applying every year since then and this year they finally accepted me back in! I'm excited to finally finish my last year. But I can't make this financially possible.

**Info:**

* Tuition will be $15k/semester
* Elligible for $10K worth of grants per semester
* Found out last year 4 loans (2 servicers) slipped by and are in default. ^(They switched servicers and stopped my auto pay.)
* 2 Federal Subsidized Stafford, 2 Fed UnSub Stafford
* Rehabilitated 2 of them, 2 of them are still in rehabilitation with 8 months to go.

What do you recommend I do? I have read that website that lists the pros and cons of rehabilitating vs consolidating, but I am still confused on what to do.

If I need the money in about a month or two from now, LATEST next semester (about 6 months from now), should I rehabilitate or consolidate those federal loans?

**Considering:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Appealing to my school somehow. (Financially burdened, 10 years since failing)
* Reconsolidating loans (Default stays on record, but they can see late payments anyway? Minimal issue?)
* Toughing it out and rehabilitate the loans to remove default. Get a private loan and forgo the grants.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current financial situation**

&amp;#x200B;

* Living paycheck to paycheck, below poverty line
* Have $10K saved up for school.
* 30K worth of private loans still (Used to be 70K)
* Federal loans equal 15K",finance

What would others recommend I do with the $20-$25k I have saved up?  Pay off my loans ($22k if paid today) or use this for a larger down payment?

If it matters, my job is quite secure so I don't feel the need to have as much of a safety net for a few months after the pay off/down payment.

investing,Buffett and $BAC.,"He's been buying up $BAC like crazy during July. The price has been relatively stable and on a valuation basis they're cheap (all banks are). He hasn't added to $WFC or $BK. I know he paired down his $BK stake a lot for some reason. He's almost completely out of $GS also. I think it's because he had to get government approval for his &gt;10% stake in a bank and he probably figured he was only going to get one bank to do that with. And he probably picked $BAC because their upside may be larger for whatever reason Buffett sees. 

At least he's using some of the cash he's been piling up. Although I really do wonder what he sees down the road. He always invests for the next decade and he still caught $AAPL as a great investment so he hasn't lost his touch I think. But how does he see banks becoming profitable in the next few years that warrants building such a large stake now? Does he see interest rates rise? Why? Does he see $BAC going on an acquisition spree with smaller banks? Why? Does he see them getting into crypo like $GS did? Why? I have no idea.",finance
